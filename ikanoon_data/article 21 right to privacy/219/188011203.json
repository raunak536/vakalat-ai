The conundrum in this appeal is: whether the contents of a\n\n         memory card/pen­drive being electronic record as predicated in\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/938830/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 2(1)(t)</a> of the Information and Technology Act, 2000 (for\n\n         short, ‘the 2000 Act’) would, thereby qualify as a “document”\n\n         within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 3</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n         (for short, ‘the 1872 Act’) and <a href=\"/doc/1055120/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 29</a> of the Indian Penal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CHARANJEET KAUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2019.11.29</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">14:31:21 IST</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Reason:</span>\n\n\n         Code, 1860 (for short, ‘the 1860 Code’)?               If so, whether it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                  2</span>\n\n\n\n\nobligatory to furnish a cloned copy of the contents of such\n\nmemory card/pen­drive to the accused facing prosecution for an\n\nalleged offence of rape and related offences since the same is\n\nappended to the police report submitted to the Magistrate and\n\nthe prosecution proposes to rely upon it against the accused, in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 207</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for\n\nshort, ‘the 1973 Code’)? The next question is: whether it is open\n\nto the Court to decline the request of the accused to furnish a\n\ncloned copy of the contents of the subject memory card/pen­\n\ndrive in the form of video footage/clipping concerning the alleged\n\nincident/occurrence of rape on the ground that it would impinge\n\nupon the privacy, dignity and identity of the victim involved in\n\nthe stated offence(s) and moreso because of the possibility of\n\nmisuse of such cloned copy by the accused (which may attract\n\nother independent offences under the 2000 Act and the 1860\n\nCode)?\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   The appellant has been arrayed as accused No. 8 in\n\nconnection with offence registered as First Information Report\n\n(FIR)/Crime Case No. 297/2017 dated 18.2.2017 punishable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                  3</span>\n\n\n\n\nunder Sections 342, 366, 376, 506(1), 120B and <a href=\"/doc/795331/\" id=\"a_5\">34</a> of the 1860\n\nCode and <a href=\"/doc/112223967/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 66E</a> and <a href=\"/doc/15057582/\" id=\"a_7\">67A</a> of the 2000 Act, concerning the\n\nalleged incident/occurrence at around 2030 hrs. to 2300 hrs. on\n\n17.2.2017, as reported by the victim.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.   For considering the questions arising in this appeal, suffice\n\nit to observe that the investigating officer attached to the\n\nNedumbassery Police Station, Ernakulam, Kerala, after recording\n\nstatements of the concerned witnesses and collecting the relevant\n\nevidence, filed police reports under Section 173 of the 1973 Code\n\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Angamaly. First police\n\nreport, on 17.4.2017 and the second, on 22.11.2017. When the\n\nappellant was supplied a copy of the second police report on\n\n15.12.2017, all documents noted in the said report, on which the\n\nprosecution proposed to rely, were not supplied to the appellant,\n\nnamely, (i) electronic record (contents of memory card); (ii)\n\nForensic Science Laboratory (for short, ‘the FSL’) reports and the\n\nfindings attached thereto in C.D./D.V.D.; (iii) medical reports;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">C.C.T.V. footages and (iv) Call data records of accused and\n\nvarious witnesses etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                        4</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.   It is noted by the concerned Magistrate that the visuals\n\ncopied and documented by the forensic experts during the\n\nforensic examination of the memory card were allowed to be\n\nperused by the appellant’s counsel in the presence of the regular\n\ncadre Assistant Public Prosecutor of the Court, in the Court\n\nitself. After watching the said visuals, some doubts cropped up,\n\nwhich propelled the appellant to file a formal application before\n\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate, Angamaly for a direction to\n\nthe prosecution to furnish a cloned copy of the contents of\n\nmemory card containing the video and audio footage/clipping, in\n\nthe same format as obtained in the memory card, alongwith the\n\ntranscript of the human voices, both male and female recorded in\n\nit. In the said application, the appellant inter alia asserted as\n\nfollows:­\n\n        “7.       It may be noted that the electronic record in the\n        form of copy of the alleged video footage of the offending act\n        committed by accused No.1 on the body and person of the\n        defacto complainant is a crucial and material record relied\n        by the prosecution in this case. It is the definite contention\n        of prosecution that the above electronic record is both the\n        evidence of commission of crime as well as the object of\n        commission of crime and hence indisputably the most\n        material piece of evidence in this case. When the injustice,\n        in not serving such a vital piece of evidence relied on by the\n        prosecution in the case, was immediately brought to the\n        notice of this Hon’ble Court, without prejudice to the right\n        of petitioner to obtain copies of the same, the defence side\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                  5</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas allowed to watch the alleged video footages by playing\nthe contents of a pen drive in the lap top made available\nbefore this Hon’ble Court. Head phones were also provided\nto the counsel and also to the learned APP who also was\nthroughout present during this proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.        It is most respectfully submitted that by watching\nthe video footage, although in a restricted environment and\nwith limited facilities in the presence of the Ld. APP and the\nPresiding Officer, it is shockingly realised that the visuals\nand audio bytes contained in the video are of such a nature\nwhich would completely falsify the prosecution case in the\nform presently alleged by the prosecution. As a matter of\nfact the video footage is not at all an evidence of\ncommission of crime as falsely contended by the\nprosecution but it is rather a clear case of fabricating false\nevidence with intent to foist a false case. It is submitted\nthat it is after deliberately concealing or withholding the\nalleged primary evidence viz. the mobile phone stated to\nhave been used by accused No.1, by the prosecution in\nactive connivance with accused No.1, that the prosecution\nhas produced a memory card which evidently contains only\nselected audio and video recording.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">9.       xxx                xxx                xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">10.       ……The further Verification and close scrutiny of\nthe images and audio with scientific aid will in all\nprobability provide more significant materials necessary to\nfind out the truth behind the recorded images and the\nextent of tampering and the same could only be unearthed\nif the mirror copy of the memory card is furnished to the\npetitioner which he is entitled to get without any further\ndelay. As the prosecution is fully aware that the tampering\ncould be detected and further female voice could be\nretrieved by the defense, the prosecution is trying to\nprevent the supply of the copy of the memory card in any\nform to the defense. It is illegal and the same will clearly\namount to denial of a just and fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">11.            xxx                    xxx             xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">12.      A close scrutiny of the contents of mahazar dated\n8.3.2017 would show that on 18.2.2017 accused No.1 had\nentrusted a 8 GB memory card to Adv. E.G. Poulose, who\nhad in turn produced the same before the Court of JFCM\nAluva. The investigating agency thereafter obtained custody\nof the above electronic record and later the 8 GB memory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                6</span>\n\n\n\n\ncard was sent to FSL, where, upon examination, Dr. Sunil\nS.P.,     Assistant      director     (documents),      FSL,\nThiruvananthapuram has allegedly prepared a report in\nthat regard. The copy of the report has not been furnished\nto the petitioner. The mahazar further shows that the\ncontents of Memory card was transferred to a pen drive for\nthe investigation purpose. The above mahazar further\ncategorically states that the pen drive contained the data\ntransferred from memory card and the same relates to the\nvideo footage of 17.2.2017 from 22:30:55 to 22:48:40 hrs\nand it is in order to check and verify whether the voice\ncontained therein belongs to Suni that the voice sample\nwas allegedly taken. The description in the mahazar\nproceeds as if there is only male voice in the video footage\ntotally screening the fact that the video footage contains\nmany vital and material utterances in female voice. Those\nutterances were revealed to the petitioner and his counsel\nonly on 15.12.2017. Everybody present had the benefit of\nhearing the said clear female voice. As mentioned earlier\nthe Ld. APP was also present. But the investigation agency\nwhich should have definitely seen and heard the same has\nfor obvious reason screened the said material aspects from\nthe records. The investigation, it appears did not venture to\ntake steps to compare the female voice in the video footage\nwith the voice of the female involved in this case, for\nobvious reasons. On viewing and hearing, it is revealed that\nclear attempt have been made by somebody to delete major\nportions from the video footage and from the audio\nrecording.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">13.       It is respectfully submitted that utterances made\nby the parties involved and seen in the video footage\ndetermines the nature of act recorded in the video footage\nand a transcript of the utterances and human voices in the\nvideo footage is highly just and necessary especially in view\nof the shocking revelation, found when the video footage\nwas played on 15.12.2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">14.       Yet another aspect which is to be pointed out is\nthe mysterious disappearance of the mobile phone allegedly\nused for recording the video footage. The strong feeling of\nthe petitioner is that the investigating agency has not so far\nstated the truth regarding the mobile phone allegedly used\nto shot the video footage. The prosecution records itself\nwould strongly indicate that the mobile phone used to\nrecord the occurrence (which now turns out to be a drama)\nwas with the Police or with the persons who are behind the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                7</span>\n\n\n\n\nfabrication of the video footage as evidence to launch the\ncriminal prosecution and false implication of the petitioner.\nIt is revolting to common sense to assume that even after\nconducting investigation for nearly one year by a team\nheaded by a very Senior Police officer like the Addl. DGP of\nthe Stage, during which accused No.1 was in the custody of\nthe investigating team for 14 days at a stretch and\nthereafter for different spells of time on different occasions\nthe original mobile instrument used for recording the video\nfootage could not be unearthed. It appears that the\ninvestigating team was a willing agent to suffer the wrath of\nsuch a disgrace in order to suppress the withholding of the\nmobile instrument.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">15.       It is interesting to note that even in the second\nfinal report dated 22.11.2017 the Police has stated that the\ninvestigation to obtain the original mobile phone is even\nnow continuing. It is nothing but an attempt to be fool\neverybody including the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">16.       It is most respectfully submitted that in view of\nthe startling revelation in the video footage, the petitioner\nintends to make request to conduct proper, just and\nmeaningful investigation into the matter so as to ensure\nthat the real truth is revealed and the real culprits in this\ncase are brought to justice. For enabling the petitioner to\ntake steps in that regard. It is highly just and essential that\nthe cloned copy of the contents of memory card containing\nthe video and audio content in the same format as obtained\nin the Memory card and the transcript of the human voices\nrecorded in it are produced before Court and copy of the\nsame furnished forthwith to the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">17.       As mentioned herein before, the prosecution has\nchosen to furnish only a small portion of the prosecution\nrecords on 15.12.2017. The petitioner is approaching this\nHon’ble Court with a detailed petition stating the details of\nrelevant documents which do not form part of the records\nalready produced before this Hon’ble Court and the details\nof the other documents which are not furnished to\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">18.       It is submitted that the petitioner as an accused is\nlegally entitled to get the copies of all documents including\nthe CDs, Video footage etc., and the prosecution is bound\nto furnish the same to the petitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                         8</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">       19.       In the above premises it is respectfully prayed\n       that this Hon’ble Court may be pleased to direct the\n       prosecution to furnish a cloned copy of the contents of\n       Memory Card containing the video and audio content in the\n       same format as obtained in the memory card and the\n       transcript of human voices, both male and female recorded\n       in it, and furnish the said cloned copy of the memory card\n       and the transcript to the petitioner.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">6.   The Magistrate vide order dated 7.2.2018, rejected the said\n\napplication, essentially on the ground that acceding to the\n\nrequest of the appellant would be impinging upon the esteem,\n\ndecency, chastity, dignity and reputation of the victim and also\n\nagainst public interest. The relevant portion of the order dated\n\n7.2.2018 reads thus:­\n\n          “Heard both sides in detail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">           The petitioner has also filed reply statement to the\n       objection and counter statement filed by Special Public\n       Prosecutor in the case. The allegation against the petitioner\n       is that he engaged the first accused to sexually assault the\n       victim and videograph the same. On receipt of summons the\n       petitioner entered appearance and was served with the\n       copies of prosecution records. The learned Senior Counsel\n       appearing for the petitioner requested for the copies of the\n       contents of memory card. The same could not be allowed &amp;\n       the investigation official has already a petition filed objecting\n       the same, with a prayer to permit them to view the same in\n       the court. Hence they were permitted to view the video\n       footage and subsequent to the same they had filed this\n       petition seeking a direction to the prosecution to furnish the\n       copies of alleged audio and video footage and its transcript.\n       The prosecution strongly opposed the same stating that the\n       same will add insult to the victim who had suffered a lot at\n       the hands of not only the accused but also the media. Hence\n       they submitted that the petitioner may be permitted to view\n       the contents of the video during trial.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                      9</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">          Here the offence alleged tantamounts to a serious blow to\n       the supreme honour of a woman. So as to uphold the\n       esteem, decency, chastity, dignity and reputation of the\n       victim, and also in the public interest, I am declining the\n       prayer. But so as to ensure fairness in the proceedings and\n       for just determination of the truth, the petitioner is\n       permitted to inspect the contents of the video footage at the\n       convenience of court.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">7.   Aggrieved by the above decision, the appellant carried the\n\nmatter to the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam (for short, ‘the\n\nHigh Court’) by way of Crl.M.C. No. 1663/2018.             The learned\n\nsingle Judge of the High Court dismissed the said petition and\n\nconfirmed the order of the Magistrate rejecting the stated\n\napplication filed by the appellant. The High Court, however, after\n\nanalyzing the decisions and the relevant provisions cited before\n\nit, eventually concluded that the seized memory card was only\n\nthe medium on which the alleged incident was recorded and\n\nhence that itself is the product of the crime. Further, it being a\n\nmaterial object and not documentary evidence, is excluded from\n\nthe purview of Section 207 of the 1973 Code.               The relevant\n\ndiscussion can be discerned from paragraph 41 onwards, which\n\nreads thus:­\n\n       “41.      This leads to the crucial question that is to be\n       answered in this case. Evidently, the crux of the prosecution\n       allegation is that, offence was committed for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                10</span>\n\n\n\n\nrecording it on a medium. Memory card is the medium on\nwhich it was recorded. Hence, memory card seized by the\npolice itself is the product of the crime. It is not the contents\nof the memory card that is proposed to be established by the\nproduction of the memory card. The acts of sexual abuse is\nto be established by the oral testimony of the victim and\nwitnesses. It is also not the information derived from the\nmemory card that is sought to be established by the\nprosecution. Prosecution is trying to establish that the\nalleged sexual abuse was committed and it was recorded.\nThough, in the course of evidence, contents of it may be\nsought to be established to prove that, it was the memory\ncard created by the accused, contemporaneously recorded\non the mobile, along with the commission of offence, that\ndoes not by itself displace the status of the memory card as a\ndocument. Memory card itself is the end product of the\ncrime. It is hence a material object and not a documentary\nevidence. Hence, it stands out of the ambit of section 207\nCr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">42.      The evaluation of the above legal propositions\nclearly spells out that, the memory card produced in this\ncase is not a document as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_8\">section\n307</a> IPC [sic 207 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.P.C</a>.]. In fact, it is in the nature of a\nmaterial object. Hence, copy of it cannot be issued to the\npetitioner herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_16\">43.       Prosecution has a case that, though accused is\nentitled for his rights, it is not absolute and even outside\n<a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_10\">section 207</a> Cr.P.C., there can be restrictions regarding the\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_11\">section 207</a> Cr.P.C. It was contended that, if the\nabove statutory provision infringes the right of privacy of the\nvictim involved, fundamental right will supersede the\nstatutory right of the accused. Definitely, in case of Justice\nK.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_12\">Another v. Union of India and\nOrs.</a> (2017) 10 SCC 1 (at page 1), the Constitutional Bench of\nthe Supreme Court had held that the fundamental rights\nemanate from basic notions of liberty and dignity and the\nenumeration of some facets of liberty as distinctly protected\nrights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">Art. 19</a> does not denude <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Art.21</a> of its expansive\nambit. It was held that, validity of a law which infringes the\nfundamental rights has to be tested not with reference to the\nobject of state action, but on the basis of its effect on the\nguarantees of freedom. In Sherin V. John’s case (supra), this\nCourt had held that, when there is a conflict between\nFundamental Rights of a person and statutory rights of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                     11</span>\n\n\n\n\n       another person, Fundamental Rights will prevail. The\n       possibility of such contention may also arise. Since that\n       question does not arise in this case in the light of finding\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_15\">section 207</a> Cr.P.C. I do not venture to enter into that\n       issue.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">       44.       Having considered the entire issue, I am inclined to\n       sustain the order of the court below in Crl.M.P. No.49 of\n       2018 in C.P. No.16 of 2017 dismissing the application,\n       though on different grounds. However, this will not preclude\n       the Court from permitting the accused to watch the memory\n       card only in Court, subject to restrictions, to prepare\n       defence.”\n\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">8.    The appellant being dissatisfied, has assailed the reasons\n\nwhich found favour with the trial Court, as well as the High\n\nCourt. The appellant broadly contends that the prosecution case\n\nis founded on the forensic report which suggests that eight video\n\nrecordings were retrieved from the memory card and that the\n\nvideo files were found to be recorded on 17.2.2017 between\n\n22:30:55 hrs. and 22:48:40 hrs. The same were transferred to\n\nthe stated memory card on 18.2.2017 between 09:18 hrs. and\n\n09:20 hrs.   Be it noted that the original video recording was\n\nallegedly done by accused No. 1 on his personal mobile phone,\n\nwhich has not been produced by the investigating agency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">However, the memory card on which the offending video\n\nrecording was copied on 18.2.2017 was allegedly handed over by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                    12</span>\n\n\n\n\nan Advocate claiming that the accused No. 1 had given it to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">He had presented the memory card before the Court on\n\n20.2.2017, which was sent for forensic examination at State FSL,\n\nThiruvananthapuram. After forensic examination, the same was\n\nreturned alongwith FSL report DD No. 91/2017 dated 3.3.2017\n\nand DD No. 115/2017 dated 7.4.2017. A pen­drive containing\n\nthe data/visuals retrieved from the memory card, was also\n\nenclosed with the report sent by the State FSL.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">9.   Be that as it may, the prosecution was obviously relying on\n\nthe contents of the memory card which have been copied on the\n\npen­drive by the State FSL during the analysis thereof and has\n\nbeen so adverted to in the police report.      The contents of the\n\nmemory card, which are replicated in the pen­drive created by\n\nthe State FSL would be nothing but a “document” within the\n\nmeaning of the 1973 Code and the provisions of the 1872 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">And since the prosecution was relying on the same and proposes\n\nto use it against the accused/appellant, it was incumbent to\n\nfurnish   a   cloned   copy   of   the   contents   thereof   to   the\n\naccused/appellant, not only in terms of Section 207 read with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                  13</span>\n\n\n\n\nSection 173(5) of the 1973 Code, but also to uphold the right of\n\nthe accused to a fair trial guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. The trial Court rejected the request of the\n\nappellant on the ground that it would affect the privacy and\n\ndignity of the victim, whereas, the High Court proceeded on the\n\nbasis that the memory card is a material object and not a\n\n“document”.    It is well known that a cloned copy is not a\n\nphotocopy, but is a mirror image of the original, and the accused\n\nhas the right to have the same to present his defence effectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">In the alternative, it is submitted, that the Court could have\n\nimposed appropriate conditions while issuing direction to the\n\nprosecution to furnish a cloned copy of the contents of memory\n\ncard to the accused/appellant.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">10. Per contra, the respondent­State and the intervenor (the\n\nvictim) have vehementaly opposed the present appeal on the\n\nargument that the appellant before this Court is none other than\n\nthe master­mind of the conspiracy.        Although he was not\n\npersonally present on the spot, but the entire incident has\n\noccurred at his behest. It is urged that the appeal deserves to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                  14</span>\n\n\n\n\ndismissed as the appellant has disclosed the identity of the\n\nvictim in the memo of the special leave petition from which the\n\npresent appeal has arisen.    Further, the appellant has falsely\n\nasserted that he had himself perused the contents of the pen­\n\ndrive and even for this reason, the appeal should be dismissed at\n\nthe threshold. As a matter of fact, the contents of the pen­drive\n\nwere allowed to be viewed by the appellant’s counsel and the\n\nregular cadre Assistant Public Prosecutor of the Court.        The\n\nasservation of the appellant that after viewing the contents of the\n\npen­drive, he gathered an impression that the contents of the\n\nmemory card must have been tampered with, is the figment of\n\nimagination of the appellant and contrary to forensic report(s) by\n\nthe State FSL.   The definite case of the respondent is that the\n\nmemory card seized in this case containing the visuals of sexual\n\nviolence upon the victim is a material object and the pen­drive\n\ninto which the contents of memory card were documented\n\nthrough the process of copying by the State FSL and sent to the\n\nCourt for the purpose of aiding the trial Court to know the\n\ncontents of the memory card and the contents of the said pen­\n\ndrive is both material object as well as “document”.     It is also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                  15</span>\n\n\n\n\nurged that the visual contents of the pen­drive would be physical\n\nevidence of the commission of crime and not “document” per se\n\nto be furnished to the accused alongwith the police report. The\n\ncontents of the memory card or the pen­drive cannot be parted to\n\nthe accused and doing so itself would be an independent offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">Moreover, if a cloned copy of the contents of the memory card is\n\nmade available to the accused/appellant, there is reason to\n\nbelieve that it would be misused by the accused/appellant to\n\nexecute the conspiracy of undermining the privacy and dignity of\n\nthe victim. It is urged that the appellant has relied on certain\n\ndecisions to contend that the contents of the memory card must\n\nbe regarded as “electronic record” and, therefore, a “document”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">The exposition in those decisions are general observations and\n\nwould be of no avail to the appellant.    The appellant is facing\n\nprosecution for an offence of rape, and the trial thereof would be\n\nan in­camera trial before the Special Court.     To maintain the\n\nsanctity and for upholding the privacy, dignity and identity of the\n\nvictim, it is urged that the accused/appellant in such cases can\n\nseek limited relief before the trial Court to permit him and his\n\nlawyer or an expert to view the contents of the pen­drive in Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                    16</span>\n\n\n\n\nor at best to permit him to take a second opinion of expert to\n\nreassure himself in respect of the doubts entertained by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">Such indulgence would obviate the possibility of misuse of the\n\ncloned copy of the video/audio footage/clipping and the same\n\nwould be in the nature of a preventive measure while giving a fair\n\nopportunity to the accused to defend himself.    The respondent\n\nand the intervenor would urge that the appeal be dismissed\n\nbeing devoid of merits.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">11. As aforesaid, both sides have relied on reported decisions of\n\nthis Court, as well as the High Courts and on the provisions of\n\nthe relevant enactments to buttress the submissions. We shall\n\nrefer thereto as may be required.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">12. We have heard Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel\n\nfor the appellant, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe respondent­State and Mr. R. Basant, learned senior counsel\n\nfor the intervenor.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">13. The central issue is about the obligation of the investigating\n\nofficer flowing from Section 173 of the 1973 Code and that of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                   17</span>\n\n\n\n\nMagistrate while dealing with the police report under Section 207\n\nof the 1973 Code. Section 173 of the 1973 Code ordains that the\n\ninvestigation under Chapter XII of the said Code should be\n\ncompleted without unnecessary delay and as regards the\n\ninvestigation in relation to offences under Sections 376, 376A,\n\n376AB, 376B, 376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB or 376E of the 1860\n\nCode, the same is required to be completed within two months\n\nfrom the date on which the information was recorded by the\n\nofficer in charge of the police station. The investigating officer\n\nafter completing the investigation, is obliged to forward a copy of\n\nthe police report to a Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of\n\nthe offence on such police report. Alongwith the police report,\n\nthe investigating officer is also duty bound to forward to the\n\nMagistrate “all documents” or relevant extracts thereof, on which\n\nprosecution proposes to rely other than those sent to the\n\nMagistrate during investigation.        Similarly, the statements\n\nrecorded under Section 161 of all the persons whom the\n\nprosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses, are required to\n\nbe forwarded to the Magistrate alongwith the police report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">Indeed, it is open to the police officer, if in his opinion, any part\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                       18</span>\n\n\n\n\nof the “statement” is not relevant to the subject matter of the\n\nproceedings or that its disclosure to the accused is not essential\n\nin the interests of justice and is inexpedient in public interest, to\n\nindicate that part of the “statement” and append a note\n\nrequesting the Magistrate to exclude that part from the copies to\n\nbe granted to the accused and stating his reasons for making\n\nsuch request. That discretion, however, is not given to him in\n\nrespect of the “documents” or the relevant extracts thereof on\n\nwhich the prosecution proposes to rely against the accused\n\nconcerned. As regards the documents, sub­Section (7) enables\n\nthe investigating officer, if in his opinion it is convenient so to do,\n\nto furnish copies of all or any of the documents referred to in\n\nsub­Section (5) to the accused.         Section 173, as amended and\n\napplicable to the case at hand, reads thus:­\n\n\n        ‘‘173.

Concededly, as regards the “documents” on which the\n\nprosecution proposes to rely, the investigating officer has no\n\noption but to forward “all documents” to the Magistrate alongwith\n\nthe police report.   There is no provision (unlike in the case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                        21</span>\n\n\n\n\n“statements”) enabling the investigating officer to append a note\n\nrequesting     the   Magistrate,   to        exclude   any   part   thereof\n\n(“document”) from the copies to be granted to the accused. Sub­\n\nSection (7), however, gives limited discretion to the investigating\n\nofficer to forward copies of all or some of the documents, which\n\nhe finds it convenient to be given to the accused. That does not\n\npermit him to withhold the remaining documents, on which the\n\nprosecution proposes to rely against the accused, from being\n\nsubmitted to the Magistrate alongwith the police report. On the\n\nother hand, the expression used in Section 173(5)(a) of the 1973\n\nCode makes it amply clear that the investigating officer is obliged\n\nto forward “all” documents or relevant extracts on which the\n\nprosecution proposes to rely against the accused concerned\n\nalongwith the police report to the Magistrate.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">15. On receipt of the police report and the accompanying\n\nstatements and documents by virtue of Section 207 of the 1973\n\nCode, the Magistrate is then obliged to furnish copies of each of\n\nthe statements and documents to the accused.                 Section 207\n\nreads thus:­\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                       22</span>\n\n\n\n\n        ‘‘ 207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report\n        and other documents.—In any case where the proceeding\n        has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall\n        without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of\n        each of the following:—\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">        (i) the police report;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">        (ii) the first information report recorded under section 154;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">        (iii) the statements recorded under sub­section (3) of section\n        161 of all persons whom the prosecution proposes to\n        examine as its witnesses, excluding therefrom any part in\n        regard to which a request for such exclusion has been made\n        by the police officer under sub­section (6) of section 173;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">        (iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under\n        section 164;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">        (v) any other document or relevant extract thereof forwarded\n        to the Magistrate with the police report under sub­section (5)\n        of section 173:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           Provided that the Magistrate may, after perusing any\n        such part of a statement as is referred to in clause (iii) and\n        considering the reasons given by the police officer for the\n        request, direct that a copy of that part of the statement or of\n        such portion thereof as the Magistrate thinks proper, shall\n        be furnished to the accused:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           Provided further that if the Magistrate is satisfied that\n        any document referred to in clause (v) is voluminous, he\n        shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof,\n        direct that he will only be allowed to inspect it either\n        personally or through pleader in Court.’’\n\n\nAs regards the statements, the first proviso enables the\n\nMagistrate to withhold any part thereof referred to in clause (iii),\n\nfrom the accused on being satisfied with the note and the\n\nreasons specified by the investigating officer as predicated in\n\nsub­Section (6) of Section 173.             However, when it comes to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                  23</span>\n\n\n\n\nfurnishing of documents submitted by the investigating officer\n\nalongwith police report, the Magistrate can withhold only such\n\ndocument referred to in clause (v), which in his opinion, is\n\n“voluminous”. In that case, the accused can be permitted to take\n\ninspection of the concerned document either personally or\n\nthrough his pleader in Court. In other words, Section 207 of the\n\n1973 Code does not empower the Magistrate to withhold any\n\n“document” submitted by the investigating officer alongwith the\n\npolice report except when it is voluminous. A fortiori, it\n\nnecessarily follows that even if the investigating officer appends\n\nhis note in respect of any particular document, that will be of no\n\navail as his power is limited to do so only in respect of\n\n‘statements’ referred to in sub­Section (6) of Section 173 of the\n\n1973 Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78958066\" id=\"span_30\">16. Be that as it may, the Magistrate’s duty under Section 207\n\nat this stage is in the nature of administrative work, whereby he\n\nis required to ensure full compliance of the Section.

It\n          includes, documents or the relevant extracts thereof which\n          are forwarded by the police to the Magistrate with its report\n          under Section 173(5) of the Code. Such a compliance has\n          to be made on the first date when the accused appears or\n          is brought before the Magistrate at the commencement of\n          the trial inasmuch as Section 238 of the Code warrants the\n          Magistrate to satisfy himself that provisions of Section 207\n          have been complied with.

Be that as it may, furnishing of documents to the accused\n\nunder Section 207 of the 1973 Code is a facet of right of the\n\naccused to a fair trial enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_35\">In <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_28\">Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of\n\nDelhi</a>)4, this Court expounded thus:­\n\n\n          “218. The liberty of an accused cannot be interfered with\n          except under due process of law. The expression “due\n          process of law” shall deem to include fairness in trial. The\n          court (sic Code) gives a right to the accused to receive all\n          documents and statements as well as to move an\n          application for production of any record or witness in\n          support of his case. This constitutional mandate and\n          statutory rights given to the accused place an implied\n          obligation upon the prosecution (prosecution and the\n          Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure. The concept of fair\n          disclosure would take in its ambit furnishing of a\n          document which the prosecution relies upon whether filed\n          in court or not. That document should essentially be\n\n3 (1992) 4 SCC 711\n4 (2010) 6 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                              26</span>\n\n\n\n\nfurnished to the accused and even in the cases where\nduring investigation a document is bona fide obtained by\nthe investigating agency and in the opinion of the\nProsecutor is relevant and would help in arriving at the\ntruth, that document should also be disclosed to the\naccused.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">219. The role and obligation of the Prosecutor particularly\nin relation to disclosure cannot be equated under our law\nto that prevalent under the English system as aforereferred\nto. But at the same time, the demand for a fair trial cannot\nbe ignored. It may be of different consequences where a\ndocument which has been obtained suspiciously,\nfraudulently or by causing undue advantage to the accused\nduring investigation such document could be denied in the\ndiscretion of the Prosecutor to the accused whether the\nprosecution relies or not upon such documents, however in\nother cases the obligation to disclose would be more\ncertain. As already noticed the provisions of Section\n207 have a material bearing on this subject and make\nan interesting reading. This provision not only require\nor mandate that the court without delay and free of\ncost should furnish to the accused copies of the police\nreport,     first    information    report,    statements,\nconfessional statements of the persons recorded under\nSection 161 whom the prosecution wishes to examine\nas witnesses, of course, excluding any part of a\nstatement or document as contemplated under Section\n173(6) of the Code, any other document or relevant\nextract thereof which has been submitted to the\nMagistrate by the police under sub­section (5) of\nSection 173. In contradistinction to the provisions of\nSection 173, where the legislature has used the\nexpression “documents on which the prosecution\nrelies” are not used under Section 207 of the Code.\nTherefore, the provisions of Section 207 of the Code\nwill have to be given liberal and relevant meaning so as\nto achieve its object. Not only this, the documents\nsubmitted to the Magistrate along with the report\nunder Section 173(5) would deem to include the\ndocuments which have to be sent to the Magistrate\nduring the course of investigation as per the\nrequirement of Section 170(2) of the Code.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                          27</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">          220. The right of the accused with regard to disclosure of\n          documents is a limited right but is codified and is the very\n          foundation of a fair investigation and trial. On such\n          matters, the accused cannot claim an indefeasible legal\n          right to claim every document of the police file or even the\n          portions which are permitted to be excluded from the\n          documents annexed to the report under Section 173(2) as\n          per orders of the court. But certain rights of the accused\n          flow both from the codified law as well as from equitable\n          concepts of the constitutional jurisdiction, as substantial\n          variation to such procedure would frustrate the very basis\n          of a fair trial. To claim documents within the purview of\n          scope of Sections 207, 243 read with the provisions of\n          Section 173 in its entirety and power of the court under\n          <a href=\"/doc/1735825/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 91</a> of the Code to summon documents signifies and\n          provides precepts which will govern the right of the accused\n          to claim copies of the statement and documents which the\n          prosecution has collected during investigation and upon\n          which they rely.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">          221. It will be difficult for the Court to say that the accused\n          has no right to claim copies of the documents or request\n          the Court for production of a document which is part of the\n          general diary subject to satisfying the basic ingredients of\n          law stated therein. A document which has been obtained\n          bona fide and has bearing on the case of the prosecution\n          and in the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, the same\n          should be disclosed to the accused in the interest of justice\n          and fair investigation and trial should be furnished to the\n          accused. Then that document should be disclosed to the\n          accused giving him chance of fair defence, particularly\n          when non­production or disclosure of such a document\n          would affect administration of criminal justice and the\n          defence of the accused prejudicially.”\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166228518\" id=\"span_38\">19. Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/166228518/\" id=\"a_30\">V.K. Sasikala v. State5</a>, this Court held as\n\nunder:­\n\n          “21. The issue that has emerged before us is, therefore,\n          somewhat larger than what has been projected by the State\n          and what has been dealt with by the High Court. The\n\n5 (2012) 9 SCC 771\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                       28</span>\n\n\n\n\n       question arising would no longer be one of compliance\n       or non­compliance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 207</a>\n       CrPC and would travel beyond the confines of the strict\n       language of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_32\">Cr.PC</a> and touch upon the\n       larger doctrine of a free and fair trial that has been\n       painstakingly built up by the courts on a purposive\n       interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is not\n       the stage of making of the request; the efflux of time that\n       has occurred or the prior conduct of the accused that is\n       material. What is of significance is if in a given situation\n       the accused comes to the court contending that some\n       papers forwarded to the court by the investigating agency\n       have not been exhibited by the prosecution as the same\n       favours the accused the court must concede a right to the\n       accused to have an access to the said documents, if so\n       claimed. This, according to us, is the core issue in the case\n       which must be answered affirmatively. In this regard, we\n       would like to be specific in saying that we find it difficult to\n       agree with the view taken by the High Court that the\n       accused must be made to await the conclusion of the trial\n       to test the plea of prejudice that he may have raised. Such\n       a plea must be answered at the earliest and certainly\n       before the conclusion of the trial, even though it may be\n       raised by the accused belatedly. This is how the scales of\n       justice in our criminal jurisprudence have to be balanced.”\n\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">20. The next seminal question is: whether the contents of the\n\nmemory card/pen­drive submitted to the Court alongwith the\n\npolice report can be treated as “document” as such. Indubitably,\n\nif the contents of the memory card/pen­drive are not to be\n\ntreated as “document”, the question of furnishing the same to the\n\naccused by virtue of Section 207 read with Section 173 of the\n\n1973 Code would not arise.         We say so because it is nobody’s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                        29</span>\n\n\n\n\ncase before us that the contents of the memory card/pen­drive\n\nbe treated as a “statement” ascribable to Section 173(5)(b) of the\n\n1973 Code.            Notably, the command under Section 207 is to\n\nfurnish “statements” or “documents”, as the case may be, to the\n\naccused as submitted by the investigating officer alongwith the\n\npolice report, where the prosecution proposes to rely upon the\n\nsame against the accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">21. The High Court adverted to certain judgments before\n\nconcluding that the memory card would be a material object. For\n\narriving at the said conclusion, the High Court relied on the\n\ndecision of the King’s Bench of United Kingdom in The King v.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">Daye6, wherein Darling J., adding to the majority opinion, had\n\nheld thus:­\n          “…But I should myself say that any written thing\n          capable of being evidence is properly described as a\n          document and that it is immaterial on what the writing\n          may be inscribed. It might be inscribed on paper, as is\n          the common case now; but the common case once was\n          that it was not on paper, but on parchment; and long\n          before that it was on stone, marble, or clay, and it\n          might be, and often was, on metal. So I should desire to\n          guard myself against being supposed to assent to the\n          argument that a thing is not a document unless it be a\n          paper writing. I should say it is a document no matter\n          upon what material it be, provided it is writing or printing\n          and capable of being evidence.”\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n6 [1908] 2 K.B. 333\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                        30</span>\n\n\n\n\nThe High Court also relied on the decision of the Chancery Court\n\nin Grant and Another v. Southwester and County Properties\n\nLtd. and Another7, wherein it was observed as follows:­\n             “There are a number of cases in which the meaning of\n          the word &quot;document&quot; has been discussed in varying\n          circumstances. Before briefly referring to such cases, it\n          will, I think, be convenient to bear in mind that the\n          derivation of the word is from the Latin &quot;documentum&quot;: it is\n          something which instructs or provides information. Indeed,\n          according to Bullokar&#x27;s English Expositor (1621), it meant\n          a lesson. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary has as the\n          fourth meaning for the word the following: &quot;Something\n          written, inscribed, etc., which furnishes evidence or\n          information upon any subject, as a manuscript, title­deed,\n          coin, etc.,&quot; and it produces as the relevant quotation: ­\n          &quot;These frescoes... have become invaluable as documents,&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          the writer being Mrs. Anna Brownell Jameson who lived\n          from 1794 to 1860.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">              I think that all the authorities to which I am about to\n          refer have consistently stressed the furnishing of\n          information ­ impliedly otherwise than as to the document\n          itself ­ as being one of the main functions of a document.\n          Indeed, in In Re Alderton and Barry&#x27;s Application (1941) 59\n          R.P.C. 56, Morton J. expressly doubted whether blank\n          workmen&#x27;s time sheets could be classified as documents\n          within section 11(1)(b) of the Patent and Design Acts 1907­\n          1939 expressly because in their original state they\n          conveyed no information of any kind to anybody...”\n\n\n\nIt can be safely deduced from the aforementioned expositions\n\nthat the basis of classifying article as a “document” depends\n\nupon the information which is inscribed and not on where it is\n\ninscribed.

In the 42nd Law Commission Report39,\n\nthe Commission opined on the amendments to the 1860 Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">Dealing with <a href=\"/doc/639278/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 29</a> of the 1860 Code, the Commission\n\nopined as under:­\n          “2.56. The main idea in all the three Acts is the same and\n          the emphasis is on the “matter” which is recorded, and not\n          on the substance on which the matter is recorded. We feel,\n          on the whole, that the Penal Code should contain a\n          definition of “document” for its own purpose, and that\n          <a href=\"/doc/639278/\" id=\"a_73\">section 29</a> should be retained.”\n\nThe said observation is restated in the 156 th Report40, wherein\n\nthe Commission opined thus:­\n          “11.08     Therefore, the term ‘document’ as defined in\n          <a href=\"/doc/1580204/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 29</a>, IPC may be enlarged so as to specifically\n          include therein any disc, tape, sound track or other device\n          on or in which any matter is recorded or stored by\n          mechanical, electronic or other means … … … The\n          aforesaid proposed amendment in <a href=\"/doc/639278/\" id=\"a_75\">section 29</a> would also\n          necessitate consequential amendment of the term\n          “document” under <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_76\">section 3</a> of the Indian Evidence Act,\n          1872 on the lines indicated above.”\n\n\nConsidering the aforementioned Reports, it can be concluded\n\nthat the contents of the memory card would be a “matter” and\n\n\n\n\n39 Forty­Second Report, Law Commission India, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_77\">Indian Penal Code</a>, June, 1971, 32­35\n\n40 One Hundred Fifty­Sixth Report on the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_78\">Indian Penal Code</a> (Volume I), August, 1997,\nLaw Commission of India, Chapter­XI\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">\f                                   47</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe memory card itself would be a “substance” and hence, the\n\ncontents of the memory card would be a “document”.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_150\">32. It is crystal clear that all documents including “electronic\n\nrecord” produced for the inspection of the Court alongwith the\n\npolice report and which prosecution proposes to use against the\n\naccused must be furnished to the accused as per the mandate of\n\nSection 207 of the 1973 Code.        The concomitant is that the\n\ncontents of the memory card/pen­drive must be furnished to the\n\naccused, which can be done in the form of cloned copy of the\n\nmemory card/pen­drive.      It is cardinal that a person tried for\n\nsuch a serious offence should be furnished with all the material\n\nand evidence in advance, on which the prosecution proposes to\n\nrely against him during the trial. Any other view would not only\n\nimpinge upon the statutory mandate contained in the 1973\n\nCode, but also the right of an accused to a fair trial enshrined in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">33. We do not wish to dilate further nor should we be\n\nunderstood to have examined the question of relevancy of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                  48</span>\n\n\n\n\ncontents of the memory card/pen­drive or for that matter the\n\nproof and admissibility thereof. The only question that we have\n\nexamined in this appeal is: whether the contents of the memory\n\ncard/pen­drive referred to in the chargesheet or the police report\n\nsubmitted to Magistrate under Section 173 of the 1973 Code,\n\nneed to be furnished to the accused if the prosecution intends to\n\nrely on the same by virtue of Section 207 of the 1973 Code?\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_152\">34. Reverting to the preliminary objection taken by the\n\nrespondent for dismissing the appeal at the threshold because of\n\nthe disclosure of identity of the victim in the memo of the special\n\nleave petition forming the subject matter of the present appeal,\n\nwe find that the explanation offered by the appellant is plausible\n\ninasmuch as the prosecution itself had done so by naming the\n\nvictim in the First Information Report/Crime Case, the statement\n\nof the victim under Section 161, as well as under Section 164 of\n\nthe 1973 Code, and in the chargesheet/police report filed before\n\nthe Magistrate.   Even the objection regarding incorrect factual\n\nnarration about the appellant having himself viewed the contents\n\nof the memory card/pen­drive does not take the matter any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">\f                                   49</span>\n\n\n\n\nfurther, once we recognize the right of the accused to get the\n\ncloned copies of the contents of the memory card/pen­drive as\n\nbeing mandated by Section 207 of the 1973 Code and more so,\n\nbecause of the right of the accused to a fair trial enshrined in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">35. The next crucial question is: whether parting of the cloned\n\ncopy of the contents of the memory card/pen­drive and handing\n\nit over to the accused may be safe or is likely to be misused by\n\nthe accused or any other person with or without the permission\n\nof the accused concerned? In the present case, there are eight\n\nnamed accused as of now. Once relief is granted to the appellant\n\nwho is accused No. 8, the other accused would follow the same\n\nsuit.   In that event, the cloned copies of the contents of the\n\nmemory card/pen­drive would be freely available to all the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118244912\" id=\"span_79\">36. Considering the principles laid down by this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/118244912/\" id=\"a_81\">Tarun Tyagi</a> (supra), we are of the opinion that certain\n\nconditions need to be imposed in the fact situation of the present\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                                 50</span>\n\n\n\n\ncase. However, the safeguards/conditions suggested by the\n\nappellant such as to take help of experts, to impose watermarks\n\non the respective cloned copies etc., may not be sufficient\n\nmeasure to completely rule out the possibility of misuse thereof.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">In that, with the advancement of technology, it may be possible\n\nto breach even the security seals incorporated in the concerned\n\ncloned copy.   Besides, it will be well­nigh impossible to keep\n\ntrack of the misuse of the cloned copy and its safe and secured\n\ncustody.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">37. Resultantly, instead of allowing the prayer sought by the\n\nappellant in toto, it may be desirable to mould the relief by\n\npermitting the appellant to seek second expert opinion from an\n\nindependent agency such as the Central Forensic Science\n\nLaboratory (CFSL), on all matters which the appellant may be\n\nadvised. In that, the appellant can formulate queries with the\n\nhelp of an expert of his choice, for being posed to the stated\n\nagency.    That shall be confidential and not allowed to be\n\naccessed by any other agency or person not associated with the\n\nCFSL. Similarly, the forensic report prepared by the CFSL, after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                   51</span>\n\n\n\n\nanalyzing the cloned copy of the subject memory card/pen­drive,\n\nshall be kept confidential and shall not be allowed to be accessed\n\nby any other agency or person except the concerned accused or\n\nhis authorized representative until the conclusion of the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">We are inclined to say so because the State FSL has already\n\nsubmitted its forensic report in relation to the same memory card\n\nat the instance of the investigating agency.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">38. Needless to mention that the appellant before us or the\n\nother accused cannot and are not claiming any expertise, much\n\nless, capability of undertaking forensic analysis of the cloned\n\ncopy of the contents of the memory card/pen­drive. They may\n\nhave to eventually depend on some expert agency.             In our\n\nopinion,   the   accused,   who   are   interested   in   reassuring\n\nthemselves about the genuineness and credibility of the contents\n\nof the memory card in question or that of the pen­drive produced\n\nbefore the trial Court by the prosecution on which the\n\nprosecution would rely during the trial, are free to take opinion of\n\nan independent expert agency, such as the CFSL on such\n\nmatters as they may be advised, which information can be used\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">\f                                        52</span>\n\n\n\n\nby them to confront the prosecution witnesses including the\n\nforensic report of the State FSL relied upon by the prosecution\n\nforming part of the police report.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"122252422\" id=\"span_83\">39. Considering that this is a peculiar case of intra­conflict of\n\nfundamental rights flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a>, that is right to a fair\n\ntrial of the accused and right to privacy of the victim, it is\n\nimperative to adopt an approach which would balance both the\n\nrights. This principle has been enunciated in the case of <a href=\"/doc/122252422/\" id=\"a_83\">Asha\n\nRanjan v. State of Bihar41</a> wherein this Court held thus:­\n\n\n         “57. The aforesaid decision is an authority for the\n         proposition that there can be a conflict between two\n         individuals qua their right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21</a> of the\n         Constitution and in such a situation, to weigh the balance\n         the test that is required to be applied is the test of larger\n         public interest and further that would, in certain\n         circumstances, advance public morality of the day. To put\n         it differently, the “greater community interest” or\n         “interest of the collective or social order” would be the\n         principle to recognise and accept the right of one\n         which has to be protected.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">                    xxx             xxx               xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">         61. Be it stated, circumstances may emerge that may\n         necessitate for balancing between intra­fundamental\n         rights. It has been distinctly understood that the test that\n         has to be applied while balancing the two fundamental\n         rights or inter fundamental rights, the principles applied\n         may be different than the principle to be applied in intra­\n         conflict between the same fundamental right … … ... Thus,\n         there can be two individuals both having legitimacy to\n\n41 (2017) 4 SCC 397\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">\f                                  53</span>\n\n\n\n\nclaim or assert the right. The factum of legitimacy is a\nprimary consideration. It has to be remembered that no\nfundamental right is absolute and it can have limitations in\ncertain circumstances … … ... Therefore, if the collective\ninterest or the public interest that serves the public cause\nand further has the legitimacy to claim or assert a\nfundamental right, then only it can put forth that their\nright should be protected. There can be no denial of the\nfact that the rights of the victims for a fair trial is an\ninseparable aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and\nwhen they assert that right by themselves as well as the\npart of the collective, the conception of public interest gets\ngalvanised. The accentuated public interest in such\ncircumstances has to be given primacy, for it furthers and\npromotes “Rule of Law”. It may be clarified at once that the\ntest of primacy which is based on legitimacy and the public\ninterest has to be adjudged on the facts of each case and\ncannot be stated in abstract terms. It will require studied\nscanning of facts, the competing interests and the ultimate\nperception of the balancing that would subserve the larger\npublic interest and serve the majesty of rule of law. ... … …\n\n            xxx             xxx                 xxx\n\n86.1. The right to fair trial is not singularly absolute, as\nis perceived, from the perspective of the accused. It\ntakes in its ambit and sweep the right of the victim(s)\nand the society at large. These factors would\ncollectively allude and constitute the Rule of Law i.e.\nfree and fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_162\">86.2. The fair trial which is constitutionally protected as a\nsubstantial right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> and also the statutory\nprotection, does invite for consideration a sense of conflict\nwith the interest of the victim(s) or the collective/interest of\nthe society. When there is an intra­conflict in respect of\nthe same fundamental right from the true perceptions,\nit is the obligation of the constitutional courts to weigh\nthe balance in certain circumstances, the interest of\nthe society as a whole, when it would promote and\ninstil Rule of Law. A fair trial is not what the accused\nwants in the name of fair trial. Fair trial must soothe the\nultimate justice which is sought individually, but is\nsubservient and would not prevail when fair trial requires\ntransfer of the criminal proceedings.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                         54</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">40.

Undoubtedly, right of people to hold peaceful protests\n          and demonstrations, etc. is a fundamental right\n          guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_87\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1248826/\" id=\"a_88\">19(1)(b)</a> of the\n          Constitution. The question is as to whether disturbances,\n          etc. caused by it to the residents, as mentioned in detail by\n          the NGT, is a larger public interest which outweighs the\n          rights of protestors to hold demonstrations at Jantar\n          Mantar Road and, therefore, amounts to reasonable\n          restriction in curbing such demonstrations. Here, we agree\n          with the detailed reasoning given by the NGT that holding\n          of demonstrations in the way it has been happening is\n          causing serious discomfort and harassment to the\n          residents. At the same time, it is also to be kept in mind\n          that for quite some time Jantar Mantar has been chosen as\n          a place for holding demonstrations and was earmarked by\n          the authorities as well. Going by the dicta in <a href=\"/doc/122252422/\" id=\"a_89\">Asha\n          Ranjan [Asha Ranjan v. State of Bihar</a>, (2017) 4 SCC\n          397 : (2017) 2 SCC (Cri) 376] , principle of primacy\n          cannot be given to one right whereby the right of the\n          other gets totally extinguished. Total extinction is not\n          balancing. Balancing would mean curtailing one right of\n          one class to some extent so that the right of the other\n          class is also protected.”\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76947\" id=\"span_87\">41. We are conscious of the fact that Section 207 of the 1973\n\nCode permits withholding of document(s) by the Magistrate only\n\nif it is voluminous and for no other reason. If it is an “electronic\n\nrecord”, certainly the ground predicated in the second proviso in\n42 (2018) 17 SCC 324\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">\f                                    55</span>\n\n\n\n\nSection 207, of being voluminous, ordinarily, cannot be invoked\n\nand will be unavailable. We are also conscious of the dictum in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/76947/\" id=\"a_90\">Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal\n\nAffairs, West Bengal vs. Satyen Bhowmick &amp; Ors.43</a>, wherein\n\nthis Court has restated the cardinal principle that accused is\n\nentitled to have copies of the statements and documents\n\naccompanying the police report, which the prosecution may use\n\nagainst him during the trial.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76947\" id=\"span_89\">42. Nevertheless, the Court cannot be oblivious to the nature of\n\noffence and the principle underlying the amendment to Section\n\n327 of the 1973 Code, in particular sub­Section (2) thereof and\n\ninsertion of Section 228A of the 1860 Code, for securing the\n\nprivacy of the victim and her identity.      Thus understood, the\n\nCourt is obliged to evolve a mechanism to enable the accused to\n\nreassure himself about the genuineness and credibility of the\n\ncontents of the memory card/pen­drive from an independent\n\nagency <a href=\"/doc/76947/\" id=\"a_91\">referred to above</a>, so as to effectively defend himself\n\nduring the trial.</span>     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382199\" id=\"span_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"122252422\" id=\"span_91\">Thus, balancing the rights of both parties is\n\nimperative, as has been held in <a href=\"/doc/122252422/\" id=\"a_92\">Asha Ranjan</a> (supra) and\n43 (1981) 2 <a href=\"/doc/382199/\" id=\"a_93\">SCC 109\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                                   56</span>\n\n\n\n\nMazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan</a> (supra). The Court is duty\n\nbound to issue suitable directions.     Even the High Court, in\n\nexercise of inherent power under Section 482 of the 1973 Code,\n\nis competent to issue suitable directions to meet the ends of\n\njustice.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">43. If the accused or his lawyer himself, additionally, intends to\n\ninspect the contents of the memory card/pen­drive in question,\n\nhe can request the Magistrate to provide him inspection in Court,\n\nif necessary, even for more than once alongwith his lawyer and\n\nI.T. expert to enable him to effectively defend himself during the\n\ntrial. If such an application is filed, the Magistrate must consider\n\nthe same appropriately and exercise judicious discretion with\n\nobjectivity while ensuring that it is not an attempt by the\n\naccused to protract the trial. While allowing the accused and his\n\nlawyer or authorized I.T. expert, all care must be taken that they\n\ndo not carry any devices much less electronic devices, including\n\nmobile phone which may have the capability of copying or\n\ntransferring the electronic record thereof or mutating the\n\ncontents of the memory card/pen­drive in any manner.          Such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                  57</span>\n\n\n\n\nmultipronged approach may subserve the ends of justice and\n\nalso effectuate the right of accused to a fair trial guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_168\">44. In conclusion, we hold that the contents of the memory\n\ncard/pen drive being electronic record must be regarded as a\n\ndocument. If the prosecution is relying on the same, ordinarily,\n\nthe accused must be given a cloned copy thereof to enable\n\nhim/her to present an effective defence during the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">However, in cases involving    issues such as of privacy of the\n\ncomplainant/witness or his/her identity,     the Court may be\n\njustified in providing only inspection thereof to the accused and\n\nhis/her lawyer or expert for presenting effective defence during\n\nthe trial. The court may issue suitable directions to balance the\n\ninterests of both sides.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_170\">45. In view of the above, this appeal partly succeeds.       The\n\nimpugned judgment and order passed by the trial Court and the\n\nHigh Court respectively stand modified by giving option to the\n\nappellant/accused to the extent indicated hitherto, in particular\n\nparagraphs 37, 38 and 43.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">\f                                  58</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">46.
