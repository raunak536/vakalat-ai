The writ of mandamus is not generally a remedy against private\n                          wrongs. The scope of writ of mandamus is against the private authority which\n                          might be performing a public duty limited to the enforcement of the public\n                          duty, and this Court cannot interfere with the internal management of a\n                          private body. It is well settled that a writ of mandamus lies only for the\n                          purpose of a public or statutory duty. Writs are issued for the performance of\n                          public duties. Though <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is worded in\n                          such a way that a writ of mandamus could be issued even against a private\n                          authority but such private authority must be discharging a public function and\n                          the right sought to be enforced must be a public duty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          11.
