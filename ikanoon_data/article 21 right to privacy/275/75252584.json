Therefore,\n                    representative form of governance comes out as a\n                    device to bring to fore the popular will. The\n                    Constitution of India has embraced the\n                    representative model of governance at all levels i.e.\n                    local, State and the Union. Thus perceived, the\n                    people are the sovereign since they exercise the\n                    power of adult franchise that ultimately builds the\n                    structure of representative democracy.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">                        ......\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                          &quot;Mere existence of a Constitution, by itself,\n                    does not ensure constitutionalism or a constitutional\n                    culture. It is the political maturity and traditions of a\n                    people that import meaning to a Constitution which\n                    otherwise merely embodies political hopes and\n                    ideals.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">                        ...\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                        &quot;Fundamental human freedoms limit the\n                    authority of the State. Yet the role of institutions in\n                    achieving democracy is as significant. Nations fail\n                    when institutions of governance fail. The\n                    responsiveness of institutions is determined in a\n                    large measure by their ability to be receptive to\n                    differences and perceptive to the need for constant\n                    engagement and dialogue. Constitutional skirmishes\n                    are not unhealthy. They test the resilience of\n                    democracy.

Our discussion with Sri Lalit Kishore, learned\n\n        Advocate General, Bihar as instructed by Sri Amir Subhani,\n\n        Development Commissioner, Bihar and Sri Santosh Kumar\n\n        Mall, Secretary, Department of Information and Technology,\n\n        Government of Bihar, Patna has resulted in our conclusion that\n\n        the Government, be it for whatever reason, is most reluctant to\n\n        put in the public domain the number of deaths which occurred\n\n        in Bihar during the last one year, i.e. during the time of\n\n        Pandemic Covid-19. In our considered view, the resistance is\n\n        uncalled for, for such action is neither protected by any law nor\n\n        in consonance with good governance&#x27;s settled principles. The\n\n        Government, while correcting its myopic approach, only needs a\n\n        reminder that &quot;To cover with veil of secrecy, the common\n\n        routine business, is not in the interest of the public. Such\n\n        secrecy can seldom be legitimately desired.&quot; is what Hon&#x27;ble\n\n        the Supreme Court had said in <a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_2\">State of U.P. v.

The Civil\n\n        Registration       system      has     a   threefold   objective:   Legal,\n\n        Administrative and Statistical.

The need undertaking such an exercise arose\n\n        only when this Court found that the number of deaths reported\n\n        by the Government of Bihar, in the times of the second wave of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.353 of 2021(36) dt.18 -06-2021\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                          10/28</span>\n\n\n\n\n        Covid-19, did not appear to be correct, which facts stands\n\n        confirmed through the affidavit dated June 10, 2021 filed by the\n\n        Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar wherein it is stated that\n\n        the total number of deaths which took place in Bihar is 9375 and\n\n        not 5424 the figure indicated earlier. We clarify that at this\n\n        stage, we do not express any opinion on the explanation\n\n        furnished by the Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar, for\n\n        revising the figure, which may or may not be factually correct.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">                        17. It is only during the course of the proceedings\n\n        on 12.06.2021 for reasons unfathomable by the Court, for the\n\n        first time, that too orally, under instructions, the learned\n\n        Advocate General raised the issue of the public representatives\n\n        not being responsible or accountable for providing information\n\n        to be uploaded on the digital portal.

In our considered view, the objection is legally\n\n        unsustainable, and this we say so for the provisions of the\n\n        Statutes (Acts) and the Bihar Registration of Births and Deaths\n\n        Rules, 1999 are clear. We had elaborately discussed the\n\n        provisions of different Statutes (Acts) in our order dated\n\n        12.05.2021 and need not repeat here. The plea being specious is\n\n        also because the Government had acted thereupon and issued\n Patna High Court CWJC No.353 of 2021(36) dt.18 -06-2021\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          11/28</span>\n\n\n\n\n        directions in the affirmative from time to time. In fact, we find\n\n        the Government to work by adopting an approach of\n\n        compartmentalization, lacking in coordination, resulting in\n\n        filing of affidavits which are both either vague or contradictory.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                        19. We may remind the Government that in the year\n\n        2011, it had itself amended the Bihar Registration of Births and\n\n        Deaths Rules, 1999 mandating computerization of birth and\n\n        death registers. Now, if the object of the CRS portal is to be\n\n        achieved more so, concerning the &quot;second fold&quot; and the &quot;third\n\n        fold&quot; as is so stated by the Director, Directorate of Economics\n\n        and Statistics, Department of Planning &amp; Development,\n\n        Government of Bihar, Patna in his affidavit dated June 6, 2021,\n\n        reproduced supra, then we see no reason as to why such\n\n        information of deaths is not regularly uploaded and made\n\n        known to the general public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                        20.

Now that the World Health Organization and the\n\n        Government of India can provide the status of Covid-19, why is\n\n        it that the State should be reluctant to upload the information of\n\n        all deaths on the official website? We are not unmindful that the\n\n        information of fatalities arising out of Covid-19 is in the public\n\n        domain.
