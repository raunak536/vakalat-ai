This criminal appeal has been  preferred  against  the  impugned\n      judgment and order dated 20.9.2010 passed by the High Court of  Punjab\n      &amp; Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Appeal No. 243-DB of 2002, by  way\n      of which the High Court has affirmed  the  judgment  and  order  dated\n      4.3.2002 passed by the Additional Sessions  Judge,  Jind  in  Sessions\n      Case No. 37 of 2001, by way of which the  appellant  no.  1  has  been\n      convicted  under  <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  376</a>  of  the  Indian   Penal   Code,   1860\n      (hereinafter referred to as `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>’) and awarded the sentence  of  seven\n      years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- and in  default\n      of making payment, to further  undergo  imprisonment  for  two  years.\n      Further he has been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 506</a> IPC  and  awarded  the\n      sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment. Both the  sentences  have\n      been directed to  run  concurrently.  The  other  co-accused,  namely,\n      Manoj, Satish @ Sitta and Kuldeep have been convicted separately under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_4\">sections 376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_5\">506</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_6\">366</a> and <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_7\">363</a> IPC.   Kuldeep  Singh  alone  has  been\n      found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 376 (2)  (g)</a>  IPC,  and  has  been  awarded\n      sentence of life imprisonment. Out of  these  four  convicts,  Kuldeep\n      Singh and Manoj did not prefer any appeal  against  the  High  Court’s\n      judgment, while appellant nos.1 and 2 preferred  the  present  appeal.\n      Appellant no.2  had died during the pendency of this appeal  in  jail,\n      therefore, we are concerned only with the case of appellant  no.1   i.\n      e. Lillu @ Rajesh.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">      2.    Mr. J.P. Singh, learned counsel  for  the  appellant,  submitted\n      that the prosecution has failed to prove the  date  of  birth  of  the\n      prosecutrix and that she was about 17-18 years of age on the  date  of\n      incident.  Thus, it was a clear cut case of consent. The statement  of\n      Raj Bala, prosecutrix  has   not  been  corroborated  by  any  of  the\n      witnesses and has not got corroborated by the  medical  evidence.  Dr.\n      Malti Gupta (PW-1), who had examined Raj Bala,  prosecutrix  medically\n      had deposed that there was no external mark of injury on any  part  of\n      her body. The possibility of  prosecutrix  being  habitual  to  sexual\n      intercourse could not be ruled out. There was no  bleeding.  Thus,  in\n      such a fact-situation, the statement of the prosecutrix that  she  was\n      unmarried and had never indulged in sexual activity with  any  person,\n      or was below 16 years, could not be relied upon.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">      3.    On the other hand, the State  of  Haryana,  as  usual,  remained\n      unrepresented as the government counsel duly appointed  by  the  State\n      considered it their privilege not to appear in court  and  become  the\n      burden on public exchequer. So, the court has to examine the case more\n      consciously going through the record and examine  the  correctness  of\n      the findings recorded by the courts below.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      4.    The trial  court  has  examined  the  issue  on  age  and  after\n      examining the school certificate (Ext. P-N), which stood  duly  proved\n      by Lakhi Ram (PW-11), Science teacher, Government High Court,  Badhana\n      and  Gajraj Singh, teacher, Govt. Primary School, Badhana, came to the\n      conclusion that her date of birth  as  per  the  school  register  was\n      4.6.1987. So on the date of incident i.e. 7.3.2001, she was 13 years 9\n      month and 2 days old.  She was a student of 6th  standard.  To  refute\n      the same, no evidence worth the name has  been  led  by  the  accused-\n      appellant. The said finding stood affirmed by the High  Court  and  in\n      view thereof, it remains totally immaterial  whether  the  prosecutrix\n      was a consenting party or not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">      5.    So far as the medical evidence is concerned, Dr. Malti Gupta (PW-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      1), Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Jind, has deposed that Raj  Bala,\n      prosecutrix was habitual in sexual activities and such a statement was\n      made in view of the medical examination. Relevant part  thereof  reads\n      as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           &quot;Bilateral  breast  were  moderately  developed,  There  was  no\n           external mark of injury seen any where  on  the  body.  Axillary\n           heir was not developed. Public hair were partially developed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           On  local  examination  labia  majora  and  labia  minora   were\n           moderately developed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           There was no bleeding P/V. Whitish discharge was present.  Hymen\n           was completely torn.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           Vagina admitted two fingers cervix was  normal,  uterus  was  of\n           null parous by lateral FF were normal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           ….Two swabs were taken from  cervix  vagina.  Public  hair  were\n           taken and sent for examination. Salwar  worn  by  Raj  Bala  was\n           taken and sealed following were handed over to the police.\n           ….It is correct that I have given  my  opinion  that  hymen  was\n           completely torn.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           ….It is also correct that the marginas were completely   heeled.\n           I cannot give the exact time.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           ….I cannot say whether it was torn one year back 2 years back or\n           10 days back.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           ….I cannot say whether there was any sign of semen on the  swabs\n           taken by me.”\n\n\n           She further deposed:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">           &quot;.... Since there was no matting of hair so   I  did  not  opine\n           whether there was any semen on the public hair.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           ….I do not remember whether I enquired from Raj Bala whether she\n           came to me for medico legal examination  after  washing  clothes\n           and taking bath or not. However, the  salwar  worn  by  her  was\n           taken into custody. I cannot say from how many days Raj Bala was\n           having  sexual  activities.  The  possibility  of  Raj  Bala  of\n           habitual sexual intercourse cannot be ruled out.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">      6.    In fact, much has been argued by Mr. J.P. Singh on  two  fingers\n      test. Admitting very fairly that in case she was a minor, the question\n      as to whether she had been habitual to sexual activities  or  not,  is\n      immaterial to determine the issue of consent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">      7.    So far as the two  finger  test  is  concerned,  it  requires  a\n      serious consideration by the court as there  is  a  demand  for  sound\n      standard of conducting and interpreting forensic examination  of  rape\n      survivors.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">      8.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"163001754\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/163001754/\" id=\"a_9\">Narayanamma (Kum) v. State of Karnataka &amp; Ors.</a>, (1994) 5  SCC\n      728, this Court held that fact of admission of  two  fingers  and  the\n      hymen rupture does not give a clear  indication  that  prosecutrix  is\n      habitual to sexual intercourse. The doctor has to opine as to  whether\n      the hymen stood ruptured much earlier or  carried  an  old  tear.  The\n      factum of admission of two fingers could not be held  adverse  to  the\n      prosecutrix, as it would also depend upon  the  size  of  the  fingers\n      inserted. The doctor must give his clear opinion as to whether it  was\n      painful and bleeding on touch, for the  reason  that  such  conditions\n      obviously relate to the hymen.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      9.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974122\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/1974122/\" id=\"a_10\">State of U.P. v. Pappu @ Yunus &amp; Anr.</a>, AIR 2005 SC 1248,  the\n      Court held that a prosecutrix complaining of having been a  victim  of\n      an offence of rape is not an accomplice after the crime. There  is  no\n      rule  of  law  that  her  testimony  cannot  be  acted  upon   without\n      corroboration in material particulars, for the reason, that she stands\n      on a much higher pedestal than an injured witness.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1843796\" id=\"span_3\">This Court while dealing  with  the  issue  in  <a href=\"/doc/1843796/\" id=\"a_11\">State  of  Uttar\n      Pradesh v. Munshi</a>, AIR 2009 SC 370, has expressed its anguish and held\n      that even if the victim of rape was previously  accustomed  to  sexual\n      intercourse, it cannot be the determinative question. On the contrary,\n      the question still remains as to whether the accused committed rape on\n      the victim on the occasion complained of. Even if the victim had  lost\n      her virginity earlier, it can certainly not  give  a  licence  to  any\n      person to rape her. It is the accused who was on  trial  and  not  the\n      victim. So as to whether the victim is of a promiscuous  character  is\n      totally an irrelevant issue altogether in a case of rape. Even a woman\n      of easy virtue has a right to  refuse  to  submit  herself  to  sexual\n      intercourse to anyone and everyone, because she is  not  a  vulnerable\n      object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone.  A\n      prosecutrix stands on a higher pedestal than an  injured  witness  for\n      the reason that an injured witness gets the  injury  on  the  physical\n      form, while the prosecutrix suffers psychologically  and  emotionally.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">      10.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"128137606\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/128137606/\" id=\"a_12\">Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>),  AIR  2012  SC  2281,\n      this Court dealt with a case where the allegation was that the  victim\n      of rape herself was an unchaste woman, and a  woman  of  easy  virtue.\n      The court held that so far  as  the  prosecutrix  is  concerned,  mere\n      statement of prosecutrix herself is enough  to  record  a  conviction,\n      when her evidence is read in  its  totality  and  found  to  be  worth\n      reliance.  The  incident  in  itself  causes  a  great  distress   and\n      humiliation to the victim though, undoubtedly a  false  allegation  of\n      rape can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to  the  accused\n      as well.  The <a href=\"/doc/128137606/\" id=\"a_13\">Court further held</a> as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974122\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"524900\" id=\"span_7\">“Even in cases where there is some material to  show  that  the\n           victim was habituated to sexual intercourse, no inference of the\n           victim being a woman of “easy virtues”  or  a  women  of  “loose\n           moral character” can be  drawn.  Such a woman  has  a  right  to\n           protect her dignity and cannot be subjected  to  rape  only  for\n           that reason. She has a right to  refuse  to  submit  herself  to\n           sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is  not  a\n           vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone\n           and everyone. Merely because a woman  is  of  easy  virtue,  her\n           evidence cannot be discarded on that ground alone rather  it  is\n           to be cautiously appreciated.

Ramdev Singh</a>,  AIR  2004  SC  1290,   this\n      court dealt with the issue and held that rape is violative of victim’s\n      fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. So, the courts\n      should deal with such cases sternly  and  severely.  Sexual  violence,\n      apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion  on  the\n      right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to  her\n      supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and  dignity  as  well.  It\n      degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a  helpless\n      innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience.  A\n      rapist not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar  on\n      the most cherished position of a  woman,  i.e.  her  dignity,  honour,\n      reputation and chastity. Rape is  not  only  an  offence  against  the\n      person of a woman, rather a crime against the entire society. It is  a\n      crime against basic human rights and also violates the most  cherished\n      fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      12.   In view of  International  Covenant  on  Economic,  Social,  and\n      Cultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of  Basic  Principles\n      of Justice for  Victims  of  Crime  and  Abuse  of  Power  1985,  rape\n      survivors are entitled to legal recourse that  does  not  retraumatize\n      them or violate their physical or mental integrity and  dignity.  They\n      are also entitled to medical procedures conducted  in  a  manner  that\n      respects their right to consent.  Medical  procedures  should  not  be\n      carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or  degrading\n      treatment and  health  should  be  of  paramount  consideration  while\n      dealing with gender-based violence. The State is under  an  obligation\n      to make such services  available  to  survivors  of  sexual  violence.\n      Proper measures should be taken  to  ensure  their  safety  and  there\n      should be no arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">      13.   Thus, in view of the above, undoubtedly, the two finger test and\n      its interpretation violates the right of rape  survivors  to  privacy,\n      physical and mental integrity and dignity.  Thus, this test,  even  if\n      the report is  affirmative,  cannot  ipso  facto,  be  given  rise  to\n      presumption of consent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">      14.   In view of the above, the facts and circumstances of the case do\n      not present special  features  warranting  any  interference  by  this\n      Court. The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">                          ….……………………………...................................J.\n                            (Dr. B.S.
