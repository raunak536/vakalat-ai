The appellate authority has furnished the information on 24.08.2011 to the petitioner.  Not satisfied with the information supplied, the petitioner has filed the second appeal under Section 19(3) to the Commission on 28.09.2011.  On the basis of the petitioner/appellant&#x27;s second appeal to the Commission, this Commission has issued a direction on 31.10.2011 directing the appellate authority to send his remarks on the comments made by the petitioner to the Commission on 31.10.2011.  The petitioner again has filed a petition before the Commission on 20.04.2012.  Based on the petition dt.20.04.2012 today&#x27;s enquiry was conducted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">\t4.During the enquiry, the petitioner has stated that he has not received the required information from the Public Information Officer till now.  The Asst. Public Information Officer who appeared before the Commission requested two weeks time to furnish the information.  The Commission was inclined to accept the request of the Public Authority and the time requested by the APIO was granted.  But, at the same time, it was noticed that there has been a delay of 56 days by the public authority in informing the petitioner about the procedure for applying for copies.  The appellate authority has furnished this information only on 24.08.2011 for the appeal filed on 30.06.2011.  Therefore, the information shall be supplied free of cost as per <a href=\"/doc/383252/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 7(6)</a> of the R.T.I. Act, 2005.\u0014\n\nand resultantly, directed the Public Information Officer (Office of the Registrar, High Court) to furnish copies of all Diary notings and hearing records of CMSA No.10 of 2007 of Madras High Court, to the Respondent (Petitioner/Appellant), free of cost, by 11.07.2012 and report compliance to the Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\t3.Assailing the correctness of the orders dated 02.07.2012 in Case No.40997/Enquiry/A/2011, passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Registrar General, High Court, submits that the impugned orders dated 02.07.2012 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission are void ab initio, because of the fact that the said orders are in negation of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t4.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urges before this Court that the impugned orders, dated 02.07.2012, have been passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, without considering the fact that the information sought for by the respondent is barred, as per the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t5.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner projects an argument that information sought for by the Respondent is covered under the Rules of the High Court, Madras, Appellate Side, 1965.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"79225691\" id=\"span_1\">6.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the request of the petitioner in regard to the copy of the Mediation report in the matter of SLP (Civil) 19109 of 2009, Supreme Court Letter No.D.No.2796/XII/2009, dated 22nd April 2010 and the copy of the Mediation report in the matter of CMSA No.10 of 2007 on the file of this Court Letter No.File No.349/2007, dated 28th Nov. 2007, cannot be furnished to the Respondent/Petitioner, because of the fact that the Honourable Supreme Court in the decision Moti Ram (dead) through <a href=\"/doc/79225691/\" id=\"a_5\">Lrs and another v. Ashok Kumar and another</a>, (2011) 1 Supreme Court Cases 466, at Page 467, has clearly held that the discussions and proposals in regard to the mediation should not be disclosed.  Further, it is observed that if the happenings in the mediation proceedings are disclosed, it will destroy the confidentiality of the mediation process.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\t7.In support of the contention that the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, which passed the impugned orders dated 02.07.2012, need not be a party to the proceedings before this Court in W.P.No.23448 of 2012, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/High Court relies on the order dated 12.02.2010 passed by this Court between N.Velayutham and another v. The Registrar, Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai-18 and 3 others, wherein in Paragraph 10 and 11, it is observed and laid down as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\u001310.Before closing the case it must be noted that whenever a person challenges the order of the State or Central Information Commission, it is not necessary to make the Commission a party to the writ petition. The Commission is a statutory appellate authority and is expected to function within the four corners of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a>. If its orders are under challenge, the Commission is not expected to defend it. In a writ for certiorari the order will have to speak for itself. If the Commission is made as a party, it will be an unnecessary drain on the Commission to engage counsel to defend its orders. In no case a court is expected to defend its decisions. More often, the Commission&#x27;s orders are challenged by the Government departments or information officers at the expense of the Government. In these cases, the applicant who sought the information will be a party and will be expected to defend his request. \t\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t11.Only for the purpose of calling for records or sending a copy of the order, the Information Commission need not be made as a party. If the persons who do not file proper records, then a notice may be sent by the Registry to call for the records if ordered by the courts. Likewise, on complicated matters if any legal assistance is required, the Court can appoint an &#x27;amicus curiae&#x27; to help the Court. The orders of the Court on all matters involving the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">Right to Information Act</a>, as a matter of routine, can be marked to the appropriate Commission. The Registry shall henceforth must ask the counsel who files writ petitions to delete the Information Commission from the array of parties. This will not only reduce the paper work and administrative difficulties faced by the Commission, besides saving them draining their meagre resources.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\t8.The Respondent/Petitioner (Party-in-person) submits that he filed Petition HMOP No.32 of 2002 (under <a href=\"/doc/1474007/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 13(1)(ia)</a> and (iii) of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_9\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1995</a> \u0016 on the file of the Learned Subordinate Judge, Poonamallee) for divorce on the ground of cruelty and insanity against his wife, during March 2002 and ultimately, the petition has been dismissed on 02.09.2005.  Subsequently, he preferred an Appeal before this Court and he was asked to file the same before the District Court, Chengalpattu and the said case was transferred to the Fast Track Court, Poonamallee and that the Appellate Court allowed his petition and granted the relief of divorce on 26.10.2006.  However, in Second Appeal filed by his wife, this Court, on 22.12.2008, reversed the Decree of the divorce granted by the First Appellate Court.  Furthermore, he was informed by the Registrar that his entire case file was missing and when his Advocate approached the Registrar about the non-listing of his case for a long time and finally, the orders were reserved in the middle of September 2008 and subsequently, the orders were pronounced.

As already noticed, in the United Kingdom, the Information Rights Tribunal and the Information  Commissioners are to deal with the matters arising from both, the FOIA as well as the Data Protection Act, 1998. These tribunals are discharging quasi judicial functions. Appointments to them are dealt with and controlled by the TCEA. These appointments are treated as judicial appointments and are covered under Part 2 of the TCEA. Section 50 provides for the eligibility conditions for judicial appointment. Section 50(1)(b) refers to a person who satisfies the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on an N-year basis. A person satisfies that condition on N-year basis if (a) the person has a relevant qualification and (b) the total length of the person\u0012s qualifying periods is at least N years. Section 52 provides for the meaning of the expression \u0011gain experience in law\u0012 appearing in Section 50(3)(b). It states that a person gains experience in law during a period if the period is one during which the person is engaged in law-related activities. The essence of these statutory provisions is that the concerned person under that law is required to possess both a degree as well as experience in the legal field. Such experience inevitably relates to working in that field. Only then, the twin criteria of requisite qualification and experience can be satisfied.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t91. It may be of some relevance here to note that in UK, the Director in the office of the Government Information Service, an authority created under the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_63\">Freedom of Information Act, 2000</a> possesses a degree of law and has been a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia and North Carolina in UK. The Principal Judge of Information Rights Jurisdiction in the First-tier Tribunal, not only had a law degree but were also retired solicitors or barristers in private practice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t92. Thus, there exists a definite requirement for appointing persons to these posts with legal background and acumen so as to ensure complete faith and confidence of the public in the independent functioning of the Information Commission and for fair and expeditious performance of its functions. The Information Commissions are required to discharge their functions and duties strictly in accordance with law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\t93. In India, in terms of sub-Section (5), besides being a person of eminence in public life, the necessary qualification required for appointment as Chief Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner is that the person should have wide knowledge and experience in law and other specified fields. The term \u0011experience in law\u0012 is an expression of wide connotation. It presupposes that a person should have the requisite qualification in law as well as experience in the field of law. However, it is worthwhile to note that having a qualification in law is not equivalent to having experience in law and vice-versa. \u0011Experience in law\u0012, thus, is an expression of composite content and would take within its ambit both the requisite qualification in law as well as experience in the field of law. A person may have some experience in the field of law without possessing the requisite qualification. That certainly would not serve the requirement and purpose of the Act of 2005, keeping in view the nature of the functions and duties required to be performed by the Information Commissioners. Experience in absence of basic qualification would certainly be insufficient in its content and would not satisfy the requirements of the said provision. Wide knowledge in a particular field would, by necessary implication, refer to the knowledge relatable to education in such field whereas experience would necessarily relate to the experience attained by doing work in such field. Both must be read together in order to satisfy the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_64\">Sections 12(5)</a> of and 15(5) the Act of 2005. Similarly, wide knowledge and experience in other fields would have to be construed as experience coupled with basic educational qualification in that field.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t94. Primarily it may depend upon the language of the rules which govern the service but it can safely be stated as a rule that experience in a given post or field may not necessarily satisfy the condition of prescribed qualification of a diploma or a degree in such field. Experience by working in a post or by practice in the respective field even for long time cannot be equated with the basic or the prescribed qualification. In absence of a specific language of the provision, it is not feasible for a person to have experience in the field of law without possessing a degree in law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"732151\" id=\"span_5\">In somewhat different circumstances, this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/732151/\" id=\"a_65\">State of Madhya Pradesh v. Dharam Bir</a> [(1998) 6 SCC 165], while dealing with Rule 8(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Training (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1985, took the view that the stated qualification for the post of Principal Class I or Principal Class II were also applicable to appointment by promotion and that the applicability of such qualification is not restricted to direct appointments. Before a person becomes eligible for being promoted to the post of Principal, Class II or Principal, Class-I, he must possess a Degree or Diploma in Engineering, as specified in the Schedule. The fact that the person had worked as a Principal for a decade would not lead to a situation of accepting that the person was qualified to hold the post. The Court held as under :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\t\u001332. \u0013Experience\u0014 gained by the respondent on account of his working on the post in question for over a decade cannot be equated with educational qualifications required to be possessed by a candidate as a condition of eligibility for promotion to higher posts. If the Government, in exercise of its executive power, has created certain posts, it is for it to prescribe the mode of appointment or the qualifications which have to be possessed by the candidates before they are appointed on those posts. The qualifications would naturally vary with the nature of posts or the service created by the Government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t33. The post in question is the post of Principal of the Industrial Training Institute. The Government has prescribed a Degree or Diploma in Engineering as the essential qualification for this post. No one who does not possess this qualification can be appointed on this post. The educational qualification has a direct nexus with the nature of the post. The Principal may also have an occasion to take classes and teach the students. A person who does not hold either a Degree or Diploma in Engineering cannot possibly teach the students of the Industrial Training Institute the technicalities of the subject of Engineering and its various branches.\u0014\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t95. Thus, in our opinion, it is clear that experience in the respective field referred to in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act of 2005 would be an experience gained by the person upon possessing the basic qualification in that field. Of course, the matter may be somewhat different where the field itself does not prescribe any degree or appropriate course. But it would be applicable for the fields like law, engineering, science and technology, management, social service and journalism, etc.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t96. This takes us to discuss the kind of duties and responsibilities that such high post is expected to perform. Their functions are adjudicatory in nature. They are required to give notice to the parties, offer them the opportunity of hearing and pass reasoned orders. The orders of the appellate authority and the Commission have to be supported by adequate reasoning as they grant relief to one party, despite opposition by the other or reject the request for information made in exercise of a statutory right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\t97. It is not only appropriate but is a solemn duty of every adjudicatory body, including the tribunals, to state the reasons in support of its decisions. Reasoning is the soul of a judgment and embodies one of the three pillars on which the very foundation of natural justice jurisprudence rests. It is informative to the claimant of the basis for rejection of his claim, as well as provides the grounds for challenging the order before the higher authority/ constitutional court. The reasons, therefore, enable the authorities, before whom an order is challenged, to test the veracity and correctness of the impugned order. In the present times, since the fine line of distinction between the functioning of the administrative and quasi-judicial bodies is gradually becoming faint, even the administrative bodies are required to pass reasoned orders. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508507\" id=\"span_6\">In this regard, reference can be made to the judgments of this Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/1508507/\" id=\"a_67\">Siemens Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Co. of India Ltd. v. Union of India &amp; Anr.</a> [(1976) 2 SCC 981]; and Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax Department Works Contract and Leasing, Kota v. Shukla &amp; Brothers [(2010) 4 SCC 785].</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\t98. The Chief Information Commissioner and members of the Commission are required to possess wide knowledge and experience in the respective fields. They are expected to be well versed with the procedure that they are to adopt while performing the adjudicatory and quasi judicial functions in accordance with the statutory provisions and the scheme of the Act of 2005. They are to examine whether the information required by an applicant falls under any of the exemptions stated under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_69\">Second Schedule of the Act</a> of 2005. Some of the exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a>, particularly, sub-sections (e), (g) and (j) have been very widely worded by the Legislature keeping in mind the need to afford due protection to privacy, national security and the larger public interest. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 8(1)(e)</a>, (f), (g), (h) and (i), the authority is required to record a definite satisfaction whether disclosure of information would be in the larger public interest or whether it would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of the offenders and whether it would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual. All these functions may be performed by a legally trained mind more efficaciously. The most significant function which may often be required to be performed by these authorities is to strike a balance between the application of the freedom guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the rights protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In other words, the deciding authority ought to be conscious of the constitutional concepts which hold significance while determining the rights of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the statute and the Constitution. The legislative scheme of the Act of 2005 clearly postulates passing of a reasoned order in light of the above. A reasoned order would help the parties to question the correctness of the order effectively and within the legal requirements of the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\t99. \u0011Persons of eminence in public life\u0012 is also an expression of wide implication and ramifications. It takes in its ambit all requisites of a good citizen with values and having a public image of contribution to the society. Such person should have understanding of concepts of public interest and public good. Most importantly, such person should have contributed to the society through social or allied works. The authorities cannot lose sight of the fact that ingredients of institutional integrity would be applicable by necessary implication to the Commissions and their members. This discussion safely leads us to conclude that the functions of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners may be better performed by a legally qualified and trained mind possessing the requisite experience. The same should also be applied to the designation of the first appellate authority, i.e., the senior officers to be designated at the Centre and State levels. However, in view of language of Section 94 <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_74\">5</a>, it may not be necessary to apply this principle to the designation of Public Information Officer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">\t100.Moreover, as already noticed, the Information Commission, is performing quasi-judicial functions and essence of its adjudicatory powers is akin to the Court system. It also possesses the essential trappings of a Court and discharges the functions which have immense impact on the rights/obligations of the parties. Thus, it must be termed as a judicial Tribunal which requires to be manned by a person of judicial mind, expertise and experience in that field. This Court, while dealing with the cases relating to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution has observed that every provision of the Constitution, can be amended provided in the result, the basic structure of the Constitution remains the same. The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights contained in Part III of the Constitution and their protection itself has been treated as the basic structure of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\t101. Besides separation of powers, the independence of judiciary is of fundamental constitutional value in the structure of our Constitution. Impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in judicial decision making are the hallmarks of the Judiciary. If \u0011Impartiality\u0012 is the soul of Judiciary, `Independence&#x27; is the life blood of Judiciary. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive, as this Court stated in the case of Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association [(2010) 11 SCC 17].\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\t102. The independence of judiciary stricto sensu applies to the Court system. Thus, by necessary implication, it would also apply to the tribunals whose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the court system. The entire administration of justice system has to be so independent and managed by persons of legal acumen, expertise and experience that the persons demanding justice must not only receive justice, but should also have the faith that justice would be done.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">\t103. The above detailed analysis leads to an ad libitum conclusion that under the provisions and scheme of the Act of 2005, the persons eligible for appointment should be of public eminence, with knowledge and experience in the specified fields and should preferably have a judicial background. They should possess judicial acumen and experience to fairly and effectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would come up for determination before the Commission, in its day-to-day working. The Commission satisfies abecedarians of a judicial tribunal which has the trappings of a court. It will serve the ends of justice better, if the Information Commission was manned by persons of legal expertise and with adequate experience in the field of adjudication. We may further clarify that such judicial members could work individually or in Benches of two, one being a judicial member while the other being a qualified person from the specified fields to be called an expert member. Thus, in order to satisfy the test of constitutionality, we will have to read into <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act that the expression \u0011knowledge and experience\u0012 includes basic degree in that field and experience gained thereafter and secondly that legally qualified, trained and experienced persons would better administer justice to the people, particularly when they are expected to undertake an adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and niceties of law. Such appreciation and application of legal principles is a sine qua non to the determinative functioning of the Commission as it can tilt the balance of justice either way. Malcolm Gladwell said, \u0013the key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former.  We are lacking in the latter\u0014. The requirement of a judicial mind for manning the judicial tribunal is a well accepted discipline in all the major international jurisdictions with hardly with any exceptions. Even if the intention is to not only appoint people with judicial background and expertise, then the most suitable and practical resolution would be that a \u0011judicial member\u0012 and an \u0011expert member\u0012 from other specified fields should constitute a Bench and perform the functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2005. Such an approach would further the mandate of the statute by resolving the legal issues as well as other serious issues like an inbuilt conflict between the Right to Privacy and Right to Information while applying the balancing principle and other incidental controversies. We would clarify that participation by qualified persons from other specified fields would be a positive contribution in attainment of the proper administration of justice as well as the object of the Act of 2005. Such an approach would help to withstand the challenge to the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 12(5)</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">\t104. As a natural sequel to the above, the question that comes up for consideration is as to what procedure should be adopted to make appointments to this august body. <a href=\"/doc/372537/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 12(3)</a> states about the High-powered Committee, which has to recommend the names for appointment to the post of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners to the President. However, this Section, and any other provision for that matter, is entirely silent as to what procedure for appointment should be followed by this High Powered Committee. Once we have held that it is a judicial tribunal having the essential trappings of a court, then it must, as an irresistible corollary, follow that the appointments to this august body are made in consultation with the judiciary. In the event, the Government is of the opinion and desires to appoint not only judicial members but also experts from other fields to the Commission in terms of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act of 2005, then it may do so, however, subject to the riders stated in this judgment. To ensure judicial independence, effective adjudicatory process and public confidence in the administration of justice by the Commission, it would be necessary that the Commission is required to work in Benches. The Bench should consist of one judicial member and the other member from the specified fields in terms of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act of 2005. It will be incumbent and in conformity with the scheme of the Act that the appointments to the post of judicial member are made \u0011in consultation\u0012 with the Chief Justice of India in case of Chief Information Commissioner and members of the Central Information Commission and the Chief Justices of the High Courts of the respective States, in case of the State Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners of that State Commission. In the case of appointment of members to the respective Commissions from other specified fields, the DoPT in the Centre and the concerned Ministry in the States should prepare a panel, after due publicity, empanelling the names proposed at least three times the number of vacancies existing in the Commission. Such panel should be prepared on a rational basis, and should inevitably form part of the records. The names so empanelled, with the relevant record should be placed before the said High Powered Committee. In furtherance to the recommendations of the High Powered Committee, appointments to the Central and State Information Commissions should be made by the competent authority. Empanelment by the DoPT and other competent authority has to be carried on the basis of a rational criteria, which should be duly reflected by recording of appropriate reasons. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79225691\" id=\"span_7\">The advertisement issued by such agency should not be restricted to any particular class of persons stated under <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 12(5)</a>, but must cover persons from all fields. Complete information, material and comparative data of the empanelled persons should be made available to the High Powered Committee. Needless to mention that the High Powered Committee itself has to adopt a fair and transparent process for consideration of the empanelled persons for its final recommendation. This approach, is in no way innovative but is merely derivative of the mandate and procedure stated by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/79225691/\" id=\"a_81\">L. Chandra Kumar</a> (supra) wherein the Court dealt with similar issues with regard to constitution of the Central Administrative Tribunal. All concerned are expected to keep in mind that the Institution is more important than an individual.

Giving effect to the above scheme would not only further the cause of the Act but would attain greater efficiency, and accuracy in the decision-making process, which in turn would serve the larger public purpose.

The case on hand raises important questions of constitutional importance relating to the position of Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice of India under the Constitution and the independence of the Judiciary in the scheme of the Constitution on the one hand and on the other, fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. Right to information is an integral part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_93\">Right to Information Act</a> merely recognizes the constitutional right of citizens to freedom of speech and expression. Independence of Judiciary forms part of basic structure of the Constitution of India. The independence of Judiciary and the fundamental right to free speech and expression are of a great value and both of them are required to be balanced.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t13.The Constitution is fundamentally a public text-the monumental character of a Government and the people-and Supreme Court is required to apply it to resolve public controversies. For, from our beginnings, a most important consequence of the constitutionally created separation of powers has been the Indian habit, extraordinary to other democracies, of casting social, economic, philosophical and political questions in the form of public law remedies, in an attempt to secure ultimate resolution by the Supreme Court. In this way, important aspects of the most fundamental issues confronting our democracy finally arrive in the Supreme Court for judicial determination.  Not infrequently, these are the issues upon which contemporary society is most deeply divided. They arouse our deepest emotions. This is one such controversy. William J.

For the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs. What the constitutional fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times cannot be the measure to the vision of our time. Similarly, what those fundamentals mean for us, our descendants will learn, cannot be the measure to the vision of their time. This realization is not, I assure you, a novel one of my own creation.

At the risk of repetition, we pertinently point out that Clause 37 of the Letters Patent confers power on this Court (High Court of Madras) from time to time to make rules and orders for the purpose of regulating all proceedings in civil cases which may be brought before this Court, etc.,  Also, we bear in mind Order XII Rules 1 and 2 of this Court&#x27;s Appellate Side Rules, 1965 which permits any party to obtain certified copies as mentioned thereunder.  Therefore, we are of the considered view that the Respondent/Petitioner (Husband) is entitled to receive copies of Diary notings, hearing records of CMSA No.10 of 2007, copies of Grounds of Appeal in CMSA No.10 of 2007, Cross Objection No.48 of 2007, Common Order in CMSA No.10 of 2007 and Cross Objection No.48 of 2007, dated 22.12.2008, only under the relevant provisions of the Rules of High Court, Madras (Appellate Side), 1965.
