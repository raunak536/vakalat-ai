Yes\n       3. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes\n\nGITA MITTAL, J\n\n1.      The present application displays a blatant refusal by a party to the\n\nlitigation to comply with the court direction made in accordance with law\n\nto   furnish a       blood sample       for   DNA testing   which   would enable\n\nauthoritative adjudication on the real issue in the matter.              For this\n\npurpose, the defendant no. 1 has filed IA No. 10394/2011 dated 30th\n\nMay, 2011 seeking the following prayers :-\n\n               &quot;(a) direct the plaintiff or the learned Deputy Registrar of\n               this court or any other authority or officer not to pressurize,\n               coerce, compel or force the petitioner in any manner to\n               involuntarily provide blood and/or tissue sample for DNA\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                 1\n                analysis.\n               (b) Direct that till the abovementioned prayer is finally\n               considered by this court, the order of the learned Deputy\n               Registrar directing the applicant to deliver blood sample on\n               1.6.2011 may kindly be deferred or kept in abeyance.&quot;\n\n2.     Before considering the application on the merits of the submissions\n\nmade before this court, it is necessary to consider certain essential facts\n\nwhich emerge from the record.\n\nFactual Narration\n\n3.     The plaintiff has filed the suit inter alia seeking declaration that the\n\nplaintiff is the naturally born son of the defendants and that the defendant\n\nno.1 is the father of the plaintiff. It is asserted that, though he was born\n\nto Smt. Ujjwala Sharma, defendant no. 1 whilst her marriage to Sh. B. P.\n\nSharma subsisted, the plaintiff was not born from their wedlock.\n\nReliance in this behalf has been placed on the report of blood samples\n\ndrawn from Shri B.P. Sharma and DNA profiling which have been\n\ncompared with the DNA profiling of the plaintiff‟s blood sample which\n\nreport reflects that Sh.B.P. Sharma cannot be his (the plaintiff‟s)\n\nbiological father. Besides the report, the plaintiff also relies upon a joint\n\naffidavit by himself and Sh.B.P. Sharma stating that such blood samples\n\nwere furnished voluntarily and the admission by Sh.B.P. Sharma in the\n\ndivorce petition filed by him and Smt. Ujjawala Sharma-defendant no.2.\n\n4.     The plaintiff has categorically asserted that he was born from an\n\nextramarital relationship between the defendants.         In this regard, he\n\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                               2\n places reliance on the proximity between the parties in the plaint and\n\nrelies on photographs which according to the plaintiff manifest that the\n\ndefendants as well as the plaintiff shared an intimate relationship. In her\n\nwritten statement the defendant no.2-the plaintiff‟s biological mother\n\nsupports the plaintiff.\n\n5.     The defendant no. 1 does not dispute that the plaintiff is the\n\nbiological son of the defendant no.2, but denies relationship or intimacy\n\nwith her as well as the plaintiff.\n\n6.     During the pendency of the suit, the plaintiff filed IA No. 4720/2008\n\non 11th April, 2008 seeking a direction to the defendant no. 1 to submit\n\nto DNA testing. This application though opposed by the defendant no.1,\n\nwas allowed by the detailed judgment dated 23rd December, 2010\n\nwherein the court inter alia rejected the pleas of the defendant no.1 that\n\nthe birth of the plaintiff on 15th February, 1979 during the subsistence of\n\nthe marriage of Dr. Ujjawala Sharma and Sh. B.P. Sharma invited an\n\nabsolute presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n7.     The following directions were issued by the judgment dated 23rd\n\nDecember, 2010 :-\n\n           &quot;45. In view of the above conclusions, the application has\n           to succeed. The parties or their counsel are directed to\n           appear before the Joint Registrar on 8th February, 2011.\n           The Joint Registrar shall obtain particulars and details to\n           facilitate the DNA testing of the first defendant; the said\n           defendant is directed to furnish such sample on a date and\n           time to be designated by the Joint Registrar, by taking or\n           drawing appropriate samples after ascertaining the details\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                            3\n            from the concerned accredited agency i.e. Centre for\n           Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology (Constituent Laboratory of the\n           Council of Scientific Industrial Research, Government of\n           India, Habsiguda Uppal Road, Hyderabad - 500 007,\n           Andhra Pradesh, India. The said institution shall furnish\n           the report to this Court within six weeks of receiving the\n           samples.‖\n\n8.     The defendant no.1‟s challenge to the order dated 23rd December,\n\n2010 by way of an appeal being FAO(OS) No. 44/2011 was dismissed by\n\nthe judgment dated 7th February, 2011.\n\n9.     The defendant no. 1 has assailed the judgments dated 23rd\n\nDecember, 2010 and 7th February, 2011 before the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia by way of a special leave petition being SLP (Civil) No. 5756/2011.\n\nIn the present application, the defendant no.1 admits that by the order\n\ndated 18th March, 2011 notice has been issued in SLP(Civil) No.\n\n5756/2011 filed before the Supreme Court, however the defendant no.1‟s\n\nprayer for stay stands rejected.\n\n10.    The present application has been filed by the defendant no.1 on the\n\nsubmission &quot;that the plaintiff had not placed any material which could in\n\nany manner indicate that the plaintiff was the son of the defendant\n\nherein&quot;.      The defendant no. 1 has premised the application on a\n\nreproduction of <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_2\">section 4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_3\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n       The defendant no. 1 has put forth the following reasons for the\n\napplication :-\n\n(i) no useful purpose would be served to subject defendant no.1 to the\n\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                          4\n test\n\n(ii) final relief cannot be granted to the plaintiff because of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 112</a> of\n\nthe Evidence Act\n\n(iii) no sample can be obtained from the defendant no. 1 per force\n\nwithout his express consent or else it would violate fundamental rights of\n\nthe defendant no.1 protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n(iv) for the above reasons, not to pressurise, coerce or force the\n\ndefendant no. 1 to provide blood and/or tissue sample for DNA testing\n\n11.    The defendant no. 1 has also placed reliance on the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in (2001) 5 SCC 311 Kanti Devi vs. Poshi Ram on the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_6\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. Sh. B.U. Barqi, Advocate\n\nappearing on behalf of defendant no.1 has further contended that despite\n\nthe directions made by the court, the defendant no. 1 cannot be called\n\nupon to give his sample.              He has sought to urge that the same is the\n\ncorrect reading of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in AIR 1993\n\nSC 2295 Goutam Kundu vs. State of West Bengal and AIR 2003 SC\n\n3450 Sharda vs. Dharmpal. Placing reliance on the observations of the\n\nApex Court in para 18 of the judgment in Goutam Kundu (supra), it has\n\nbeen argued that not only could the defendant no.1 be not compelled to\n\ngive samples but also no adverse inference could be drawn against him\n\nfor not doing so.\n\n       Learned counsel categorically submits that in view of law laid down\n\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                5\n in (2010) 7 SCC 263 Selvi vs. State of Karnataka, no sample could be\n\nobtained from the defendant no.1 per force without his express consent.\n\n12.    Mr. P.H. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing for the plaintiff\n\nhas    contended       that    no     reply   to   this   application   was   necessary.\n\nConsequently learned counsels were orally heard in the matter on this\n\napplication. Learned senior counsel urges at great length that given the\n\njudicial pronouncements of the Supreme Court and the adjudication by\n\nthis court in the judgment dated 23rd December, 2010, the defendant\n\nno.1 has no option in the matter.\n\n13.    Opposing this application, Mr. Patwalia, has further contended that\n\nthe application is malafide and an abuse of the process of the court. It is\n\nvehemently urged that the order passed by this court has been sustained\n\nin appeal and even the Supreme Court has refused stay thereof to the\n\ndefendant no.1.          It is urged that directions having been made, the\n\ndefendant no.1 has no option but to comply with the same unless the\n\ndirection is modified or stayed by the court.                    It is urged that the\n\ndefendant has to be forcibly confined and a sample compulsorily extracted\n\nfrom him.\n\n14.    Right at the outset it was pointed out to counsel for the defendant\n\nno. 1 that the pleas on which the present application is premised have\n\nbeen heard, considered and rejected by the judgments dated 23rd\n\nDecember, 2010 and 7th February, 2011 and that it was not open for the\n\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                        6\n defendant no. 1 to re-agitate the issues which stand decided.\n\n       Mr.    Burqi     has    insisted   that   he   wishes   to   deal   with   three\n\npronouncements of the Supreme Court which have not been placed or\n\nconsidered before this court for the purposes of the defendant no.1‟s\n\nsubmission that he cannot be compelled to provide a sample for DNA\n\ntesting.\n\n15.    This application therefore raises the question as to whether a\n\nperson can be physically compelled to give a blood sample for DNA\n\nprofiling in compliance with a civil court order in a paternity action? If it\n\nwere held that the same was permissible, how is the court to mould its\n\norder and what would be the modalities for drawing the involuntary\n\nsample?       The justifiability of the refusal has to be tested against the\n\nplaintiff‟s rights which are involved.           As a corollary, the impact of the\n\naffect of a refusal to comply with the court direction has to be answered.\n\nIn case an adverse inference was to be drawn, what is the nature of the\n\ninference?      The role of the court in discovering the truth having made the\n\ndirections, and the parameters of exercise of jurisdiction by a civil court\n\nare also in issue.\n\nWhether the judicial pronouncements in AIR 1993 SC 2295\nGoutam Kundu vs. State of West Bengal; AIR 2003 SC 3450\nSharda vs. Dharmpal; (2001) 5 SCC 311 Kanti Devi &amp; Anr. Vs.\nPoshi Ram have been overlooked\n\n16.    First and foremost, it is necessary to deal with the misconceived\n\nsubmissions of learned counsel for the applicant that prece4dents have\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                       7\n been overlooked in on the judgment dated 23rd December, 2010. Mr.\n\nBurqi has firstly submitted that this court had failed to consider the\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam\n\nKundu vs. State of West Bengal.          In this regard, I find that in the\n\norder dated 23rd December, 2010 my learned brother S. Ravindra Bhat,\n\nJ, has observed as follows :-\n\n          &quot;6. The plaintiff submits that the Court has power under\n          <a href=\"/doc/69984823/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 75 (e)</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_8\">CPC</a>) read with\n          Order-XXVI, Rule-10 (A) to issue a direction for holding a\n          scientific technical or expert investigation. It is argued that\n          the Supreme Court had in Goutam Kundu v. State of West\n          Bengal &amp; Anr., (1993) 3 SCC 418 even while sounding a\n          note of caution with regard to a court&#x27;s approach in deciding\n          such applications, had summarized the legal position in the\n          following manner: -\n               &quot;26. From the above discussion it emerges:- (1) that courts in\n               India cannot order blood test as matter of course;\n               (2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in order\n               to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot be\n               entertained.\n               (3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the\n               husband must establish non access in order to dispel the\n               presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_9\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n               (4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be the\n               consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have\n               the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as\n               an unchaste woman.\n               (5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for\n       analysis.&quot;\n               xxx\n       35. The Court would now examine if a third party (to a marriage,\n       like the first defendant here) may be compelled to undergo scientific\n       tests of the nature of giving blood samples for the purpose of DNA\n       testing. The case of Goutam Kundu (supra) provides us with\n       assistance here. In this case, the Court held that\n               &quot;1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to\n               undergo medical test.\n               2. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in\nIA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                             8\n                violation of the right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the\n               Indian Constitution.\n               3. However, the Court should exercise such a power if the\n               applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is sufficient\n               material before the Court. If despite the order of the court,\n               the respondent refuses to submit himself to medical</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">               examination, the court will be entitled to draw an adverse\n               inference against him.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">       In the order dated 23rd December, 2010, the court has thus\n\nextensively relied on the principles laid down in Goutam Kundu (supra)\n\nby the Supreme Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">17.    The judgment dated 23rd December, 2010 has also considered the\n\nlaw laid down in Sharda (supra) in the following terms :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_1\">&quot;7. The Plaintiff argues that the correct legal position was,\n               however, restated and clarified by a subsequent larger - 3\n               Judges Bench ruling reported as <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_11\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a> AIR\n               2003 SC 3450. In <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_12\">the said judgment</a>, the Court held as\n               follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                     ―39. Goutam Kundu (supra) is, therefore, not an\n                     authority    for   the    proposition   that   under    no\n                     circumstances the Court can direct that blood tests be\n                     conducted. It, having regard to the future of the child,\n                     has, of course, sounded a note of caution as regard\n                     mechanical passing of such order. In some other\n                     jurisdictions, it has been held that such directions\n                     should ordinarily be made if it is in the interest of the\n                     child.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                     xxx xxx xxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                     80.

In order to substantiate such allegation, the\n                     Petitioner would always insist on medical examination.\n                     If respondent avoids such medical examination on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                 9</span>\n                        ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or for a\n                       matter right to personal liberty as enshrined under\n                       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, and with the\n                       extensive interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                       this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be\n                       treated as absolute right. What is emphasized is that\n                       some limitations on this right have to be imposed and\n                       particularly where two competing interests clash.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in\n                              issue before the court, the use of DNA is an\n                              extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. One view\n                              is that when modern science gives means of\n                              ascertaining the paternity of a child, there should\n                              not be any hesitation to use those means\n                              whenever the occasion requires. The other view is\n                              that the court must be reluctant in use of such\n                              scientific advances and tools which result in\n                              invasion of right to privacy of an individual and\n                              may not only be prejudicial to the rights of the\n                              parties but may have devastating effect on the\n                              child. Sometimes the result of such scientific test\n                              may bastardise an innocent child even though his\n                              mother and her spouse were living together\n                              during the time of conception. In our view, when\n                              there is apparent conflict between the right to\n                              privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly\n                              to medical examination and duty of the court to\n                              reach the truth, the court must exercise its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                 10</span>\n                                discretion only after balancing the interests of the\n                               parties and on due consideration whether for a\n                               just decision in the matter, DNA is eminently\n                               needed.

There is no conflict in the two decisions of this\n                               Court, namely, Goutam Kundu (AIR 1993 SC\n                               2295: 1993 AIR SCW 2325) and Sharda (AIR\n                               2003 SC 3450: 2003 AIR SCW 1950). In Goutam\n                               Kundu, it has been laid down that courts in India\n                               cannot order blood test as a matter of course and\n                               such prayers cannot be granted to have roving\n                               inquiry; there must be strong prima facie case\n                               and court must carefully examine as to what\n                               would be the consequence of ordering the blood\n                               test. In the case of Sharda while concluding that a\n                               matrimonial court has power to order a person to\n                               undergo a medical test, it was reiterated that the\n                               court should exercise such a power if the applicant\n                               has a strong prima facie case and there is\n                               sufficient material before the court. Obviously,\n                               therefore, any order for DNA can be given by the\n                               court only if a strong prima facie case is made out\n                               for such a course. Insofar as the present case is\n                               concerned, we have already held that the State\n                               Commission has no authority, competence or\n                               power to order DNA.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_6\">18.

Essentially there are two: the character of the\n               invasion of the body and the expression of the victim&#x27;s will;\n               the latter may be manifested by physical resistance.

In that limited sense the expression of\n               the will is significant. But where there is no affirmative\n               consent, I cannot see that it should make any\n               difference whether one states unequivocally that he\n               objects or resorts to physical violence in protest or is in\n               such condition that he is unable to protest. The Court,\n               however, states that &quot;the absence of conscious consent,\n               without more, does not necessarily render the taking a\n               violation of a constitutional right.&quot; This implies that a different\n               result might follow if petitioner had been conscious and had\n               voiced his objection. I reject the distinction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">               Since there clearly was no consent to the blood test, it\n               is the nature of the invasion of the body that should be\n               determinative of the due process question here\n               presented. The Court&#x27;s opinion suggests that an\n               invasion is &quot;brutal&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; only if the police use\n               force to overcome a suspect&#x27;s resistance.

I cannot\n               accept an analysis that would make physical resistance by a\n               prisoner a prerequisite to the existence of his constitutional\n               rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">               Apart from the irrelevant factor of physical resistance, the\n               techniques used in this case and in Rochin are comparable. In\n               each the operation was performed by a doctor in a hospital. In\n               each there was an extraction of body fluids. Neither operation\n               normally causes any lasting ill effects. The Court denominates\n               a blood test as a scientific method for detecting crime and\n               cites the frequency of such tests in our everyday life. The\n               stomach pump too is a common and accepted way of making\n               tests and relieving distress. But it does not follow from the\n               fact that a technique is a product of science or is in common,\n               consensual use for other purposes that it can be used to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                  26</span>\n                extract evidence from a criminal defendant without his\n               consent. Would the taking of spinal fluid from an unconscious\n               person be condoned because such tests are commonly made\n               and might be used as a scientific aid to law enforcement?\n               Only personal reaction to the stomach pump and the blood\n               test can distinguish them. To base the restriction which the\n               Due Process Clause imposes on state criminal procedures\n               upon such reactions is to build on shifting sands. We should,\n               in my opinion, hold that due process means at least that law-\n               enforcement officers in their efforts to obtain evidence from\n               persons suspected of crime must stop short of bruising the\n               body, breaking skin, puncturing tissue or extracting body\n               fluids, whether they contemplate doing it by force or by\n               stealth.‖\n                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">47.

In the interests of the\n               general public, it is necessary for the State to identify HIV\n               positive cases and any action taken in that regard cannot be\n               termed as unconstitutional as under <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_77\">Article\n               47</a> of the Constitution, the State was under an obligation to\n               take all steps for the improvement of the public health.

By the end of 1991, 36 federal states in USA\n                      enacted legislations regarding informed consent for HIV\n                      test.

The court rejected\n\nthe argument of the counsel for the petitioner expanding the definition of\n\nthe said statutory provision regarding samples which could be taken or\n\nappointment of experts. In this pronouncement, it was ruled that medical\n\ninspections have, in some circumstances, been authorised by statute. For\n\ninstance under the Old Workman‟s Compensation Act, 1275.

On the issue\n\nof the submission of the husband‟s counsel for the operation of taking a\n\nsample of blood being of trivial character, involving no danger or\n\ndiscomfort and that the interference with the person of the wife therefore\n\nbe deminimus, the court held as follows :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">               ―If I considered this to be a sustainable contention I should\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                    44</span>\n                have wished to have medical evidence to support counsel&#x27;s\n               statement, but it is conceded that the operation involves\n               puncturing the skin and extracting some small quantity of\n               blood.

The level of privacy protection thus may also depend upon the\n\ncontext in which the established standards are applied and the manner in\n\nwhich the right to privacy is challenged.

Test in Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon,\n               Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi and Syria speaks about the\n               paternity test, wherein it is stated as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">                      ―Paternity testing requires a painless sample from\n                      both the child and possible father. Even without a\n                      sample from the mother, D.N.A. paternity test\n                      results are up to 99.9999% accurate-that&#x27;s one-\n                      in-a-million odds your results are incorrect.‖\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">               15. The above analysis clearly shows that if the mother is not\n               available, from the sample collected from the child and the\n               alleged father, the paternity test can be conducted. Thus, if\n               D.N.A. test is performed without the mother&#x27;s sample, it\n               requires additional analysis and it will take a few days longer\n               to complete the same. However, the accuracy of the results\n               will not be affected.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">               16. The above discussions make it very clear that it is not\n               always necessary to conduct D.N.A. test on both the alleged\n               father and mother and the D.N.A. test performed on the\n               father will also show whether a particular child was born to\n               the person on whom such test has been performed. While so,\n               the argument advanced on the side of the petitioner that\n               without conducting D.N.A. test on the second respondent, the\n               alleged mother of the first respondent, there will be no useful\n               purpose, by directing the petitioner alone to subject himself\n               for D.N.A. test, is totally erroneous. In the fast technology\n               development in scientific field, it is nothing wrong in directing\n               a person to undergo D.N.A. test, which will enable the Court\n               to arrive at a proper conclusion. Furthermore, the petitioner,\n               who asserts that he had no relationship with the second\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                60</span>\n                respondent and the first respondent was not born to him, to\n               prove his assertion, can very well subject himself for the said\n               test to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt. In fact, the\n               test result will amply prove his case also.‖\n                                        (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">111. Reliability of the scientific evidence depends upon three factors; the\n\nvalidity of the underlying scientific principle ; the validity of the technique\n\napplying the principle ; and the proper application of the technique on a\n\nparticular occasion.           Each individual has an entirely unique genetic\n\nsignature (except in the case of identical twins) derived from DNA\n\nconfiguration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">112. DNA profiling has been statutorily recognized in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_150\">Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure</a> and the aforenoticed judicial precedents as reliable\n\nscientific evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">113. Value is attached to genetic finger printing and DNA profiling as it\n\nwould be difficult for the suspect or the person being tested to harder to\n\nfabricate with the evidence.          It is therefore difficult to undermine the\n\nvalue of the test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">114. DNA fingerprinting has thus established high specificity, has\n\nextraordinary probative properties and is statutorily recognised.          DNA\n\nsamples can be obtained from blood; tissue; pulled head hair samples\n\nwith intact roots; fingernail clippings; bone marrow; tooth pulp; dried\n\nblood stains and biopsy samples. Genetic fingerprinting falls outside the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination and is within the parameters of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                61</span>\n reasonable search and seizures provided there exists the element of\n\ncooperation as required for the purposes of taking, say,        a blood or a\n\nsemen sample.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">115. The above narration adequately establishes the unimpeachable\n\nimportance and value attached to the affirmative nature of the results of\n\nDNA profiling in a case where parentage is in issue. The refusal of the\n\ndefendant no. 1 to furnish the sample and its consequence have tobe\n\ntested against these standards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">116. An issue of paternity may be established in three ways. Firstly, in\n\naccordance with the marital presumption rule (<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 112</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act); (or,) recognition of the paternity by the party; or, lastly by\n\na judicial determination of paternity. The instant case is of the third kind.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">117. From the above discussion, it is manifest that there is no difficulty if\n\nthe person consents to the taking of intimate bodily samples.          If the\n\nspecimen had been obtained and the results indicate that the alleged\n\nfather is the father of the child, a presumption of paternity is created.\n\nSuch presumption can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat the results of the genetic test are not reliable in that particular case.\n\nDifficulty arises if the taking of the sample is refused. The same may be\n\nfor genuine or good causes or without.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">118. In the case before the Family Division of England reported at 1988\n\n(22) All ER 500 McVeigh v. Beattie, the appellant had resisted the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                              62</span>\n application for blood test on which nevertheless directions for the test\n\nwere made. The appellant subsequently indicated that he was not willing\n\nto submit himself to blood tests if there was a further application for a\n\nblood test direction.         As the appellant did not submit to the blood test\n\nwhen further direction was made, the trial judges drew the inference that\n\nthe appellant failed to comply with the blood test directions because he\n\nhad sexual intercourse with the respondent and he knew that the blood\n\ntest would show that he was probably the father of the respondent‟s child.\n\nWood, J considered the question as &quot;Was the appellant&#x27;s failure or refusal\n\nto comply with the blood test direction evidence which was &#x27;other\n\nevidence&#x27;, i.e. capable of construing corroboration of the complainant&#x27;s\n\ncase that it was the appellant who was the father of her child or, to use\n\nthe words of Sellers LJ in Simpson v. Collinson (1964) 1 All ER 262 at p.\n\n267, was it evidence that shows or tends to show the story is true.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">       It was stated by Wood, J. that it has been held that a report of a\n\nblood test relating to the party could constitute corroborative evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">119. In the context of refusal by an adult party to submit to a blood test,\n\nthe observations of Lord Denning MR in the judgment reported at 1968\n\n(1) All ER 20 entitled Re L at 26 (1969) p 119 at 159 shed valuable light\n\nand deserve to be considered in extenso:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"682973\" id=\"span_106\">&quot;Both counsel for the husband and counsel for the wife felt\n               bound to concede that, under these sections, the Court could\n               not order an adult to submit to a blood test. A blood test\n               which involves the insertion of a needle is an assault, unless\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                               63</span>\n           consented to. It would need express statutory authority to\n          require an adult to submit to it. ((1963) 2 All ER 841\n          (1964) P. 67). If these sections do not authorise the court to\n          order an adult to have his blood tested, I do not see that they\n          authorise the court to make such an order in the case of an\n          infant. A test of the child&#x27;s blood would be useless unless\n          there were tests of the adults also. But, I would say this. If\n          an adult unreasonably refuses to have a blood test, or to\n          allow a child to have one, I think that it is open to the court in\n          any civil proceedings (no matter whether it be a paternity\n          issue or an affiliation summons, or a custody\n          proceeding) to treat his refusal as evidence against\n          him, and may draw an inference therefrom adverse to\n          him. This is simply common sense. It is in keeping with the\n          rule that in a nullity case, if a party refuses to be medically\n          examined, the court may infer that some impediment exists\n          pointing to incapacity (see <a href=\"/doc/682973/\" id=\"a_152\">W. v.

The test applicable to determine the nature\n                       and extent of the corroboration is the same whether the\n                       case falls within the rule of common law or within that\n                       class of offences for which corroboration is required by\n                       statute.

In certain cases,\n                       where it is contrary to the interest of a minor, the Court\n                       may not make a blood-test direction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_139\">                       (2) The Court cannot order an adult to submit to blood-\n                       test.

If, therefore, in a case it is shown that a\n               person     wrongfully       withholds      evidence,      every\n               presumption to his disadvantage consistent with the\n               facts admitted or proved can be raised against him or\n               her. This section, amongst other things, therefore,\n               enables the Court to draw an adverse inference against\n               a party who refuses to produce a document in his\n               possession. Similarly, it enables the Court to draw a\n               presumption against a person who can make evidence\n               available to the Court but obstructs the availability of\n               such evidence. If, therefore, a person in a case refuses\n               to submit to a medical examination where the whole\n               case depends on the state of his or her mind and body,\n               I think that it would be open to the Court to draw an\n               adverse inference or presumption against such a\n               person.

Individuals\n\nhave different sensibilities.         Non-cooperation or refusal to supply the\n\nbodily sample may be the outcome of fear or embarrassment or even\n\nanger.       Ignorance about the testing procedure or an outcome or\n\napprehension about the accuracy of the outcome may also result in non-\n\ncooperation.       In these circumstances, the refusal may always not be\n\nbecause of guilt or machiavellin motives.

On 1st June, 2011 when all parties, including Dr. Preeti\n\nRai from the dispensary of the Government of NCT of Delhi in the High\n\nCourt were present to take the samples before the Joint Registrar, the\n\nfollowing statement was made by counsel for the defendant no.1\n\n                ―Learned counsel for defendant no.1 states that the\n               defendant no. 1 has not come to the court today and he has\n               also moved an application vide diary no.84071 on 30.05.2011\n               with the prayer that the defendant no.1         may not be\n               pressurized to give his blood samples.

It\n\nwas also put to the defendant no. 1 that if acceptable to the laboratory,\n\nany bodily sample (other than the blood sample) which include, hair,\n\nsaliva, nails etc could be given by him. Such an option was given to the\n\ndefendant no.1 on the premise that the DNA analysis could be carried out\n\non samples obtained from such samples as well. Learned counsel for the\n\ndefendant no. 1 categorically stated that the defendant no.1 was not\n\nwilling to give any such sample.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">152.

The DNA profiling is a modern scientific method which has been\n\naccepted in all jursidictions for the purposes of conclusively identifying\n\nparents.     Given the evidentiary value of a DNA profiling especially in a\n\npaternity case, the refusal by the defendant no.1 to give his bodily sample\n\nwould really have the effect of frustrating the importance of the test.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">159.

It is in the pleadings of the parties that the wife of the defendant\n\nno. 1 expired in 1993.                Given the criminal law in India, even if any\n\ncriminality could be attached to the alleged relationship between the\n\ndefendants, the only person who could have made a complaint foisting\n\ncriminality in respect thereof upon the defendant no. 1 was his deceased\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                  82</span>\n wife.    Given her demise, the defendant no.1 cannot even nurture an\n\napprehension that any criminal liability could be attached to his conduct\n\nupon the result of the DNA test.

It is important to note that there is no plea of violation of bodily\n\nintegrity of the defendant no. 1 in furnishing the blood sample before this\n\ncourt.     The defendant no. 1 does not express any kind of apprehension\n\nfrom the physical testing on account of the minor intrusion entailed.

The defendant no. 1‟s fear of unwarranted evasion of privacy are\n\nexpressed in broad, and speculative which are completely untenable\n\nterms. Such concerns, if warranted, can be met by orders regulating the\n\nsampling, publication, treatment, disposal of the DNA report etc. Despite\n\nthe available legal provision as well as liberty having been granted by the\n\nSupreme Court in the order dated 10th May, 2010, no such request has\n\nbeen made by the defendant no.1.

The blood test procedure is routine.\n\nIt is compulsory even in this country for those joining government or\n\nmilitary service.        Blood donation is widely practiced.     Blood testing is\n\nundertaken routinely for identifying infections, health status etc of the\n\nperson being tested.             A blood sample is drawn by medical experts\n\nadopting a judicious method.          The intrusion for a blood test is minimal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">176.

However biological\n\nparentage may also be a relevant issue in cases and circumstances\n\ninvolving displacement including disasters, adoption as well as in children\n\nborn by IVF procedure or surrogacy. Here maternity determinations may\n\nalso be necessary.            Visitation rights with children and custody claims\n\nclaimed by the biological parent not having physical custody and control\n\nover the child raise such issues. The same may arise in a paternity action\n\nor be raised in an inheritance issue.           Given the accuracy and value\n\nattached to DNA profiling, this test may either confirm an identity or\n\nshatter it.

The present case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">IA No.10394/2011 in CS(OS) 700/2008                                                    99</span>\n underlines the need for consideration beyond these concerns which must\n\nbe anticipated and imperatively addressed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_252\">202. Legal discussion has also arisen about the power of the court to\n\ndirect posting of collateral parties and implementing an hierarchy of\n\nsources for paternity testing. This is necessary especially where the\n\nprimary concern i.e. the putative father may not be available or cannot\n\nfor any reason be tested (for instance, in a case of demise and non-\n\navailability of the sample).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">       In the judgment reported at 583 A.2d 782 in the matter of\n\nEstate of Peter Rogers, Sr.Deceased, the Superior Court of New\n\nJersey (Appellate Division) observed that though the Parentage Act\n\nsubjected only parties to a court order compelling blood test or genetic\n\ntesting, the court had an inherent power to require non-party to give\n\nevidence in form of testimony in quest for truth, it also has the inherent\n\npower to require a non-party when they are needed to adjudicate a\n\ngenuine issue before it to give evidence in form of blood sample in quest\n\nfor truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">203.

It held that ordering\n               a test upon a person to determine biological relationships\n               between him and the plaintiff would not attract the sanction of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India‖\n\nPosthumous Testing\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">206.

In the judgment reported at 2008 ME 79, 946 A.2d 389 titled In\n\nre: Kingsbury, the court held that a blood relative of the decedent who\n\nwas also a party in action could be directed to submit to DNA testing,\n\nfailing which exhumation of the body would be directed.       The court held\n\nthat the compelling interests of the illegitimate child far outweighed the\n\n„temporary moral distress‟ which would result from the exhumation of the\n\ndecedents body which was essential in the light of the intestacy law policy\n\ngoal of determining the rightful heirs of the decedents and that the law\n\nshould favour posthumous paternity determination over temporary\n\nemotional distress as well as any public interest in preserving legal\n\ncertainty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_260\">209. Paternity testing issues may also arise in adoption and sperm donor\n\ncases. In cases involving adoption or artificially conceived children, there\n\nwould be a living biological father. Such father would have a competing\n\ninterest which may include the desire to remain anonymous to the child\n\nso as to be free from obligations. In the context of such cases, the\n\nfather‟s interest in anonymity may outweigh an adopted or artificially\n\nconceived child‟s right to know while the father is living.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">210. Similar considerations may be advocated by a child born outside of\n\nmarriage in a posthumous paternity determination case.          An issue of\n\npaternity may arise in succession matters.

It may be noted that with regard to posthumous testing, the family\n\nor relatives of a decedent may evince emotional and religious interest in\n\nkeeping his body undisturbed.         These interests have to be examined\n\nespecially in the light of the social, biological and financial interest of\n\nrecognised heirs of the decedent in denying a putative illegitimate child,\n\nof accessing any proof of paternity which would include a sample of their\n\nDNA. Upon testing of such sample, the putative child can certainly gain a\n\nsubstantial share in the estate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_263\">       Several authors have urged that the child‟s access to proof of\n\npaternity are far outweighed by the said financial interest of the\n\nrecognised heirs of an intestate decedent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\">212.
