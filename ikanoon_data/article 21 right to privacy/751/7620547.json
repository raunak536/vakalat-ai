The question that arose was whether this Court could direct the appellant to undergo a DNA test, to prove whether he was the father of the child born to the victim and which in turn would prove as to whether he was the rapist of the victim. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">7. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that this Court cannot compel the appellant to undergo a DNA test without his consent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_6\">In this regard the learned Senior Counsel submits that in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_18\">Goutam Kundu Vs. State of West Bengal &amp; Others</a>, reported in 1993 3 SCC 418, Courts in India cannot order a blood test as a matter of course. He submits that the Apex Court has held that the Courts have to carefully examine the consequence of ordering a blood test and no one can be compelled to give his/her sample of blood for analysis.</span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">8. The learned Senior Counsel submits that the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not prove that the appellant was the rapist of the victim or that the appellant was the father of the victim&#x27;s child. In this respect, he has referred to the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, especially the evidence given by the victim in her cross-examination, wherein she has stated that she came to know the name of the appellant only when the case was filed and that she had not seen the face of the person who raped her on the relevant night, due to darkness. He also submits that as the FIR had been filed after 6/7 months after the alleged rape had been committed, the same cast a doubt on the authenticity of the contents of the FIR.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">9. On the other hand, the Additional Public Prosecutor submits that the victim was mentally ill and unable to recall previous incidents, as given in the testimony of PW-1. She also submits that the victim was 48 years of age and the appellant was 24 years of age. Further, though a bichar (village meeting under the aegis of the elder of the village) had been held in the village on 2 (two) occasions, due to the alleged illegal act of the appellant, the appellant did not turn up in the bichar held on the 2 (two) occasions. She submits that though the evidence of the prosecution witnesses proved the guilt of the appellant, the appellant should be subjected to a DNA test to conclusively prove the said fact.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">10. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">11. The question to be decided is as to whether the appellant had raped the victim and whether the child born to the victim had been fathered by the appellant, as it has been alleged that the child was the result of the rape. As stated earlier, an issue has cropped up as to whether a DNA test could/should be done on the appellant and the child, so as to determine whether the appellant had fathered the child, besides considering the evidence that has already been recorded by the learned Trial Court.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_7\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_19\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra), the Supreme Court was seized of an issue, wherein the paternity of a child between a married couple was disputed. The alleged father (husband) of the child prayed for a Blood Group test of the child and himself to prove that he was not the father of the child. The application was dismissed on the ground that there were other methods in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_20\">Evidence Act</a> to prove the paternity of the child and that the Blood Group test could not conclusively prove the paternity of a child. The Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_21\">in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_22\">the above case</a></a> held that though a Blood Group test was a useful test to determine the question of disputed paternity, it could be relied upon by the Courts as a circumstantial evidence, which ultimately excluded a certain individual as a father of the child. The Supreme <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_23\">Court further held</a> that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, the presumption of legitimacy of a child, with regard to the father is that a child born of a married woman is deemed to be the legitimate child of a husband and would remain so, even if the child was born within 280 days after dissolution of a marriage and the mother remain unmarried, unless it could be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any time, when the child could have been begotten.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_8\">It was in the above context that the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_25\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) held that the Courts in India cannot order a blood test as a matter of course. It thus held as follows:-</span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;(1) That courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course;(2) Wherever applications are made for such prayers in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot be entertained.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste woman.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_9\">13. The paternity test that was sought to be done by the alleged father in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_27\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) was a Blood Group test and not a DNA profiling/test, wherein DNA rich cells are extracted. On the other hand, Blood Group test examines the Blood type of a person. As per the medical literature existing today with regard to DNA test and Blood test, perhaps the greatest difference between a Blood Group test and a DNA test is that a Blood Group test cannot be used as conclusive proof of fatherhood. It can only be used to disprove parentage and not to prove that the individual is the father of the child. The DNA test on the other hand, is a very reliable test, which is based on different parameters than a Blood Group test.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">14. With the incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC w.e.f. 23.06.2006, DNA test can be done to facilitate the prosecution, in proving it&#x27;s case against an accused. Though it may be argued that right to privacy is a part of the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> and that <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 20(3)</a> provides that nobody should be compelled to give evidence against himself, we are of the view that the said would not over-ride the search for the truth, as the offence of rape is an offence against the society at large and as the objective of a Court proceeding is to find out the &quot;truth&quot;. We are accordingly of the view that the appellant&#x27;s right under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Articles 20(3)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">&amp; 21</a> would have to give way to public interest, so that the truth is laid bare for all to see.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41352099\" id=\"span_10\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/41352099/\" id=\"a_33\">Harishchandra Sitaram Khanorkar Vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, reported in 2023 (1) ABR (CRI) 259, the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has held that there can be no doubt that there have been remarkable technological advancement in forensic science and in scientific investigations. The DNA testing has an unparalleled ability both to exonerate the wrongly convicted person and to identify the guilty. It has the potential to significantly improve both the criminal justice system and police investigative practices. Modern DNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before DNA technology. It provides not only guidance to the investigation, but also supplies the Court accurate information regarding the identification of the criminal.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167218943\" id=\"span_11\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/167218943/\" id=\"a_34\">Pravin Suryabhanji Gube Vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, reported in 2019 (2) ABR (CRI) 70, the Bombay High Court has held that DNA is a modern scientific technique, which is very useful and helpful not only for investigators, but also for Courts to reach to the truth. DNA conclusively points the finger of guilt towards the perpetrator of a crime. However, while considering this scientific piece of evidence, the Court is required to examine as to whether at any point of time, it could be said that there was the slightest chance of playing with the samples and/or tampering with it by anyone.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68696327\" id=\"span_12\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/68696327/\" id=\"a_35\">Mukesh Vs.

It observed in paragraph Nos. 216 and 217 as follows:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;216. DNA technology as a part of Forensic Science and scientific discipline not only provides guidance to investigation but also supplies the court accrued information about the tending features of identification of criminals. The recent advancement in modern biological research has regularized Forensic Science resulting in radical help in the administration of justice. In our country also like several other developed and developing countries, DNA evidence is being increasingly relied upon by courts. After the amendment in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_36\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> by the insertion of Section 53A by Act 25 of 2005, DNA profiling has now become a part of the statutory scheme. Section 53A relates to the examination of a person accused of rape by a medical practitioner.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">217. Similarly, under Section 164A inserted by Act 25 of 2005, for medical examination of the victim of rape, the description of material taken from the person of the woman for DNA profiling is a must.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">18. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"810006\" id=\"span_13\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/810006/\" id=\"a_37\">Pantangi Balarama Venkata Ganesh Vs.

Further, the evidence of experts is admissible in evidence in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872.

Like all other opinion evidence, the probative value accorded to DNA evidence also varies from case to case, depending on the facts and circumstances and the weight accorded to other evidence on record, whether contrary or corroborative. This is all the more important to remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA evidence may be increasing with the advancement of science and technology with every passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, we have not yet reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible.

Prior to 2006, even without the aforesaid specific provision in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_54\">Cr.PC</a> the prosecution could have still restored to this procedure of getting the DNA test or analysis and matching of semen of the appellant with that found on the undergarments of the prosecutrix to make it a foolproof case, but they did not do so, thus they must face the consequences.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">26. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31929238\" id=\"span_20\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/31929238/\" id=\"a_55\">Sandeep Vs.

The above cases show that there is no bar or restriction in having a DNA profiling of an accused in a case of rape. In the present case, not only is there an allegation of rape against the appellant, but the appellant has been accused of being the father of the child born due to the rape inflicted by the appellant. It is quite clear that DNA profiling of the appellant could prove whether the appellant was the father of the child born to the victim. As <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC allows for examination of a person accused of rape through DNA profiling on the request of a Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, we do not find any bar or restriction for this Court to pass a direction for DNA profiling of the appellant, which would prove whether the appellant was the father of the child and thus further prove the question whether any rape had been committed on the victim by the appellant.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">29. Now let us see whether DNA profiling can be done in civil cases, wherein paternity of a child between couples is in question.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">30. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_22\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_58\">Bhabani Prasad Jena Vs. Orissa State Commission</a> for Women, reported in 2010 8 SCC 633, the Supreme Court has held that depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, it would be permissible for a Court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to determine the paternity of a child. However, the Court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the interests of the parties and on due consideration whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is needed. Thus, in a case relating to the charge by the husband regarding the alleged infidelity of the wife, the same could be ordered by the Court depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">31. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_23\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_59\">Dipanwita Roy Vs. Ronobroto Roy</a>, reported in 2015 1 SCC 365, the Apex Court has allowed the DNA test to be done with regard to the paternity of the child born to his wife, to establish whether or not the husband was the father of the child, so as to prove the alleged infidelity of the wife. It also held that in view of the issue involved <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_60\">in <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_61\">the above case</a></a>, <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act was not strictly attracted to the case.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">32. As can be seen even in civil cases regarding disputes with regard to infidelity of the wife and paternity of a child, the Supreme Court has allowed DNA test to be done, after balancing the interests of the parties, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of a case. The case in hand is however different, as it pertains to a criminal case and in the view of this Court, the right to preserve individual privacy claimed by the appellant, has to give way to the object of finding out the truth, otherwise the same could amount to sacrificing the cause of justice. Thus, in criminal cases, the requirement of finding out the truth would over-ride the stand of the appellant, in not agreeing to undertake a DNA test.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">33. The present case is with regard to whether the appellant had committed a crime against society, which can be proved by way of a DNA test. We are of the view that the principal of proportionality is also in favour of the Court resorting to DNA testing, to find out whether a crime had been committed by the appellant, keeping in view the allegation made by the victim and the fact that a child has been born.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">34. A perusal of the orders passed by the Supreme Court clearly go to show that DNA test/profiling is useful and helpful in coming to a decision with regard to identifying the perpetrator of a crime. The Supreme Court has in many cases as <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_63\">referred to above</a>, supported the use of DNA test/profiling. However, it is only in respect of civil cases where the paternity of a child is in dispute between the married couples that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has given words of caution that DNA test/profiling should not be done at the drop of a hat, in view of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31929238\" id=\"span_24\">As stated in the earlier paragraphs, the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/31929238/\" id=\"a_65\">Sandeep Vs. State of U.P.</a> (supra) has accepted the confirmation that the accused therein was the father of the unborn child, who had died during the murder of a pregnant woman, determined on the basis of a DNA test. In the present case, the victim has accused the appellant of raping her and making her pregnant. In that view of the matter, we are of the view that the DNA test/profiling would conclusively prove whether the appellant had fathered the child and whether he had raped the victim, as he has denied raping her.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">35. In view of the reasons stated above, we are of the view that additional evidence is required to be taken in terms of <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 391</a> Cr.P.C, as DNA test of the appellant and the child born to the victim, would conclusively prove whether the child has been fathered by the appellant and whether the appellant was the perpetrator of the rape committed on the victim. Accordingly, we direct the learned Trial Court to take additional evidence under <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 391</a> Cr.PC, by taking steps for ensuring that a DNA test/profiling of the appellant and the child of the victim alleged to have been fathered by the appellant, is undertaken, after taking the samples from the appellant and the child in the presence of the learned Judge of the learned Trial Court. In this regard, necessary directions may be issued by the learned Trial Court to the Superintendent of the concerned Jail to produce the appellant and also to the victim to produce the child. The learned Trial Court shall ensure all precautions are taken at the time of taking of samples from the above persons and making sure the samples are not compromised in any manner. The learned Trial Court shall also ensure that the persons/institution which is going to conduct the DNA test/profiling takes all possible precautions so that the entire testing procedure is not compromised in any manner. The entire exercise should be conducted at the earliest and preferably within a period of 2 (two) months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.&quot; \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26000323\" id=\"span_25\">10.\tThe relevant paragraphs of the judgment of the Delhi High Court passed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/26000323/\" id=\"a_68\">Meera Devi</a> (supra) are as under:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">&quot;10. It is fundamental duty of the Court to ascertain the truth and do justice on the basis of truth. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13065451\" id=\"span_26\">In <a href=\"/doc/13065451/\" id=\"a_69\">Ved Prakash Kharbanda v. Vimal Bindal</a>, 198 (2013) DLT 555, this Court has discussed the relevant principles relating to the discovery of the truth.

It has to disperse the suspicious, cloud and dust out the smear of dust as all these things clog the very truth. So long chaff, cloud and dust remains, the criminals are clothed with this protective layer to receive the benefit of doubt. So it is a solemn duty of the Courts, not to merely conclude and leave the case the moment suspicions are created. It is onerous duty of the Court, within permissible limit to find out the truth. It means, on one hand no innocent man should be punished but on the other hand to see no person committing an offence should get scot free. There is no mathematical formula through which the truthfulness of a prosecution or a defence case could be concretised. It would depend on the evidence of each case including the manner of deposition and his demeans, clarity, corroboration of witnesses and overall, the conscience of a judge evoked by the evidence on record.

Shanmugam v. Ariya Kshatriya</a>, (2012) 6 SCC 430, the Supreme Court held that the entire journey of a judge is to discern the truth from the pleadings, documents and arguments of the parties. Truth is the basis of justice delivery system. The Supreme Court laid down the following principles:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">&quot;43. On the facts of the present case, following principles emerge:\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">43.1. It is the bounden duty of the Court to uphold the truth and do justice.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">43.2. Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether it is pleadings, affidavits or evidence. Dishonest and unscrupulous litigants have no place in law courts.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">43.3. The ultimate object of the judicial proceedings is to discern the truth and do justice. It is imperative that pleadings and all other presentations before the court should be truthful.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">43.4. Once the court discovers falsehood, concealment, distortion, obstruction or confusion in pleadings and documents, the court should in addition to full restitution impose appropriate costs. The court must ensure that there is no incentive for wrong doer in the temple of justice. Truth is the foundation of justice and it has to be the common endeavour of all to uphold the truth and no one should be permitted to pollute the stream of justice.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">43.5. It is the bounden obligation of the Court to neutralize any unjust and/or undeserved benefit or advantage obtained by abusing the judicial process.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"104710706\" id=\"span_38\">(Emphasis supplied)\n \n11.13 In <a href=\"/doc/104710706/\" id=\"a_82\">Ramesh Harijan v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>, (2012) 5 SCC 777, the Supreme Court emphasized that it is the duty of the Court to unravel the truth under all circumstances.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48110962\" id=\"span_39\">11.14 In <a href=\"/doc/48110962/\" id=\"a_83\">Bhimanna v. State of Karnataka</a>, (2012) 9 SCC 650, the Supreme Court again stressed that the Court must endeavour to find the truth. The observations of the Supreme Court are as under:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">&quot;28. The court must endeavour to find the truth. There would be &quot;failure of justice&quot; not only by unjust conviction but also by acquittal of the guilty, as a result of unjust failure to produce requisite evidence. Of course, the rights of the accused have to be kept in mind and safeguarded but they should not be overemphasised to the extent of forgetting that the victims also have rights.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">11.15 In the recent pronouncement in Kishore Samrite v. State of U.P., MANU/SC/0892/2012, the Supreme Court observed that truth should become the ideal to inspire the Courts to pursue. This can be achieved by statutorily mandating the Courts to become active seekers of truth. The observations of Supreme Court are as under:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">&quot;31. It has been consistently stated by this Court that the entire journey of a Judge is to discern the truth from the pleadings, documents and arguments of the parties, as truth is the basis of the Justice Delivery System.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">32. With the passage of time, it has been realised that people used to feel proud to tell the truth in the Courts, irrespective of the consequences but that practice no longer proves true, in all cases. The Court does not sit simply as an umpire in a contest between two parties and declare at the end of the combat as to who has won and who has lost but it has a legal duty of its own, independent of parties, to take active role in the proceedings and reach at the truth, which is the foundation of administration of justice. Therefore, the truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue. This can be achieved by statutorily mandating the Courts to become active seekers of truth. To enable the courts to ward off unjustified interference in their working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury, prevarication and motivated falsehood, must be appropriately dealt with. The parties must state forthwith sufficient factual details to the extent that it reduces the ability to put forward false and exaggerated claims and a litigant must approach the Court with clean hands. It is the bounden duty of the Court to ensure that dishonesty and any attempt to surpass the legal process must be effectively curbed and the Court must ensure that there is no wrongful, unauthorised or unjust gain to anyone as a result of abuse of the process of the Court. One way to curb this tendency is to impose realistic or punitive costs.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">(Emphasis supplied)\n \n11.16 Malimath Committee on Judicial Reforms discussed the paramount duty of Courts to search for truth.

For justice to be done truth must prevail. It is truth that must protect the innocent and it is truth that must be the basis to punish the guilty. Truth is the very soul of justice. Therefore truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">-Many countries which have Inquisitorial model have inscribed in their Parliamentary Acts a duty to find the truth in the case.

The second part of the section does not allow any discretion but obligates and binds the Court to take necessary steps if the fresh evidence to be obtained is essential to the just decision of the case, essential to an active and alert mind and not to one which is bent to abandon or abdicate. Object of the Section is to enable the Court to arrive at the truth irrespective of the fact that the prosecution or the defence has failed to produce some evidence which is necessary for a just and proper disposal of the case. Though justice is depicted to be blind-folded, as popularly said, it is only a veil not to see who the party before it is while pronouncing judgment on the cause brought before it by enforcing law and administering justice and not to ignore or turn the mind/attention of the Court away from the truth of the cause or lis before it, in disregard of its duty to prevent miscarriage of justice.

He is the key-man in our judicial system, the most important and influential participant in the dispensation of justice. It is mostly with the Trial Judge rather than with the appellate Judge that the members of the general public come in contact, whether as parties or as witnesses. The image of the judiciary for the common man is projected by the Trial Court Judges and this, in turn depends upon their intellectual, moral and personal qualities.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">- Personality of Trial Court Judges\n \n&quot;Errors committed by the Trial Judge who is not of the right caliber can sometimes be so crucial that they change the entire course of the trial and thus result in irreparable miscarriage of justice.

A stenographic transcript fails to reproduce tones of voice and hesitations of speech that often make a sentence mean the reverse of what the mere words signify.

Dispensation of justice, based on truth, is an essential and inevitable feature in the justice delivery system. Justice is truth in action.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">• It is the duty of the Judge to discover truth to do complete justice.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">The entire judicial system has been created only to discern and find out the real truth.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">• The justice based on truth would establish peace in the society. For the common man truth and justice are synonymous. So when truth fails, justice fails. People would have faith in Courts when truth alone triumphs.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">• Every trial is voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest. Truth should be reigning objective of every trial. Judge has to play an active role to discover the truth and he should explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">• The Trial Judge is the key-man in the judicial system and he is in a unique position to strongly impact the quality of a trial to affect system&#x27;s capacity to produce and assimilate truth. The Trial Judge should explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth. Trial Judge has the advantage of looking at the demeanour of the witnesses. In spite of the right of appeal, there are many cases in which appeals are not filed. It is mostly with the Trial Judge rather than with the appellate Judge that the members of the general public come in contact, whether as parties or as witnesses.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">21.2 What is &#x27;Truth&#x27; and how to discover it\n \n• Law&#x27;s Truth is synonymous with facts established in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">• The purpose of judicial inquiry is to establish the existence of facts in accordance with law.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">• Facts are proved through lawfully prescribed methods and standards.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">• The belief of Courts about existence of facts must be based on reason, rationality and justification, strictly on the basis of relevant and admissible evidence, judicial notice or legally permitted presumptions. It must be based on a prescribed methodology of proof. It must be objective and verifiable.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">21.3 <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 3</a> of Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n \n• &quot;Evidence&quot; of a fact and &quot;proof&quot; of a fact are not synonymous terms. &quot;Proof&quot; in the strict sense means the effect of evidence.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">• A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">• The term &quot;after considering the matters before it&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 3</a> of the Evidence Act means that for judging whether a fact is or not proved, the Court is entitled to take into consideration all matters before it which shall include the statement of the witnesses, admissions of the parties, confession of the accused, documents proved in evidence, judicial notice, demeanour of witnesses, local inspections and presumptions.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">• The term &quot;believes it to exist&quot; in the definition of &quot;proof&quot; is a &quot;judicial belief&quot; of the Judge based on logical/rational thinking and the power of reason, and the Court is required to give reasons for the belief. The reasons are live links between the mind of the decision maker and the belief formed. Reasons convey judicial idea in words and sentences. Reasons are rational explanation of the conclusion. Reason is the very life of law. It is the heart beat of every belief and without it, law becomes lifeless. Reasons also ensure transparency and fairness in the decision making process. The reasons substitute subjectivity by objectivity. Recording of reasons also play as a vital restraint on possible arbitrary use of the judicial power. The recording of reasons serve the following four purposes:-\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">- To clarify the thought process.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">- To explain the decision to the parties.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">- To communicate the reasons to the public.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">- To provide the reasons for an appellate Court to consider.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">• Non-recording of reasons would cause prejudice to the litigant who would be unable to know the ground which weighed with the Court and also cause impediment in his taking adequate grounds before the appellate Court in the event of challenge.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">• Nothing can be said to be &quot;proved&quot;, however much material there may be available, until the Court believes the fact to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man will act under the supposition that it exists. For example, ten witnesses may say that they saw the sun rising from the West and all the witnesses may withstand the cross-examination, the Court would not believe it to be true being against the law of nature and, therefore, the fact is &#x27;disproved&#x27;. In mathematical terms, the entire evidence is multiplied with zero and, therefore, it is not required to be put on judicial scales. Where the Court believes the case of both the parties, their respective case is to be put on judicial scales to apply the test of preponderance.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">• The approach of the Trial Court has to be as under:-\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">If on consideration of all the matters before it, the Court believes a fact to exist or considers its existence probable, the fact is said to be &#x27;proved&#x27;. On the other hand, if the Court does not believe a fact either to exist or probable, such fact is said to be &#x27;disproved&#x27;. A fact is said to be &#x27;not proved&#x27; if it is neither proved nor disproved.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">• The test whether a fact is proved is such degree of probability as would satisfy the mind of a reasonable man as to its existence. The standard of certainty required is of a prudent man. The Judge like a prudent man has to use its own judgment and experience and is not bound by any rule except his own judicial discretion, human experience, and judicial sense.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">21.4 <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n \n• <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 114</a> is a useful device to aid the Court in its quest for truth by using common sense as a judicial tool. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 114</a> recognizes the general power of the Court to raise inferences as to the existence or non-existence of unknown facts on proof or admission of other facts.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">• Presumption of fact is a rule in law of evidence that a fact otherwise doubtful may be inferred from certain other proved facts.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">• The source of presumptions is the common course of natural events, human conduct and public or private business, and the Section proceeds on the assumption that just as in nature there prevails a fixed order of things, so the volitional acts of men placed in similar circumstances exhibits, on the whole, a distinct uniformity which is traceable to the impulses of human nature, customs and habits of society.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">• The illustrations though taken from different spheres of human activity, are not exhaustive. They are based upon human experience and have to be applied in the context of the facts of each case. The illustrations are merely examples of circumstances in which certain presumptions may be made. Other presumptions of a similar kind in similar circumstances can be made under the provisions of the section itself.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">• Presumption in law of evidence is a rule indicating the stage of shifting the burden of proof. From a certain fact or facts the Court can draw an inference and that would remain until such inference is either disproved or dispelled.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">• Presumptions of fact can be used by the Courts in the course of administration of justice to remove lacunae in the chain of direct evidence before it. The function of a presumption is to fill a gap in evidence.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">• <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act applies to both civil and criminal proceedings.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">• Whether or not a presumption can be drawn under the section in a particular case depends ultimately upon the facts and circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be laid down. Human behaviour is so complex and room must be left for play in the joints. It is not possible to formulate a series of exact propositions and con-flue human behaviour within straitjackets.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">• No rule of evidence can guide the Judge on the fundamental question whether evidence as to a relevant fact should be believed or not. Secondly, assuming that the Judge believes very few cases, guide him on the question what inference he should draw from it as to assist a Judge in the very smallest degree in determining the master question of the whole subject - whether and how far he ought to believe what the witnesses say? The rules of evidence do not guide what inference the Judge ought to draw from the facts in which, after considering the statements made to him, he believes. In every judicial proceeding whatever these two questions - Is this true, and, if it is true what then? - ought to be constantly present in the mind of the Judge, and the rules of evidence do not throw the smallest portion of light upon them.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">21.5 <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 165</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n \n• <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 165</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 invests the Judge with plenary powers to put any question to any witness or party; in any form, at any time, about any fact relevant or irrelevant. <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 165</a> is intended to arm the Judge with the most extensive power possible for the purpose of getting at the truth. The effect of this Section is that in order to get to the bottom of the matter before it, the Court will be able to look at and inquire into every fact and thus possibly acquire valuable indicative evidence which may lead to other evidence strictly relevant and admissible. The Court is not, however, permitted to found its judgment on any but relevant statements.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">• The object of a trial is, first to ascertain truth by the light of reason, and then, do justice upon the basis of the truth and the Judge is not only justified but required to elicit a fact, wherever the interest of truth and justice would suffer, if he did not.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">• The Judge contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 165</a> is not a mere umpire at a wit-combat between the lawyers for the parties whose only duty is to enforce the rules of the game and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has lost. He is expected, and indeed it is his duty, to explore all avenues open to him in order to discover the truth and to that end, question witnesses on points which the lawyers for the parties have either overlooked or left obscure or willfully avoided. A Judge, who at the trial merely sits and records evidence without caring so to conduct the examination of the witnesses that every point is brought out, is not fulfilling his duty.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"13065451\" id=\"span_51\">11.\tUpon due consideration of the aforesaid including the consent of the prosecution regarding DNA test, this  Court finds that no interference is required in the matter, as the impugned order dated 12.02.2024 is not in violation of the provisions and the judgment(s<a href=\"/doc/13065451/\" id=\"a_133\">) <a href=\"/doc/13065451/\" id=\"a_134\">referred above</a></a>.
