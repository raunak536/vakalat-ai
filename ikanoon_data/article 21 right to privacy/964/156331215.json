Abortion is an issue overshadowed and shrugged with\nglaring questions of morality, infanticide, suicide, ethics,\nreligious beliefs and women&#x27;s rights.      To what amplitude,\nabortion should be permitted, encouraged, restricted or\nrepressed is a social issue that has effectively divided\ntheologians, philosophers, legislators and general mass. The\nlaws governing this delicate sphere of the woman&#x27;s autonomy\nreflects immensely on the plight of woman in the society and\nencompasses emotive and poignant sets of views making it a\nmammoth task for the legislators to ensure that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                            Page 5 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                                CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nconstitutional mandate of equality and liberty are adhered to\nand the constitutional spirit is kept alive. (see women&#x27;s Right\nto Abort (2011) 10 SCC J-23)\n\n3.1   P.Ramanatha         Aiyer&#x27;s   The       Law   Lexicon,    defines\n&quot;abortion&quot; as, the delivery or expulsion of the human foetus\nprematurely i.e. before it is yet capable of sustaining life. The\nunlawful destruction or the bringing forth prematurely of the\nhuman foetus before the natural time of birth. To cause an\nabortion is unlawful, unless it is done in good faith for the\npurpose of saving the life of the mother.               A woman is\nconsidered to be with child as soon as she becomes pregnant.\nQuickening is the name applied to peculiar sensations\nexperienced by a woman about the fourth or fifth month of\npregnancy. As stated in Modi on Medical Jurisprudence and\nToxicology, at the first perception of &quot;quickening&quot; or the foetal\nmovement by the mother, she is said to be &quot;quick with the\nchild&quot;, and occurs at any time between 18-20 weeks. This\nterm arises from the old notion that a foetus becomes\nendowed with life and secures an identity apart from the\nmother, when the movements are felt by the mother.\nHowever, causing miscarriage of a woman &quot;quick with child&quot; is\nconsidered a much graver offence, than causing miscarriage\nof a woman &quot;with child&quot;.            So in former, the prescribed\npunishment is imprisonment of either description for a term\nwhich may extend to seven years and a fine, whereas in the\nlatter, the prescribed punishment is imprisonment of either\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               Page 6 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                               CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\ndescription for a term which may extend to three years or with\na fine or both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">3.2   In India, abortion is illegal according to the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">Indian Penal Code</a>.

Undoubtedly, <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 5</a> of the\nsaid Act relates to the right of a pregnant woman to terminate\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                           Page 14 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\npregnancy in case it is found necessary to save her life.\n<a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 5</a> nowhere speaks of any right of a pregnant woman\nto terminate the pregnancy beyond 20 weeks on the ground of\nhaving conceived on account of rape. It strictly restricts to the\ncases where the life of the pregnant woman would be in\ndanger in case the pregnancy is not terminated and does not\nrefer to any other circumstances. Undoubtedly, the opinion in\nthat regard has to be formed by a registered medical\npractitioner and such opinion should be in good faith. The\nexpression &quot;good faith&quot; discloses that the opinion has to be\nbased on the necessary examination required to form such an\nopinion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">4.5   As far as <a href=\"/doc/444500/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3(2)(b)(ii)</a> is concerned, it clearly\nspeaks of the right to terminate the pregnancy where there is\na substantial risk in allowing the child to take birth as it would\nsuffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be\nseriously handicapped. However, such right is restricted to\nthe maximum period of twenty weeks of pregnancy and not\nbeyond it. <a href=\"/doc/444500/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 3(2)(b)(ii)</a> is very clear in that regard.

In case, the pregnancy has not exceeded\ntwenty weeks, then such an opinion can be formed in good\nfaith by any one medical practitioner.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  Page 15 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_32\">4.6   The Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_33\">Suchita Srivastava and\nanother v.

The legislative intent\nwas to provide a qualified &#x27;right to abortion&#x27; and the\ntermination of pregnancy has never been recognised as a\nnormal recourse for expecting mothers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">22. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\nreproductive choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal\nliberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\nof India. It is important to recognise that reproductive\nchoices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\nabstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is\nthat a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily\nintegrity should be respected. This means that there\nshould be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\nreproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\nparticipation in sexual activity or alternatively the\ninsistence on use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                      Page 17 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> R/SCR.A/1919/2015                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nwomen are also free to choose birth-control methods\nsuch as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to\ntheir logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a\nwoman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term,\nto give birth and to subsequently raise children.\nHowever, in the case of pregnant women there is also a\n&#x27;compelling state interest&#x27; in protecting the life of the\nprospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\npregnancy is only permitted when the conditions\nspecified in the applicable statute have been fulfilled.\nHence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_39\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be\nviewed as reasonable restrictions that have been placed\non the exercise of reproductive choices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">23. A perusal of the above mentioned provision makes\nit clear that ordinarily a pregnancy can be terminated\nonly when a medical practitioner is satisfied that a\n&#x27;continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the\nlife of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her\nphysical or mental health&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3(2)(i)</a>] or when\n&#x27;there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it\nwould suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities\nas to be seriously handicapped&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3(2)(ii)</a>].\nWhile the satisfaction of one medical practitioner is\nrequired for terminating a pregnancy within twelve weeks\nof the gestation period, two medical practitioners must\nbe satisfied about either of these grounds in order to\nterminate a pregnancy between twelve to twenty weeks\nof the gestation period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">24. The explanations to this provision have also\ncontemplated the termination of pregnancy when the\nsame is the result of a rape or a failure of birth-control\nmethods since both of these eventualities have been\nequated with a &#x27;grave injury to the mental health&#x27; of a\nwoman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">25. In all such circumstances, the consent of the\npregnant woman is an essential requirement for\nproceeding with the termination of pregnancy.

In the facts before us, the State could claim that it is\nthe guardian of the pregnant victim since she is an\norphan and has been placed in government-run welfare\ninstitutions. However, the State&#x27;s claim to guardianship\ncannot be mechanically extended in order to make\ndecisions about the termination of her pregnancy. An\nossification test has revealed that the physical age of the\nvictim is around 19-20 years. This conclusively shows\nthat she is not a minor. Furthermore, her condition has\nbeen described as that of &#x27;mild mental retardation&#x27; which\nis clearly different from the condition of a &#x27;mentally ill\nperson&#x27; as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the MTP\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">31. As mentioned earlier, in the facts before us the victim\nhas not given consent for the termination of pregnancy.\nWe cannot permit a dilution of this requirement of\nconsent since the same would amount to an arbitrary and\nunreasonable restriction on the reproductive rights of the\nvictim. We must also be mindful of the fact that any\ndilution of the requirement of consent contemplated by\n<a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 3(4)(b)</a> of the MTP Act is liable to be misused in a\nsociety where sex-selective abortion is a pervasive social\nevil.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">58. In our considered opinion, the language of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_50\">MTP\nAct</a> clearly respects the personal autonomy of mentally\nretarded persons who are above the age of majority.\nSince none of the other statutory conditions have been\nmet in this case, it is amply clear that we cannot permit a\ndilution of the requirement of consent for proceeding\nwith a termination of pregnancy. We have also reasoned\nthat proceeding with an abortion at such a late stage (19-\n20 weeks of gestation period) poses significant risks to\nthe physical health of the victim.&quot;\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                       Page 19 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                           CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">5..

The issues relating to medical termination of\n      pregnancy in common parlance known as &#x27;abortion&#x27; are\n      indeed of public importance. Counsel for the parties\n      attempted to go into the length and breadth of the issue.\n      In our opinion, however, the point for consideration lies in\n      a narrow compass. This Court is not supposed to enter\n      upon a debate as to when foetus comes to life or the\n      larger question touching upon the ethics of abortion. We\n      are merely concerned with the validity of the relevant\n      provisions of the Act. At the outset, it may be mentioned\n      that the petition was sought to be argued as if the Act\n      has been enacted to legalise abortions but from a bare\n      reading of the relevant provision it would appear that Act\n      aims at termination of pregnancy in the interest of the\n      woman or the to-be-born child. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 3</a> may be quoted\n      in extenso as under :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      &quot;3.

On a plain reading, it is manifest that <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 3</a> permits\ntermination of pregnancy by registered medical\npractitioner(s) on being satisfied, in good faith, that the\ncontinuance of pregnancy would involve a risk to the life\nof the pregnant woman or cause grave injury to her\nphysical and mental health; or that if the child were born,\nit would suffer from such physical or mental\nabnormalities as would render it seriously handicapped.\nAs per the Explanation, where pregnancy is caused by\nrape, the anguish of pregnancy is regarded as &#x27;grave\ninjury to the mental health&#x27; of the pregnant woman. If the\npregnancy occurs as a result of failure of any device or\nmethod used by the woman or her husband for the\npurpose of limiting the number of children, the anguish\ncaused by such unwanted pregnancy is also treated as\nconstituting &#x27;grave injury to the mental health&#x27; of the\npregnant woman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">6. It would appear that dominant object to achieve which\nthe law has been enacted is to save the life of the\npregnant woman or to relieve her of any injury toward\nphysical and mental health or prevent the possible\ndeformities in the child - to be born. We find support from\nthe Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, the\nrelevant portion of which reads as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">&quot;There is thus avoidable wastage of the mother&#x27;s health,\nstrength and, sometimes, life. The proposed measure\nwhich seeks to liberalize certain existing provisions\nrelating to termination of pregnancy has been conceived\n(1) as a health measure - When there is danger to the life\nor risk to physical or mental health of the woman; (2) on\nhumanitarian grounds - Such as when pregnancy arises\nfrom a sex crime like rape or intercourse with a lunatic\nwoman, etc.; (3) eugenic grounds - Where there is\nsubstantial risk that the child, if born, would suffer from\ndeformities and diseases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">7.The object of the Act being to save the life of the\npregnant woman or relieve her of any injury to her\nphysical and mental health, and no other thing, it would\nappear the Act is rather in consonance with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India than in conflict with it. While it\nmay be debatable as to when the foetus comes to life so\nas to attract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, there\ncannot be two opinion that where continuance of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                       Page 22 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\"> R/SCR.A/1919/2015                             CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\npregnancy is likely to involve risk to the life of the\npregnant woman or cause grave injury to her physical\nand mental health, it would be in her interest to\nterminate the pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">8.The perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 3</a> also makes it clear that the Act\ndoes not give a carte blanche to any person, even a\nmedical practitioner, to cause termination of pregnancy.\n<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_59\">The Act</a> provides in express terms that the pregnancy\ncan be terminated upto twenty weeks and only by\nregistered medical practitioner. If the length of\npregnancy exceeds twelve weeks upto twenty weeks, it\ncan be terminated only if a Board of at least two\nregistered medical practitioners is of the opinion, in good\nfaith, that the continuance of pregnancy involves risk to\nthe life of the pregnant woman or cause grave injury to\nher physical and mental health.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">9. An important aspect of the case is that the termination\nof pregnancy is not something which is provided for the\nfirst time by the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_60\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy\nAct</a>.<a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 312</a> of the Indian Penal Code too protects\ntermination of pregnancy described as miscarriage; if it is\ndone &quot;in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of\nthe woman&quot;. Similarly <a href=\"/doc/1637773/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 315</a> of the Indian Penal\nCode protects any act done with intent to prevent child\nfrom being born alive or causing it to die after its birth &quot;if\nsuch act has been done in good faith for the purpose of\nsaving the life of the mother&quot;.To bring home the point, it\nwould be useful to quote Sections 312 and 315 as\nunder :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">&quot;Section 312.

Abortion was made a crime for\n     which the mother as well as the abortionist could be\n     punished except where it had to be induced in order to\n     save the life of the mother. It has been stated that this\n     very strict law has been observed in the breach in a very\n     large number of cases all over the country. Furthermore,\n     most of these mothers are married women, and are\n     under no particular necessity to conceal their pregnancy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">     11.Read in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 312</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1637773/\" id=\"a_66\">315</a>, IPC, it\n     would appear that the object of the Act was to make the\n     provisions relating to termination of pregnancy stringent\n     and effective rather than to permit blatant termination of\n     pregnancy. <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 312</a> of the IPC made causing\n     miscarriage an offence except in good faith for the\n     purpose of saving the life of the woman without laying\n     down the manner in which pregnancy could be medically\n     terminated. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 3</a> of the Act provides the guidelines\n     or limitation within which the pregnancy could be\n     terminated.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">7.

But because the foetus\n      is &quot;an autonomous human being&quot; under the protection of\n      the Constitution, the termination of pregnancy has a\n      social dimension which demands public regulation;\n(6)   The Constitution also protects a woman&#x27;s right to free\n      development of her personality, which includes freedom\n      to decide against parenthood.          But this right is not\n      guaranteed without limitations. The right of others, the\n      constitutional order, and the moral code all restrict it;\n(7)   A compromise which guarantees both the protection of\n      foetus as well as the freedom of abortion of a pregnant\n      woman is impossible because the termination of\n      pregnancy always means &quot;destruction of unborn life&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">      The legal order cannot, therefore, make a woman&#x27;s self-\n      determination, the principle of its regulations.

Relying on the then current state of medical\nknowledge, the decision established a system of Trimesters\nthat attempted to balance the State&#x27;s legitimate interests with\nthe individual constitutional rights. The Court ruled that the\nState cannot restrict a women&#x27;s right to an abortion during the\nfirst trimester, the State can regulate the abortion procedure\nduring the second trimester &quot;in ways that are reasonably\nrelated to maternal health&quot;         and in the third trimester,\ndemarketing the viability of the foetus, a State can choose to\nrestrict or even to prescribe abortion as it would deem fit. It\nwas held that &quot;the childbirth endangers the lives of some\nwomen, voluntary abortion &#x27;at any time and place&#x27; regardless\nof medical standards would impinge on a rightful concern of\nthe society. The woman&#x27;s health is part of that concern as is\nthe life of the foetus after quickening.

We are concerned\nwith destruction of foetus life. This is what is known as\nabortion or miscarriage. To dispel any doubt as to\nwhether the foetus has a life, what has been stated by\nTaylor in his Principle and Practice of Medical\nJurisprudence may be noted where the learned author\nhas opined at p. 332 (13th Edn.) that legally both\nabortion and miscarriage are synonymous because the\nfoetus being regarded as a &quot;human life ... from the\nmoment of fertilisation&quot;. It may, however, be stated that\nsometimes the word &#x27;miscarriage&#x27; is used for\n&quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; and &quot;abortion&quot; for &quot;miscarriage\nproduced by unlawful means&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">5 This distinction is, however, not material for our\npurpose because Section 312 of the Penal Code speaks\nabout causing of miscarriage and Section 314 punishes\nthe person who has intent to cause miscarriage of a\nwoman and while doing so causes the death of such\nwoman. It is under this section that the appellant has\nbeen found guilty by the High court of Kerala after setting\naside the acquittal order of the learned Assistant\nSessions Judge. For the offence under Section 314, the\nappellant has been sentenced RI for 4 years and a fine of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                       Page 29 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\"> R/SCR.A/1919/2015                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nRs. 5,000.00. The High court had also taken suo motu\ncognizance against the order of acquittal and it is\nbecause of this that along with the criminal appeal filed\nby the State which was registered as Criminal Appeal No.\n415 of 1989 the High court disposed of CrRC No. 44 of\n1989, which is relatable to its own action. So, two\naforesaid appeals have been preferred by the appellant.\nIt may be stated that out of fine of Rs. 5,000.00 as\nawarded, a sum of Rs. 4,000.00 was directed to be paid\nto the children of the deceased towards compensation for\nloss of their mother, in case of realisation of fine.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">6 Our law-makers had faced some difficulty when our\nPenal Code was being enacted. The authors of the Code\nobserved as below while enacting Section 312:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">&quot;With respect to the law on the subject of abortion, we\nthink it necessary to say that we entertain strong\napprehension that this or any other law on that subject\nmay, in this country, be abused to the vilest purposes.\nThe charge of abortion is one which, even where it is not\nsubstantiated often leaves a stain on the honour of\nfamilies. The power of bringing a false accusation of this\ndescription is therefore a formidable engine in the hands\nof unprincipled men. This part of the law will, unless\ngreat care be taken, produce few convictions but much\nmisery and terror to respectable families, and a large\nharvest of profit to the vilest pests of society. We trust\nthat it may be in our power in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_72\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a> to lay down rules which may prevent such an\nabuse. Should we not be able to do so, we are inclined to\nthink that it would be our duty to advise his Lordship in\ncouncil rather to suffer abortion, where the mother is a\nparty to the offence, to remain wholly unpunished, than\nto repress it by provisions which would occasion more\nsuffering to the innocent than to the guilty.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">So what finds place in the aforesaid section is the result\nof very mature and hard thinking and we have to give full\neffect to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">7 After the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_73\">Medical Termination of\nPregnancy Act, 1971</a>, the provisions of the Penal Code\nrelating to miscarriage have become subservient to this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                      Page 30 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n      Act because of the non obstante clause in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 3</a>,\n      which permits abortion / miscarriage by a registered\n      practitioner under certain circumstances. This permission\n      can be granted on three grounds:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      (i) Health when there is danger to the life or risk to the\n      physical or mental health of the woman;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      (ii) humanitarian such as when pregnancy arises from a\n      sex crime like rape or intercourse with a lunatic woman;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      (iii) eugenic - where there is substantial risk that the\n      child, if born, would suffer from deformities and diseases.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">      (See Statement of Objects and Reasons).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">      8 The above shows that concern for even unborn child\n      was evinced by the legislature, not to speak of hazard to\n      the life of the woman concerned.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">8.4   The religious, moral and cultural sensibilities continue to\ninfluence the abortion laws throughout the world. The right to\nlife, the right to liberty, and the right to security of person are\nmajor issues of human rights that are sometimes used as\njustification for the existence or the absence of laws controlling\nabortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require\nthat certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be\nobtained, often, but not always, using a trimester-based\nsystem to regulate the window in which abortion is still legal to\nperform. In many debates, arguments presented in favour of\nor against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of\nan induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or\nrestricting abortion. The arguments on morality and legality\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                             Page 31 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">       R/SCR.A/1919/2015                          CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\ntend to collide and combine, complicating the issue at hand.\nAbortion debates, especially pertaining to abortion laws, are\noften spearheaded by advocacy groups belonging to one of\nthe two camps. Most often those in favour of legal prohibition\nof abortion describe themselves as pro-life while those against\nlegal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as pro-\nchoice.     Both are used to indicate the control principles in\narguments for and against abortion: &quot;Is the foetus a human\nbeing with a fundamental right to life&quot; for pro-life advocates,\nand, for those who are pro-choice. &quot;Does a woman have the\nright to choose whether or not to have an abortion&quot;.

Mr. Pratik Barot, the learned counsel appearing for the\napplicant made a fervent appeal for issuing directions for\npermitting the pregnancy of the applicant to be terminated for\nthe same having been caused against her wishes and\nbecause of rape.

On the other hand, Mr. Mitesh Amin, the learned Public\nProsecutor and Mr. N.J.

It was submitted that whatever\nmay be the ultimate outcome, the applicant will have to deliver\nthe child. Mr. Amin, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted\nthat the State would take care of the applicant so far as\ndelivery of the child is concerned and if she is disowned\nultimately by the husband and her family members, then the\nState would see to it that the applicant is provided adequate\nshelter and protection with the necessary financial aid.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">11.

Secondly, for the\ntime being I leave this aspect of rape aside. Assuming that\nthe pregnancy for whatever reason had been against the wish\nand desire of the applicant, the intriguing aspect in the present\ncase is that by the time the applicant chose to file this writ\npetition i.e. on 31/3/2015, the pregnancy had been of about 27\nweeks as is borne out from the medical reports. Although it is\nthe case of the applicant that since she was in unlawful\nconfinement of the accused persons she had no opportunity to\nget the pregnancy terminated within the statutory time period\nas provided in the Act, yet I am unable to accept such\nsubmission as the law does not permit the termination of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                            Page 33 of 38</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">      R/SCR.A/1919/2015                            CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\npregnancy beyond 20 weeks except in cases where the life of\nthe mother is in danger.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">11.2 The learned counsel for the applicant strenuously\ncontended that when read in the context of the Explanation-1\nto <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_75\">Section-3</a>, where pregnancy caused by rape is said to be of\ngrave injury to the mental health of a pregnant woman, the\nsame aspect must ipso facto ought to have been made\napplicable to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_76\">Sec.5</a> of the Act of 1971 too\nwhereby the pregnancy could be terminated if required\nimmediately in order to save the life of the pregnant woman.\nMr. Barot wants this Court to read something on the statute\nwhich the legislature has not thought fit to provide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">11.3 A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an\nevil. A court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve\nwhat it considers a distress resulting from its operating.

The Court\n     cannot proceed with the assumption that the legislature,\n     while enacting the Statute has committed a mistake; it\n     must proceed on the footing that the legislature intended\n     what it has said; even if there is some defect in the\n     phraseology used by it in framing the statute, and it is\n     not open to the court to add and amend, or by\n     construction, make up for the deficiencies, which have\n     been left in the Act. The Court can only iron out the\n     creases but while doing so, it must not alter the fabric, of\n     which an Act is woven. The Court, while interpreting\n     statutory provisions, cannot add words to a Statute, or\n     read words into it which are not part of it, especially\n     when a literal reading of the same, produces an\n     intelligible result.(Vide: <a href=\"/doc/553711/\" id=\"a_78\">Nalinakhya Bysack v.

The Statute is not to be construed in light of certain\n     notions that the legislature might have had in mind, or\n     what the legislature is expected to have said, or what the\n     legislature might have done, or what the duty of the\n     legislature to have said or done was.The Courts have to\n     administer the law as they find it, and it is not\n     permissible for the Court to twist the clear language of\n     the enactment, in order to avoid any real, or imaginary\n     hardship which such literal interpretation may cause.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">11.5 I am conscious of the fact that to carry a child in her\nwomb by a woman as a result of conception through an act of\nrape is not only extremely traumatic for her but humiliating,\nfrightening and psychologically devastating and as a human\nbeing, more particularly in the Indian society she becomes an\nobject of scorn and ostracisation.

I may only say having regard to the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the case that the applicant will have to\nbravely go ahead with the pregnancy and when time comes,\nshe should deliver the child. I am conscious of the fact that it is\neasy for a judge to say so in his judgment because it is\nultimately the applicant who will have to face the hard days\nahead, but as observed above, howsoever harsh one may find\nthe law, yet it remains the law and one has to respect it. She\nmust understand that termination at this stage will put her own\nlife in peril. I can only remind her of what Helene Evans, a\nvictim of rape, had to say in these type of situations. I quote\n&quot;After the abortion, I wanted to die. How could I live when\nI had just ended the life of my child? The negative\nfeelings resulting from the rape were not eliminated by\nthe abortion. Nothing was solved; instead, the grief was\nnow doubled.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">13.
