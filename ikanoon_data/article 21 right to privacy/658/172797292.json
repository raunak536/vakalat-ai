However, with respect to information\nsought in point no. 1 and 2 of the instant RTI Application, the Commission\nobserves that the Respondent has been changing stance as during the hearing, the\nRespondent has submitted that the information sought is of commercial\nconfidence and the same pertains to personal information of third party which is\nexempted from disclosure under Section 8 (1) (d) and (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">RTI Act</a> and after\nthe conclusion of hearing, the Respondent vide his written submission dated\n25.11.2022 has submitted that the CEO has given her dissent to share her personal\ninformation but the said fact were never quoted by the Respondent during the\nhearing.

The Appellant contended that\nhe has sought specific information on his RTI application on point nos. 1 and 2 but\ndespite the fact the Respondent wrongly denied the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">The Respondent, during the hearing, reiterated the contents of their written\nsubmissions, the relevant extracts are reproduced herein below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;BASIS FOR NON-DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION It is respectfully submitted\nthe information sought in point nos. 1 and 2 is personal in nature, and is exempt\nfrom disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/802881/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)(i)</a> of the RTI Act. Further, the information\nsought in point no. 2 is of commercial confidence containing 1. details of\nrenumeration and terms of engagement of the CEO of Hockey India. The\nRespondent is exempt from disclosure such information under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of\nthe RTI Act. THE INFORMATION SOUGHT BY THE APPELLANT IS PERSONAL IN\nNATURE AND IS EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER SECTION 8(1)(D) OF THE RTI\nACT J. It is respectfully submitted that the information sought in pt. nos. 1 and 2,\nincluding the CEO&#x27;s salary and contractual details of her terms of employment, is\npersonal information. Such information is exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98132808\" id=\"span_4\">A 5 judge bench of the Supreme Court in Central Public Information Officer,\nSupreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/98132808/\" id=\"a_11\">India vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a> (2020)5 SCC 481, while\ninterpreting the term &quot;personal information&quot;, has observed as follows: K. &quot;292. it\nemerges from the discussion that certain category of information such as medical\ninformation, details of personal relations, employee records and professional\nincome can be classified as personal information. The question of whether such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         5</span>\n information must be disclosed has to be determined by the CPIO on a case-to-case\nbasis, depending on the public interest demonstrated in favour of disclosure.\nL. As per the abovementioned judgement, the disclosure with regard to pay/salary\nof the CEO will undoubtedly fall within the scope of &quot;personal information.\nFurther, the Appellant has failed to disclose the public interest which is a\nmandatory requirement for disclosure of such confidential and personal\ninformation. Any disclosure of such personal information, in the absence of public\ninterest, is violative of the right to privacy enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India. M. Further, the legal proposition that salary is purely\npersonal and confidential information and exempt from disclosure has been\nacknowledged in the draft Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, which was\nreleased by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on November\n18, 2022 for public comments. It has a provision which proposes to amend the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">Right to Information Act</a> 2005. Clause 30(2) of the draft proposes an amendment\nto <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)</a>) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">RTI Act</a>, which will have the effect of totally exempting\npersonal information from disclosure. &quot;Clause 30 of the draft reads as follows-\nClause (i) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_16\">section 8</a> of the Right to Information Act. 2005 shall\nbe amended in the following manner: (a) The words &quot;the disclosure of which has\nno relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public\nInformation Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate\nauthority, as the case N. If these proposed amendments receive the Parliamentary\napproval, <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8(1)</a>() of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a> would read as &quot;information which relates to\npersonal information&quot;. In other words, personal information will be totally exempt\nfrom disclosure.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_6\">Further, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_19\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.\nCentral Information Commr.</a>, (2013) 1 SCC 212, has observed that: 0. &quot;13. The\ndetails disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are &quot;personal information&quot;\nwhich stand exempted from disclosure under clause 6) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI\nAct, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Information\nOfficer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority is\nsatisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.&quot;\nTherefore, the second appeal is wholly misconceived\nWhile such information can be disclosed voluntarily, it is submitted that the CEO is\nnot willing to disclose such personal information to the general public. The CPIO\nhad written an email to the CEO on 22.11.2022 seeking her approval for disclosing\nher salary details. The same was declined by the CEO vide email dated 23.11.2022.\nThe email exchange between the CPIO and CEO is annexed herein and marked as\nAnnexure-1 (Colly.). P. IS EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSING MATTERS OF COMMERCIAL\nCONFIDENCE AS SOUGHT UNDER SECTION 8(18) OF THE ACT THE RESPONDENT\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           6</span>\n Further, it is respectfully submitted that the CEO&#x27;s contract is not only personal\ninformation but also a matter of commercial confidence which is exempt under\n<a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 8(1)(d)</a> of the RTI Act. It is noteworthy to state that disclosure of\nemployment contract and/or salary/benefits puts a person at a disadvantageous\nposition insofar as negotiation of salary and /or other benefits jobs are concerned\nfor a fresh job. Therefore, one is entitled to protect her personal information in\nlaw.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">Xxxxxxxx\nPENDING PROCEEDINGS ON SIMILAR ISSUES BEFORE THE HON&#x27;BLE DELHI HIGH\nCOURT It is submitted that a very similar RTI was filed with the hockey India on\n13.09.2015 by an Applicant who sought disclosure of commercially sensitive\ninformation concerning sponsorship amounts received by Hockey India League as\nwell as consultancy and legal expenses of lawyers engaged by Hockey India. The\nsaid information was denied by the then CPIO citing commercial confidence. The\nsame was carried in appeal by the Applicant to this Hon&#x27;ble Commission which\ndirected disclosure of the information. However, against the said Order dated\n22.10.2018, the Respondent herein filed a Writ Petition before the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi\nHigh Court being WP (C) No. 11761/2018 wherein the Respondent challenged the\nfindings of the Ld.

Please also mention if any amount is paid\nto CEO in foreign currency or fund-transfer to some foreign bank-account and\nDuties, responsibilities, powers, and other rights given to CEO at Hockey India also\nenclosing contract, agreement etc, if any, signed between CEO and Hockey India,\netc. under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">In this regard, the Commission arrives at the conclusion that the CPIO has\nappropriately denied the personal information on point no. 1 of the RTI\napplication regarding &quot;Complete information together with file-notings,\ncorrespondence, documents etc on appointment of Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\nat Hockey India mentioning name, nationality, monetary and other benefits\navailable to the CEO.

At this juncture, it is necessary to clear some misconceptions about\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_37\">RTI Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_38\">The RTI Act</a> provides access to all information that is available and\nexisting.........A public authority is also not required to furnish information which\nrequire drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not\nrequired to provide `advice&#x27; or `opinion&#x27; to an applicant, nor required to obtain\nand furnish any `opinion&#x27; or `advice&#x27; to an applicant. The reference to `opinion&#x27;\nor `advice&#x27; in the definition of `information&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_39\">section 2(f)</a> of the Act, only refers\nto such material available in the records of the public authority. Many public\nauthorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and\nopinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused\nwith any obligation under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_40\">RTI Act</a>.&quot; (Emphasis Supplied)\n\nFurther for better understating of the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(f)</a> of the RTI\nAct, reference may be had of <a href=\"/doc/1355531/\" id=\"a_42\">Khanapuram Gandaiah vs Administrative Officer\n&amp;Ors.
