It is averred that having followed the\nsaid order no cause of action arises in favour of the plaintiff. In fact the\nplaintiff has suppressed the said order dated 01.04.2014. In the response to\nthe allegations in the plaint about the duration of the programmes or the\nfrequency of the programme are not denied.

The first question that arises in this case is whether this Court would\nhave the powers to grant a pre-publication or pre-broadcasting injunction\nagainst the defendants. The above issue is no longer res integra. A\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_46\">Sahara India Real Estate\nCorporation Ltd. and Ors. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India\nand Anr.</a>, (2012) 10 SCC 603 (MANU/SC/0735/2012) concluded that in\nmost jurisdictions there is power in the Court to postpone reporting of\njudicial proceedings in the interest of administration of justice. That was a\ncase in which Civil Appeals were pending filed by the petitioner\nchallenging the orders passed by the Security Appellate Tribunal. Certain\ncommunications were exchanged between the counsel for the parties\npursuant to a direction by the Court that the learned counsel should attempt\nto reach a consensus with respect to acceptable security in the form of an\nunencumbered asset. The communications exchanged between the\ncounsels appear to have come on one of the TV Channels. In this\nbackground, the petitioner has stated that the Court should give appropriate\ndirections with regard to reporting of matters which are sub-judice. The\nSupreme Court held as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"831263\" id=\"span_23\">&quot;29. At this stage, we wish to clarify that the reliance on the\n       above judgments is only to show that &quot;prior restraint&quot; per se has\n       not been rejected as constitutionally impermissible. At this\n       stage, we may point out that in the present IAs we are dealing\n       with the concept of &quot;prior restraint&quot; per se and not with cases of\n       misuse of powers of pre- censorship which were corrected by\n       the Courts [see <a href=\"/doc/831263/\" id=\"a_47\">Binod Rao v.

The question of prior restraint arose before this Court in\n       1988,      in    the     case      of <a href=\"/doc/1351834/\" id=\"a_48\">Reliance      Petrochemicals\n       Limited v. Proprietors of Indian Express Newspapers Bombay\n       (P) Limited MANU/SC/0412/1988</a>: AIR 1989 SC 190 in the\n       context of publication in one of the national dailies of certain\n       articles which contained adverse comments on the proposed\n       issue of debentures by a public limited company. The validity of\n       the debenture was sub judice in this Court. Initially, the court\n       granted injunction against the press restraining publication of\n       articles on the legality of the debenture issue. The test\n       formulated was that any preventive injunction against the press\n       must be &quot;based on reasonable grounds for keeping the\n       administration of justice unimpaired&quot; and that, there must be\n       reasonable ground to believe that the danger apprehended is real\n       and imminent. The Court went by the doctrine propounded by\n       Holmes J of &quot;clear and present danger&quot;. This Court treated the\n       said doctrine as the basis of balance of convenience test. Later\n       on, the injunction was lifted after subscription to debentures had\n       closed.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       31....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       32. Thus, the principle of open justice is not absolute. There can\n       be exceptions in the interest of administration of justice. In\n       Mirajkar, the High Court ordered that the deposition of the\n       defence witness should not be reported in the newspapers. This\n       order of the High Court was challenged in this Court under\n       <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 32.</a> This Court held that apart from <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 151</a> of the\n       Code of Civil Procedure, the High Court had the inherent\n       power to restrain the press from reporting where administration\n       of justice so demanded. This Court held vide para 30 that\n       evidence of the witness need not receive excessive publicity as\n       fear of such publicity may prevent the witness from speaking the\n       truth. That, such orders prohibiting publication for a temporary\n       period during the course of trial are permissible under\n       the inherent powers of the court whenever the court is satisfied\n       that interest of justice so requires. As to whether such a\n       temporary prohibition of publication of court proceedings in the\n       media under the inherent powers of the court can be said to\n       offend <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> rights [which includes freedom of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                    Page 15 of 42</span>\n        press to make such publication], this Court held that an order of\n       a court passed to protect the interest of justice and the\n       administration of justice could not be treated as violative of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19(1)(a) [</a>see para 12]. The judgment of this Court in\n       Mirajkar is delivered by a Bench of 9- Judges and is binding on\n       this Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">20.     In Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar and Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra\nand Anr.AIR 1967 SC 1 the Supreme Court was dealing with a issue\nwhere an order was passed by the High Court not to publish reports\nregarding the evidence of one of the witnesses. This was a curb on the\nprinciple of public trial in open Court. A nine Judge Bench of the Supreme\nCourt held that the High Court has inherent jurisdiction to hold a trial in\ncamera. The Supreme Court held as follows:-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">       &quot;21. Having thus enunciated the universally accepted\n       proposition in favour of open trials, it is necessary to consider\n       whether this rule admits of any exceptions or not. ........That is\n       why we feel no hesitation in holding that the High Court has\n       inherent jurisdiction to hold a trial in camera if the ends of\n       justice clearly and necessarily require the adoption of such a\n       course. It is hardly necessary to emphasise that this inherent\n       power must be exercised with great caution and it is only if the\n       court is satisfied beyond the doubt that the ends of justice\n       themselves would be defeated if a case is tried in open court\n       that it can pass an order to hold the trial in camera; but to deny\n       the existence of such inherent power to the court would be to\n       ignore the primary object of adjudication itself. The principle\n       underlying the insistence on hearing causes in open court is to\n       protect and assist fair, impartial and objective administration of\n       justice; but if the requirement of justice itself sometimes\n       dictates the necessity of trying the case in camera, it cannot be\n       said that the said requirement should be sacrificed because of\n       the principle that every trial must be held in open court....&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                      Page 16 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"> 21.    Similarly, reference may also be had to the judgment of Supreme\nCourt in Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd.vs. Proprietors of Indian Express\nNewspapers, Bombay Pvt. Ltd. and Ors., AIR 1989 SC 190. In that case\nthe petitioner had made a public issue of Secured Convertible Debentures.\nA petition was filed in the Karnataka High Court and in the Delhi High\nCourt challenging the consent of the Controller of Capital Issues. In the\nTransfer Petition, the Supreme Court granted an injunction order directing\nthat the issue would be proceeded with „without let or hindrance&#x27;. Certain\nadverse reports were published commenting adversely on the debentures.\nThe petitioners had objected to the reports claiming that the effect was to\ncomment on a matter which was subjudice and to undermine the effect of\ninterim order passed by this Court. Trial by newspaper on an issue which\nis sub-judice was argued to be grossest mode of interference with the due\nadministration of justice. The Supreme Court issued an order of injunction\nrestraining the respondents from publishing any article, comment, report or\nany editorial questioning the legality or validity of any of the consents,\napprovals or permissions for issue of the Secured Full Convertible\nDebentures. Hence, the Supreme Court ordered restraint on publication.\nNeedless to add that after the time for subscription to the debentures had\nclosed and the imminent danger to the subscription subsided, the Supreme\nCourt held that continuance of the injunction is no longer necessary. The\nSupreme Court applied the test of real and imminent danger in order to\ninfer as to whether the proposed publication would lead to an interference\nin the course of justice for the purpose of grant or non-grant of interim\ninjunction of prior restraint against publication.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                  Page 17 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> 22.

The next issue would be as to under what facts and circumstances,\nthe Court should exercise its jurisdiction to grant an injunction regarding\npublication of news items or broadcasting of programmes. The\nConstitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/86964673/\" id=\"a_53\">Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd. and\nOrs. vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India and Anr.</a> (supra) held as\nfollows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">       42. .... But, what happens when courts are required to balance\n       important public interests placed side by side. For example, in\n       cases where presumption of open justice has to be balanced with\n       presumption of innocence, which as stated above, is now\n       recognized as a human right. These presumptions existed at the\n       time when the Constitution was framed [existing law under\n       <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19(2)]</a> and they continue till date not only as part of rule\n       of law under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 14</a> but also as an <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 21</a> right. The\n       constitutional protection in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> which protects the rights\n       of the person for a fair trial is, in law, a valid restriction\n       operating on the right to free speech under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, by\n       virtue of force of it being a constitutional provision. Given that\n       the postponement orders curtail the freedom of expression of\n       third parties, such orders have to be passed only in cases in\n       which there is real and substantial risk of prejudice to fairness\n       of the trial or to the proper administration of justice which in the\n       words of Justice Cardozo is &quot;the end and purpose of all laws&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">       However, such orders of postponement should be ordered for a\n       limited duration and without disturbing the content of the\n       publication. They should be passed only when necessary to\n       prevent real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial (court\n       proceedings), if reasonable alternative methods or measures\n       such as change of venue or postponement of trial will not\n       prevent the said risk and when the salutary effects of such\n       orders outweigh the deleterious effects to the free expression of\n       those affected by the prior restraint. The order of postponement\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                       Page 18 of 42</span>\n        will only be appropriate in cases where the balancing test\n       otherwise favours non-publication for a limited period. It is not\n       possible for this Court to enumerate categories of publications\n       amounting to contempt. It would require the courts in each case\n       to see the content and the context of the offending publication.\n       There cannot be any straightjacket formula enumerating such\n       categories. In our view, keeping the above parameters, if the\n       High Court/ Supreme Court (being Courts of Record) pass\n       postponement orders under their inherent jurisdictions, such\n       orders would fall within &quot;reasonable restrictions&quot; under\n       <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 19(2)</a> and which would be in conformity with societal\n       interests, as held in the case of Cricket Association of Bengal\n       (supra)...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">       43. In the light of the law enunciated hereinabove, anyone, be he\n       an accused or an aggrieved person, who genuinely apprehends\n       on the basis of the content of the publication and its effect, an\n       infringement of his/ her rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a> to a fair trial and\n       all that it comprehends, would be entitled to approach an\n       appropriate writ court and seek an order of postponement of the\n       offending publication/ broadcast or postponement of reporting of\n       certain phases of the trial (including identity of the victim or the\n       witness or the complainant), and that the court may grant such\n       preventive relief, on a balancing of the right to a fair trial and\n       <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> rights, bearing in mind the abovementioned\n       principles of necessity and proportionality and keeping in mind\n       that such orders of postponement should be for short duration\n       and should be applied only in cases of real and substantial\n       risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice or to the\n       fairness of trial.

From the mere reading of the excerpts from the judgment\n       of <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_63\">Sahara India</a> (supra), it can be said that the High Court has\n       ample powers under its inherent powers to restraint the\n       publication in media in the event it arrives at the finding that\n       the said publication may result in interference with the\n       administration of justice or would be against the principle of\n       fair trial or open justice. Although the aforenoted observations\n       seem to suggest that the Court can restrain the publication of\n       the news relating to Court proceedings or postpone the same in\n       order obtain the fair trial.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158887669\" id=\"span_34\">The later part of the judgement in\n       <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_64\">Sahara India</a> (supra) suggest that the order of the prior restraint\n       is a preventive order and the said order may proceed to restrain\n       any publication which may cause obstruction of the justice\n       which include intrusion in right to have open justice unbiased\n       by any public opinion expressed in publication. Thus, the\n       interference with the course of justice as a term is not merely\n       confined to the restraint order only on the publications relating\n       to pending Court proceedings. But also, any publication which\n       would give excessive adverse publicity to the accused or\n       alleged victim which may likely to hamper the fair trial in\n       future is also covered within the ambit and sweep of the enquiry\n       of the Court as to what may constitute the interference with the\n       course of the justice....</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       ................\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158887669\" id=\"span_35\">49.

The present matter is at the stage of preliminary enquiry by the police.\nThe question is whether it will be appropriate for the Court to grant stay on\npublication at this preliminary stage.

For the legal position in this regard, reference may be had to the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_66\">Sidhartha Vashisht vs. State\n(NCT of Delhi</a>), AIR 2010 SC 2352. That was a case in which the accused\nwas tried for the offence of murder. In that case, the learned senior counsel\nappearing for the appellant submitted that the appellant had been specifically\ntargeted and maligned before and during the proceedings by the media,\ndespite his acquittal by the Trial Court. The Apex Court while discussing the\nrole of the media and press opined that there is a danger of serious risk of\nprejudice if the media exercises an unrestricted and unregulated freedom.\nThe Court further stated that certain articles and news appearing in the\nnewspaper immediately after the date of occurrence did cause confusion in\nthe mind of the public. In this regard, the relevant paras are as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       &quot;148. Despite the significance of the print and electronic media\n       in the present day, it is not only desirable but least that is\n       expected of the persons at the helm of affairs in the field, to\n       ensure that trial by media does not hamper fair investigation by\n       the investigating agency and more importantly does not\n       prejudice the right of defence of the accused in any manner\n       whatsoever.

He is ostracised, humiliated and convicted without\n       trial. All this puts at grave risk due administration of justice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       8. It is common knowledge that such trials and investigative\n       journalism and publicity of pre-mature, half baked or even\n       presumptive facets of investigation either by the media itself or\n       at the instance of Investigating Agency has almost become a\n       daily occurrence whether by electronic media, radio or press.\n       They chase some wrong doer, publish material about him little\n       realizing the peril it may cause as it involves substantial risk to\n       the fairness of the trial.

In that case\nthe accused were sentenced to death for abduction and murder. The appeal\nwas filed against the conviction by the accused persons. The main attack of\ndefence was the dishonest, shoddy and incomplete investigation by the\npolice. The prosecution proved that the victim was made unconscious, killed\nand his body parts were dismembered. The police during investigation for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                      Page 23 of 42</span>\n the recovery of body parts arranged for a camera to shoot the recovery\nprocess. The Special Prosecutor conceded that such disclosure by the Police\nin respect of their leads while collecting evidence affected the quality of\ninvestigation. The Court while stating that due to media interference the\nauthenticity of the investigation is questionable held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       &quot;120. ...When the investigation is in embryo stage, the police\n       should eschew themselves from any publicity. It is high time\n       for the police officer to understand their responsibility not to\n       approach the media to get cheap and objectionable publicity\n       which makes the criminal justice system not transparent but\n       patchy and hazy. Right to information is wrongly interpreted by\n       the police as right to inform. High degree of secrecy is a must\n       when the investigation is in process. The publication of the\n       matter in the print/electronic media and highhanded telecast and\n       immature comments of the anchors of the TV media may\n       mislead the people as public opinion is bound to be influenced\n       by the manner the case is projected and ultimately affect the\n       sanctity and fairness of the criminal trial. The overzealous\n       efforts made by the prosecution to telecast the investigation i.e.\n       discovery panchanama dilutes the investigation and lends\n       support to the argument of the defence that the police from the\n       beginning were not fair in the investigation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"142906\" id=\"span_43\">29.    Reference may be had to be judgment in the case of M.S. Ravi &amp; Ors.\nMANU/KE/1298/2009. The High Court of Kerala <a href=\"/doc/142906/\" id=\"a_70\">in that case</a> was dealing\nwith a publication of an article relating to a case of murder of a Nun. The\nissue concerned was whether the article amounted to contempt of court. On\nthe issue of media interfering with the due course of justice, the Court held\nas follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       &quot;16. We notice that there is a growing tendency among the\n       media to make comments on the merits of the cause pending\n       before the courts, while reporting on pending proceedings. Talk\n       shows are held even on the merits of interim orders passed by\n       the courts. Conflicting views, even on interim orders, are\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                      Page 24 of 42</span>\n        broadcast and the anchor, in some cases, finally pronounce the\n       verdict also. Such trial by media is sure to prejudice either the\n       prosecution/Plaintiff/Petitioner or the accused/Defendant/\n       Respondent. Such programmes of the media have the effect of\n       interfering with the administration of justice and therefore, will\n       amount to criminal contempt. The theory of our system of\n       justice is that &quot;the conclusions to be reached in a case will be\n       induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not\n       by outside influence, whether of private talk or public print&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">       Such programmes make a mockery of this theory against\n       outside influence. &quot;The right to sue and defend in courts is the\n       alternative of force in an organised society. It is the right\n       conservative of all other rights and lies at the foundation of\n       orderly Government&quot;. But, the said cardinal right is being\n       infringed by such talk shows. To keep the viewers remain glued\n       to their programme in the evening, the channels broadcast such\n       talk shows. But, in that process, unknowingly, the system of\n       administration of justice of our State is being weakened and\n       distorted. Interference even with police investigation will\n       amount to interference with the due course of justice.\n       Influencing the investigating officer will also amount to\n       contempt of court.....&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">30.    The power of the High Court to order restrain of publication in the\nmedia would clearly encompass the stage when the criminal case against\nthe accused is at the preliminary enquiry or investigation stage also.

In that case the High Court was dealing with\na petition where a public figure claimed protection against publication\nunder her right of privacy. The Division Bench noted that publication of\nthe excerpts of the proposed publication had occurred much prior to the\nfiling of the suit. In those facts the Division Bench held that private life of\npublic figure does become matter of public interest. It was in those facts\nthat the Division Bench held that there was no question of any irreparable\nloss and injury since the respondent had herself claimed damages which\nwould be a remedy in case she is able to establish defamation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"562656\" id=\"span_47\">Next case is <a href=\"/doc/562656/\" id=\"a_72\">Tata Sons Limited vs. Greenpeace International &amp;\nAnr.</a>, 178(2011) DLT 705. That was a case in which the plaintiff was said\nto be developing an eco-friendly port. However, the defendants were\nraising concerns about probable dangers to the nesting and breeding of\nOlive Ridley Turtles by the proposed port in various quarters. It was\naverred by the plaintiff that the contentions of the defendant are false,\nfrivolous and misleading on facts.</span> It is further urged that the defendants\nhad gone a step further and had made an online game titled „Turtle vs.\nTATA‟. It was urged that the impugned game and the defendant‟s use of\nTATA mark amounts to defamation with an ulterior motive of damaging\nits reputation. It was in those facts that this High Court held as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       &quot;28. The English common law precedent on awarding interim\n       injunctions in cases of defamation is set out by the case of\n       Bonnard (supra). In Bonnard it was decided that an interim\n       injunction should not be awarded unless a defence of\n       justification by the Defendant was certain to fail at trial level.\n       The Court&#x27;s observations, widely applied in subsequent\n       judgments are as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">             ...[The subject-matter of an action for defamation is\n             so special as to require exceptional caution in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                      Page 26 of 42</span>\n              exercising the jurisdiction to interfere by injunction\n             before the trial of an action to prevent an anticipated\n             wrong. The right of free speech is one which it is for\n             the public interest that individuals should possess,\n             and, indeed, that they should exercise without\n             impediment, so long as no wrongful act is done; and,\n             unless an alleged libel is untrue, there is no wrong\n             committed; but, on the contrary, often a very\n             wholesome act is performed in the publication and\n             repetition of an alleged libel. Until it is clear that an\n             alleged libel is untrue, it is not clear that any right at\n             all has been infringed; and the importance of leaving\n             free speech unfettered is a strong reason in cases of\n             libel for dealing most cautiously and warily with the\n             granting of interim injunctions.... In the particular\n             case before us, indeed, the libelous character of the\n             publication is beyond dispute, but the effect of it\n             upon the Defendant can be finally disposed of only\n             by a jury, and we cannot feel sure that the defence of\n             justification is one which, on the facts which may be\n             before them, the jury may find to be wholly\n             unfounded; nor can we tell what may be the damages\n             recoverable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       Again, in Fraser v. Evans [1969] 1 QB 349 Lord Denning MR\n       stated the law as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              The court will not restrain the publication of an\n              article, even though it is defamatory, when the\n              Defendant says he intends to justify it or to make\n              fair comment on a matter of public interest. That has\n              been established for many years ever since Bonnard\n              v. Perryman. The reason sometimes given is that the\n              defences of justification and fair comment are for\n              the jury, which is the constitutional tribunal, and not\n              for a judge. But a better reason is the importance in\n              the public interest that the truth should out.... There\n              is no wrong done if it is true, or if [the alleged libel]\n              is fair comment on a matter of public interest.

The Court held that granting\nan injunction would freeze the entire public debate on the effect of the\nport project on the Olive Ridley Turtle‟s Habitat. On those grounds, the\ninterim injunction was declined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">       The facts of these two cases are entirely different from what is\nbeing said and alleged by the plaintiff in the present case. Here the issue\nis as to whether the acts done by the defendant are subservient and\nobstructing the course of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"18451876\" id=\"span_50\">33.    The learned senior counsel appearing for defendant No.1 has also\nstrongly relied upon the judgement of this High Court in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/18451876/\" id=\"a_73\">Naveen Jindal vs. Zee Media Corporation Ltd. and Anr.</a> (supra) which\njudgment was given on 01.04.2014. As per the facts given, the case dealt\nwith a situation where the plaintiff appears to have been contesting the\nelections for the third time from the Kurukshetra Lok Sabha Constituency\nin Haryana. It was averred by the plaintiff <a href=\"/doc/18451876/\" id=\"a_74\">in that case</a> that the allegations\nwhich were subject matter of that suit were aired by the defendants in the\nnews programmes from 01.03.2014 and 24.03.2014 were per se\ndefamatory and were repeated 131 times against the plaintiff which not\nonly effected the sentiments of a particular community and caste but also\ndone with a view to damage the prospect of the plaintiff in getting elected\nto the Parliament in the ensuing elections. The allegations that were\nlevelled against the plaintiff have been reproduced hereinafter when\ndealing with the preliminary submissions of the defendant.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">34.    It was averred by the plaintiff therein that the allegations made by\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                     Page 28 of 42</span>\n the reporters of defendant No.1 against plaintiff No.1 were per se\ndefamatory and that the defendants therein had unleashed a campaign of\nvilification.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">35.    This court, however, concluded that prima facie there may be\nincorrect statements or inaccurate statements which were made by the\ndefendants which may not be to the liking of the plaintiff or which may\nbe causing annoyance to the plaintiff therein but were not per se\ndefamatory. Having arrived at that conclusion the Court held that to\nrestrain the defendants from pre-telecasting of programmes or              news\narticles or reporting the same would not only be gagging the Right to\nFreedom of Press      but also gagging of the public to know about              a\ncandidate who is sought to be elected by its electorate. Hence, this Court\n<a href=\"/doc/18451876/\" id=\"a_75\">in that case</a> granted limited relief to the plaintiff whereby the defendants\nwere directed to obtain the view of plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 therein in case\nthey intend to televise any programme pertaining to plaintiff No. 1 or its\ncompanies and to ensure that the interviews/comments are simultaneously\nreflected at the end of said programme. In my view the conclusions arrived\nat by the Court are based on those facts. That judgment does not have any\napplication to the facts of the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18451876\" id=\"span_52\">36.     I will also here to deal with the preliminary objections raised by the\ndefendant. It has been urged that the said earlier suit was filed by the\nplaintiff being CS(OS) 881/2014 titled <a href=\"/doc/18451876/\" id=\"a_76\">Naveen Jindal &amp; Anr. vs. Zee\nMedia Corporation &amp; Ors.</a> (supra). The reliefs claimed by the plaintiff in\nthe present suit, it is urged, are covered by the reliefs claimed in the earlier\nsuit. The facts of that case as already elaborated were that the plaintiff was\ncontesting the Lok Sabha Elections from the Kurukshetra Lok Sabha\nConstituency in Haryana. It was averred that allegations are being aired by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                       Page 29 of 42</span>\n the defendants in their news programme which were per se defamatory and\nwere repeated 131 times against the plaintiff. A perusal of the allegations\nmade would show that there were several allegations most of which related\nto the conduct and behavior of the plaintiff as a Member of Parliament etc.\nThe allegations which were subject matter of the said suit read as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">   &quot;6. In order to deal with these allegations which were leveled against\n   plaintiff No. 1, it may be pertinent here to refer to the allegations\n   which have been reproduced by the plaintiff, which are as under:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       • Congress candidate Naveen Jindal during his campaign for\n       3rd inning had to face brunt of the people. The Member of\n       Parliament could not give any answer when some people\n       confronted him with the frauds going on since 10 years and his\n       inability to fulfil the promises made at the time of election.\n       • When people asked him as to why he has not fulfilled the\n       promises made by him and people expressed their anger in this\n       regard, then netaji became angry and started blaming the\n       people. His security guards also misbehaved with the\n       people. Jindal went to the extent of saying Ok don&#x27;t vote for\n       me.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       • You will be shocked to see Naveen Jindal caught in an\n       imbroglio with the people of Kurukshetra which is his own\n       constituency. But this is true.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       • The people of Kumhar community were voting for him on\n       this very condition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">       • But see the high headedness of the Member of Parliament\n       that he even went to the extent of saying them that they should\n       not vote for him. If you do not believe, then listen to this. In\n       the meanwhile, the security guards of Jindal not only\n       misbehaved with the public but they also pushed aside all those\n       who came to complaint.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">       • The entire Kumhar community is extremely unhappy and\n       rather angry on hearing such words from the mouth of their\n       own Member of Parliament and the treatment given to them by\n       the security guards of Jindal. They are at a complete loss to\n       understand as to what was their fault, whether it is a crime to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                    Page 30 of 42</span>\n        ask question from their own Member of Parliament who is a\n       liar.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">       • Naveen Jindal could not tolerate this behaviour of theirs and\n       you can see the manner in which he has misbehaved with the\n       members of prajapat community.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       • Thereafter when he tried to raise his point in the workers\n       meeting then he misbehaved and ignored and the body guards\n       pushed him aside. Such kind of attitude has left a totally\n       negative impact on the prajapati community.\n       • Several of our correspondents have joined us. We will gather\n       information from them and will discuss on this issue.\n       • Generally, whenever a leader goes to public, he listens to the\n       grievance of the people and he should talk with the people in a\n       very polite manner. But it is not so in this case. The security\n       guards of Jindal highly misbehaved with the local people. You\n       can feel the impact of such an incident.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">       • History is a witness that whenever a minor spark has risen\n       from any area of Haryana the same has always turned into a\n       massive demonstration. Whether it is the demonstration of JP\n       or of Jat community or of transport employees or of farmers.\n       Such agitations always emerge in the form of small sparks and\n       turn into a monstrous demonstration. The witness to this is the\n       incident of yesterday. The members of Prajapat community are\n       not confined only in the areas of Kurukshetra or Gulachika\n       alone but it is spread throughout Haryana in vast numbers. In\n       Sonepat also, there are large members of this community.\n       Voters of prajapat community play a significant role in\n       Haryana and in this case Naveen Jindal has succeeded in\n       reaching Lok Sabha twice due to these Kumhars. But his\n       conduct towards them shows nothing but his high-headedness\n       and the downfall of a person always starts from such conducts.\n       He has started his own doom. Now it depends upon the\n       members of the Kumhar community to make its future plans\n       for the coming Lok Sabha Elections.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">       • All this will definitely leave a negative impact.\n       • You have seen the incident which has happened with a\n       particular community. If we see the whole incident, we clearly\n       find the high-headedness of Naveen Jindal.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                    Page 31 of 42</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        • He is undoubtedly a very high-headed person and it actually\n       shows somewhere or the other. You can see his attitude\n       towards employees of his own company with whom they are\n       talking.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">       • The every effect of this defeat in the coming elections is now\n       clearly visible on the face of Naveen Jindal and in his\n       speeches.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">       • Even otherwise, the attitude of Naveen Jindal is like this.\n       Whenever we ask any question from him, he shows his high\n       headedness. Earlier also, he had done exactly the same with\n       our camera during a discussion with him. He had jerked the\n       camera when our reporter tried to ask a question from him. His\n       conduct is visible in the public also. He will have to pay for his\n       attitude.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">       • Public also knows how to reply the anger. Public has only\n       one power with them which is their vote and you have seen\n       this for yourself in the recent elections of Delhi Assembly.\n       Now when the elections are very near, then public will\n       definitely give its reply which will cause sleepless nights to\n       several leaders. Public will give its fitting reply to Jindal Sahib\n       by means of voting.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">       • Frustration is self evident. He has won twice from this\n       constituency and now he is here for the third time. Such a\n       conduct on his part with the public just before the elections can\n       cause a huge loss to the Congress party in the entire Haryana.\n       We are receiving inputs that this prajapat community is spread\n       in entire Haryana and it is a very strong community and that\n       several other communities are also attached with this\n       community.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">       • But is he absolutely unafraid of the results. High command\n       has given him a free hand to deal with the public in the manner\n       he wants.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">       • Someone will definitely question his attitude. Public will not\n       tolerate such kind of conduct. Public will give its\n       representative through voting and the results of Lok Sabha\n       elections will definitely show the negative impact in the\n       Kurukshetra. You have just seen the conduct of one kind. The\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                       Page 32 of 42</span>\n        candidate will have to bear the brunt for his conduct at every\n       cost.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">       • It is natural that he will have to bear the brunt for his attitude.\n       What do you think?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">       • You must know how to talk with the public when you go to\n       them before the elections. Public will definitely ask question\n       from you when you fail to fulfil all those promises of\n       developments which you had made at the time of last elections.\n       Specially your volunteer who is widely advertising for you and\n       whatever he is saying before the people, will be the same\n       position with all the workers and such a situation will become\n       the biggest problem.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">       • His mines in Bhilwara has been cancelled or is likely to be\n       cancelled while as he has no mines.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">37.    In those facts and circumstances, this Court declined to give a\nblanket pre-telecast restraint order. Directions were passed that the\ndefendants therein would obtain views of the plaintiffs in case they intend\nto televise any program pertaining to plaintiff No.1 or his companies so\nthat the said interview, comment or their side of the story is simultaneously\nreflected at the end of the said programme.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_57\">38.    This suit is based on alleged defamatory publication/broad casts\npertaining to a specific complaint filed by Mrs.ABC before the\nChhattisgarh High Court. There are serious allegations of outraging the\nmodesty of the lady and rape etc. As per the orders of the Chhattisgarh\nHigh Court the police is to take steps on the complaint which is filed by the\nsaid Mrs.ABC in accordance with the guidelines <a href=\"/doc/18451876/\" id=\"a_77\">laid down by</a> the Supreme\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_78\">Lalita Kumari vs. Government of Uttar Pradesh &amp;\nOrs.</a>(supra). The earlier suit being CS(OS) 881/2014 had nothing to do\nwith the said publications on the allegations of Mrs.ABC. This is obvious\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                         Page 33 of 42</span>\n from a reading of the allegations which are the subject matter of the earlier\nsuit. The cause of action for the present suit is entirely different. There is\nno merit in the submission of the defendant that the present suit does not\nlie in view of CS(OS)881/2014 filed earlier by the plaintiffs.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">39.    I will now deal with the two other preliminary            submissions of\ndefendant No.1. One of the submissions is that the lady who has made the\nallegations, namely, Mrs.ABC is a necessary or proper party. A perusal of\nthe plaint shows that there is no relief sought against Mrs. ABC. The issue is\nas to whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the plaintiff is\nentitled to an injunction against the defendant. Relief that will be granted by\nthis court or declined by this court is not going to affect Mrs.ABC. The said\nMrs.ABC is neither a necessary nor a proper party to the present suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">       The next contention raised by defendant No. 1 is that the plaintiff is\nguilty of suppression of material facts. In the course of arguments, the\ndefendants have not been able to point out any material fact which would in\nany way have a bearing on this case which has been suppressed by the\nplaintiff. For the purpose of this application, there are no merits in the said\nsubmission also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">40.    Coming to the facts of this case. The background of the Complaint\nwhich is lodged by Mrs.ABC is to be noted. There are certain disputes\npending between the JSPL and Mrs.ABC regarding various transactions that\ntook place regarding sale of land since 1999. Mrs. ABC filed a Civil Suit\nno.4A/2009 for possession of her land and claimed damages against JSPL in\n2009. The Suit was decreed vide Order dated 15.03.2013. JSPL being\naggrieved by the same filed an appeal which has been remanded back vide\nOrder dated 02.01.2015. Further Mrs.ABC wrote a letter to the plaintiff\ndated 20.08.2008 seeking compensation for the land purchased by JSPL. On\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                      Page 34 of 42</span>\n 26.07.2010 Mrs. ABC wrote a letter to the Superintendent of the Police,\nChattisgarh complaining that JSPL has made unauthorized construction on\nthe land belonging to her and also requested suitable compensation. On\n18.08.2010, FIR no. 142/2010 under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_79\">section 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_80\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_81\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_82\">294</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_83\">506</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_84\">323</a> IPC was registered at PS Raigarh by Mrs. ABC. FIR No.143/2010 was\nalso lodged by JSPL against Mrs. ABC on the same date.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">       The allegations made before the Chhattisgarh High Court are that in\n2001 Mrs.ABC was threatened by one Mr.D.K.Bhargava. Thereafter the\nsaid Mr.Bhargava and the plaintiff went to her house and robbed her chastity\nand forcibly took her thumb impression on some documents. It is further\nstated that on 18.8.2010 while she was standing on the road she was dragged\ninside the factory of JSPL where unnatural rape was committed on her. This\nis the nature of allegations on which an enquiry is being conducted by the\nChhattisgarh Police. Steps are being taken pursuant to directions dated\n6.1.2015 of the Chhattisgarh High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">41.    Plaintiff has strenuously denied the above allegations against the\nplaintiff pointing out that the allegations are belated and stale, being made\n12 to 14 years after the alleged incident. Further in the various proceedings\nearlier, no such allegation was made by Ms. ABC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">42.    Another relevant fact is the running feud between the two parties.\nThere are allegations made by the plaintiff that in 2012 an attempt to extort\nRs.100 crores was made by Editors of defendant No.1 in conspiracy with the\nChairman of defendant No.1 for &quot;going slow&quot; on the vilification campaign\nagainst the plaintiff and his company regarding reportage. It is the\ncontention of the plaintiff that the demands of defendant No.1 were recorded\nby the officers of the plaintiff in a sting operation carried out at a hotel in\nNew Delhi. Pursuant to this action, FIRs have been lodged. The details of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                     Page 35 of 42</span>\n various proceedings which have been filed against each other have been\nalready narrated above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">43.    The plaintiffs aver that defendants have aired more than 20\ndefamatory and false programs against the plaintiff w.e.f. 7.1.2015 to\n15.1.2015. It is averred that there have been attempts to deliberately\nmisinterpret the orders of the Chhattisgarh High Court. Reference is made\nto a program aired on 13.1.2015 for a duration of 1 hour and 50 minutes\nwhere the anchor is stated to be impressing on the viewers that the police is\nnot following the instructions of the High Court or directions of the\nSupreme Court. It is averred that the anchor was trying to point out as to\nwhether the delay is on account of SSP (Raigarh), IG Police, DIG Police\n(Chhattisgarh), Home Secretary, Home Minister and Chief Minister.\nLeading questions are said to be put to the police pointing out that in an\nallegation of rape, an FIR is to be lodged first and the question of enquiry\nwould not arise. Reference is also made to an interview with Additional\nSuperintendent of Police, Mr.Prafful Kumar which are accusatory in nature\nand blames the police for not lodging an FIR despite order passed by the\nChhattisgarh High Court. It is averred that defendants are interfering with\nthe administration of justice and are trying to conduct a media trial and to\ncause deliberate harm and prejudice to the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">44.    It is urged that the publication and televising of such articles and\nnews programmes is raising a real and imminent threat to pending fair\nenquiry in the matter by the police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">45.    Hence, essentially the plaintiff seeks to press for an ad interim\ninjunction based on two contentions. Firstly, that the defendants are\nmotivated on account of the past litigation between the parties where they\nwere caught trying to extort large amount of money from the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                    Page 36 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\"> Hence, the defendants are actuated by malice and ill will towards the\nplaintiff. The second contention is the conduct of the defendant is such as\nto interfere with the administration of justice and hamper a fair enquiry.\nThe said conduct is an intrusion to the right to open justice unbiased by\nany public opinion expressed in publications. It is urged that the\nprogrammes not only defame the plaintiff but also tend to interfere with the\nadministration of justice and that the entire attempt of the defendant/its\nreporters is to pressurize, browbeat or hectoring/pressurize the police into\nlodging an FIR against the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">46.    I may at this stage take a closer look at the nature of programmes\nbeing telecast as reproduced by the plaintiff and not specifically denied by\nthe defendant. Reference may be had to some of the questions and\nobservations being made in the TV Programme which read as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       &quot;And regarding this we directly asked the Chief Minister of\n       Chhattisgarh, Dr.Raman Singh, when the High Court has\n       passed the order then why is the government not doing\n       anything.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">       Dr.Raman Singh- If the High Court has directed then there\n       won‟t be any problem.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">       Anchor-Rohit Sardana-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">       Chief Minister Raman Singh doesn‟t find it necessary to say\n       more than one line on this issue. He said that High Court has\n       ordered so investigation will be done. But even after the order\n       of the High Court, complaint has not been lodged, when we\n       asked this question, no one had the answer to this. Before\n       showing this report we tried to get the view point of Naveen\n       Jindal on this issue. After this statement, we thought of showing\n       you this report.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">       Anchor-Rohit Sardana-Welcome Mr.Praful Kumar.

It is 2015. There is\n       so much delay. If it had been 2003, then it wouldn‟t have been\n       the delay.

He\n       says that the court has not asked him to investigate, it has asked\n       him to enquire. Although, it has already been a week since the\n       court has passed its order, but the enquiry is still going on. And\n       just think, if the police is saying that one who has complained is\n       not found at her home so they are not able to proceed further.\n       From this we can understand the intention of the police and the\n       seriousness with which it wants to enquire.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">       .....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">       Reporter-Devesh- The police officers are repeatedly telling a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                     Page 38 of 42</span>\n        bundle of lies because on the first day itself after the order on\n       Wednesday when the lady reached the SP office. SP met her\n       himself and kept her there from morning till evening. The first\n       mistake that the police did was that they did not have a lady\n       police present there. And even then they heard the complete\n       story of the lady and then again the police tried to get the\n       statement of the victim. SP left by saying that you give it in\n       writing and then the police official did not meet the lady. And\n       now on the phone line, the ASP said that they are regularly\n       sending the police to the house of the victim and the statement\n       is not being recorded. The lady is clearly telling in her\n       statement that the goons of the company are regularly visiting\n       her home, her family members are being threatened, her\n       daughter is threatened to be raped, how can such a lady stay at\n       home. As per the order of the High Court, she has been\n       provided four security guards by the Bilaspur SP and those\n       guards are provided by the Raigarh District police itself. The\n       lady has been kept at a separate place to protect her from the\n       goons. We were there for the interview and police guards were\n       also there with the lady. Even then if the ASP says that they\n       don‟t have information about where the lady is, clearly explains\n       that somewhere the police is evading and is not trying to\n       register a case.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">       ................\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">       Reporter-Shailesh-No Rohit. It is very much clear that\n       somewhere the police is going slow in this case and it would be\n       interesting to see when the police takes the next action even\n       after the High Court gave its order one week ago. In supremacy,\n       High Court come next to the Supreme Court, and the order of\n       the High Court clearly says that further action should be taken\n       in this case. We should see that.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">       ANCHOR- Devesh...hasn‟t anyone asked the Women\n       Commission as to why they are not coming forward in this\n       case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">       Reporter-Devesh-The women Commission has constantly\n       maintained silence on this issue. Apart from Women\n       Commission, senior officials of the police has kept silence in\n       this matter.

If the police desires, statements and\n       enquiry, what the High Court has said, can be done in two days.\n       But the attitude of police is such that it doesn‟t want the\n       investigation to happen and this matter proceeds further. Even\n       the lady is questioning as to what is that benefit due to which\n       police is not willing to do its duty. The lady also said in her\n       interview that constant pressure is being created by the\n       company and the police. What is the reason that even after the\n       order of the High Court, police is not investigating the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">       ANCHOR- Allegation of rape was made on Aasaram, he had\n       to go to jail, Nityanand was alleged for rape, legal action was\n       also taken against him. Rape allegation was also made on the\n       journalist Tarun Tejpal in November 2013, legal action was\n       taken. In June 2009 Shiney Ahuja was also charged for rape by\n       his maid, police took action <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_85\">in that case</a> also. Initially, Shiney\n       Ahuja also said that the allegations are false and he is being\n       framed.

The nature of the programme, the questions and observations show\nthey    are likely to prejudice the police and hamper the course of\ninvestigation/ inquiry which is being conducted by the police. I am\npersuaded to come to this conclusion on seeing the nature of questions\nbeing put by the Anchor in various TV programmes. As an example, I may\nrefer to the questions of the Anchor in asking the ASP as to who is\nresponsible for the presumed delay i.e. SSP Rai Garh, IG Police, DG\nChattisgarh, Home Secretary, Home Minister or the Chief Minister.\nAnother example is an observation by the reporter that the Women\nCommission and the police have maintained silence. Another example is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                    Page 40 of 42</span>\n the observation what the High Court has said can be done in two days if\nthe police so desire.        The programmes are replete with such\nquestions/observations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">48.    The nature of questioning done by the reporters of defendants, the\nextent of coverage being done by the defendants does show that an attempt\nis being prima facie made to prod the police if not pressurize. The plaintiff\nhave made out a prima facie case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">49.    In these facts would the plaintiff be entitled to an injunction to\nrestrain the defendants from publishing reports or airing reports pertaining\nto the allegations which are pending before the police by Mrs. ABC. Legal\nposition as explained above is quite clear. Any publication which gives\nexcessive adverse publicity to an accused or which is likely to hamper fair\ntrial and constitutes an interference with the course of justice could be a\nground for grant of injunction. The court has ample inherent power to\nrestrain publication in media in the event it arrives at a finding that the said\npublication may result in interference with the administration of justice or\nwould be against the principle of fair trial or open justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">50.    The balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff. Serious\nprejudice will be caused to plaintiff in case injunction is not granted.\nAccordingly, the defendants 1 and 2, their associates are restrained by an\norder of injunction from publishing any article or right-ups or telecasting\nprogrammes on the allegations against the plaintiff as made by Mrs. ABC\neither in the complaint or before the police, till the time the police\ncompletes its enquiry and, if necessary, investigation and files an\nappropriate report/document before the court. The injunction passed is of a\ntemporary nature and is applicable only till the police completes its\npreliminary enquiry or any other investigation if required that may be done\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">CS(OS) 143/2015                                                       Page 41 of 42</span>\n at a later stage.
