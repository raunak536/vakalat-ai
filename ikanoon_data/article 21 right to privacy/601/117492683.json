However, it held that as of the date of its order, it was not open to\n\n     itto traverse beyond the provisions of Rule 3B in the exercise of the jurisdiction\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\n14   Prima facie, quite apart from the issue of constitutionality which has been\n\n     addressed before the High Court, it appears that the High Court has taken an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                           7</span>\n\n     unduly restrictive view of the provisions of clause (c) of Rule 3B.   Clause (c)\n\n     speaks of a change of marital status during an ongoing pregnancy and is\n\n     followed in parenthesis by the words “widowhood and divorce”. The expression\n\n     “change of marital status” should be given a purposive rather than a restrictive\n\n     interpretation. The expressions “widowhood and divorce” need not be construed\n\n     to be exhaustive of the category which precedes it.\n\n\n15   The fundamental principle of statutory interpretation is that the words of a\n\n     statute must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and\n\n     ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act and the intent of the\n\n     legislature. Parliament by amending the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_15\">MTP Act</a> through Act 8 of 2021 intended\n\n     to include unmarried women and single women within the ambit of the Act. This\n\n     is evident from the replacement of the word ‘husband’ with ‘partner’ in\n\n     Explanation I of <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">\n16   Explanation 1 expressly contemplates a situation involving an unwanted\n\n     pregnancy caused as a result of the failure of any device or method used by a\n\n     woman or her partner for the purpose of limiting the number of children or\n\n     preventing pregnancy. The Parliamentary intent, therefore, is clearly not to\n\n     confine the beneficial provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_17\">MTP Act</a> only to a situation involving a\n\n     matrimonial relationship. On the contrary, a reference to the expression “any\n\n     woman or her partner” would indicate that a broad meaning and intent has been\n\n     intended to be ascribed by Parliament. The statute has recognized the\n\n     reproductive choice of a woman and her bodily integrity and autonomy. Both\n\n     these rights embody the notion that a choice must inhere in a woman on\n\n     whether or not to bear a child. In recognizing the right the legislature has not\n\n     intended to make a distinction between a married and unmarried woman, in her\n\n     ability to make a decision on whether or not to bear the child. These rights, it\n\n     must be underscored, are in consonance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                           8</span>\n\n     Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">\n17   In this case, the petitioner submits that she was deserted by her partner at the\n\n     last stage in June 2022 causing her immense mental agony, trauma, and\n\n     physical suffering.

The Statement\n\n     of Objects and Reasons of the MTP Act seeks to “liberalise certain existing\n\n     provisions relating to termination of pregnancy … (1) as a health measure—\n\n     when there is danger to the life or risk to physical or mental health of the\n\n     woman”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n18   A comparison between the two provisions before and after the 2021 amendment\n\n     is tabulated below:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">                MTP, 1971                         MTP Amendment 2021\n     Explanation    2:   Where    any    Explanation 1: For the purposes of clause\n     pregnancy occurs as a result of     (a), where any pregnancy occurs as a result\n     failure of any device or method     of failure of any device or method used by\n     used by any married woman or        any woman or her partner for the\n     her husband for the purpose         purpose of limiting the number of\n     of limiting the number of           children or preventing pregnancy, the\n     children, the anguish caused by     anguish caused by such pregnancy may be\n     such unwanted pregnancy may         presumed to constitute a grave injury to the\n     be presumed to constitute a         mental health of the pregnant woman.\n     grave injury to the mental health\n     of the pregnant woman.\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">     The above table shows that the phrase ‘married woman’ was replaced by ‘any\n\n     woman’ and the word ‘husband’ was replaced by ‘partner’.
