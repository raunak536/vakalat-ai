She is running a beauty parlor\n\n  business in the part of shop situated at kh. No.616/2. The\n\n  petitioner/plaintiff is a child born from the relationship of defendants\n\n  No. 1 &amp; 2. Defendant No.1 was intending to execute document of\n\n  property in favour of petitioner/plaintiff, but on the objection raised\n\n  by defendant No.3 who is real sister of petitioner/plaintiff, he could\n\n  not able to execute the documents in accordance with law.\n\n  Defendant No.3 also threatened that she will make it prove that\n\n  plaintiff is not the daughter of defendant No.1 and therefore, the\n\n  cause      of    action   arose       for   getting    the   declaration   that\n\n  petitioner/plaintiff is a child born from the relationship of defendant\n\n  No.1 &amp; 2 along with other reliefs of share in the property. During\n\n  pendency of civil suit, petitioner/plaintiff filed an application under\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence Act for undergoing DNA test of\n\n  defendant No.1 to be conducted by Dr. Ankit Tripathi as also from\n\n  Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate of Forensic\n\n  Science Services, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India,\n\n  Hyderabad.        This    application       was   replied    by    respondent\n\n  No.1/defendant No.1. After considering application, learned trial\n\n  Court dismissed the application by impugned order.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">6. Learned        counsel   for   petitioner/plaintiff     submits    that   the\n\n  petitioner/plaintiff filed civil suit for declaration that petitioner is a\n\n  child born from relationship of defendants No. 1 &amp; 2. Until and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               -4-</span>\n\n\n\n\n  unless the expert report through scientific method is obtained, lis\n\n  pending before the Court below cannot be decided. Undergoing\n\n  DNA test is the only scientific test by which paternity of petitioner\n\n  /plaintiff can be proved. In reply to application under <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 45</a> of\n\n  the Evidence Act, respondent No.1/defendant pleaded that if the\n\n  Court directs to defendant No.1 to undergo DNA test, defendant\n\n  No.1 is ready and willing to comply with the orders passed by the\n\n  Court. Defendant No.1 has not objected to undergo DNA test but\n\n  even then application under <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence Act is\n\n  dismissed on extraneous consideration recording that unless and\n\n  until there is satisfaction of the Court, it cannot be ordered. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_4\">He\n\n  pointed out that in the application under <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence\n\n  Act as well as in the plaint, petitioner/plaintiff has very specifically\n\n  pleaded that defendant is aged about 75 years and is suffering\n\n  from medical ailments. Hence, there is urgency also to order for\n\n  undergoing DNA test of defendant No.1. He contended that when\n\n  DNA test is only a scientific method for proving paternity or\n\n  legitimacy of the birth of petitioner/plaintiff from the relationship of\n\n  defendants No. 1 &amp; 2 then learned trial Court ought to have\n\n  allowed the application. He places reliance upon judgment passed\n\n  in the case of <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_6\">Dipanwita Roy Vs. Ronobroto Roy</a> reported in\n\n  AIR 2015 SC 418.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">10.Perusal of plaint would show that petitioner/plaintiff has specifically\n\n   pleaded that her birth was from the relationship of defendants No.\n\n   1 &amp; 2. Both of them are still residing as husband and wife. In\n\n   application under <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 45</a> of the Evidence Act, it is very\n\n   specifically pleaded that defendant No.1 is aged 75 years and is\n\n   suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Even though the other reliefs\n\n   sought for by the petitioner/plaintiff in the suit is with respect to\n\n   property, but main relief is with respect to declaration of\n\n   petitioner/plaintiff to be a child born from the relationship of\n\n   defendants No. 1 &amp; 2. The other reliefs are consequential. If the\n\n   paternity of petitioner/plaintiff is not proved, then she will continue\n\n   to face social insult. For proving legitimacy or paternity of a child or\n\n   any person, DNA is the only scientific method to prove.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_6\">11.

The matter may be considered from another\n\n           angle. In all such matrimonial cases where\n\n           divorce is sought, say on the ground of impotency,\n\n           schizophrenia etc. normally without there being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                       -6-</span>\n\n\n\n\nmedical examination, it would be difficult to arrive\n\nat a conclusion as to whether the allegation made\n\nby his spouse against the other spouses seeking\n\ndivorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In\n\norder   to   substantiate      such   allegation,   the\n\npetitioner   would     always    insist   on   medical\n\nexamination. If the respondent avoids such\n\nmedical examination on the ground that it violates\n\nhis/her right to privacy or for a matter right to\n\npersonal liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India, then it may in most of\n\nsuch cases become impossible to arrive at a\n\nconclusion. It may render the very grounds on\n\nwhich divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore,\n\nwhen there is no right to privacy specifically\n\nconferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nand with the extensive interpretation of the phrase\n\n&quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read\n\ninto <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as absolute\n\nright. What is emphasized is that some limitations\n\non this right have to be imposed and particularly\n\nwhere two competing interests clash. In mattes of\n\naforesaid    nature    where    the   legislature   has\n\nconferred a right upon his spouse to seek divorce\n\non such grounds, it would be the right of that\n\nspouse which comes in conflict with the so-called\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                -7-</span>\n\n\n\n\n           right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the Court\n\n           has to reconcile these competing interests by\n\n           balancing the interests involved.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">12.

It is borne from the decisions rendered by this\n\n             Court in Bhabani Prasad Jena (supra), and Nandlal\n\n             Wasudeo Badwaik (supra), that depending on the\n\n             facts and circumstances of the case, it would be\n\n             permissible for a Court to direct the holding of a\n\n             DNA examination, to determine the veracity of the\n\n             allegation(s), which constitute one of the grounds,\n\n             on which the concerned party would either succeed\n\n             or lose. There can be no dispute, that if the\n\n             direction to hold such a test can be avoided, it\n\n             should be so avoided. The reason, as already\n\n             recorded in various judgments by this Court, is that\n\n             the legitimacy of a child should not be put to peril.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">             11. The question that has to be answered in this\n\n             case, is in respect of the alleged infidelity of the\n\n             appellant-wife. The respondent-husband has made\n\n             clear and categorical assertions in the petition filed\n\n             by him under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act,\n\n             alleging infidelity. He has gone to the extent of\n\n             naming the person, who was the father of the male\n\n             child born to the appellant-wife. It is in the process\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                               -10-</span>\n\n\n\n\n          of substantiating his allegation of infidelity, that the\n\n          respondent-husband had made an application\n\n          before the Family Court for conducting a DNA test,\n\n          which would establish whether or not, he had\n\n          fathered the male child born to the appellant-wife.\n\n          The respondent feels that it is only possible for him\n\n          to substantiate the allegations levelled by him (of\n\n          the appellant-wife&#x27;s infidelity) through a DNA test.\n\n          We agree with him. In our view, but for the DNA\n\n          test, it would be impossible for the respondent-\n\n          husband to establish and confirm the assertions\n\n          made in the pleadings. We are therefore satisfied,\n\n          that the direction issued by the High Court, as has\n\n          been extracted hereinabove, was to told DNA test\n\n          in circumstances is fully justified. DNA testing is the\n\n          most legitimate and scientifically perfect means,\n\n          which the husband could use, to establish his\n\n          assertion of infidelity. This should simultaneously\n\n          be taken as the most authentic, rightful and correct\n\n          means also with the wife, for her to rebut the\n\n          assertions made by the respondent-husband, and\n\n          to establish that she had not been unfaithful,\n\n          adulterous or disloyal.
