Also, the 1st Respondent/Petitioner has informed that he has seen the order but not able to remember the date of inspection/perusal and also stated that the said order relates to Judiciary and more so, it is a judicial order and as such, he requires a copy of the same.

Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat and others</a>, [AIR 2006 Supreme Court 212], the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that &#x27;The interest of general public (public interest) is of a wide import covering public order, public health, public security, morals, economic welfare of the community and the objects enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution of India viz., &#x27;the Directive Principles of State Policy&#x27;.</span>\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\t30.It is to be pertinently point out that in Latin the term &#x27;Forma&#x27; refers to giving shape to something and forming a pattern. As a matter of fact, Sweden has granted the right of access to Government information under the Freedom of Press Act, 1766, to its citizens. Countries like Canada and Australia have enacted &#x27;Access to Information Act, 1982&#x27; and the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_26\">Freedom of Information Act, 1982</a>&#x27;. England enacted &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_27\">Freedom of Information Act, 2000</a>. Likewise, U.S.A. enacted &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_28\">Freedom of Information Act, 1966</a>&#x27;. In many foreign countries, the concept of &#x27;Iron Screen of Secrecy&#x27; has withered away and given way to an open and free deliberations/discussions coupled with a right to information. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\t31.In short, &#x27;Information&#x27; is like a &#x27;Candle&#x27; which showers light to remove one&#x27;s darkness i.e. Ignorance. In fact, information is energy which kindles one&#x27;s thought culminating in expression based on thinking capacity. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\t32.In the Golden words of R.N.Tagore in the Poem Gitanjali the need for freedom of information has been highlighted and spotlighted [vide verse XXXV]. Also, we recollect the following lines from &#x27;Bible&#x27;:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&#x27;Ye shall no other truth and the\n\t\t\t  truth shall make you free&#x27;     (John \u0016 8:32)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">\t33.Undoubtedly, the Official Secretes Act, 1923 (a colonial legacy) is an off shoot against the movement of Nationalism in our country. Other than this Act, there are some Secrecy Laws like <a href=\"/doc/127060/\" id=\"a_29\">Art. 74</a> and <a href=\"/doc/674146/\" id=\"a_30\">163</a> of the Constitution of India. <a href=\"/doc/127060/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 74</a> of the Constitution of India envisages that there shall be a council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as the head to aid and advise the President and such advise shall not be enquired into any Court. In a similar fashion, <a href=\"/doc/674146/\" id=\"a_32\">Art. 163</a> of the Constitution of India enjoins that &#x27;there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister as the head to aid and advise the Governor and such advise shall not be enquired into by any Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">\t34.That apart, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_33\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>, with <a href=\"/doc/1788561/\" id=\"a_34\">Commissions of Enquiry Act, 1952</a> <a href=\"/doc/715059/\" id=\"a_35\">Atomic Energy Act, Preventive Detention Act, 1962</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1778/\" id=\"a_36\">Prevention of Terrorists Act, 2002</a>, <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_37\">Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985</a> etc. do contain some provisions which lay emphasis on secrecy.

The form of access can be decided by the Public Information Officer concerned subject to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_39\">Right to Information Act</a> that the Information shall be provided in the form in which it is sought unless it would disproportionately divert the resources of the public authority.\t\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\t36.Ordinarily, it is mandatory for a public authority to furnish all accessible information to the citizens except where the information is exempted under the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act. A public authority may permit access to every information in public interest. In case, where the information is exempted from disclosure, then, <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 10</a> of the Act says that access may be given to that part of record which does not contain any information which is exempted from disclosure and which can reasonably be severed from other part that contains the exempted information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">\t37.A mere glance of the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 10</a> of the Act makes it lucidly clear that under <a href=\"/doc/690325/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 10(2)(b)</a> of the Right to Information Act, the Public Information Officer is the deciding authority for granting partial access to records that may contain exempted information. However, when only partial information is disclosed, the Public Information Officer needs to state valid reasons for the decision. Furthermore, he is required to specify his name and designation as the decision maker and the applicant&#x27;s right in regard to the review of the decision including the particulars of A.O., time limit, process fee etc. Only that portion of the record, which does not contain any information, which is exempted from disclosure and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains exempted information, may be furnished. \t \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\t38.If public interest outweighs private interest, then, information has to be furnished, otherwise, the concerned officer can record refusal to part with the information sought for. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_44\">The Right to Information Act</a> is a legislation which has overriding effect on the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_45\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a> (19 of 1923), and any other law for the time being in force as per <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 22</a> of the Act. No wonder, the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_47\">Right to Information Act</a> is a boon to maintain transparency in public administration. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">\t39.<a href=\"/doc/1812801/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 2(e)</a> of the Right to Information Act defines the &#x27;Competent Authority&#x27; as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;(i) the Speaker in the case of the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of a State or a Union territory having such Assembly and the Chairman in the case of the Council of States or Legislative Council of a State;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(ii) the Chief Justice of India in the case of the Supreme Court;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(iii) the Chief Justice of the High Court in the case of a High Court;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(iv) the President or the Governor, as the case may be, in the case of other authorities established or constituted by or under the Constitution;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(v) the administrator appointed under <a href=\"/doc/297117/\" id=\"a_49\">article 239</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">\t40.<a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act defines &#x27;Information&#x27; as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;(f) \u0013information\u0014 means any material in any form, including records, documents,memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers, samples, models, data material held in any electronic form and information relating to any private body which can be accessed by a public authority under any other law for the time being in force.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">\t41.Moreover, <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act means &#x27;Public Authority&#x27; as follows: \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">&quot;any authority or body or institution of self government established or constituted-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(a) by or under the Constitution;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(b) by any other law made by Parliament;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(c) by any other law made by State Legislature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(d) by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government, and\nincludes any-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">(ii)non-Government organisation substantially financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(i) \u0013record\u0014 includes-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">(a) any document, manuscript and file;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">(b) any microfilm, microfiche and facsimile copy of a document;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(c) any reproduction of image or images embodied in such microfilm\n(whether enlarged or not); and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(iii)(d) any other material produced by a computer or any other device.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\t42.<a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 5</a> of the Act makes it obligatory on every public authority to designate as many officers as Central Public Information Officers and State Information Public Officers in all Administrative Units or Offices as may be necessary to furnish necessary information to the individuals requesting information under the Act. The authority is required to designate Central Assistant Public Information Officer and State Assistant Public Information Officer at the Sub Divisional or Sub District level. The Assistant Public Information Officers are to perform two functions: (i) To receive the applications for informations; (ii) To receive appeals under the Act. The Applications/Petitions for information are to be forwarded to the Central Information Commission or State Information Commission as the case may be. These Officers are to be designated at all the aforementioned levels within 100 days of the enactment of the Act. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">\t43.Admittedly, there is no provision under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_53\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> which prescribes the qualification or experience that the Information Officers are required to possess. At this stage, a closer scrutiny of the language employed in <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5</a> of the Act candidly makes it clear that any Officer can be designated as Central Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer. Thus, there is no particular/specific requirement adumbrated for designating an Officer at Sub Divisional or Sub District level.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">\t44.No doubt, the Appeals under <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Right to Information Act against the orders of Public Information Officers are to be preferred before an Officer senior in the rank to Public Information Officer. But, under <a href=\"/doc/1852611/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 19(3)</a> of the Act, a further Appeal lies to Central or State Information Commission against the orders of Central or State Appellate Officer. These authorities are supposed to dispose of such Applications or Appeals within the scheduled time prescribed under the Act. Further, there is no qualification or experience required of these designated Officers to whom the First Appeal lie. However, in contrast, <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_57\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_58\">15(5)</a> of the Act speak for experience and knowledge that the Information Commissioners at the Central and State Levels are required to possess mandatorily. \t\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">\t45.It is to be noted that an Applicant/Requisitionist is not bound to furnish any reason requiring the information or any personal details except those that are necessary for the purpose of contacting him.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">\t46.<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_59\">Under the Right to Information Act</a>, the Central Public Officer/ State Public Information Officer is supposed to deal with the matter where request is made for supply of information within 30 days. However, if the information concerns the life or liberty of a person, it is to be furnished within 48 hours of the receipt of request. If the concerned officer fails to give his decision within 30 days or 48 hours as the case may be, then, he shall be deemed to have refused the request.\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_48\">\t47.If a request is rejected, the concerned officer is to communicate the reasons for denying the request, the time limit within which the Appeal may be filed and the other relevant particulars of the Appellate Authority to the respective individual who made the request.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">\t48.It is the duty of the Public Information Officer to deal with request from persons requiring information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_60\">Right to Information Act</a>. If the concerned request cannot be made in writing, then, he is to render reasonable assistance to the concerned person to reduce the same into writing. If the information sought for is held by or its subject matter is interlinked/connected with the function of another public authority, then, the Public Information Officer under the Act, is to transfer, within 5 days, the request to other public authority and inform the Applicant immediately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">\t49.The Public Information Officer may seek the assistance of any other officer for the proper discharge of his duties. In allowing partial access, the Public Information Officer shall issue notice to the Applicant informing that (a)Only part of the required request after severance of the record containing information which is exempted from disclosure is being provided; (b)The reasons for arriving at a conclusion including any findings on material question of fact, referring to the material on which those findings are based; (c)The name and designation of the person giving the decision; (d)The details of fees calculated by him and the amount of fee which the Applicant is required to deposit; (e)The Applicant&#x27;s rights in regard to reviewing the decision recording the non disclosure of part of information, the amount of fee charged or form of access provided; (f) If the information requested has been supplied by the third party or is treated by confidential by that party, then, the Public Information Officer shall give the written notice to the third party within five days from the date of receipt of request and take his/her representation into account; (g) The third party ought to be given an opportunity to make a representation before the Public Information Officer within ten days from the date of receipt of such notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\t50.Coming to the aspect of penalty provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">Right to Information Act</a>, it is to be pointed out that every Public Information Officer will be liable for fine of Rs.250/- penalty upto a maximum of a Rs.25,000/-. Under <a href=\"/doc/291269/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 20(1)</a> of the Right to Information Act,       (i) for not accepting an application/petition; (ii) delaying information, without reasonable cause; (iii)malafidely denying information; (iv)knowingly furnishing incomplete, incorrect and misleading information; (v)destroying information for which a request has been made; (vi)obstructing the supply of information in any manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">\t51.Undoubtedly, <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 20</a> of the Act, insofar as it relates to imposition of penalty, is penal in character. But before the levy of any penalty on an Officer/Official, enough opportunity is to be afforded to the delinquent/deviant concerned. If the Public Information Officer or concerned Department has not accepted an Application from the Applicant, then, he has the option of transmitting the said Application by post. Also, he can lodge complaint to the respective Information Commission under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 18</a> of the Act. In fact, the Commission has power to impose penalty not exceeding Rs.25,000/- on the concerned errant/deviant officer, who refused to accept the Application from the concerned Applicant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\t52.It is to be remembered that the recommendations of the State Information Commission/Directions issued by it to the concerned authority to take action against an errant Public Information Officer are not binding on the Competent/Public Authority under the Act. It is needless for this Court to point out that it is within the purview of the Public Authority/Competent Authority either to agree with the recommendations/directions so issued or to differ from the views taken by the State Information Commission, in the considered opinion of this Court. It cannot be lost sight of that under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_65\">Right to Information Act</a>, the Public Information Officer concerned is an Independent Authority.  Indeed, he shall not adopt a lackadaisical, a laissez-faire attitude and also not to remain as an indolent person in regard to his discharge of duties under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_66\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">\t53.It cannot be gainsaid that <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 deals with &#x27;exemption&#x27; from disclosure of information in regard to matters falling under (a) to (j) and further <a href=\"/doc/1484095/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8(2)</a> and (3) of the Act refers to the Public Authority who may allow the access to information if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests etc. In fact, the Competent Authority as per <a href=\"/doc/1822230/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 2(e)(iii)</a> and (h) of the Act speaks of &#x27;Competent Authority&#x27; and &#x27;Public Authority&#x27;. While denying the information as required under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8(e)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005, the undermentioned facts can be taken into account by the concerned authority. They are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(a)Whether supplying/furnishing information on public records would impede the investigation/apprehension/prosecution;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(b)Whether the information is such that can be refused/denied to Parliament or State Legislature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(c)Whether public interest in disclosure earns the protected interest;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(d)<a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 22</a> of the Right to Information Act has an overriding effect and as such, the legal procedure enshrined for quasi judicial proceedings gets overridden by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_72\">Right to Information Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">\t54.A closer scrutiny of the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 18</a> of the Act clearly point out that the State Information Commission has power to conduct an enquiry in a matter before it. The Information Commission is empowered to ascertain whether the endorsement made by the Public Information Officer is quite in tune with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_74\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. Moreover, the Information Commission can also find out whether the information sought for by the Applicant has been wilfully/purposely held back or the same has not been supplied within the prescribed time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\t55.In a case of an Appeal under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 19</a> of the Act, as per <a href=\"/doc/641541/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 18(4)</a> of the Act, the State Information Commission prior to the passing of an order (pertaining to an information of a third party) is to necessarily issue a notice to the third party for providing a reasonable opportunity, by adhering to the principles of Natural Justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">\t56.It is to be pointed out that &#x27;Right to Privacy&#x27; is recognised as basic human right in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 12</a> of Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 and <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 17</a> of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966. Added further, the concept of &#x27;Right to Privacy&#x27; is an essential component of right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">\t57.Under two contingencies, the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 8</a> of the Right to Information Act, gets attracted viz., (i) If the information is personal in nature and has no nexus or relationship to any public activity or interest; and (ii)furnishing of the same would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual as per the decision in Kunche Durga Prasad V.

Really speaking, the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_82\">Right to Information Act</a> enjoins that every public authority has to update its publications under <a href=\"/doc/1576851/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 4(1)(b)</a> every year. In fact, the Central/ State Government/Departments are to come out with necessary/ general instructions for time bound updating of all categories of information including formats of publication. Every public authority in turn must publish updated information i.e. Specific to its functions adhering to the guidelines. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">\t59.Apart from the above, the Central Information Commission will transmit an annual report to the Central Government on the implementation of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_84\">Right to Information Act</a> at the end of the year. Likewise, the State Information Commission will send a report to the State Government. Each Ministry has a duty to compile reports from its public authorities and send them to Central Information Commission or State Information Commission as the case may be. Each Report will contain details of number of requests received by each public authority, number of rejections and appeals, particulars of any disciplinary action taken, amount of fees and charges calculated etc. \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\t60.The Central Government is to table the Central Information Commission Report before the Parliament after the end of each year.

Similar is the mandate under <a href=\"/doc/785969/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 350</a> read with 345 of the Constitution of India, as per the decision in State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Uttarakhand V.

As a matter of fact, the ingredients of the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_98\">Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</a> are procedural in character. <a href=\"/doc/762785/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 15</a> of the Act contemplates three methods in and by which cognizance of a criminal contempt can be taken by a Hon&#x27;ble High Court or Supreme Court for its own content. In respect of criminal contempt of a subordinate Court only two methods are specified in the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_100\">Contempts of Court Act</a> which can be sought in aid in regard to the taking of cognizance by the Court of record.

State of Gujarat and others</a>, [AIR 1991 Supreme Court 2176] at special pages 2179 &amp; 2180], it is observed and laid down as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\t\t&quot;The plea that the Supreme Court has no supervisory jurisdiction over the High Court or other subordinate Courts and therefore, it does not possess powers which High Courts have under <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 215</a> is misconceived.  <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 227</a> confers supervisory jurisdiction on the High Court and in exercise of that power High Court may correct judicial orders of subordinate Courts, in addition to that, the High Court has administra- tive control over the subordinate courts. Supreme Court&#x27;s power to correct judicial orders of the subordinate courts under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 136</a> is much wider and more effective than that contained under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 227.</a> Absence of administrative power of superintendence, over the High Court and subordinate court does not affect this Court&#x27;s wide power of judicial superintendence of all courts in India. Once there is power of judicial superintendence, all the Courts whose orders are amenable to correction by this Court would be subordinate courts and therefore this Court also possesses similar inherent power as the High Court has under <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 215</a> with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts. The jurisdiction and power of a superior Court of Record to punish contempt of subordinate courts was not founded on the court&#x27;s administrative power of superintendence, instead the inherent jurisdiction was conceded to superior Court of Record on the premise of its judicial power to correct the errors of subordinate Courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">\tSince the Supreme Court has power of judicial super- intendence and control over all the courts and Tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country, it has a corresponding duty to protect and safeguard the interest of inferior courts to ensure the flow of the stream of justice in the courts without any interference or attack from any quarter. The subordinate and inferior courts do not have adequate power under the law to protect themselves, therefore, it is necessary that this Court should protect them. Under the constitutional scheme it has a special role in the administration of justice and the powers conferred on it under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 32</a><a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_109\">, 136</a><a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_110\">, 141</a> and <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_111\">142</a> form part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The amplitude of the power of the court under these Articles of the Constitution cannot be curtailed by law made by Central or State Legislature.  No doubt High Courts have power to persist for the contempt of subordinate courts but that does not affect or abridge the inherent power of this court under <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 129.</a> The Supreme Court and the High Court both exercise concurrent jurisdiction under the constitutional scheme in matters relating to fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_114\">226</a> of the Constitution, therefore this Court&#x27;s jurisdiction and power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts would not be inconsistent to any constitutional scheme. There may be occasions then attack on Judges and Magistrate of subordinate courts may have wide repercussions through out the country, in that situation it may not be possible for a High Court to contain the same, as a result of which the administration of justice in the country may be paralysed, in that situation the Apex Court must intervene to ensure smooth functioning of courts. The Apex Court is duty bound to take effective steps within the constitutional provisions to ensure a free and fair administration of justice through out the country. For that purpose it must wield the requisite power to take action for contempt of subordinate Courts. Ordinarily, the High Court would protect the subor- dinate courts from any onslaught on their independence, but in exceptional cases, extraordinary situation may prevail affecting the administration of public justice or where the entire judiciary is affected, the Supreme Court may directly take cognizance of contempt of subordinate Courts. However, it was observed that the Supreme Court will sparingly exercise its inherent power in taking cognizance of the contempt of subordinate Courts, as ordinarily matters relating to contempt of subordinate Courts must be dealt with by the High Courts. The instant case is of exceptional nature as the incident created a situation where functioning of the subordinate courts all over the country was adversely affected and the administration of justice was paralysed, therefore, this Court took cognizance of the matter.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"994171\" id=\"span_6\">68.That apart, in regard to a criminal contempt of a High Court, a private party can approach the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court with the consent in writing of the Advocate General.

If the Hon&#x27;ble High Court is prima facie satisfied that the information received by it regarding commission of a Contempt of Subordinate Court is not frivolous and the contempt lodged is not either technical or a small one, in its discretion, act suo motu and commence the proceedings against the contemner. But this method of suo motu cognizance of contempt of a subordinate court ought to be resorted to sparingly and only where the contempt concerned is of a serious nature. The High Court is not compelled or bound to proceed against a contemnor just for the sake of reference from a subordinate court. It may reject or discharge the reference, if, in its view it is based on allegations which are totally devoid of substance, as per the decision <a href=\"/doc/1205665/\" id=\"a_121\">XXV Additional Sessions Judge, Bangalore V.

However, if the High Court acts on information obtained from its own sources, such as from perusal of records of a subordinate court or on reading of a report in a Newspaper or hearing of a public speech, where there being any reference from the subordinate court or the Learned Advocate General, it can be said to have taken cognizance on its own motion. However, if the High Court is directly approached by means of a petition by a private individual, feeling aggrieved, not being the Advocate General, then, the High Court  in such a contingency, has  a discretion to refuse to entertain the petition or to take cognizance on its own accord on the basis of information supplied to it in the said petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">\t72.Further, the word &#x27;Reference&#x27; means &#x27;conveying information&#x27;.

It may appear to be enterprising or tempting for any one to have access to every possible information for an individual whether it relates to an individual or not.

It is that injury to public interest is the reason for the exclusion from disclosure of documents whose contents, if disclosed, would injure public and national interest. Public interest which demands that evidence be withheld is to be weighed against the public interest in the administration of justice that courts should have the fullest possible access to all relevant materials. When public interest outweighs the latter, the evidence cannot be admitted. The Court will proprio motu exclude evidence, the production of which is contrary to public interest. It is in public interest that confidentiality shall be safeguarded. The reason is that such documents become subject to privilege by reason of their contents. Confidentiality is not a head of privilege. It is not that the contents contain material which it would be damaging to the national interest to divulge but rather that the documents would be of a class which demand protection. To illustrate the class of documents would embrace Cabinet papers, Foreign Office dispatches, papers regarding the security to the State and high level interdepartmental minutes. In the ultimate analysis the contents of the document are so described that it could be seen at once that in the public interest the documents are to be withheld.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">An objection under Section 123 is raised by an affidavit affirmed by the head of the department. The Court may also require a Minister to affirm an affidavit. That will arise in the course of the enquiry by the Court as to whether the document should be withheld from disclosure. If the Court is satisfied with the affidavit evidence, that the document should be protected in public interest from production the matter ends there. If the Court would yet like to satisfy itself the Court may see the document. This will be the inspection of the, document by the Court. Objection as to production as well as admissibility contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_144\">section 162</a> of the Evidence Act is decided by the Court in the enquiry.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">\tThe documents in respect of which exclusion from production was claimed were the Blue book being rules and instructions for the protection of the Prime Minister when on tour and in travel. The Under Secretary, Confidential Department, came to Court and gave evidence that the Blue book was a document relating to the affairs of State and was not to be disclosed. The Chief Secretary filed an affidavit on 20 September, 1973 and claimed privilege in respect of the Blue book by submitting that the document related to affairs of State and should, therefore, be excluded from production. Held that in the facts and circumstances of the present case the affidavit affirmed by Chief Secretary on 20 September, 1973 was an affidavit objecting to the production of the documents. The oral evidence of the Under Secretary as well as the aforesaid affidavit showed that objection was taken at the first instance. Where no affidavit was filed an affidavit could be directed to be filed later on. If an affidavit was defective an opportunity could be given to file a better affidavit. It is for the court to decide whether the affidavit is clear in regard to objection about the nature of documents. The Court can direct further affidavit in that behalf. The blue book was an unpublished official record. Any publication of parts of the blue book which might be described as innocuous part of the document would not render the entire document a published one. If the Court found on inspection that any part of the document was innocuous in the sense that it did not relate to affairs of State the Court could order disclosure of the innocuous part provided that would not give a distorted or misleading impression. Where the Court orders disclosure of an innocuous part the Court should seal up the other parts which are said to be noxious because their disclosure would be undesirable. AIR 1974 All 324 Reversed.

Even the dependence of tribunals on the sponsoring or parent department for infrastructural facilities or personal may undermine the independence of the tribunal (vide Wade &amp; Forsyth: Administrative Law, 10th Edn., Public Prosecutor.774 and 777).&quot; \t\t\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\tAlso, in the aforesaid decision at page 55 &amp; 56, in paragraph 101, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">&quot;101.Independent judicial tribunals for determination of the rights of citizens, and for adjudication of the disputes and complaints of the citizens, is a necessary concomitant of the rule of law. The rule of law has several facets, one of which is that disputes of citizens will be decided by Judges who are independent and impartial; and that disputes as to legality of acts of the Government will be decided by Judges who are independent of the executive. Another facet of the rule of law is equality before law. The essence of the equality is that it must be capable of being enforced and adjudicated by an independent judicial forum. Judicial independence and separation of judicial power from the executive are part of the common law traditions implicit in a Constitution like ours which is based on the Westminster model.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">\tMoreover, in the aforesaid decision, in paragraph 120, at page 67, it is held that &#x27;... (xiii) Two-member Benches of the Tribunal should always have a judicial member. Whenever any larger or special Benches are constituted, the number of technical members shall not exceed the judicial members&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">\t83.In the decision Namit Sharma V. Union of India, [2013-2-L.W. at page 1], at Special Pages 38 to 40, wherein in Paragraphs 90 to 95, it is observed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\t\u001390. As already noticed, in the United Kingdom, the Information Rights Tribunal and the Information  Commissioners are to deal with the matters arising from both, the FOIA as well as the Data Protection Act, 1998. These tribunals are discharging quasi judicial functions. Appointments to them are dealt with and controlled by the TCEA. These appointments are treated as judicial appointments and are covered under Part 2 of the TCEA. Section 50 provides for the eligibility conditions for judicial appointment. Section 50(1)(b) refers to a person who satisfies the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on an N-year basis. A person satisfies that condition on N-year basis if (a) the person has a relevant qualification and (b) the total length of the person\u0012s qualifying periods is at least N years. Section 52 provides for the meaning of the expression \u0011gain experience in law\u0012 appearing in Section 50(3)(b). It states that a person gains experience in law during a period if the period is one during which the person is engaged in law-related activities. The essence of these statutory provisions is that the concerned person under that law is required to possess both a degree as well as experience in the legal field. Such experience inevitably relates to working in that field. Only then, the twin criteria of requisite qualification and experience can be satisfied.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">\t91. It may be of some relevance here to note that in UK, the Director in the office of the Government Information Service, an authority created under the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_151\">Freedom of Information Act, 2000</a> possesses a degree of law and has been a member of the Bar of the District of Columbia and North Carolina in UK. The Principal Judge of Information Rights Jurisdiction in the First-tier Tribunal, not only had a law degree but were also retired solicitors or barristers in private practice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">\t92. Thus, there exists a definite requirement for appointing persons to these posts with legal background and acumen so as to ensure complete faith and confidence of the public in the independent functioning of the Information Commission and for fair and expeditious performance of its functions. The Information Commissions are required to discharge their functions and duties strictly in accordance with law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">\t93. In India, in terms of sub-Section (5), besides being a person of eminence in public life, the necessary qualification required for appointment as Chief Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner is that the person should have wide knowledge and experience in law and other specified fields. The term \u0011experience in law\u0012 is an expression of wide connotation. It presupposes that a person should have the requisite qualification in law as well as experience in the field of law. However, it is worthwhile to note that having a qualification in law is not equivalent to having experience in law and vice-versa. \u0011Experience in law\u0012, thus, is an expression of composite content and would take within its ambit both the requisite qualification in law as well as experience in the field of law. A person may have some experience in the field of law without possessing the requisite qualification. That certainly would not serve the requirement and purpose of the Act of 2005, keeping in view the nature of the functions and duties required to be performed by the Information Commissioners. Experience in absence of basic qualification would certainly be insufficient in its content and would not satisfy the requirements of the said provision. Wide knowledge in a particular field would, by necessary implication, refer to the knowledge relatable to education in such field whereas experience would necessarily relate to the experience attained by doing work in such field. Both must be read together in order to satisfy the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_152\">Sections 12(5)</a> of and 15(5) the Act of 2005. Similarly, wide knowledge and experience in other fields would have to be construed as experience coupled with basic educational qualification in that field.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">\t94. Primarily it may depend upon the language of the rules which govern the service but it can safely be stated as a rule that experience in a given post or field may not necessarily satisfy the condition of prescribed qualification of a diploma or a degree in such field. Experience by working in a post or by practice in the respective field even for long time cannot be equated with the basic or the prescribed qualification. In absence of a specific language of the provision, it is not feasible for a person to have experience in the field of law without possessing a degree in law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"732151\" id=\"span_12\">In somewhat different circumstances, this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/732151/\" id=\"a_153\">State of Madhya Pradesh v. Dharam Bir</a> [(1998) 6 SCC 165], while dealing with Rule 8(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Industrial Training (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1985, took the view that the stated qualification for the post of Principal Class I or Principal Class II were also applicable to appointment by promotion and that the applicability of such qualification is not restricted to direct appointments. Before a person becomes eligible for being promoted to the post of Principal, Class II or Principal, Class-I, he must possess a Degree or Diploma in Engineering, as specified in the Schedule. The fact that the person had worked as a Principal for a decade would not lead to a situation of accepting that the person was qualified to hold the post. The Court held as under :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">\t\u001332. \u0013Experience\u0014 gained by the respondent on account of his working on the post in question for over a decade cannot be equated with educational qualifications required to be possessed by a candidate as a condition of eligibility for promotion to higher posts. If the Government, in exercise of its executive power, has created certain posts, it is for it to prescribe the mode of appointment or the qualifications which have to be possessed by the candidates before they are appointed on those posts. The qualifications would naturally vary with the nature of posts or the service created by the Government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">\t33. The post in question is the post of Principal of the Industrial Training Institute. The Government has prescribed a Degree or Diploma in Engineering as the essential qualification for this post. No one who does not possess this qualification can be appointed on this post. The educational qualification has a direct nexus with the nature of the post. The Principal may also have an occasion to take classes and teach the students. A person who does not hold either a Degree or Diploma in Engineering cannot possibly teach the students of the Industrial Training Institute the technicalities of the subject of Engineering and its various branches.\u0014\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">\t95.Thus, in our opinion, it is clear that experience in the respective field referred to in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act of 2005 would be an experience gained by the person upon possessing the basic qualification in that field. Of course, the matter may be somewhat different where the field itself does not prescribe any degree or appropriate course. But it would be applicable for the fields like law, engineering, science and technology, management, social service and journalism, etc.\n\n\tAlso, in the aforesaid decision at page 44 &amp; 45 in paragraphs 106 &amp; 107, it is observed and laid down as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">&quot;106.For the elaborate discussion and reasons afore-recorded, we  pass the following order and directions: \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">1.The writ petition is partly allowed. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">2.The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_155\">Sections 12</a>(5 ) and 15(5) of the Act of 2005 are held to be constitutionally valid, but with the rider that, to give it a meaningful and purposive interpretation, it is necessary for the Court to \u0011read into\u0012 these provisions some aspects without which these provisions are bound to offend the doctrine of equality. Thus, we hold and declare that the expression \u0011knowledge and experience\u0012 appearing in these provisions would mean and include a basic degree in the respective field and the experience gained thereafter. Further, without any peradventure and veritably, we state that appointments of legally qualified, judicially trained and experienced persons would certainly manifest in more effective serving of the ends of justice as well as ensuring better administration of justice by the Commission. It would render the adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and nuances of law, more adherent to justice and shall enhance the public confidence in the working of the Commission. This is the obvious interpretation of the language of these provisions and, in fact, is the essence thereof. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">3. As opposed to declaring the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_157\">15(6)</a> unconstitutional, we would prefer to read these provisions as having effect \u0011post-appointment\u0012. In other words, cessation/ termination of holding of office of profit, pursuing any profession or carrying any business is a condition precedent to the appointment of a person as Chief Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner at the Centre or State levels. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">4.There is an absolute necessity for the legislature to reword or amend the provisions of Senior Counsel <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 12(5)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_159\">12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_160\">15(5)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_161\">15(6)</a> of the Act. We observe and hope that these provisions would be amended at the earliest by the legislature to avoid any ambiguity or impracticability and to make it in consonance with the constitutional mandates. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">5.We also direct that the Central Government and/or the competent authority shall frame all practice and procedure related rules to make working of the Information Commissions effective and in consonance with the basic rule of law. Such rules should be framed with particular reference to <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_163\">28</a> of the Act within a period of six months from today. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">6.We are of the considered view that it is an unquestionable proposition of law that the Commission is a \u0011judicial tribunal\u0012 performing functions of \u0011judicial\u0012 as well as \u0011quasi-judicial\u0012 nature and having the trappings of a Court. It is an important cog and is part of the court attached system of administration of justice, unlike a ministerial tribunal which is more influenced and controlled and performs functions akin to the machinery of administration. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">7.It will be just, fair and proper that the first appellate authority (i.e. the senior officers to be nominated in terms of <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 5</a> of the Act of 2005) preferably should be the persons possessing a degree in law or having adequate knowledge and experience in the field of law. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">8.The Information Commissions at the respective levels shall henceforth work in Benches of two members each. One of them being a \u0011judicial member\u0012, while the other an \u0011expert member\u0012. The judicial member should be a person possessing a degree in law, having a judicially trained mind and experience in performing judicial functions. A law officer or a lawyer may also be eligible provided he is a person who has practiced law at least for a period of twenty years as on the date of the advertisement. Such lawyer should also have experience in social work. We are of the considered view that the competent authority should prefer a person who is or has been a Judge of the High Court for appointment as Information Commissioners. Chief Information Commissioner at the Centre or State level shall only be a person who is or has been a Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of India. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">9.The appointment of the judicial members to any of these posts shall be made \u0011in consultation\u0012 with the Chief Justice of India and Chief Justices of the High Courts of the respective States, as the case may be. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">10.The appointment of the Information Commissioners at both levels should be made from amongst the persons empanelled by the DoPT in the case of Centre and the concerned Ministry in the case of a State. The panel has to be prepared upon due advertisement and on a rational basis as afore-recorded.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">11.The panel so prepared by the DoPT or the concerned Ministry ought to be placed before the High-powered Committee in terms of <a href=\"/doc/372537/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 12(3)</a>, for final recommendation to the President of India. Needless to repeat that the High Powered Committee at the Centre and the State levels is expected to adopt a fair and transparent method of recommending the names for appointment to the competent authority. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">12.The selection process should be commenced at least three months prior to the occurrence of vacancy. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">13.This judgment shall have effect only prospectively.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">14.Under the scheme of the Act of 2005, it is clear that the orders of the Commissions are subject to judicial review before the High Court and then before the Supreme Court of India. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution, the judgments of the Supreme Court are law of the land and are binding on all courts and tribunals. Thus, it is abundantly clear that the Information Commission is bound by the law of precedence, i.e., judgments of the High Court and the Supreme Court of India. In order to maintain judicial discipline and consistency in the functioning of the Commission, we direct that the Commission shall give appropriate attention to the doctrine of precedence and shall not overlook the judgments of the courts dealing with the subject and principles applicable, in a given case. It is not only the higher court\u0012s judgments that are binding precedents for the Information Commission, but even those of the larger Benches of the Commission should be given due acceptance and enforcement by the smaller Benches of the Commission. The rule of precedence is equally applicable to intra appeals or references in the hierarchy of the Commission. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">\t107.The writ petition is partly allowed with the above directions, however, without any order as to costs.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_13\">84.In the decision <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_167\">Bihar Public Service Commission V.

The expression \u0011public interest\u0012 has to be understood in its true connotation so as to give complete meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The expression \u0011public interest\u0012 must be viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify denial of a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its common parlance, the expression\u0011public interest\u0012, like \u0011public purpose\u0012, is not capable of any precise definition . It does not have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and state of society and its needs. [<a href=\"/doc/41868/\" id=\"a_168\">State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh</a> (AIR 1952 SC 252) = (1952) 62 L.W. 527].

The decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring that larger public interest outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the provision. Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may come to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it within the ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there may be cases where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual. All these protections have to be given their due implementation as they spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the balance factor between right to privacy and right to information with the purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge from the constitutional values under the Constitution of India.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\tAlso, in the aforesaid decision, at page 295, in paragraphs 29 &amp; 30, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">&quot;Firstly, the members of the Board are likely to be exposed to danger to their lives or physical safety. Secondly, it will hamper effective performance and discharge of their duties as examiners. This is the information available with the examining body in confidence with the interviewers. Declaration of collective marks to the candidate is one thing and that, in fact, has been permitted by the authorities as well as the High Court. We see no error of jurisdiction or reasoning in this regard. But direction to furnish the names and addresses of the interviewers would certainly be opposed to the very spirit of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the Act.\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">The disclosure of names and addresses of the members of the Interview Board would exfacie endanger their lives or physical safety. The possibility of a failed candidate attempting to take revenge from such persons cannot be ruled out. On the one hand, it is likely to expose the members of the Interview Board to harm and, on the other, such disclosure would serve no fruitful much less any public purpose. Marks are required to be disclosed but disclosure of individual  names would hardly hold relevancy either to the concept of transparency or for proper exercise of the right to information within the limitation of the Act.                  \t\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">\t85.The requirement of a judicial mind/legal person in a quasi-judicial body has been internationally approved and recognised.

Moreover, the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of High Court [as Competent Authority \u0016 Public Authority under <a href=\"/doc/140273920/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 2(e)(iii)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/140273920/\" id=\"a_186\">2(h)(a)</a> of the Act, 22 of 2005 and also Plenipotentiary in the Judicial hierarchy] can be provided with an enough freedom and inbuilt safeguards in exercising his discretionary powers either to furnish the information or not to part with the information, as prayed for by any applicant much less the 1st Respondent/Petitioner. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">\t95.That apart, if the copies of the Minutes dated 16.12.2010 and 07.03.2011 are supplied to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, then, the interest of the administration of the High Court will get jeopardised and also it will perforce the Petitioner/High Court to furnish the informations sought for by the concerned Applicants/Requisitionists as a matter of usual course without any qualms or rhyme or reasons/ restrictions. In effect, to uphold the dignity and majesty of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court \u0016 being an Independent Authority under the Constitution of India, some self-restrictions are to be imposed as regards the supply of internal/domestic functioning of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court and its office informations in respect of matters which are highly confidential in nature inasmuch as it concerns with the Intricate, Internal Discussions and Deliberations, Notings, Jottings and Administrative Decisions taken on various matters at different levels and as such, they are exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 8(e)(i)(j)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Even otherwise, they are not open to litigants/public without restrictions. No wonder, it can be fittingly observed that if Impartiality is the Soul of Judiciary, then, Independence is the Life Blood of Judiciary. Also that, without Independence, Impartiality cannot thrive/survive.\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">\t96.In short, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner are furnished, then, it will prejudicially affect the confidential interest, privacy and well being of the High Court, in the considered opinion of this Court. In any event, the 1st Respondent/Petitioner cannot invoke the aid of Clause 37 of Amended Letters Patent dealing with &#x27;Regulation of Proceedings&#x27; and also Order XII [pertaining to the entitlement of Certified Copies] of the Rules of the High Court, Madras, Appellate Side, 1965, since they are not applicable to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\t97.For the foregoing elaborate discussions and reasons and on an overall assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case which float on the surface, we unhesitatingly hold that the contention of the Public Information Officer, Office of the Registrar, High Court, Madurai Bench of Madras High Court pointing out before the 2nd Respondent/ Tamil Nadu Information Commission that &#x27;the Commission, on numerous occasions, has determined procedures for receipt of documents from Court&#x27; as if it is a Judicial order, is not legal. Likewise, the order of the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai in Case No.11224/Enquiry/A/2012 dated 22.05.2012, in advising the 1st Respondent/Petitioner to obtain the copies of the Minutes, by filing a Copy Application before Court, as per the procedure followed by the Judicial Department and closing the case, is prima facie unsustainable in the eye of law. Accordingly, this Court, in the interest of Justice, interferes with the said order dated 22.05.2012 in Case No.11224/Enquiry/A/ 2012 passed by the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai and sets aside the same, to advance the cause of Justice. Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed. No costs. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    (E.D.R.J.)
