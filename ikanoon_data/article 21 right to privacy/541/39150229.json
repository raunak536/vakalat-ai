He also          submitted that in that\n\nstatement, the petitioner has stated that he wants DNA test. He further\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner has earlier moved before this Court in Cr.M.P.\n\nNo.127 of 2021 challenging the cognizance order as well as the order\n\nrejecting the prayer for DNA test of the child. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_2\">He submitted that although\n\nthe Court has not interfered with the cognizance order, however liberty was\n\nprovided to the petitioner to file a petition for conducting DNA test of the\n\nchild at proper stage. He submitted that the petition has been filed on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner, which has been rejected by the learned court vide\n\norder dated 15.09.2022 on flimsy ground. He further submitted that in the\n\nimpugned order only on the ground of delay, the prayer for DNA test has\n\nbeen rejected in spite of the observation of the High Court. To buttress his\n\narguments, he relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_8\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>; [(2003) 4 SCC 493].</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_3\">4.

The matter may be considered from another angle. In\n            all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the\n            ground of impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally without\n            there being medical examination, it would be difficult to arrive\n            at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made by a spouse\n            against the other spouse seeking divorce on such a ground, is\n            correct or not. In order to substantiate such allegation, the\n            petitioner would always insist on medical examination. If the\n            respondent avoids such medical examination on the ground\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        3                        W.P. (Cr) No. 536 of 2022</span>\n\n\n             that it violates his/her right to privacy or for that matter right\n             to personal liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the\n             Constitution of India, then it may in most of such cases\n             become impossible to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the\n             very grounds on which divorce is permissible nugatory.\n             Therefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically\n             conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and with\n             the extensive interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">             this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as\n             an absolute right. What is emphasized is that some limitations\n             on this right have to be imposed and particularly where two\n             competing interests clash. In matters of the aforesaid nature\n             where the legislature has conferred a right upon his spouse to\n             seek divorce on such grounds, it would be the right of that\n             spouse which comes in conflict with the so-called right to\n             privacy of the respondent. Thus the court has to reconcile\n             these competing interests by balancing the interests involved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">                79. If despite an order passed by the court, a person\n             refuses to submit himself to such medical examination, a\n             strong case for drawing an adverse inference would be made\n             out. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act also enables a\n             court to draw an adverse inference if the party does not\n             produce the relevant evidences in his power and possession.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                80. So viewed, the implicit power of a court to direct\n             medical examination of a party to a matrimonial litigation in a\n             case of this nature cannot be held to be violative of one&#x27;s right\n             of privacy.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">5.    On these grounds, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that\n\nthe impugned order dated 15.09.2022 is bad in law and direction may kindly\n\nbe issued for DNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"971977\" id=\"span_5\">6.    Per contra Mr. Ashok Kumar Yadav, learned Sr.S.C.-I appearing for the\n\nrespondent-State submitted that there are serious allegations of rape of a\n\nchild against the petitioner and in each and every cases, DNA test is not a\n\nrule. He further submitted that in a case of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 376</a> of\n\nIPC committed by the petitioner then the result of the DNA test by itself\n\nwould be of no avail. Contra, if the oral evidence of the witnesses including\n\nthat of prosecutrix are found to be not sufficient to hold the petitioner guilty\n\nof the charge of rape, then the result of the DNA test even if it would go to\n\nestablish the paternity will equally be of no avail. He also submitted that in\n\na case of rape medical evidence is not always final but medical evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      4                       W.P. (Cr) No. 536 of 2022</span>\n\n\nplays the role of secondary evidence. He submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court has held in <a href=\"/doc/971977/\" id=\"a_15\">M.P. v. Dayal Sahu</a>; (AIR 2005 SC 3570)\n\nthat non-examination of doctor in a case of rape is not always fatal to the\n\nprosecution when the testimony of the prosecutrix inspires confidence of\n\nthe Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1950410\" id=\"span_7\">He relied upon the judgments passed in <a href=\"/doc/1950410/\" id=\"a_16\">Anandamay Bag v.\n\nState of West Bengal</a> &amp; anr.; (2007 SCC OnLine Cal 249) , Sabur\n\nHossain Biswas @ Paltu v.

In light of the above submissions of the learned counsel for the\n\nparties, the Court has perused the materials on record and finds that\n\nadmittedly the petitioner is charged under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 376</a> of IPC and under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 4</a>/<a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_19\">6</a> of POCSO Act. The seriousness of such type of cases was\n\nsubject matter in <a href=\"/doc/158643373/\" id=\"a_20\">State of Rajasthan v. Om Prakash</a>; [(2002) 5 SCC\n\n745] wherein in paragraph 19, it has been held as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               &quot;19. Child rape cases are cases of perverse lust for sex\n            where even innocent children are not spared in pursuit of\n            sexual pleasure. There cannot be anything more obscene than\n            this. It is a crime against humanity. Many such cases are not\n            even brought to light because of the social stigma attached\n            thereto. According to some surveys, there has been a steep\n            rise in child rape cases. Children need special care and\n            protection. In such cases, responsibility on the shoulders of\n            the courts is more onerous so as to provide proper legal\n            protection to these children. Their physical and mental\n            immobility call for such protection. Children are the natural\n            resource of our country. They are the country&#x27;s future. Hope\n            of tomorrow rests on them. In our country, a girl child is in a\n            very vulnerable position and one of the modes of her\n            exploitation is rape besides other modes of sexual abuse.\n            These factors point towards a different approach required to\n            be adopted. The overturning of a well-considered and well-\n            analysed judgment of the trial court on grounds like non-\n            examination of other witnesses, when the case against the\n            respondent otherwise stood established beyond any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                       5                        W.P. (Cr) No. 536 of 2022</span>\n\n\n            reasonable doubt was not called for. The minor contradiction\n            of recovery of one or two underwears was wholly\n            insignificant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_10\">8.    The responsibility on the shoulders of the courts is more onerous so\n\nas to provide proper legal protection to the children, which was considered\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_21\">State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh</a>;\n\n[(1996) 2 SCC 384] in paragraph 21 of <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_22\">the said judgment</a>, which reads as\n\nunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             &quot;21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in\n            particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are\n            celebrating woman&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no\n            concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of\n            indifference of the society towards the violation of human\n            dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a\n            rapist not only violates the victim&#x27;s privacy and personal\n            integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as\n            physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical\n            assault -- it is often destructive of the whole personality of\n            the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his\n            victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female.\n            The courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while\n            trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with\n            such cases with utmost sensitivity. The courts should examine\n            the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by\n            minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the\n            statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature,\n            to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If\n            evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be\n            relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in\n            material particulars. If for some reason the court finds it\n            difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look\n            for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short\n            of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The\n            testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the\n            background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive\n            to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases\n            involving sexual molestations.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_11\">9.    In several decisions, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that in a case of\n\nrape medical evidence is not always final but medical evidence plays the\n\nrole of secondary evidence including the judgments relied by Mr. Ashok\n\nKumar Yadav, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State. Even\n\npresuming that earlier plea was taken by the petitioner for DNA test, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                       6                       W.P. (Cr) No. 536 of 2022</span>\n\n\nsaid test cannot be allowed in a routine way. For deciding the case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 376</a> of IPC, paternity of the child is not relevant as the same can be\n\ndecided on oral evidence. Therefore, holding of DNA test will not be\n\nrelevant to the consideration of the charge. The leading decision on this\n\npoint is the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_24\">Goutam Kundu v. State of West Bengal</a>; [1993\n\n(3) SCC 418], where Their Lordships of the Supreme Court held that no\n\nperson can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis against his or\n\nher will and no adverse inference can be drawn for such refusal.

The Court should therefore examine the\n                proportionality of the legitimate aims being pursued i.e.\n                whether the same are not arbitrary or discriminatory, whether\n                they may have an adverse impact on the person and that they\n                justify the encroachment upon the privacy and personal\n                autonomy of the person, being subjected to the DNA test.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">12.   Thus, merely because something is permissible under the law, cannot\n\nbe directed as a matter of course to be performed particularly when a\n\ndirection to that effect may encroach privacy and physical autonomy of a\n\nperson.
