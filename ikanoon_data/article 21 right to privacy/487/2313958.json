The learned Single Judge has not appreciated that the college\n\n             in question is not a public authority having no control of the\n\n             State Government and hence is not coming under the fold of\n\n             <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_22\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. Hence there cannot be any\n\n             direction by the Commission to provide information to the\n\n             information seeker.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_6\">ii.

It has been submitted that it is incorrect on the part of the\n\n             college to take the ground that the college in question is not\n\n             under the control of the State Government rather the college\n\n             in question will not come under the fold of the private\n\n             authority rather the college in question is a public authority,\n\n             by virtue of the reason that substantial fund is released by the\n\n             State Government by grant-in-aid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">       ii.   It has been contended that the moment, the aid is being given\n\n             by the State Government, the college in question will come\n\n             under the fold of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> in view of the\n\n             provision of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2 (h)(d)(i)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                    8</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                                                   2025:JHHC:16367-DB\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">23.

There may be\n            cases where the finance is more than 50% but still\n            may not be called substantially financed.

For proper appreciation of the aforesaid contention, it would be apt\n\n    to refer herein the factual aspect of the aforesaid case. In the said\n\n    case the seminal question was put before the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court that\n\n    whether a cooperative society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_43\">Kerala\n\n    Cooperative Societies Act, 1969</a> (for short &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_44\">Societies Act</a>&quot;) will fall\n\n    within the definition of &quot;public authority&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2(h)</a> of the\n\n    Right to Information Act, 2005 (for short &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_46\">RTI Act</a>&quot;) and be bound\n\n    by the obligations to provide information sought for by a citizen\n\n    under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_47\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">39. As per the fact of the aforesaid case a Full Bench of the Kerala High\n\n    Court, in its judgment in Mulloor Rural Coop. Society Ltd. v. State\n\n    of Kerala [AIR 2012 Ker 124] , answered the question in the\n\n    affirmative and upheld Circular No. 23 of 2006 dated 1-6-2006,\n\n    issued by the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies, Kerala stating\n\n    that all the cooperative institutions coming under the administrative\n\n    control of the Registrar, are &quot;public authorities&quot; within the meaning\n\n    of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act and obliged to provide information as\n\n    sought for. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"322018\" id=\"span_17\">The question was answered by the Full Bench in view of\n\n    the conflicting views expressed [Mulloor Rural Coop. Society\n\n    Ltd. v. State of Kerala, Writ Appeal No. 1688 of 2009, order dated\n\n    24-3-2011 (Ker)] by a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in\n\n    Writ Appeal No. 1688 of 2009, with an earlier judgment of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  14</span>\n                                                    2025:JHHC:16367-DB\n\n\n\n\n    Division Bench in <a href=\"/doc/322018/\" id=\"a_49\">Thalapalam Service Coop.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court while taking in to consideration the core of\n\n    the Act 2005 particularly the term substantially financed has\n\n    observed that the Cooperative Societies registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_51\">Kerala\n\n    Cooperative Societies Act</a> will not fall within the definition of &quot;public\n\n    authority&quot; as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">41. It is evident that the fact of the aforesaid case is quite different from\n\n    the present one, since the said case is of co-operative society\n\n    registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_53\">Kerala Co-operative Societies Act</a> which is under\n\n    the control of Registrar of Co-operative Society would be falling\n\n    within the definition of public authority under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 2(h)</a> of the\n\n    Right to Information Act, 2005 and while answering the same, the\n\n    Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has pleased to hold that the co-operative society\n\n    registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_55\">Kerala Co-operative Societies Act</a> will not fall\n\n    within the definition of public authority as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_56\">Section\n\n    2(h)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005.
