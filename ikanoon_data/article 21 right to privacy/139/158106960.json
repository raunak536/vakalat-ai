The facts of the case, necessary for disposal of present petition, in\n                          short, are that petitioner is working in Google Company and presently posted\n                          in Hyderabad Office. He is facing trial for offences under Sections 498A, 506\n                          read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 34</a> of IPC as well as under <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_4\">4</a> of Dowry\n                          Prohibition Act arising out of FIR registered at Mahila Thana, Jabalpur. A\n                          notice under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 41-A</a> of Cr.P.C. was issued to petitioner and was served\n                          at his residence in Hyderabad. After investigation was over, charge-sheet was\n                          filed. Thereafter, petitioner appeared before the concerned Magistrate who\n                          granted bail to him. Charges have been framed. FIR as well as charge-sheet\n                          filed against mother of petitioner was quashed by this Court in M.Cr.C.\n                          No.30092/2022. It is the case of petitioner that even after warrant was issued\n                          against complainant, she is avoiding to appear before the Trial Court for\n                          recording of her evidence and on account of dilatory tactics adopted by the\n                          complainant, trial is pending for the last two years for recording of her\n                          evidence. It is the claim of petitioner that complainant belongs to very\n                          influential family having strong political and bureaucratic contacts and\n                          accordingly, she got a Look Out Circular (for short &quot;LOC&quot;) issued against\n                          petitioner. It is the case of petitioner that the said LOC was neither in his\n                          knowledge nor it was ever communicated to him. It is the case of petitioner\n                          that he is employed in multi-national projects of the Company and\n                          accordingly he is required to visit abroad. Accordingly, he moved an\n                          application for grant of permission in RCT No.964/2022. It is the case of\n                          petitioner that vide order dated 29.07.2024, the Trial Court granted him\n                          permission to travel abroad. In terms of the permission granted to petitioner\n                          as well as in the light of fundamental rights guaranteed to him by Constitution\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                    4                    WP. No.28981 of 2024</span>\n\n\n                          of India, petitioner made all necessary arrangements for his journey to USA\n                          including return ticket for 08.10.2024. Petitioner reached Hyderabad\n                          International Airport at about 02:00 am IST on 20.09.2024 for boarding flight\n                          (Emirate Flight No.EK-525). After completing the security check-in, in the\n                          immigration check, he was restrained and detained by immigration officers at\n                          Hyderabad International Airport. On enquiry, he was informed by the\n                          immigration officials that an LOC was issued by SHO, Mahila Thana\n                          Jabalpur in Crime No.108/2021 by the order of Superintendent of Police,\n                          Jabalpur (M.P.). It is the case of petitioner that for the first time, he came to\n                          know about LOC when he was informed by the immigration officers. It is\n                          claimed that despite his request, neither copy of LOC was provided to him\n                          nor any more details were provided including date and number of said LOC\n                          by the immigration officers. Petitioner also provided them a copy of order\n                          passed by the Trial Court by which he was permitted to travel abroad.\n                          However, the airport authorities denied to allow him to board the plane. The\n                          representative of petitioner also personally visited the office of respondent\n                          No.3 and respondent No.2, where no responsible person was available. On\n                          insistence to at least inform respondent No.3, the staff available there\n                          informed that SHO of Mahila Thana is occupied in Ganesh Visarjan and will\n                          be informed once she returns. Consequent to this negligent attitude of SHO,\n                          Police Station Mahila Thana, Jabalpur, petitioner was not allowed to board\n                          the plane. At about 05:00 am, a phone call was received in the immigration\n                          office of respondent No.5 and thereafter he was allowed to return to his home.\n                          It is claimed that since petitioner is working on a project, therefore, his\n                          presence in company&#x27;s office at USA is necessary and the absence of\n                          petitioner may result in termination of his services. Therefore, under\n                          compelling circumstances, petitioner booked another Air Ticket for travelling\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                   5                    WP.

Jabalpur expressed his ignorance about the\n                          LOC and although he assured for redressal of grievance of petitioner but no\n                          order has been passed. It is submitted that conduct of respondents in issuing\n                          LOC, smacks of malafide and ulterior motive because once notice under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 41-A</a> of Cr.P.C. was issued, then, it is clear that there was no\n                          possibility of petitioner to run away from the clutches of investigating agency.\n                          Furthermore, petitioner appeared before the Trial Court and obtained the bail\n                          order. Later on, he was also granted permission to travel abroad and under\n                          these circumstances issuance of LOC as well as non-withdrawal of the same\n                          at the appropriate time has resulted in utter violation of fundamental rights of\n                          petitioner and accordingly present petition has been filed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">                          3.

When the\n                          case was taken up at 12:45 pm again, Shri Sampat Upadhyay submitted that\n                          the record has not been received and it will be received in 15 minutes.

Still, the record was not voluntarily produced and at 01:00 pm\n                          when the court insisted that the record be produced, then one person who was\n                          already standing outside the court room in the gallery with the record and was\n                          visible through the window came inside the Court room with the record.

During the course of the day, it was once again submitted by Shri\n                          Sampat Upadhyay that preliminary enquiry is pending at Katni and Additional\n                          Superintendent of Police posted in Katni is conducting the preliminary\n                          enquiry. Accordingly, Shri Sampat Upadhyaya as well as Shri Harpreet\n                          Ruprah, Additional Advocate General were asked to explain as to whether any\n                          part of cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of\n                          Superintendent of Police, Katni or not? It is fairly conceded by Shri Sampat\n                          Upadhyay - Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur as well as Shri Ruprah that the\n                          FIR was lodged at Jabalpur.

However, it was submitted by Shri\n                          Sampat Upadhyay that in a routine manner the preliminary enquiry has been\n                          transferred to Katni.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          7.    At this stage, Shri Ruprah- Additional Advocate General, by raising his\n                          voice and in a very aggressive manner submitted that even petitioner had not\n                          approached the Court with clean hands. He has made false submission before\n                          this Court that he was allowed to travel abroad by order dated 29.07.2024. In\n                          fact, he was never allowed to travel abroad and he has filed this writ petition\n                          on false grounds. However, he fairly conceded that LOC has been withdrawn\n                          by respondents themselves. During the course of arguments, the State counsel\n                          himself provided copy of order dated 19.09.2024 passed by the Trial Court\n                          which mentions that petitioner has submitted tickets etc. and he would appear\n                          before the Trial Court immediately after returning from abroad. Shri Ruprah\n                          started criticizing the order passed by the Trial Court and submitted that\n                          although the trial Court has mentioned that petitioner shall appear before the\n                          Trial Court after returning from abroad, but it is not mentioned specifically\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                   10                    WP. No.28981 of 2024</span>\n\n\n                          that permission is granted. Therefore, it is submitted that the trial Court has\n                          dealt with the issue in a very casual manner. Although this Court was dealing\n                          with a sensitive issue as to whether fundamental right of petitioner, as\n                          enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India, has been violated and\n                          even after voluntarily withdrawing the LOC issued against petitioner, counsel\n                          for respondents was arguing in a very aggressive manner and putting the\n                          blame on the court of not passing a very clear order of permitting petitioner to\n                          travel abroad. Accordingly, Shri Ruprah was directed to read the order dated\n                          19.09.2024 along with the order dated 29.07.2024 and also to point out as to\n                          whether petitioner was detained at Hyderabad International Airport on\n                          account of violation of terms and conditions of the bail order or he was\n                          detained on account of LOC. The manner in which Shri Ruprah was showing\n                          aggression, this Court thought it appropriate to stop giving opportunity of\n                          hearing to Shri Sampat Upadhyay, Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur and\n                          directed Shri Ruprah to confine his arguments to the legal position only. It\n                          was fairly conceded by Shri Ruprah that in case of violation of conditions of\n                          the bail order, the Police cannot detain a person on its own and the only\n                          remedy available to the Police is to move an application for cancellation of\n                          bail. He fairly conceded that petitioner was not detained on account of\n                          violation of bail order, but he was detained on account of pendency of LOC.\n                          Accordingly, Shri Ruprah was directed to point out the provision of law in\n                          which the LOC was issued and he was also directed to show that LOC which\n                          was issued against petitioner in compliance of which petitioner was detained\n                          in Hyderabad International Airport. Shri Ruprah was again and again\n                          requested to provide copy of LOC which was issued against petitioner but it\n                          was submitted by Shri Ruprah that at present he is not in possession of the\n                          same.

During the course of arguments, Shri Ruprah provided copy of Office\n                          Memorandum (O.M.) dated 22.02.2024 issued by Government of India,\n                          Ministry of Home Affairs, Foreigners Division (Immigration Section).\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">                          11.   It was fairly submitted by Shri Ruprah that Superintendent of Police is\n                          the competent authority to make a request for issuance of LOC. At this stage,\n                          Shri Ruprah, expressed that he was shocked when he was informed in the\n                          morning by Shri Sampat Upadhyay that he has not brought the record of\n                          departmental proceedings which according to him have been initiated against\n                          Ms. Shabana Pervez. He further submitted that this act of Shri Sampat\n                          Upadhyay is unpardonable. He further submitted that in fact the LOC should\n                          have been reviewed periodically by Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur as well\n                          as by the SHO, Police Station Mahila Thana, Jabalpur but that was not done.\n                          It is further submitted that after having issued notice under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 41-A</a> of\n                          Cr.P.C. there was no occasion for the SHO, Mahila Thana, Jabalpur, to have\n                          an apprehension that petitioner may flee away. Furthermore, after the bail was\n                          granted by the Trial Court therefore, the apprehension of fleeing away which\n                          might have been in the mind of SHO should have come to an end and thus she\n                          should have withdrawn the LOC but that was not done. After going through\n                          the order dated 29.07.2024 and 19.09.2024 passed by the Trial Court, it is\n                          submitted by Shri Ruprah that although the words &quot;Petitioner is permitted to\n                          travel abroad&quot; are not specifically mentioned in the order dated 19.09.2024\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                    12                     WP.

Since the respondents have already withdrawn LOC and information\n                          has also been given by the Bureau of Immigration, Government of India, by\n                          its letter dated 27.09.2024 that the request for deletion of LOC against the\n                          subject(s) has/have been completed at their end, this Court is of the\n                          considered opinion that now as the LOC issued against petitioner has lost its\n                          life on 27.09.2024, therefore, no further direction in that regard is required.\n                          Look Out Circulars:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">                          14.   LOCs are not governed by any specific penal provision. These are\n                          issued under administrative and executive orders of Ministry of Home\n                          Affairs. The primary object is to prevent an individual from leaving the\n                          country to evade legal proceedings and the legal basis of LOCs can be found\n                          in different statutes which are meant to regulate immigration and preventing\n                          the individuals from absconding during investigation. <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_12\">Some of the Act</a> are\n                          like <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_13\">Passports Act, 1967</a>, <a href=\"/doc/27376/\" id=\"a_14\">Foreigners Act, 1946</a>. <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.P.C</a>. does not provide for\n                          issuance of any LOC.

The guidelines for issuance of LOC are prescribed through\n                          OMs issued by Ministry of Home Affairs from time to time. The very purpose\n                          of issuing LOC is to create co-ordination between multiple government\n                          agencies and it is initiated on the request from an originating agency.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                    13                    WP.

In the present case, notice under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 41A</a> of Cr.P.C. was served on\n                          petitioner. It is not the case of SHO, Mahila Thana, Jabalpur, that petitioner\n                          was avoiding his arrest and the notice could not be served on him. The service\n                          of notice on petitioner clearly indicates that he was available with the police\n                          and was co-operating with the investigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">                          16.

Once the charge sheet was filed and petitioner had appeared before the\n                          Trial Court and was granted bail, then it is clear that the investigation had\n                          already come to an end and further movement of petitioner was to be\n                          regulated by the orders of the Court. The Trial Court had granted bail to\n                          petitioner and one of the conditions was that he will not leave the country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">                          18.   Now, the only question for consideration is as to whether petitioner was\n                          granted permission to leave the country or not?\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">                          19.   It is well established principle of law that for getting passport issued\n                          prior permission of the Court in which the trial is pending is not required but\n                          for leaving the limits of the country or in other words for travelling abroad the\n                          permission is required. Accordingly, by order dated 29.07.2024 and\n                          19.09.2024 permission was granted to petitioner to travel to USA, then by no\n                          stretch of imagination it can be said that on 20.09.2024 when petitioner was\n                          stopped at Hyderabad International Airport, he was trying to avoid his arrest\n                          or he was trying to run away from the country. In fact, petitioner claims\n                          himself to be an employee of Google Company and was required to travel to\n                          USA in connection with his service conditions.

In the Constituent Assembly, the Drafting Committee\n                              chaired by Dr B.R. Ambedkar had included the phrase but it came\n                              to be deleted after a careful evaluation of the vagaries of the\n                              decision-making process in the US involving interpretation of the\n                              due process clause. Significantly, present to the mind of the Framers\n                              of our Constitution was the invalidation of social welfare legislation\n                              in the US on the anvil of the due process clause on the ground that it\n                              violated the liberty of contract of men, women and children to offer\n                              themselves for work in a free market for labour. This model\n                              evidently did not appeal to those who opposed the incorporation of\n                              a similar phrase into the Indian Constitution. Yet the debates in the\n                              Constituent Assembly indicate that there was a substantial body of\n                              opposition to the deletion of the due process clause, which\n                              eventually led Dr B.R. Ambedkar to objectively sum up the rival\n                              viewpoints for decision by the House.

First, the\n                              fundamental rights are no longer regarded as isolated silos or\n                              watertight compartments. In consequence, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 14</a> has been held\n                              to animate the content of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21.</a> Second, the expression\n                              &quot;procedure established by law&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> does not connote a\n                              formalistic requirement of a mere presence of procedure in enacted\n                              law. That expression has been held to signify the content of the\n                              procedure and its quality which must be fair, just and reasonable.\n                              The mere fact that the law provides for the deprivation of life or\n                              personal liberty is not sufficient to conclude its validity and the\n                              procedure to be constitutionally valid must be fair, just and\n                              reasonable. The quality of reasonableness does not attach only to\n                              the content of the procedure which the law prescribes with\n                              reference to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 21</a> but to the content of the law itself.

In dealing with a substantive challenge to a law on the ground\n                              that it violates a fundamental right, there are settled principles of\n                              constitutional interpretation which hold the field. The first is the\n                              presumption of constitutionality which is based on the foundational\n                              principle that the legislature which is entrusted with the duty of law-\n                              making best understands the needs of society and would not readily\n                              be assumed to have transgressed a constitutional limitation. The\n                              burden lies on the individual who asserts a constitutional\n                              transgression to establish it. Secondly, the courts tread warily in\n                              matters of social and economic policy where they singularly lack\n                              expertise to make evaluations.

We think that the right to life\n                              includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along\n                              with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate\n                              nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and\n                              expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and\n                              mixing and commingling with fellow human beings. Of course, the\n                              magnitude and content of the components of this right would\n                              depend upon the extent of the economic development of the\n                              country, but it must, in any view of the matter, include the right to\n                              the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such\n                              functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression\n                              of the human-self. Every act which offends against or impairs\n                              human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to\n                              live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and\n                              just procedure established by law which stands the test of other\n                              fundamental rights. Now obviously, any form of torture or cruel,\n                              inhuman or degrading treatment would be offensive to human\n                              dignity and constitute an inroad into this right to live and it would,\n                              on this view, be prohibited by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21</a> unless it is in accordance\n                              with procedure prescribed by law, but no law which authorises and\n                              no procedure which leads to such torture or cruel, inhuman or\n                              degrading treatment can ever stand the test of reasonableness and\n                              non-arbitrariness: it would plainly be unconstitutional and void as\n                              being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_69\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_70\">21.</a> It would thus be seen that\n                              there is implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21</a> the right to protection against torture\n                              or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in\n                              <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 5</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\n                              guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 7</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and\n                              Political Rights.

There the Secretary of\n                                State refused to issue passport to each of the two plaintiffs because\n                                of the refusal to file affidavit concerning their membership in the\n                                Communist Party.

In due course the\n                                case went up to the Supreme Court.

But that function of\n                                the passport is subordinate. Its crucial function today is control over\n                                exit&quot;. While in the earlier judgment the emphasis was laid on the\n                                request to protect the citizen, this judgment says that the main\n                                function of a passport is to control the exit. So a passport, whether\n                                in England or in the United States of America serves diverse\n                                purposes; it is a &quot;request for protection&quot;, it is a document of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                                                  25                    WP.

Thus, it is clear that it is the duty of the originating agency to\n                          review the LOC on quarterly or yearly basis and whenever any order by\n                          the Court is passed requiring deletion or suspension of LOC, then it is\n                          the duty of the originating agency to immediately inform the\n                          immigration office and all the duties arising out of the execution of LOC\n                          shall be of the originating agency. Shri Ruprah, Additional Advocate\n                          General in a very aggressive manner tried to submit that the petitioner\n                          did not give any breathing time to the originating agency to inform the\n                          immigration office with regard to permission and the permission was\n                          granted by the Trial Court on 19-9-2024 and the Petitioner tried to leave\n                          the Country in the night of 20-9-2024, therefore, if the order of the Court\n                          could not be communicated to the immigration office, then no liability\n                          can be fastened on the originating agency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">                          35.    Considered the submissions made by Counsel for the respondents.\n                          As pointed out, it is clearly mentioned in the LOC that it is the duty of\n                          the originating agency to inform the immigration department about the\n                          order of the Court urgently. Thus, Shri Ruprah was asked to point out\n                          the date on which the originating agency got an information about the\n                          permission granted by the Trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">                          36.

However, Shri Ruprah was not in a position to inform that whether\n                          Ms. Shabana Parvez, ever contacted the Public Prosecutor to find out the\n                          status of the case which is pending in the Trial Court or not?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_110\">                          38.   Now the question for consideration is that when the State\n                          Agencies are being represented by their Public Prosecutors, then whether\n                          the originating agency can claim ignorance of order or not?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">                          39.   In the present case, two orders were passed by the Trial Court, i.e.,\n                          dated 29-7-2024 and 19-9-2024.           Therefore, it is clear that the\n                          originating agency was aware of the fact that an application has already\n                          been filed seeking permission to leave the Country well in advance.\n                          Therefore, Shri Ruprah was directed to point out that why the originating\n                          agency did not keep a track of the Court proceedings and why they did\n                          not remain in touch with the Public Prosecutor?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">                          40.   When a specific question was put to Shri Ruprah that why the\n                          investigating officer, did not try to review the LOC and why did not\n                          remain in touch with the Public Prosecutor, then it was submitted by Shri\n                          Ruprah that even Superintendent of Police Jabalpur did not comply his\n                          direction to keep the record of departmental proceedings available in the\n                          light of the direction given by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">                          41.   Thus, it is clear that even Additional Advocate General had\n                          expressed his helplessness in getting the orders of the Court executed\n                          and indirectly expressed that the investigating agency is functioning as\n                          per its own whims and wishes without giving any respect to the orders of\n                          the Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">                                                                   38                   WP.

We do not have any\n                              doubt that Shri Bhim Singh was not produced either before the\n                              Magistrate on 11th or before the Sub-Judge on 13th, though he was\n                              arrested in the early hours of the morning of 10th. There certainly\n                              was a gross violation of Shri Bhim Singh&#x27;s constitutional rights\n                              under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_118\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1371971/\" id=\"a_119\">22(2).</a> Earlier we referred to the circumstance\n                              that though Shri Khajuria, Inspector General of Police stated that\n                              information was sent to Superintendent of Police, Anantnag through\n                              the Police Control Room, Srinagar on September 10, 1985, Shri\n                              Mir, the Superintendent of Police, Anantnag stated that on\n                              September 9, 1985 at 11.30 p.m., he was informed by the Police\n                              Control Room, Srinagar that Shri Bhim Singh was required to be\n                              apprehended as he was wanted in a case registered under Section\n                              153-A of the Ranbir Penal Code. Nobody cared to explain why it\n                              was thought that Bhim Singh would pass through Qazi Kund in\n                              Anantnag District on the night of September 9-10. Nobody thought\n                              fit to explain how and why the Senior Superintendent of Police,\n                              Udhampur came to direct his officers to escort Bhim Singh. It has\n                              not been explained how and when the Senior Superintendent of\n                              Police, Udhampur came to know of the arrest of Bhim Singh and\n                              who required him to arrange for the &quot;safe passage&quot; of Bhim Singh\n                              through Udhampur District. To our minds, it appears as if it was\n                              expected that Bhim Singh would proceed from Jammu to Srinagar\n                              on the intervening night of September 9-10, 1985 as there was a\n                              meeting of the Assembly on September 11 and the police were\n                              alerted to arrest him when sighted en route to Srinagar and take him\n                              back to prevent him from proceeding to Srinagar to attend the\n                              session of the Legislative Assembly. We can only say that the\n                              police officers acted in a most high-handed way. We do not wish to\n                              use stronger words to condemn the authoritarian acts of the police.\n                              If the personal liberty of a Member of the Legislative Assembly is\n                              to be played with in this fashion, one can only wonder what may\n                              happen to lesser mortals !

Some punitive provisions are contained in the Penal Code, 1860\n                              which seek to punish violation of right to life.

Our procedure for\n                              securing our personal freedom is efficient, our procedure for\n                              preventing the abuse of power is not.

A similar approach of redressing the wrong by award of\n                              monetary compensation against the State for its failure to protect\n                              the fundamental rights of the citizen has been adopted by the Courts\n                              of Ireland, which has a written constitution, guaranteeing\n                              fundamental rights, but which also like the Indian Constitution\n                              contains no provision of remedy for the infringement of those\n                              rights.

Thus, to sum up, it is now a well-accepted proposition in most\n                              of the jurisdictions, that monetary or pecuniary compensation is an\n                              appropriate and indeed an effective and sometimes perhaps the only\n                              suitable remedy for redressal of the established infringement of the\n                              fundamental right to life of a citizen by the public servants and the\n                              State is vicariously liable for their acts. The claim of the citizen is\n                              based on the principle of strict liability to which the defence of\n                              sovereign immunity is not available and the citizen must receive the\n                              amount of compensation from the State, which shall have the right\n                              to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the assessment of\n                              compensation, the emphasis has to be on the compensatory and not\n                              on punitive element. The objective is to apply balm to the wounds\n                              and not to punish the transgressor or the offender, as awarding\n                              appropriate punishment for the offence (irrespective of\n                              compensation) must be left to the criminal courts in which the\n                              offender is prosecuted, which the State, in law, is duty bound to do.\n                              The award of compensation in the public law jurisdiction is also\n                              without prejudice to any other action like civil suit for damages\n                              which is lawfully available to the victim or the heirs of the deceased\n                              victim with respect to the same matter for the tortious act\n                              committed by the functionaries of the State. The quantum of\n                              compensation will, of course, depend upon the peculiar facts of\n                              each case and no strait-jacket formula can be evolved in that behalf.\n                              The relief to redress the wrong for the established invasion of the\n                              fundamental rights of the citizen, under the public law jurisdiction\n                              is, thus, in addition to the traditional remedies and not in derogation\n                              of them. The amount of compensation as awarded by the Court and\n                              paid by the State to redress the wrong done, may in a given case, be\n                              adjusted against any amount which may be awarded to the claimant\n                              by way of damages in a civil suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1543073\" id=\"span_336\">49.

It follows that &#x27;a claim in public law for compensation&#x27; for\n                              contravention of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the\n                              protection of which is guaranteed in the Constitution, is an\n                              acknowledged remedy for enforcement and protection of such\n                              rights, and such a claim based on strict liability made by resorting\n                              to a constitutional remedy provided for the enforcement of a\n                              fundamental right is &#x27;distinct from, and in addition to, the remedy in\n                              private law for damages for the tort&#x27; resulting from the\n                              contravention of the fundamental right. The defence of sovereign\n                              immunity being inapplicable, and alien to the concept of guarantee\n                              of fundamental rights, there can be no question of such a defence\n                              being available in the constitutional remedy. It is this principle\n                              which justifies award of monetary compensation for contravention\n                              of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, when that is\n                              the only practicable mode of redress available for the contravention\n                              made by the State or its servants in the purported exercise of their\n                              powers, and enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by\n                              resort to the remedy in public law under the Constitution by\n                              recourse to <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_163\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_164\">226</a> of the Constitution.

If the facts and circumstances of the case are considered, then it is clear\n                          that the Trial Court had granted permission to the Petitioner to travel abroad\n                          and on the very same day, the petitioner was detained at Hyderabad\n                          International Airport in execution of LOC issued by Jabalpur Police. The\n                          Petitioner had already surrendered before the Trial Court and he was granted\n                          bail.   Once, the Petitioner had appeared before the Trial Court and had\n                          obtained bail, therefore, it is clear that Petitioner was not running away from\n                          the clutches of the investigating agency and there was no possibility of fleeing\n                          away from the Court requiring issuance of LOC. Further more, the LOC was\n                          issued at the stage of investigation and once, the petitioner had appeared\n                          before the Trial Court and he was granted bail, then the Jabalpur Police\n                          should have withdrawn the LOC but nothing was done. Further more, it is not\n                          the case of the respondents that they were periodically reviewing the necessity\n                          of LOC and for any good or bad reason, the right of the petitioner to travel\n                          abroad was required to be curtailed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">                          53.

This Court has also come to the\n                          conclusion that violation of fundamental right of an individual would invite\n                          criminal action, civil liability as well as departmental action against the\n                          wrongdoer.

By adopting such\n                          tactics, in fact the police department is making every sincere effort to destroy\n                          its own reputation, credibility in the eyes of the Civilized Society and the\n                          Courts. The police department is meant for maintaining law and order, but\n                          unfortunately, now the Jabalpur Police is trying its level best to lose its\n                          credibility and efficiency by following the path of Police Terrorism. On\n                          multiple occasions, it was found that the police department by claiming itself\n                          to be a disciplined force in uniform, had rejected the candidature of persons\n                          for their appointment in police department on the ground that they are not of\n                          impeachable reputation. Even the candidatures of those candidates, who had\n                          committed some offence during their minority and inspite of clear provision\n                          that it would not be a disqualification, the police department is regularly\n                          rejecting their candidatures in utter violation of provisions of <a href=\"/doc/191413284/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 24</a> of\n                          Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015. But unfortunately, once a\n                          person is appointed in the police department, then the respondents are\n                          encouraging indiscipline, inefficiency and depotism in the police\n                          department.     This dual criteria which has been adopted by the Police\n                          Department is beyond understanding and tolerance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">                          58.   Thus, it is held that the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur has played\n                          fraud on the Court by wrongly projecting that they are taking sincere action\n                          against Ms. Shabana Parvez, but thereafter, they are extending illegal\n                          protection to her.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">                          Whether Preliminary Enquiry can be done at Katni whereas the entire\n                          cause of action has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of Jabalpur\n                          Police ?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_170\">                          59.

In the present case, the entire cause of action has arisen within the\n                          territorial jurisdiction of Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur.               The\n                          Superintendent of Police is the disciplinary authority as Ms. Shabana Parvez\n                          had committed misconduct while She was posted in Mahila Thana, Jabalpur.\n                          Merely because Ms. Shabana Parvez was subsequently transferred to Katni,\n                          would not give any jurisdiction to Superintendent of Police, Katni to act as a\n                          disciplinary officer. The Show cause notice dated 4-10-2024 was issued by\n                          Superintendent of Police Jabalpur but when and why the Preliminary enquiry\n                          was transferred to Katni has not been explained by Shri Sampat Upadhyaya,\n                          Superintendent of Police Jabalpur. Thus, it is clear that the Police Department\n                          is taking care of convenience of Ms. Shabana Parvez and inspite of the fact\n                          that not only the entire cause of action arose in Jabalpur and the entire record\n                          is in Jabalpur, but still in order to avoid any inconvenience to Ms. Shabana\n                          Parvez transferred the departmental proceedings to Katni.

The purpose of public law is not\n                                only to civilize public power but also to assure the citizen that they\n                                live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and\n                                preserve their rights.

Thereafter another show cause notice was\n                          issued on 19-11-2024, and Ms. Shabana Parvez again replied that She would\n                          file her reply after going through the case diary. Shri Upadhyaya fairly\n                          conceded that thereafter, nothing was done by the enquiry officer. Thus, it is\n                          clear that not only the enquiry officer is negligent in discharging his duties,\n                          but even the suspension order of Ms. Shabana Parvez was revoked inspite of\n                          the fact that She is not co-operating with the enquiry officer. Thus, it is clear\n                          that suspension order of Ms. Shabana Parvez was nothing but it was a\n                          camaflouge done with an intention to file a misleading affidavit that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_403\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_404\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_405\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_406\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_407\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_408\">                                                                    61                    WP. No.28981 of 2024</span>\n\n\n                          respondents are serious in the matter. If the respondents were not interested\n                          in taking any action on account of utter violation of Fundamental Rights of\n                          the Petitioner, then they should have filed a reply that they would not take any\n                          action against the wrongdoer. However, from the conduct of the respondents,\n                          it is clear that although they never had any intention to take action against the\n                          wrongdoer i.e., the investigating officer, but in order to falsely show their\n                          sincerity they filed false affidavit that they are taking action on account for\n                          utter violation of Fundamental Rights. Further more, when this Court\n                          called the file of enquiry, then every attempt was made to suppress the\n                          same and only after a strict view was taken by this Court, the file the\n                          brought.    This action of the Superintendent of Police Jabalpur was\n                          clearly with a view to protect the Superintendent of Police, Katni who\n                          un-authorizedly took over the preliminary enquiry in his hand and\n                          thereafter ensured that no action is taken. Similarly, the enquiry officer,\n                          also did not do anything. It is really shocking that on one hand the police\n                          officers were ashamed of facing Court but at the same time, they did not\n                          hesitate in working against the law of the land.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">                          66.   The police officers must not forget that protection of Fundamental\n                          Rights of Citizens of India is essential for dignified existence of mankind\n                          and civilized society.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">                          67.   However, it appears that Police Department is not ready to correct\n                          itself and doesnot hesitate in working contrary to law and even they went\n                          to the extent of making an attempt to play fraud on the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">                          68.   Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of this case, this\n                          Court is of the considered opinion, that when Ms. Shabana Parvez is not\n                          co-operating in the preliminary/departmental enquiry, then revocation of\n                          her suspension order was not proper.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_409\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_410\">Signed by: ANAND</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_411\">SHRIVASTAVA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">Signing time: 1/28/2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_413\">6:11:46 PM</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:3856\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_414\">                                                                   62                    WP.

If he comes to a conclusion\n                          that no departmental enquiry is required then he shall pass a reasoned\n                          order after giving a specific finding with regard to role of Superintendent\n                          of Police as mentioned in OM issued by Ministry of Home Affairs with\n                          regard to issuance and review of LOC.
