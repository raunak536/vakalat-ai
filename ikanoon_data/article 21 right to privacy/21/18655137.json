It is observed that the defendants have neither \n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n     produced any document to support their new items about Matka King, \n\n     Cyber Crime, Matimand, Balish and other per se defamatory words nor \n\n\n\n\n                                            \n     produced any affidavits of witnesses to support  those contentions.

It has been held that the items published have \n\n\n\n\n\n     no concern with the public interest and show that the entire family \n\n     members   of   the   plaintiff   have   been   defamed.     The   finding   is   also \n\n\n\n\n\n     recorded that if the news items are perused minutely, it cannot be said \n\n     that those defamatory words are necessary for public good or public \n\n     interest.

But   it   is   well  \n                           \n                settled position that there is nothing important than reputation  \n                to a person.   Reputation  cannot be compensated in  terms of  \n                          \n                money.   A person requires years together to earn reputation,  \n                but it goes away within a moment.   Right of freedom, speech  \n                and expression is subject to various restrictions like respect of \n      \n\n                the right and reputation of other.

Shri   Dilip   Kumar   Sananda,   a  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n      member   of   the   Legislative   Assembly   approached   the   Chief  \n      Minister   for   a   special   treatment.     In   the   first   place,   the  \n      Principal Secretary of the Chief Minister made enquiries from  \n      the police station about the cases registered against Sananda.  \n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">      Thereafter,   the   Chief   Minister,   without   verifying   the  \n      truthfulness or otherwise of the assertion of Shri Dilip Kumar  \n                \n      Sananda that false complaints were being lodged against his  \n      family members, issued instructions that complaint against the  \n      concerned M.L.A. and his family members should be first placed  \n      before   the   District   Anti-Money   Lending   Committee,   which  \n               \n      should obtain legal opinion of the District Government Pleader  \n      and then only take decision on the same and take appropriate  \n      legal action.   The camouflage of sophistry used by Shri Vilas  \n      Rao   Deshmukh   in   the   instructions   given   by   him   and   the  \n      \n\n      affidavit   filed   before   this   Court   is   clearly   misleading.     The  \n      message to the authorities was loud and clear i.e. they were not  \n   \n\n\n\n      to take the complaints against Sananda family seriously and  \n      not   to   proceed   against   them.     The   District   Magistrate,   the  \n      District   Superintendent   of   Police   and   officers   subordinate   to  \n      them were bound to comply with the same in their letter and  \n\n\n\n\n\n      spirit.     They  could   disregard   those   instructions   at  their   own  \n      peril and none of them was expected to do so.   The District  \n      Anti-Money   Lending   Committee   was   constituted   by   the  \n      Government   of   Maharashtra   vide   resolution   No.MLA.\n      1204/CR/280/C/7/S dated 19th October, 2009 for protecting  \n      the farmers against unscrupulous money lenders and not for  \n\n\n\n\n\n      protecting the wrong doers, but in total disregard of the scheme  \n      of the Act, the Minister gave instructions which had the effect of  \n      frustrating the object of the legislation enacted for protection of  \n      the farmers.   The instructions given by the Chief Minister to  \n      District   Collector,   Buldhana   were   ex   facie   ultra   vires   the  \n      provisions   of   the   Act  which   do   not  envisage   any  role   of   the  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 13/10/2014 23:48:58 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                        23</span>\n                                                                             ao37.14.odt\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     \n                Chief Minister in cases involving violation of the provisions of  \n                the Act and amounted to an unwanted interference with the  \n                functioning   of   the   authorities   entrusted   with   the   task   of  \n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n                enforcing   the   Act   enacted   for   regulating,   controlling  \n                transactions   of   money   lending   and   protecting   unsuspecting  \n                borrowers against oppression and harassment at the hands of  \n                unscrupulous money lenders.&quot; \n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                           \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">     17.        In the written statement, a reference is made to the public \n\n\n\n\n                                             \n     notice issued by the Reserve Bank of India in several newspapers in \n                          \n     respect of the restrictions put on the Janata Commercial Bank Ltd., \n\n     Khamgaon,   with   which   the   close   connection   and   control   of   the \n                         \n     plaintiff   and   his   family   members   is   sought   to   be   established.     The \n\n     attempt   on   the   part   of   the   defendants   to   establish   the   defamatory \n      \n\n\n     allegations prima facie seems to be in good faith and for public good \n   \n\n\n\n     and interest by producing the material on record.  The Trial Court has \n\n     committed an error in holding that the provision of law is that the \n\n\n\n\n\n     defamatory articles are presumed to be false unless contrary is proved. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">     It has also committed an error in pre-judging the issue by holding that \n\n     the items published have no concern with the public interest or for \n\n\n\n\n\n     public   good.     The   allegations   or   aspersions   made   in   the   articles \n\n     prima  facie seem to  be  inter-linked.
