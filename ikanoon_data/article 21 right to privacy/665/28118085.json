With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns, this Commission refers to the\njudgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in SLP(C)\nNo. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_11\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

The information mostly\n          sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n          respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n          whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n          &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n          the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          13.

State of Madhya\n     Pradesh</a> (1975) 2 SCC 148, Rajagopal Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n     (<a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_38\">1994) 6 SCC 632 and Collector Vs. Canara Bank</a> (2005) 1 SCC 496\n     has held right to privacy to be a sacrosanct facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the\n     Constitution of India. It was further held that when any personal\n     information sought has no nexus with any public activity or interest,\n     the same is not to be provided. Finding the information sought <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_40\">in that\n     case</a> to be even remotely having no relationship with any public\n     activity or interest and rather being a direct invasion in private life of\n     another, information was denied.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_23\">The full bench of this Court also in\n     Secretary General, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_41\">India Vs. Subhash Chandra\n     Agarwal</a> AIR 2010 Del. 159 has held that the conflict between the\n     right to personal privacy and public interest in the disclosure of\n     personal information is recognized by the legislature by\n     incorporating <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. It was further observed that\n     personal information including tax returns, medical records etc.\n     cannot be disclosed unless the bar against disclosure is lifted by\n     establishing sufficient public interest in disclosure and disclosure\n     even then can be made only after duly notifying the third party and\n     after considering his views.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">14. At this juncture, this Commission deems it appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 2(n)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">    &quot;2(n):- &quot;third party&quot; means a person other than the citizen making a\n    request for information and includes a public authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">15. From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                       Page 7 of 9</span>\n information can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Mr. Amit Bagga being a\nperson other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the definition of &#x27;third\nparty&#x27;. This Commission also does not find any public interest which outweighs\nthe harm caused in its disclosure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_25\">16. This Commission also refers to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India in Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors. dated 13-11-2019 titled\nas CPIO, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_45\">India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>, wherein, it\nwas observed as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">        &quot;59. Reading of the aforesaid judicial precedents, in our opinion,\n        would indicate that personal records, including name, address,\n        physical, mental and psychological status, marks obtained, grades\n        and answer sheets, are all treated as personal information.\n        Similarly, professional records, including qualification,\n        performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings,\n        etc. are all personal information. Medical records, treatment,\n        choice of medicine, list of hospitals and doctors visited, findings\n        recorded, including that of the family members, information\n        relating to assets, liabilities, income tax returns, details of\n        investments, lending and borrowing, etc. are personal information.\n        Such personal information is entitled to protection from\n        unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional access is\n        available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied.\n        This list is indicative and not exhaustive.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">17. In light of the aforesaid decisions and the legal principles enunciated therein,\nthis Commission after considering the factual matrix of the case is of the opinion\nthat in the absence of any larger public interest in the matter, the appellant is not\nentitled to seek the Income Tax Returns filed by the third party, Mr. Amit Bagga\nwhich is exempted u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">18. It is to be noted that the appellant has not sought the &#x27;gross income&#x27; of her\nhusband in the RTI application. Nonetheless, during the hearing, she requested this\nCommission for disclosure of at least the &#x27;gross income&#x27; of Mr. Amit Bagga so that\nshe could defend her matrimonial case. Therefore, considering the aspect of marital\ndiscord between the husband and wife vis-à-vis her right of maintenance, this\nCommission is of the opinion that the respondent should consider providing only\nthe limited information i.e. the numerical figure(s) of the &#x27;gross income&#x27; of her\nhusband, Mr. Amit Bagga, within a period of 15 working days from the date of\nreceipt of this order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">19.
