The Rep. of the Appellant largely argued on the lines of the written contentions\nfiled in each of these cases prior to the hearing, wherein the common argument was that\nthe averred recruitment being of national importance, there ought to be complete\ntransparency. Similarly, it was also argued that that institute only publishes the roll\nnumbers of the selected candidates and not the rank list, in which regard they have also\napproached the Court challenging the selection process. Further, in Second Appeal No.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                                 Page 8 of 25</span>\n CIC/IIIKY/A/2024/615874, it was contended that the Respondent did not provide any\ninformation about the Appellant&#x27;s marks as sought for, rather asked the Appellant to\nphysically visit the institute when the marks has been asked for under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">RTI Act</a>.\nMoreover, the Respondent has not even provided the information about the reason as to\nwhy the Appellant was not considered for Grade-I despite qualifying the written test and\nthis lack of transparency raises serious concerns about the fairness of the shortlisting\nprocess.     In particular, some of his contentions in Second Appeal No.\nCIC/IIIKY/A/2024/615874 against each point of the CPIO&#x27;s reply are reproduced\nhereunder in the form of excerpts for clarity:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      &quot;The copy of the question paper was not provided. Since the recruitment process\nis already over there is no justification for denying access to the paper. This refusal itself\nsuggests there may be something to conceal. The test w.as not a conventional exam but a\nwritten presentation-based assessment. The question paper contained only six topics, and\neach candidate was required to prepare presentation (in written format) on any one of\nthese six topics. It is important to note that Adhoc faculty members from the same\ninstitute also appeared for this examination. Since the format allowed candidates to\nrespond to just one topic of their choice, any individual who was already aware of even a\nsingle topic could easily pass the exam. All the Adhoc faculty members who appeared for\nthe test cleared it, which raises a genuine concern that they might have had prior\nknowledge of the question paper. This selective advantage undermines the fairness of the\nrecruitment process and casts doubt on its transparency.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      &quot;The institute has asked me to visit the campus in person to view my answer sheet\nand note the marks. However, they are not ready to provide a copy of the answer sheet\nor detailed section-wise marks through official means. As a candidate, I have the right to\nreceive a copy of my evaluated answer sheet under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act</a>. I strongly suspect that\nthe evaluation may not have been done properly, and since the written exam carries 50%\nweightage, it is crucial to have transparency in the marking.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                                   Page 9 of 25</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       &quot;Only weightage percentages were shared; the actual maximum marks allotted for\nthe interview were not provided.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      &quot;There is a genuine concern that the process was conducted to absorb the existing\nAdhoc faculty.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      &quot;Complete details of the interview panel were not shared. As per regulations,\nstrict norms govern panel composition.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      &quot;I fail to understand how marks awarded to me by individual interview board\nmembers can be treated as someone else&#x27;s personal information. These are not personal\nopinions or confidential data unrelated to the recruitment process--they are official\nassessment scores given to me in a formal, institutional setting. As a candidate, it is my\nlegitimate right to know how each board member evaluated my performance, especially\nin a process that determines professional appointments. Disclosure of such information\nis essential to ensure the process was transparent, unbiased, and fair.

It\nis observed that privacy involves a person&#x27;s right to his physical body; right to\ninformational privacy which deals with a person&#x27;s mind; and the right to privacy of\nchoice which protects an individual&#x27;s autonomy over personal choices. While physical\nprivacy enjoys constitutional recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a>,\npersonal informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a> and right to privacy of choice is\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_31\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25 of the Constitution. In the\nconcurring opinion, there is a reference to &#x27;The Right to Privacy&#x27; by Samuel Warren and\nLouis D. Brandeis on an individual&#x27;s right to control the dissemination of personal\ninformation and that an individual has a right to limit access to such information/shield\nsuch information from unwarranted access. Knowledge about a person gives another\npower over that person, as personal data collected is capable of effecting\nrepresentations in his decision making process and shaping behaviour which can have\na stultifying effect on the expression of dissent which is the cornerstone of democracy.\nIn the said concurring judgment, it has been further held that the right to protection of\nreputation from being unfairly harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only against\nfalsehood but also against certain truths by observing: (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n      &#x27;623. An individual has a right to protect his reputation from being unfairly\n      harmed and such protection of reputation needs to exist not only against falsehood\n      but also certain truths. It cannot be said that a more accurate judgment about\n      people can be facilitated by knowing private details about their lives - people\n      judge us badly, they judge us in haste, they judge out of context, they judge without\n      hearing the whole story and they judge with hypocrisy.

The mind that has to\nbe examined is not that of a reader in general, but that of the person who is affected by\nthe publicising/dissemination of his information. The question is what a reasonable\nperson of ordinary sensibilities would feel if he/she is subjected to such publicity. Only\nwhen publicity is such that a reasonable person would feel justified in feeling seriously\naggrieved that there would be an invasion in the right to privacy which gives rise to a\ncause of action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      52. In Douglas (supra), it was also held that there are different degrees of privacy\nwhich would be equally true for information given in confidentiality, and the potential\nfor disclosure of the information to cause harm is an important factor to be taken into\naccount in the assessment of the extent of the restriction to protect the right to privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      53. While clause (j) exempts disclosure of two kinds of information, as noted in\nparagraph 47 above, that is &quot;personal information&quot; with no relation to public activity or\ninterest and &quot;information&quot; that is exempt from disclosure to prevent unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy, this Court has not underscored, as will be seen below, such\ndistinctiveness and treated personal information to be exempt from disclosure if such\ndisclosure invades on balance the privacy rights, thereby linking the former kind of\ninformation with the latter kind. This means that information, which if disclosed could\nlead to an unwarranted invasion of privacy rights, would mean personal information,\nthat is, which is not having co-relation with public information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      54. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_22\">In <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_34\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

Here, the Commission places reliance\non a catena of judgments of the superior Courts on the import of &quot;public interest&quot; as\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_29\">The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_45\">Bihar Public Service Commission vs.\nSaiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi &amp; Anr. [CIVIL APPEAL NO.9052 OF</a> 2012] observed as\nunder:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">         &quot;23. The expression &#x27;public interest&#x27; has to be understood in its true connotation\nso as to give complete meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The expression\n&#x27;public interest&#x27; must be viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify\ndenial of a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its common parlance, the\nexpression &#x27;public interest&#x27;, like &#x27;public purpose&#x27;, is not capable of any precise\ndefinition. It does not have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the\nstatute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and state of society and its\nneeds. [State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh (AIR1952 SC 252)]. It also means the\ngeneral welfare of the public that warrants recommendation and protection; something\nin which the public as a whole has a stake [Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (Eighth Edition)].\nEmphasis Supplied\n\n\n         &quot;24. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities objectively and the\nconsequences of such disclosure have to be weighed with regard to circumstances of a\ngiven case. The decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring\nthat larger public interest outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors\nstated in the provision. Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\nrequired to be dealt with great confidentiality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                                 Page 18 of 25</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1294854\" id=\"span_31\">&quot;.... Similarly, there may be cases where the disclosure has no relationship to any\npublic activity or interest or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the\nindividual. All these protections have to be given their due implementation as they spring\nfrom statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between private interest and\npublic interest. It is a matter where a constitutional protection is available to a person\nwith regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the public interest has to be construed while\nkeeping in mind the balance factor between right to privacy and right to information\nwith the purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in the\nlarger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge from the\nconstitutional values under the Constitution of India.&quot; Emphasis Supplied\n\n      Similarly, in another judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1294854/\" id=\"a_46\">S. P.\nGupta v President of India</a>, [AIR 1982 SC 149], with reference to &#x27;public interest&#x27; it has\nbeen maintained that:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"101278772\" id=\"span_32\">&quot;Redressing public injury, enforcing public duty, protecting social, collective,\n&#x27;diffused&#x27; rights and interests vindicate public interest...

Emphasis Supplied\n\n      Further, in the <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_48\">Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a> (supra) case, the Apex Court had\ntouched upon this aspect at length and some of the notable contents relevant to the\ninstant discussion is reproduced hereunder:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                               Page 19 of 25</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       &quot;75. Public interest in access to information refers to something that is in the\ninterest of the public welfare to know. Public welfare is widely different from what is of\ninterest to the public. &quot;Something which is of interest to the public&quot; and &quot;something\nwhich is in the public interest&quot; are two separate and different parameters. For example,\nthe public may be interested in private matters with which the public may have no\nconcern and pressing need to know. However, such interest of the public in private\nmatters would repudiate and directly traverse the protection of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      The object and purpose behind the specific exemption vide clause (j) to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n8(1)</a> is to protect and shield oneself from unwarranted access to personal information\nand to protect facets like reputation, honour, etc. associated with the right to privacy.\nSimilarly, there is a public interest in the maintenance of confidentiality in the case of\nprivate individuals and even government, an aspect we have already discussed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      76. The public interest test in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_50\">RTI Act</a> would mean reflecting\nupon the object and purpose behind the right to information, the right to privacy and\nconsequences of invasion, and breach of confidentiality and possible harm and injury\nthat would be caused to the third party, with reference to a particular information and\nthe person. In an article &#x27;Freedom of Information and the Public Interest: the\nCommonwealth experience&#x27; published in the Oxford University Commonwealth Law\nJournal, the factors identified as favouring disclosure, those against disclosure and\nlastly those irrelevant for consideration of public interest have been elucidated as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      &quot;it is generally accepted that the public interest is not synonymous with what is\n      of interest to the public, in the sense of satisfying public curiosity about some\n      matter. For example, the UK Information Tribunal has drawn a distinction\n      between &#x27;matters which were in the interests of the public to know and matters\n      which were merely interesting to the public (i.e. which the public would like to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                                Page 20 of 25</span>\n       know about, and which sell newspapers, but... are not relevant). Emphasis\n      Supplied\n\n      Factors identified as favouring disclosure include the public interest in:\ncontributing to a debate on a matter of public importance; accountability of officials;\nopenness in the expenditure of public funds, the performance by a public authority of its\nregulatory functions, the handling of complaints by public authorities; exposure of\nwrongdoing, inefficiency or unfairness; individuals being able to refute allegations made\nagainst them; enhancement of scrutiny of decision-making; and protecting against\ndanger to public health or safety.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      Factors that have been found to weigh against disclosure include: the likelihood of\ndamage to security or international relations; the likelihood of damage to the integrity or\nviability of decision-making processes: the public interest in public bodies being able to\nperform their functions effectively; the public interest in preserving the privacy of\nindividuals and the public interest in the preservation of confidences.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      Factors irrelevant to the consideration of the public interest have also been\nidentified. These include: that the information might be misunderstood; that the\nrequested information in overly technical in nature; and that disclosure would result in\nembarrassment to the government or to officials.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">10.   The foregoing extrapolation of the averred Apex Court judgment read with the\ncase laws specific to determining what constitutes larger public interest gives way to the\nobservation that although recruitment exams/interviews by government bodies entail a\npublic activity solely on the grounds of inviting applications and participation not of the\npublic as a whole but of such persons of the public who fulfil certain stipulated\nparameters/employment/service conditions. Now, to usher in public interest in every\nsuch recruitment upon a stray case of an applicant demanding access to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                                Page 21 of 25</span>\n information of third parties on the sole premise of apprehension of unfairness or to\nassess their performance vis-à-vis other candidates or alleging upon their strong\nbelief that such other candidate should not have been selected etc. will seemingly\nnegate the concept and advent of right to privacy and the import of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\nof the RTI Act established through the Courts over the years. Similarly, an objective\nand generalised view of every recruitment made by government bodies being a public\nactivity and thus warranting disclosure of the information relating to the performance of\nthird parties or their credentials appears to be giving way to the proposition that an\nappointment made through such recruitments will attain the element of a\ncontinuing public activity by which measure then every aspect of service of the\nthird party will be warranting disclosure in public interest at some point in time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">      However, the precedents discussed so far nowhere appear to be laying down any\nsuch principle and therefore, it will be prudent to consider that the findings and\nobservation of the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court&#x27;s judgment in the Onkar Dattatray\nKalmankar matter relied upon by the Appellant has to be read on a case to case basis\nand the Apex Court order dated 07.02.2025 in SLP No. 2783/2025 upholding <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_52\">the said\njudgment</a> is not a ruling that overrides the averred constitution bench judgment in the\nSubhash Chandra Agarwal matter. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_37\">In other words, the Apex Court order of 07.02.2025\nspecifically upholds the order of disclosure <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_53\">laid down in</a> the Onkar Dattatray\nKalmankar and does not overrule the <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_54\">Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a> case law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_38\">11.   And therefore, in the instant set of cases, the Commission relies on the <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_55\">Subhash\nChandra Agarwal</a> case law to uphold the denial of the personal information of the third\nparties and finds that the material on record does not ascribe larger public interest in the\ndisclosure of the information related to the third parties in any of the contexts discussed\nat para 9 hereinabove.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                                Page 22 of 25</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"> 12.   Having observed as above, the Commission finds no scope of intervention in the\nmatter with respect to the replies provided by the CPIOs in Second Appeal No(s).\nCIC/IIIKY/A/2024/608161 + CIC/IIIKY/A/2024/606800.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">13.   However, in Second Appeal No. CIC/IIIKY/A/2024/615874, the Commission\nobserves that the CPIO has far stretched their apprehensions with respect to the\ninformation sought for at points 1 &amp; 5 of the RTI Application which sought for the\nAppellant&#x27;s own marks etc by making the access to information conditional with\narbitrarily offering the information under CCTV surveillance; demand of various\ndocuments to prove identity and masking appellant&#x27;s own marks citing safety security\nthreats. The Respondent is strictly cautioned that so much of abundant caution was\ngrossly unwarranted and not backed by any provision of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_56\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      Similarly, the denial of the information on point no.13 wherein the Appellant\nsought for his interview marks, separately awarded or otherwise, the denial under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_57\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> &amp; (g) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_58\">RTI Act</a> was appropriate only to the extent if names of the separate\ninterview board member was part of the relevant record. However, it is not understood as\nto how asking of mere marks would disclose names of interview board members and the\nCPIO even failed to apply their mind to invoke <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 10</a> if such was the pressing need\nto withhold information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">      Further, for point no.4, the CPIO has mindlessly justified the denial of the\nquestion paper by stating that disclosure will give advantage to the recipient over others.\nWhen the examination was over and the process of selection was complete, the question\nof giving advantage to the RTI Applicant does not arise. To put it more clearly, unless it\nwas argued that the examination is not yet over; or it was a matter of limited question\nbank as with super speciality examinations etc., there being an advantage to the recipient\nof the question paper does not arise. Moreover, the denial citing policy matter of the\ninstitute for invoking <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the RTI Act is found to be completely out of\nplace and misconceived as <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> nowhere states &quot;policy matter&quot; as a ground\nfor denial. Moreover, here, the Commission is also putting stress on the averment of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                                Page 23 of 25</span>\n Appellant that - &#x27;The test was not a conventional exam but a written presentation-based\nassessment. The question paper contained only six topics, and each candidate was\nrequired to prepare presentation (in written format) on any one of these six topics.&#x27; This\nleaves little to the imagination to consider any aspect of limitation that the Respondent\nfaced or apprehends to face with the disclosure of the question paper as sought for by the\nAppellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">      Adverting to the foregoing observations, the CPIO is now directed to provide\nthe information sought for at points 1, 4, 5 &amp; 13 of the RTI Application to the\nAppellant and the only liberty accorded to the CPIO is to mask the names of the\nexaminers and invigilators or third party, if any, appearing in the answer scripts &amp;\ninterview mark sheet/record of the Appellant; question paper etc. in line with the\nexemption of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 10</a> of the RTI Act.
