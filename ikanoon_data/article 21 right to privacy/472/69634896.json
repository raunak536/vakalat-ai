What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\n                                    postulates the reservation of a private space for the individual,\n                                    described as the right to be let alone. The concept is founded\n                                    on the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an individual\n                                    to make choices lies at the core of the human personality. The\n                                    notion of privacy enables the individual to assert and control\n                                    the human element which is inseparable from the personality\n                                    of the individual. The inviolable nature of the human\n                                    personality is manifested in the ability to make decisions on\n                                    matters intimate to human life. The autonomy of the\n                                    individual is associated over matters which can be kept\n                                    private. These are concerns over which there is a legitimate\n                                    expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are inseparable\n                                    elements of the human personality. The integrity of the body\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                     25/39</span>\n\f                                                                                  W.P.Nos.26397 &amp; 27246 of 2017\n\n                                    and the sanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation that\n                                    each individual possesses an inalienable ability and right to\n                                    preserve a private space in which the human personality can\n                                    develop. Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability\n                                    of the personality would be in doubt. Recognising a zone of\n                                    privacy is but an acknowledgment that each individual must\n                                    be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development of\n                                    personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity\n                                    itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are intimate\n                                    to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy where one is\n                                    free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy, an\n                                    individual is not judged by others. Privacy enables each\n                                    individual to take crucial decisions which find expression in\n                                    the human personality. It enables individuals to preserve their\n                                    beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences\n                                    and choices against societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy\n                                    is an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of the\n                                    individual to be different and to stand against the tide of\n                                    conformity in creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects the\n                                    individual from the searching glare of publicity in matters\n                                    which are personal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the\n                                    person and not to the place where it is associated. Privacy\n                                    constitutes the foundation of all liberty because it is in privacy\n                                    that the individual can decide how liberty is best exercised.\n                                    Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a\n                                    pattern woven out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a\n                                    plural culture.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">                                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_29\">22.

Ours is a democratic society and every citizen and association\n\n                     of citizens has right of privacy. If that privacy is getting invaded\n\n                     indiscriminately, then there would be an end for all the democratic way\n\n                     of life and the rule of the law. However, under the guise of privacy, no\n\n                     citizen or association of persons can indulge in illegal or unlawful\n\n                     activities. At the same time, under the guise of suspicion, no police\n\n                     officer straightway walk into the place, make a raid and search without\n\n                     reason to believe that such place is used as gaming-house. For instance,\n\n                     gaming which includes wagering or betting to the extent it is defined in\n\n                     the Act, is forbidden by it. Simply, because a police officer thinks that\n\n                     some gaming is going on in a place, he cannot make a search of it. When\n\n                     a person&#x27;s private life or his privacy is sought to be interfered with, it\n\n                     should be done with a sense of responsibility. That is why the search\n\n                     which is permitted under <a href=\"/doc/5679480/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 5</a> is circumscribed by very many\n\n                     limitations and precautions, which are clearly intended to safeguard the\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                     32/39</span>\n\f                                                                            W.P.Nos.26397 &amp; 27246 of 2017\n\n                     interests of the citizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">                                  28.
