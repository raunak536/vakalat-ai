Questions formulated for consideration\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">1.   By an order dated 05.10.2017, a Three Member Bench of this\n\nCourt directed Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 to be placed\n\nbefore the Constitution Bench, after two learned senior counsel,\n\nappointed as amicus curiae, submitted that the questions arising for\n\nconsideration in the writ petition were of great importance. Though\n\nthe Bench recorded, in its order dated 05.10.2017, the questions\n\nthat were submitted by the learned amicus curiae, the Three\n\nMember Bench did not frame any particular question, but directed\n\nthe matter to be placed before the Constitution Bench.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">2.   At this juncture, a Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 of\n\n2017 arising out a judgment of the Kerala High Court came up\n\nbefore the same Three Member Bench. Finding that the questions\n\nraised in the said SLP were also similar, this Court passed an order\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  3</span>\n\fon 10.11.2017, directing the said SLP also to be tagged with Writ\n\nPetition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">3.   Thereafter, the Constitution Bench, by an order dated\n\n24.10.2019, formulated the following five questions to be decided by\n\nthis Court:­\n\n\n          “…1) Are the grounds specified in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 19(2)</a> in\n          relation to which reasonable restrictions on the right\n          to free speech can be imposed by law, exhaustive, or\n          can restrictions on the right to free speech be imposed\n          on grounds not found in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19(2)</a> by invoking other\n          fundamental rights?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">          2) Can a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19</a> or 21 of\n          the Constitution of India be claimed other than against\n          the ‘State’ or its instrumentalities?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">          3) Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively\n          protect the rights of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n          Constitution of India even against a threat to the\n          liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another\n          citizen or private agency?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">          4) Can a statement made by a Minister, traceable to\n          any affairs of State or for protecting the Government,\n          be attributed vicariously to the Government itself,\n          especially in view of the principle of Collective\n          Responsibility?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">          5) Whether a statement by a Minister, inconsistent\n          with the rights of a citizen under Part Three of the\n          Constitution, constitutes a violation of such\n          constitutional    rights  and   is   actionable   as\n          ‘Constitutional Tort”? …”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     4</span>\n\fII.   A brief backdrop\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Without a brief reference to the factual matrix, the questions\n\nto be answered by us may look abstract. Therefore, we shall now\n\nrefer to the background facts in both these cases.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.    Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 was filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n\n32</a> of the Constitution praying for several reliefs including\n\nmonitoring the investigation of a criminal complaint in FIR\n\nNo.0838/2016 under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 154</a> Cr.P.C., for the offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1786277/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 395</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_8\">397</a> and <a href=\"/doc/482448/\" id=\"a_9\">376</a>­D read with the relevant provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_10\">Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012</a> (for\n\nshort, ‘<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_11\">POCSO Act</a>’) and for the trial of the case outside the State\n\nand also for registering a complaint against the then Minister for\n\nUrban Development of the Government of U.P. for making\n\nstatements outrageous to the modesty of the victims. The case of\n\nthe petitioner in Writ Petition (Criminal) No.113 of 2016 in brief was\n\nthat on 29.7.2016 when he and the members of his family were\n\ntravelling from Noida to Shahjahanpur on National Highway 91 to\n\nattend the death ceremony of a relative, they were waylaid by a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                  5</span>\n\fgang. According to the writ petitioner, the gang snatched away cash\n\nand jewelry in the possession of the petitioner and his family\n\nmembers and they also gang raped the wife and minor daughter of\n\nthe petitioner. Though an FIR was registered on 30.7.2016 for\n\nvarious offences and newspapers and the television channels\n\nreported this ghastly incident, the then Minister for Urban\n\nDevelopment of the Government of U.P. called for a press\n\nconference and termed the incident as a political conspiracy.\n\nTherefore, the petitioner apprehended that there may not be a fair\n\ninvestigation. The petitioner claims that he was also offended by the\n\nirresponsible statement made by the Minister and hence he was\n\ncompelled to file the said writ petition for the reliefs stated supra.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.   Insofar as Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629 of 2017 is\n\nconcerned, the same arose out of a judgment of the Division Bench\n\nof the Kerala High Court dismissing two writ petitions. The writ\n\npetitions were filed in public interest on the ground that the then\n\nMinister for Electricity in the State of Kerala issued certain\n\nstatements in February 2016, 7.4.2017 and 22.4.2017. These\n\nstatements were highly derogatory of women. Though according to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                    6</span>\n\fthe petitioners in the public interest litigation, the political party to\n\nwhich the Minister belonged, issued a public censure, no action\n\nwas taken officially against the Minister. Therefore, the petitioner in\n\none writ petition prayed among other things for a direction to the\n\nChief Minister to frame a Code of Conduct for the Ministers who\n\nhave subscribed to the oath of office as prescribed by the\n\nConstitution with a further direction to the Chief Minister to take\n\nsuitable action if any of the Ministers failed to live upto the oath.\n\nThe prayer in the second writ petition was for a direction to the\n\nconcerned Authorities to take action against the Minister for his\n\nutterances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">7.   Both the writ petitions were dismissed by a Division Bench of\n\nthe Kerala High Court, on the ground that the prayer of the public\n\ninterest writ petitioners were in the realm of moral values and that\n\nthe question whether the Chief Minister should frame a code of\n\nconduct for the Ministers of his cabinet or not, is not within the\n\ndomain of the Court to decide. Therefore, challenging the said\n\ncommon order, the petitioner in one of those public interest writ\n\npetitions has come up with Special Leave Petition (Diary) No.34629\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                   7</span>\n\fof 2017. Since the questions raised by the petitioner in the Special\n\nLeave Petition overlapped with the questions raised in the Writ\n\nPetition, they have been tagged together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\nIII.

The   learned   Attorney   General   for   India   submitted   a\n\npreliminary note containing his submissions question­wise, which\n\ncan be summed up as follows:­\n\nQuestion No.1\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">(i)    On question No.1 it is his submission that as a matter of\n       constitutional principle, any addition, alteration or change in\n       the norms or criteria for imposition of restrictions on any\n       fundamental right has to come up through a legislative\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                   8</span>\n\f       process. The restrictions already enumerated in clauses (2)\n       and (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19</a> have to be taken to be exhaustive.\n       Therefore, the Court cannot, under the guise of invoking any\n       other fundamental right such as the one in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a>, impose\n       restrictions   not     found   in   <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_14\">Article   19(2).</a>   Under   the\n       Constitutional scheme, there can be no conflict between two\n       different fundamental rights or freedoms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Question No. 2</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">(ii)   The Constitution itself sets out the scheme of claims of\n       fundamental rights against the State or its instrumentalities\n       and it has also enacted in respect of breaches or violations of\n       fundamental rights by persons other than State or its\n       instrumentalities. Any proposition, to add or insert subjects or\n       matters in respect of which claims can be made against\n       persons other than the State, would amount to Constitutional\n       change. The concept of State action propounded and applied\n       in US Constitutional Law and the enactment of 42 US Code §\n       1983 have to be seen in the context of peculiar state of affairs\n       dealing with governmental and official immunities from legal\n       proceedings.

The concept of vicarious liability is incapable of\n        being applied to situations and no government can ever be\n        vicariously liable for malfeasance or misconduct of Minister\n        not traceable to statutory duty or statutory violations for the\n        purpose of legal remedies. Ministerial misdemeanors, which\n        have nothing to do with the discharge of public duty and not\n        traceable to the affairs of the State, will have to be treated as\n        acts of individual violation and individual wrong.

The\n         vertical   approach    connotes    a   situation   where    the\n         enforceability is only against the Government and not\n         against private actors. But with Nation States gradually\n         moving from laissez faire governance to welfare governance,\n         the role of the State is ever expanding, which justifies the\n         shift.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">(ix)     While the South African Constitution has adopted a\n         horizontal application by providing in <a href=\"/doc/584515/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 9(4)</a> of the Bill\n         of Rights of Final Constitution of 1996 that no person may\n         unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone\n         on one or more grounds in terms of sub­Section (3) which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                   21</span>\n\f          sets out the grounds that bind the State, the judiciary itself\n          has adopted a direct horizontal effect, in Ireland as could be\n          seen from the decisions in John Meskell vs. Córas\n          Iompair Éireann30and Murtagh Properties Limited vs.\n          Cleary31. In John Meskell (supra), the Irish Supreme Court\n          granted damages against the employer who dismissed the\n          employee for not joining a particular union after serving a\n          due notice to persuade him. In Murtagh Properties\n          Limited (supra), the High Court recognized and enforced\n          the right to earn livelihood without any discrimination\n          based on sex against a private employer. Countries like\n          Canada and Germany have developed indirect horizontal\n          application, meaning thereby that the rights regulate the\n          laws and statutes, which in turn regulate the conduct of\n          citizens;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">(x)       In the Indian context, direct horizontal effect has limited\n          application as can be seen from <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_91\">Articles 15(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_92\">, 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_93\">24;</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">(xi)      Paradigm cases of horizontality should be distinguished\n          from ordinary cases.

On a formal level, values\n          are understood teleologically as things to be promoted or\n          maximized. Rights, on the other hand, are not to be\n          promoted but rather to be respected. It would not show\n          proper concern for a right to allow the violation of one right\n          in order to prevent the violation of other rights. This would\n          promote the non­violation of rights, but it would not\n          respect rights39;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">(xvi)     Instead of values whose satisfaction is to be maximized,\n          rights act as constraints on the actions of the state. They\n          confer individuals with a sphere of liberty that is inviolable.\n\n36 AIR 1987 SC 1086\n37 (2005) 6 SCC 657\n38 (2012) 6 SCC 1\n39 Frances Kamm, Morality, Mortality Vol.2, Oxford University Press, 1996\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                             24</span>\n\f          Rights thereby act as restrictions on the government on\n          how to pursue values, including constitutional values. It is,\n          therefore, crucially important that we draw a distinction\n          between   the   constitutional   rights   and   constitutional\n          values. Not every increase in liberty or every improvement\n          in leading a dignified life is a constitutional right. This\n          position has been accepted by this Court;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_69\">(xvii)    As held by this Court in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy, the\n          Court will strike a balance, wherever a conflict between two\n          sets of fundamental rights is projected. Strictly speaking,\n          what is actually conceived by some and noted in several\n          decisions including Justice K.S. Puttaswamy, is not the\n          conflict of rights in abstractum, at a doctrinal level, but the\n          conflict in the notion/invocation/practice of rights;\n\n(xviii)   On the issue of statements made by Ministers and\n          collective responsibility, a reference has to be made to\n          <a href=\"/doc/1336375/\" id=\"a_101\">Articles 75(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/331399/\" id=\"a_102\">164(2).</a>     Both these Articles speak of\n          collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers. Though\n          the language employed in these Articles indicate that such\n          a collective responsibility is to the House of the People/\n          Legislative Assembly, it is actually a responsibility to the\n          people at large. Since every utterance by a Minister will\n          have a direct bearing on the policy of the Government,\n          there is an imperative need for a voluntary code of\n          conduct. As pointed out by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_103\">Common Cause</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                    25</span>\n\f        (supra), collective responsibility has two meanings, namely,</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">        (i) that all members of the Council of Ministers are\n        unanimous in support of its policies and exhibit such\n        unanimity in public; and (ii) that they are personally and\n        morally responsible for its success and failure;\n\n(xix)   Individual aberrations on the part of Ministers are serious\n        threats to constitutional governance and as such the head\n        of the Council of Ministers has a duty to ensure that such\n        breaches do not happen;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">(xx)    A code of conduct to self­regulate the speeches and actions\n        of Ministers is constitutionally justifiable and this Court\n        can definitely examine its requirement. Ideally, a Minister\n        is not supposed to breach his collective responsibility\n        towards the Cabinet and the Legislature and hence, it is\n        advisable to have a cogent code of conduct as occurring in\n        advanced democracies;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"131068451\" id=\"span_71\">(xxi)   While it is not possible to impose additional restrictions on\n        the freedom of speech, it is certainly desirable to have a\n        code of conduct for public functionaries, as followed in\n        other jurisdictions. The Court may keep in mind the fact\n        that   this   Court   in   <a href=\"/doc/131068451/\" id=\"a_104\">Sahara    India    Real   Estate\n        Corporation Limited</a> (supra) cautioned against framing\n        guidelines across the board to restrict the freedom of Press;\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                   26</span>\n\f(xxii)    Coming to hate speeches, there has been a steep increase\n          in the number of hate speeches since 2014. From May­\n          2014 to date, there have been 124 reported instances of\n          derogatory speeches by 45 politicians. Social media\n          platforms have connived the proliferation of targeted hate\n          speech.

For finding an answer to this question, it may be necessary\n\nand even relevant to take a peep into history. Since Dr. B.R.\n\nAmbedkar’s original draft in this regard followed <a href=\"/doc/1714884/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 40(6)</a> of the\n\nIrish Constitution, the original draft of the Advisory Committee\n\nincluded restrictions such as public order, morality, sedition,\n\nobscenity, blasphemy and defamation. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel\n\nsuggested the inclusion of libel also. These restrictions were sought\n\nto be justified by citing the decision in Gitlow vs. New York42.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">14.

Immediately after the adoption of the Constitution, this Court\n\nhad an occasion to deal with a challenge to an order passed by the\n\nGovernment of Madras in exercise of the powers conferred by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/584515/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 9</a>(1­A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act,\n\n194944, banning the entry and circulation of a weekly journal called\n\n‘Cross Roads’ printed and published in Bombay. The ban order was\n\nchallenged on the ground that it was violative of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n\nThe validity of the statutory provision under which the ban order\n\nwas issued, was also attacked on the basis of <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 13(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution. A Seven Member Constitution Bench of this Court,\n\nwhile upholding the challenge in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_116\">Romesh Thappar vs. State of\n\nMadras45</a> held as follows: ­\n\n44 1949 Act\n45 AIR 1950 SC 124\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                    32</span>\n\f            “[12] We are therefore of opinion that unless a law\n            restricting freedom of speech and expression is\n            directed solely against the undermining of the security\n            of the State or the overthrow of it, such law cannot fall\n            within the reservation under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_117\">Art. 19</a>,\n            although the restrictions which it seeks to impose may\n            have been conceived generally in the interests of public\n            order. …”</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_82\">16. An argument was advanced in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_118\">Romesh Thappar</a> (supra) that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/584515/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 9</a>(1­A) of the 1949 Act could not be considered wholly void,\n\nas the securing of public safety or maintenance of public order\n\nwould include the security of the State and that therefore the said\n\nprovision, as applied to the latter purpose was covered by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_120\">Article\n\n19(2).</a> However, the said argument was rejected on the ground that\n\nwhere a law purports to authorise the imposition of restrictions on\n\na fundamental right, in language wide enough to cover restrictions,\n\nboth within or without the limits of Constitutionally permissible\n\nlegislative action affecting such right, it is not possible to uphold it\n\neven so far as it may be applied within the Constitutional limits, as\n\nit is not severable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43023\" id=\"span_83\">17. On the same date on which the decision in Romesh Thappar\n\nwas delivered, the Constitution Bench of this Court also delivered\n\nanother judgment in <a href=\"/doc/43023/\" id=\"a_121\">Brij Bhushan vs. The State of Delhi46</a>. It also\n46 AIR 1950 SC 129\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                       33</span>\n\farose out of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 32</a> challenging an order\n\npassed by the Chief Commissioner of Delhi in exercise of the powers\n\nconferred by Section 7(1)(c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act,\n\n1949, requiring the Printer and the Publisher as well as the Editor\n\nof an English weekly by name ‘Organizer’, to submit for scrutiny,\n\nbefore publication, all communal matters and news and views\n\nabout Pakistan including photographs and cartoons, other than\n\nthose derived from the official sources. Following the decision in\n\nRomesh Thappar, the Constitution Bench held that the imposition\n\nof pre­censorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the\n\nPress, which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech\n\nand expression. The Bench went on to hold that Section 7(1)(c) of\n\nthe East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949 does not fall within the\n\nreservation of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 19.</a></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_77\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">18. After aforesaid two decisions, the Parliament sought to amend\n\nthe Constitution through the Constitution (First Amendment) Bill,\n\n1951. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the First\n\nAmendment, it was indicated that the citizen&#x27;s right to freedom of\n\nspeech and expression guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> has been held\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                   34</span>\n\fby some Courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person\n\nculpable, even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence.\n\nIncidentally, the First Amendment also dealt with other issues,\n\nabout which we are not concerned in this discussion. Clause (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 19</a> was substituted by a new clause under the <a href=\"/doc/136460171/\" id=\"a_126\">Constitution\n\n(First Amendment) Act, 1951</a>. For easy appreciation of the\n\nmetamorphosis that clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 19</a> underwent after the first\n\namendment, we present in a tabular column, <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 19(2)</a> pre­first\n\namendment and post­first amendment as under: ­\n\n\nPre­First Amendment – Article              Post­First Amendment – <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_129\">Article\n19(2)                                      19(2)\n(2)</a> Nothing in sub­clause (a) of clause    (2) Nothing in sub­clause (a) of\n(1) shall affect the operation of any      clause (1) shall affect the operation\nexisting law in so far as it relates to,   of any existing law, or prevent the\nor prevents the State from making          State from making any law, in so far\nany law relating to, libel, slander,       as such law imposes reasonable\ndefamation, contempt of court or any       restrictions on the exercise of the\nmatter which offends against decency       right conferred by the said sub­\nor morality or which undermines the        clause in the interests of the\nsecurity of, or tends to overthrow, the    security of the State, friendly\nState.                                     relations with foreign States, public\n                                           order, decency or morality, or in\n                                           relation to contempt of court,\n                                           defamation or incitement to an\n                                           offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_79\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">19. It is significant to note that <a href=\"/doc/66651735/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 3(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution\n\n(First Amendment) Act, 1951, declared that the newly substituted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                       35</span>\n\fclause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 19</a> shall be deemed always to have been\n\nenacted in the amended form, meaning thereby that the\n\namended clause (2) was given retrospective effect.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"554839\" id=\"span_87\">20. Another important feature to be noted in the amended clause\n\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 19</a> is the inclusion of the words ‘reasonable\n\nrestrictions’. Thus, the test of reasonableness was introduced by the\n\nfirst amendment and the same fell for jural exploration within no\n\ntime, in <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_133\">State of Madras vs. V.G. Row47</a>. The said case arose out\n\nof a judgment of the Madras High Court quashing a Government\n\nOrder declaring a society known as ‘People’s Education Society’ as\n\nan unlawful association and also declaring as unconstitutional,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/102473669/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 15(2)(b)</a> of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908,\n\nas amended by the Indian Criminal Law Amendment (Madras) Act,\n\n1950. While upholding the judgment of the Madras High Court, this\n\nCourt indicated as to how the test of reasonableness has to be\n\nexpounded. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as follows: ­\n\n             “23. It is important in this context to bear in mind that\n             the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed,\n             should be applied to each individual statute impugned,\n             and no abstract standard, or general pattern of\n\n47(1952) 1 SCC 410\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                        36</span>\n\f          reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all\n          cases. The nature of the right alleged to have been\n          infringed,    the    underlying   purpose     of  the\n          restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the\n          evil sought to be remedied thereby, the\n          disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing\n          conditions at the time, should all enter into the\n          judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive factors\n          and forming their own conception of what is\n          reasonable, in all the circumstances of a given\n          case, it is inevitable that the social philosophy and\n          the scale of values of the Judges participating in\n          the decision should play an important part, and the\n          limit to their interference with legislative\n          judgment in such cases can only be dictated by\n          their sense of responsibility and self­restraint and\n          the sobering reflection that the Constitution is\n          meant not only for people of their way of thinking\n          but for all, and that the majority of the elected\n          representatives of the people have, in authorizing\n          the imposition of the restrictions, considered them\n          to be reasonable.”</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">21. After the First Amendment to the Constitution, the country\n\nwitnessed cries for secession, with parochial tendencies showing\n\ntheir ugly head, especially from a southern State. Therefore, a\n\nNational Integration Conference was convened in September­\n\nOctober, 1961 to find ways and means to combat the evils of\n\ncommunalism,     casteism,    regionalism,     linguism    and    narrow\n\nmindedness. This Conference decided to set up the National\n\nIntegration Council. Accordingly, it was constituted in 1962. The\n\nconstitution of the Council assumed significance in the wake of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                   37</span>\n\fSino­India war in 1962. This National Integration Council had a\n\nCommittee on national integration and regionalism. This Committee\n\nrecommended two amendments to the Constitution, namely, (i) the\n\namendment of clause (2) of Article 19 so as to include the words\n\n“the sovereignty and integrity of India” as one of the restrictions; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">(ii) the amendment of 8 Forms of oath or affirmation contained in\n\nthe Third Schedule. Until 1963, no one taking a constitutional oath\n\nwas required to swear that they would “uphold the sovereignty and\n\nintegrity of India”. <a href=\"/doc/193481063/\" id=\"a_135\">But, the Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act,\n\n1963</a> expanded the forms of oath to ensure that “every candidate\n\nfor the membership of a State Legislature or Parliament, and every\n\naspirant to, and incumbent of, public office” – to quote its Statement\n\nof Objects and Reasons – “pledges himself . . . to preserve the\n\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Union of India.” Thus, by the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/193481063/\" id=\"a_136\">Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963</a>, “the sovereignty\n\nand integrity of India”, was included as an additional ground of\n\nrestriction on the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_84\">22. Having seen the history of evolution of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 19</a>,\n\nlet us now turn to the first question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                  38</span>\n\fTwo parts of Question No.1\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">23. Question No.1 is actually in two parts. The first part raises a\n\nposer as to whether reasonable restrictions on the right to free\n\nspeech enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 19(2)</a> could be said to be exhaustive.\n\nThe second part of the Question raises a debate as to whether\n\nadditional restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed on\n\ngrounds not found in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 19(2)</a>, by invoking other fundamental\n\nrights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\">\nFirst part of Question No.1\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">24. The judicial history of the evolution of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 19</a>\n\nwhich we have captured above shows that lot of deliberations went\n\ninto the articulation of the restrictions now enumerated. The draft\n\nReport of the Sub­Committee on Fundamental Rights itself\n\nunderwent several changes until the Constitution was adopted in\n\nNovember, 1949. In the form in which the Constitution was adopted\n\nin 1949, the restrictions related to (i) libel; (ii) slander; (iii)\n\ndefamation; (iv) contempt of court; (v) any matter which offends\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                 39</span>\n\fagainst decency or morality; and (vi) any matter which undermines\n\nthe security of the State or tends to overthrow the State.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">25.

The Court made it clear that the reasonable\n\nrestrictions sought to be imposed must be through “a law” having\n\nstatutory force and not a mere Executive or Departmental\n\ninstruction. The restraint upon the Executive not to have a\n\nback­door intrusion applies equally to Courts. While Courts\n\nmay be entitled to interpret the law in such a manner that the\n\nrights existing in blue print have expansive connotations, the Court\n\ncannot     impose      additional      restrictions     by    using       tools   of\n\ninterpretation.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_101\">What this Court can do and how far it can afford to\n\ngo, was articulated by B.

An argument can be made that this Court can\n             make exceptions under the peculiar circumstances of\n             this case, wherein the State has acknowledged that it\n             has not acted with the requisite speed and vigour in the\n             case of large volumes of suspected unaccounted for\n             monies of certain individuals. There is an inherent\n             danger in making exceptions to fundamental principles\n             and rights on the fly. Those exceptions, bit by bit, would\n             then eviscerate the content of the main right itself.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">50(1986) 3 SCC 615\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                        46</span>\n\f             Undesirable lapses in upholding of fundamental rights\n             by the legislature, or the executive, can be rectified by\n             assertion of constitutional principles by this Court.\n             However, a decision by this Court that an exception\n             could be carved out remains permanently as a part of\n             judicial canon, and becomes a part of the constitutional\n             interpretation itself. It can be used in the future in a\n             manner and form that may far exceed what this Court\n             intended or what the constitutional text and values can\n             bear. We are not proposing that Constitutions cannot be\n             interpreted in a manner that allows the nation­State to\n             tackle the problems it faces. The principle is that\n             exceptions cannot be carved out willy­nilly, and without\n             forethought as to the damage they may cause.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">             86.One of the chief dangers of making exceptions to\n             principles that have become a part of constitutional law,\n             through aeons of human experience, is that the logic,\n             and ease of seeing exceptions, would become\n             entrenched as a part of the constitutional order.

The role envisaged in the Constitutional scheme for\n\nthe Court, is to be a gate­keeper (and a conscience keeper) to\n\ncheck strictly the entry of restrictions, into the temple of\n\nfundamental rights. The role of the Court is to protect\n\nfundamental rights limited by lawful restrictions and not to\n\nprotect restrictions and make the rights residual privileges.\n\nClause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 19</a> saves (i) the operation of any existing law;\n\nand (ii) the making of any law by the State.

This part of Question No.1 already stands partly answered\n\nwhile dealing with the first part of Question No.1. The decisions of\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1902038/\" id=\"a_207\">Express Newspapers (Private) Ltd.</a> (supra), the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_208\">Cricket Association of Bengal</a> (supra) and Ramlila Maidan\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                 53</span>\n\fIncident, in re.

The question whether additional restrictions can peep into\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 19(2)</a>, by invoking other fundamental rights, also stands\n\nanswered by this Court in Sakal Papers. In Sakal Papers, the\n\nCentral Government issued an order called Daily Newspaper (Price\n\nand Page) Order, 1960 in exercise of the power conferred under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/534021/\" id=\"a_211\">Newspaper (Price and Page) Act, 1956</a>, fixing the maximum number\n\nof pages that might be published by a newspaper according to the\n\nprice charged. Therefore, the publisher of a Marathi Newspaper\n\nchallenged the constitutionality of both the Act and the Order. One\n\nof the arguments raised on behalf of the State in the said case was\n\nthat there are two aspects of the activities of newspapers namely,\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">(i) the dissemination of news and views; and (ii) the commercial\n\naspect. While the former would fall under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, the latter\n\nwould fall under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 19(1)(g).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_132\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">37. Since these two rights are independent and since the\n\nrestrictions on the right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> can be placed in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                     54</span>\n\finterest of the general public under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 19(6)</a>, it was contended\n\nby the State in Sakal Papers that the Act and the Order are saved\n\nby clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 19.</a> But the said argument of the State was\n\nrejected by the Constitution Bench in Sakal Papers, in the\n\nfollowing words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">          “It may well be within the power of the State to place,\n          in the interest of the general public, restrictions upon\n          the right of a citizen to carry on business but it is not\n          open to the State to achieve this object by directly and\n          immediately curtailing any other freedom of that\n          citizen guaranteed by the Constitution and which is\n          not susceptible of abridgement on the same grounds\n          as are set out in cl. (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_217\">Art. 19.</a> Therefore, the right\n          of freedom of speech cannot be taken away with the\n          object of placing restrictions on the business activities\n          of a citizen. Freedom of speech can be restricted only\n          in the interests of the security of the State, friendly\n          relations with foreign State, public order, decency or\n          morality or in relation to contempt of court,\n          defamation or incitement to an offence. It cannot, like\n          the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the\n          interest of the general public. If a law directly\n          affecting it is challenged it is no answer that the\n          restrictions enacted by it are justifiable under cls.\n          (3) to (6). For, the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_218\">Art. 19</a> is to\n          enumerate different freedoms separately and then\n          to specify the extent of restrictions to which they\n          may be subjected and the objects for securing\n          which this could be done. A citizen is entitled to\n          enjoy each and every one of the freedoms together\n          and cl. (1) does not prefer one freedom to another.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">          That is the plain meaning of this clause. It\n          follows from this that the State cannot make a\n          law which directly restricts one freedom even for\n          securing the better enjoyment of another freedom.\n          All the greater reason, therefore, for holding that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                     55</span>\n\f          the State cannot directly restrict one freedom by\n          placing an otherwise permissible restriction on\n          another freedom.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">38. We are conscious of the fact that Sakal Papers was a case\n\nwhere the petitioner before the Court had two different fundamental\n\nrights and the law made by the State fell within the permitted\n\nrestrictions upon the exercise of one of those two fundamental\n\nrights. However, the restriction traceable to clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 19</a>\n\nwas not available in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 19.</a> It is in such\n\ncircumstances that this Court held that the restriction validly\n\nimposed upon the exercise of one fundamental right cannot\n\nautomatically become valid while dealing with another fundamental\n\nright of the same person, the restriction of which stands\n\nConstitutionally on different parameters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_136\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">39. In Sakal Papers the conflict was neither between one\n\nindividual’s   fundamental     right    qua      another    individual’s\n\nfundamental    right   nor   one   fundamental    right    qua   another\n\nfundamental right of the same individual. It was a case where a\n\nrestriction validly made upon a fundamental right was held invalid\n\nqua another fundamental right of the same individual. In the cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                   56</span>\n\fon hand, what is sought to be projected is a possible conflict arising\n\nout of the exercise of a fundamental right by one individual, in a\n\nmanner infringing upon the free exercise of the fundamental right of\n\nanother person. But this conflict is age old.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_138\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">40. The exercise of all fundamental rights by all citizens is possible\n\nonly when each individual respects the other person’s rights. As\n\nacknowledged by the learned Attorney General and Ms. Aparjita\n\nSingh, learned Amicus, this Court has always struck a balance\n\nwhenever it was found that the exercise of fundamental rights by an\n\nindividual, caused inroads into the space available for the exercise\n\nof fundamental rights by another individual. The emphasis even in\n\nthe Preamble on “fraternity” is an indication that the survival of all\n\nfundamental rights and the survival of democracy itself depends\n\nupon mutual respect, accommodation and willingness to co­exist in\n\npeace and tranquility on the part of the citizens. Let us now see a\n\nfew examples. The Fundamental Duty enjoined upon every citizen of\n\nthe country under Article 51­A (e) to “promote harmony and the\n\nspirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India\n\ntranscending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                   57</span>\n\fand to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women”, is\n\nalso an indicator that no one can exercise his fundamental right in\n\na manner that infringes upon the fundamental right of another.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">41. As articulated by Jeevan Reddy, J. in Cricket Association of\n\nBengal, no one can exercise his right of speech in such a manner\n\nas to violate another man’s right. In paragraph 152 of the decision\n\nin Cricket Association of Bengal, Jeevan Reddy, J. said : “Indeed\n\nit may be the duty of the State to ensure that this right is\n\navailable to all in equal measure and that it is not hijacked\n\nby a few to the detriment of the rest. This obligation flows\n\nfrom the Preamble to our Constitution, which seeks to secure\n\nall its citizens liberty of thought, expression, belief and\n\nworship………...Under our Constitutional scheme, the State is\n\nnot merely under an obligation to respect the fundamental\n\nrights guaranteed by Part­III but under an equal obligation to\n\nensure conditions in which those rights can be meaningfully\n\nand effectively enjoyed by one and all.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                58</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131068451\" id=\"span_118\">42. The above passage from the opinion of Jeevan Reddy, J., in\n\nCricket Association of Bengal, was quoted with approval by the\n\nConstitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/131068451/\" id=\"a_221\">Sahara India Real Estate Corporation\n\nLimited</a> case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_142\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">43. There are several instances where this Court either struck a\n\nbalance or placed on a slightly higher pedestal, the fundamental\n\nright of one over that of the other. Interestingly, the competing\n\nclaims arose in many of those cases, in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 19(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">(a) right of one person qua <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 21</a> right of another. Let us now\n\ntake a look at some of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_145\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572071\" id=\"span_119\">(i)   In <a href=\"/doc/572071/\" id=\"a_224\">R. Rajagopal</a> (supra), the rights pitted against one another\n      were the freedom of expression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the\n      right to privacy of the Officers of the Government under Article</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">      21. This Court propounded:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">           “26. We may now summarise the broad principles\n           flowing from the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">              (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life\n           and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country\n           by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has\n           a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family,\n           marriage, procreation, motherhood, child­bearing and\n           education among other matters. None can publish\n           anything concerning the above matters without his\n           consent — whether truthful or otherwise and whether\n           laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                        59</span>\n\fviolating the right to privacy of the person concerned\nand would be liable in an action for damages. Position\nmay, however, be different, if a person voluntarily\nthrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites\nor raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that\nany publication concerning the aforesaid aspects\nbecomes unobjectionable if such publication is based\nupon public records including court records. This is\nfor the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of\npublic record, the right to privacy no longer subsists\nand it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\npress and media among others. We are, however, of\nthe opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_227\">Article\n19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule,\nviz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\nkidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further\nbe subjected to the indignity of her name and the\nincident being publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\nabove — indeed, this is not an exception but an\nindependent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\nobvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not available\nwith respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\ndischarge of their official duties. This is so even where\nthe publication is based upon facts and statements\nwhich are not true, unless the official establishes that\nthe publication was made (by the defendant) with\nreckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would\nbe enough for the defendant (member of the press or\nmedia) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\nverification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\nprove that what he has written is true. Of course,\nwhere the publication is proved to be false and\nactuated by malice or personal animosity, the\ndefendant would have no defence and would be liable\nfor damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not\nrelevant to the discharge of his duties, the public\nofficial enjoys the same protection as any other citizen,\nas explained in (1) and (2) above.

In certain cases, even the\n           accused seeks publicity (not in the pejorative sense) as\n           openness and transparency is the basis of a fair trial\n           in which all the stakeholders who are a party to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                       63</span>\n\flitigation including the Judges are under scrutiny and\nat the same time people get to know what is going on\ninside the courtrooms.

But, what happens\nwhen the courts are required to balance important\npublic interests placed side by side. For example, in\ncases where presumption of open justice has to be\nbalanced with presumption of innocence, which as\nstated above, is now recognised as a human right.\nThese presumptions existed at the time when the\nConstitution was framed [existing law under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_247\">Article\n19(2)]</a> and they continue till date not only as part of\nrule of law under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 14</a> but also as an <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_249\">Article 21</a>\nright. The constitutional protection in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_250\">Article 21</a> which\nprotects the rights of the person for a fair trial is, in\nlaw, a valid restriction operating on the right to free\nspeech under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_251\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, by virtue of force of it\nbeing a constitutional provision. Given that\nthe postponement orders curtail the freedom of\nexpression of third parties, such orders have to be\npassed only in cases in which there is real and\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to fairness of the trial or to\nthe proper administration of justice which in the words\nof Justice Cardozo is “the end and purpose of all laws”.\nHowever, such orders of postponement should be\nordered for a limited duration and without disturbing\nthe content of the publication. They should be passed\nonly when necessary to prevent real and substantial\nrisk to the fairness of the trial (court proceedings), if\nreasonable alternative methods or measures such as\nchange of venue or postponement of trial will not\nprevent the said risk and when the salutary effects of\nsuch orders outweigh the deleterious effects to the free\nexpression of those affected by the prior restraint. The\norder of postponement will only be appropriate in\ncases where the balancing test otherwise favours non­\npublication for a limited period. …”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                            64</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116356191\" id=\"span_127\">(vi)   In <a href=\"/doc/116356191/\" id=\"a_252\">Thalapplam Service Cooperative Bank Ltd.</a> (supra), the\n       right to know held as part of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the right to\n       privacy being part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 21</a> were perceived as competing\n       with each other, in a matter between holders of accounts in\n       cooperative banks and members of the public who wanted\n       details.

Be it stated, circumstances may emerge that may\n          necessitate for balancing between intra­fundamental\n          rights. It has been distinctly understood that the test\n          that has to be applied while balancing the two\n          fundamental rights or inter fundamental rights, the\n          principles applied may be different than the principle\n          to be applied in intra­conflict between the same\n          fundamental right. To elaborate, as in this case, the\n          accused has a fundamental right to have a fair trial\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Similarly, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                     66</span>\n\fvictims who are directly affected and also form a part\nof the constituent of the collective, have a fundamental\nright for a fair trial. Thus, there can be two individuals\nboth having legitimacy to claim or assert the right. The\nfactum of legitimacy is a primary consideration. It has\nto be remembered that no fundamental right is\nabsolute and it can have limitations in certain\ncircumstances. Thus, permissible limitations are\nimposed by the State. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"129750439\" id=\"span_133\">The said limitations are to be\nwithin the bounds of law. However, when there is\nintra­conflict of the right conferred under the same\narticle, like fair trial in this case, the test that is\nrequired to be applied, we are disposed to think, it\nwould      be    “paramount      collective  interest” or\n“sustenance of public confidence in the justice\ndispensation system”. An example can be cited. A\ngroup of persons in the name of “class honour”, as has\nbeen stated in <a href=\"/doc/129750439/\" id=\"a_265\">Vikas Yadav v. State of U.P.</a>, (2016) 9\nSCC 541: (2016) 3 SCC (Cri) 621], cannot curtail or\nthrottle the choice of a woman. It is because choice of\nwoman in choosing her partner in life is a legitimate\nconstitutional right. It is founded on individual choice\nthat is recognised in the Constitution under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 19</a>,\nand such a right is not expected to succumb to the\nconcept of “class honour” or “group thinking”. It is\nbecause the sense of class honour has no legitimacy\neven if it is practised by the collective under some kind\nof a notion. Therefore, if the collective interest or the\npublic interest that serves the public cause and\nfurther has the legitimacy to claim or assert a\nfundamental right, then only it can put forth that their\nright should be protected. There can be no denial of\nthe fact that the rights of the victims for a fair trial is\nan inseparable aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\nand when they assert that right by themselves as well\nas the part of the collective, the conception of public\ninterest gets galvanised.

The second question referred to us is as to whether a\n\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 19</a> or 21 can be claimed against\n\nanyone other than the State or its instrumentalities.

To use the phraseology adopted by the philosophers of Law,\n\nthe question on hand is as to whether Part III of the\n\nConstitution has a “vertical” or “horizontal” effect. Wherever\n\nConstitutional rights regulate and impact only the conduct of the\n\nGovernment and Governmental actors, in their dealings with private\n\nindividuals, they are said to have “a vertical effect”. But wherever\n\nConstitutional rights impact even the relations between private\n\nindividuals, they are said to have “a horizontal effect”.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">48. In    his   scholarly    article,   “The   ‘Horizontal   Effect’   of\n\nConstitutional Rights”, published in Michigan Law Review (Volume\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">2. Issue 3, 2003) Stephen Gardbaum, states that the horizontal\n\nposition has been adopted to varying degrees in Ireland, Canada,\n\nGermany, South Africa and European Union. According to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                   70</span>\n\flearned author, this issue has also been the topic of sustained\n\ndebate in the United Kingdom following the enactment of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_278\">Human Rights Act</a> of 199855.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_157\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">49. No jurisdiction in the world appears to be adopting, at least as\n\non date, a purely vertical approach or a wholly horizontal approach.\n\nA vertical approach provides weightage to individual autonomy,\n\nchoice and privacy, while the horizontal approach seeks to imbibe\n\nConstitutional values in all individuals. These approaches which\n\nappear to be bipolar opposites, raise the age­old question of\n\n‘individual vs. society’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_159\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">50. Even in countries where the individual reigns supreme, as in\n\nthe United States, the Thirteenth Amendment making slavery and\n\ninvoluntary servitude a punishable offence, has actually made\n\ninroads into individual autonomy. Therefore, some scholars think\n\nthat the Thirteenth Amendment provided a shift from the ‘purely\n\nvertical’ approach in a direct way. Subsequently, an indirect effect\n\nof the horizontality was found in certain decisions of the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court, two of which are of interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_161\">55Interestingly The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 was enacted in India five years\n before a similar Act came in United Kingdom.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                             71</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_162\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">\f51. After the American Civil War (1861­1865), the Reconstruction\n\nEra began in the United States. During this period, the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment came (1866­1868) followed by the Civil Rights Act,\n\n1875 (also called Enforcement Act or <a href=\"/doc/1786905/\" id=\"a_279\">Force Act</a>). This Civil Rights\n\nAct, 1875 entitled everyone, to access accommodation, public\n\ntransport and theaters regardless of race or color. Finding that\n\ndespite the Act, they were excluded from “whites only” facilities in\n\nhotels, theaters etc., the victims of discrimination (African­\n\nAmericans) filed cases. All those five cases were tagged together and\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court held in (year 1883) what came to be known\n\nas “Civil Rights Cases”56 that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments        did   not   empower   Congress   to   outlaw   racial\n\ndiscrimination by private individuals. But after nearly 85 years, this\n\ndecision was overturned in Jones vs. Alfred H. Mayer Co57\n\nwherein it was held that Congress could regulate sale of private\n\nproperty to prevent racial discrimination. This was done in terms of\n\n42 U.S. Code § 1982 which entitled all citizens of the United States\n\nto have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by\n\n\n56109 US 3 (1883)\n57392 US 409 (1968)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                   72</span>\n\fwhite citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\n\nconvey real and personal property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_164\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">52. But a good 20 years before the decision in Jones (supra) was\n\ndelivered, the U.S. Supreme Court had an occasion to consider a\n\nclash between contractual rights and Constitutional rights. It was\n\nin Shelly (supra) where an African­American family (Shellys) who\n\npurchased a property in a neighbourhood in St. Louis, Missouri was\n\nsought to be restrained from taking possession, because of a\n\nracially restrictive covenant contained in an Agreement of the year\n\n1911 to which a majority of property owners in the neighbourhood\n\nwere parties. The covenant restricted the sale of any property or\n\npart thereof for a term of 50 years to African­Americans and Asian­\n\nAmericans. The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the racially\n\nrestricted covenant. But the U.S. Supreme Court reversed it holding\n\nthat the enforcement of such covenants violated the Equal\n\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.           In other words\n\nthe   contractual   rights   were   trumped   by   the   Constitutional\n\nobligations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_166\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                    73</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">\f53. Then came the decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan58. It\n\nwas a case where the City Commissioner in Montgomery, Alabama\n\nfiled an action for libel against the New York Times for publishing\n\nan allegedly defamatory statement in a paid advertisement. The jury\n\nawarded damages and the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme\n\nCourt of Alabama. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the\n\ndecision and held that the First Amendment which prohibited a\n\npublic official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood\n\nrelating to the public official’s official conduct except in the case of\n\nactual malice, bound the plaintiff from exercising his private right.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">54.

While the U.S. Constitution represented (to begin with) a\n\npurely vertical approach, the Irish Constitution was found to be on\n\nthe opposite side of the spectrum, with the rights provided therein\n\nhaving horizontal effect. <a href=\"/doc/1714884/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 40</a> of the Irish Constitution deals\n\nwith Personal Rights under the Chapter “Fundamental Rights”. Sub­\n\n\n58376 U.S. 254 (1964)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                  <a href=\"/doc/69259609/\" id=\"a_281\">74</a></span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_282\">Article (3)</a> of <a href=\"/doc/1714884/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 40</a> states that “The State guarantees in its laws\n\nto respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and\n\nvindicate the personal rights of the citizen”. In other words, two\n\nrights are guaranteed namely (i) respect for the personal rights of\n\nthe citizen; and (ii) to defend and vindicate the personal rights of its\n\ncitizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_171\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_172\">56. The second clause of sub­Article (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1714884/\" id=\"a_284\">Article 40</a> of the Irish\n\nConstitution states that “The State shall, in particular, by its laws\n\nprotect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice\n\ndone, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of\n\nevery citizen”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_173\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">57. The above provisions have been interpreted by the Irish\n\nSupreme Court as imposing a positive obligation on all State actors,\n\nincluding the Courts to protect and enforce the rights of individuals.\n\nIt appears that full horizontal effect was given by the Irish Supreme\n\nCourt to Constitutional rights such as freedom of association,\n\nfreedom from sex discrimination and the right to earn a livelihood.\n\nFor instance, the Irish Supreme Court had an occasion to consider\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                                  75</span>\n\fin John Meskell, the Constitutional rights of citizens to form\n\nassociations and unions guaranteed by Article 40.6.1. This case\n\narose out of an agreement reached between certain trade unions\n\nand the employer to terminate the services of all workers and to\n\nreemploy them on condition that they agree to be members of the\n\nspecified trade unions at all times. One employee whose services\n\nwere terminated was not reemployed, as he refused to accept the\n\nspecial condition. Therefore, he sued the company for damages and\n\nclaimed a declaration that his dismissal was a violation of the\n\nConstitutional rights. Holding that the Constitutional right of\n\ncitizens   to       form   associations    and    unions     necessarily\n\nrecognized      a    correlative   right   to   abstain    from   joining\n\nassociations and unions, the Irish Supreme Court awarded\n\ndamages on the ground that the non­State actors actually violated\n\nthe Constitutional right of the plaintiff. In other words, the\n\nConstitutional rights were considered to have horizontal effect.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">58. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 also\n\nprovides horizontal effect to certain rights. <a href=\"/doc/1662686/\" id=\"a_285\">Section 8</a>.2 of the said\n\nConstitution states: “A provision of the Bill of Rights binds a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                                    76</span>\n\fnatural or a juristic person if, and to the extent that, it is\n\napplicable, taking into account the nature of the right and the nature\n\nof any duty imposed by the right.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">59.

After the Interim Constitution\n\ncame into force, the defendant­newspaper raised a defence that\n\nthey were insulated against the defamation action, under <a href=\"/doc/177373/\" id=\"a_296\">Section\n\n15</a> of the Constitution which protected the freedom of the press.\n\nThe Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court referred two\n\nissues to the Constitutional Court. One of the issues was\n\nwhether Chapter 3 (fundamental rights) of the Constitution\n\nwas applicable to legal relationships between private parties.\n\nThe majority (11:2) of the Court held that Chapter 3 could not be\n\napplied directly to the common law in actions between private\n\nparties. But they left open the question whether there were\n\nparticular provisions of the Chapter that could be so applied.\n\nHowever, the Court held that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/146422906/\" id=\"a_297\">Section 35(3)</a> of the\n\nInterim Constitution, Courts were obliged in the application and\n\ndevelopment of common law, to have due regard to the spirit,\n\npurport and objects of Chapter 3.

Interestingly, the dissenting opinion given by Kriegler, J.\n\nbecame the subject matter of lot of academic debate. To begin with,\n\nKriegler, J. rejected the idea that the debate was one of “verticality\n\nversus horizontality”. He said that Chapter 3 rights do not operate\n\nonly as against the State but also horizontally as between\n\nindividuals   where      Statutes       are    involved.      Calling    “direct\n\nhorizontality” as a bogeyman, Kriegler, J. said as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">          “The Chapter has nothing to do with the ordinary\n          relationships between private persons or associations.\n          What it does govern, however, is all law, including that\n          applicable to private relationships. Unless and until\n          there is a resort to law, private individuals are at liberty\n          to conduct their private affairs exactly as they please as\n          far as the fundamental rights and freedoms are\n          concerned. As far as the Chapter is concerned a\n          landlord is free to refuse to let a flat to someone\n          because of race, gender or whatever; a white bigot\n          may refuse to sell property to a person of colour;\n          a social club may black­ball Jews, Catholics or\n          Afrikaners if it so wishes. An employer is at\n          liberty to discriminate on racial grounds in the\n          engagement of staff; a hotelier may refuse to let a\n          room to a homosexual; a church may close its\n          doors to mourners of a particular colour or class.\n          But none of them can invoke the law to enforce or\n          protect their bigotry. One cannot claim rescission\n          of a contract or specific performance thereof if\n          such claim, albeit well­founded at common law,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                      80</span>\n\f             infringes a Chapter 3 right. One cannot raise a\n             defence to a claim in law if such defence is in conflict\n             with a protected right or freedom. The whole gamut of\n             private relationships is left undisturbed. But the state,\n             as the maker of the laws, the administrator of laws and\n             the interpreter and applier of the law, is bound to stay\n             within the four corners of Chapter 3. Thus, if a man\n             claims to have the right to beat his wife, sell his\n             daughter into bondage or abuse his son, he will\n             not be allowed to raise as a defence to a civil\n             claim or a criminal charge that he is entitled to\n             do so at common law, under customary law or in\n             terms of any statute or contract. That is a far cry\n             from the spectre of the state placing its hand on\n             private relationships. On the contrary, if it were to try\n             to do so by legislation or administrative action, <a href=\"/doc/33535/\" id=\"a_299\">sections\n             4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/757933/\" id=\"a_300\">7(1)</a> and the whole of Chapter 3 would stand as a\n             bastion of personal rights.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">64. After the Final Constitution was adopted and it came into force\n\non February 4, 1997, the first case to come up on this issue was\n\nKhumalo vs. Holomisa60. In this case, Bantu Holomisa, the leader\n\nof the South African opposition political party sued a newspaper for\n\npublishing an article alleging as though he was under a police\n\ninvestigation for his involvement with a gang of bank robbers.\n\nHeavy reliance was placed in this case on the majority decision of\n\nthe Constitutional Court of South Africa in Du Plessis (supra). But\n\nas pointed out earlier, Du Plessis was a case which was decided at\n\na time when South Africa had only an Interim Constitution.\n\n60 (2002) ZACC 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                        81</span>\n\fTherefore, while dealing with Khumalo (supra), the Constitutional\n\nCourt of South Africa applied the Final Constitution, as it had come\n\ninto force by then. What is relevant for our purpose is the opinion of\n\nthe Constitutional Court in paragraph 33 which dealt with the\n\nenforcement of the rights against non­State actors. Paragraph 33\n\nreads thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_184\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">             “[33] In this case, the applicants are members of the\n             media who are expressly identified as bearers of\n             constitutional rights to freedom of expression. There\n             can be no doubt that the law of defamation does affect\n             the right to freedom of expression.

From the discussion\n          in the previous paragraphs of the general nature of the\n          right and the MEC’s obligation in relation to it, the\n          form of the duty that the right to a basic education\n          imposed on the Trustees emerges. It is clear that\n          there is no primary positive obligation on the Trust to\n          provide basic education to the learners. That primary\n          positive obligation rests on the MEC. There was also\n          no obligation on the Trust to make its property\n          available to the MEC for use as a public school. A\n          private landowner may do so, however, in accordance\n          with <a href=\"/doc/126946091/\" id=\"a_308\">section 14(1)</a> of the Act which provides that a\n          public school may be provided on private property only\n          in terms of an agreement between the MEC and the\n          owner of the property.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">          [58] This Court, in Ex Parte Chairperson of the\n          Constitutional Assembly: In re Certification of the\n          Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, made\n          it clear that socio­economic rights (like the right to\n          a basic education) may be negatively protected\n          from improper invasion. Breach of this obligation\n          occurs directly when there is a failure to respect\n          the right, or indirectly, when there is a failure to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                     83</span>\n\f          prevent the direct infringement of the right by\n          another or a failure to respect the existing\n          protection of the right by taking measures that\n          diminish that protection. It needs to be stressed\n          however that the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/999863/\" id=\"a_309\">section 8(2)</a> of the\n          Constitution is not to obstruct private autonomy\n          or to impose on a private party the duties of the\n          state in protecting the Bill of Rights. It is rather\n          to require private parties not to interfere with or\n          diminish the enjoyment of a right. Its application\n          also depends on the intensity of the constitutional\n          right in question, coupled with the potential\n          invasion of that right which could be occasioned by\n          persons other than the State or organs of State. ”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">66.

Therefore, the\n      petitioner pitched his claim under <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 19(1)(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/27622490/\" id=\"a_377\">Article\n      31(1)(which was available at that time).</a> But while making a\n      comparison between <a href=\"/doc/27622490/\" id=\"a_378\">Article 31(1) (as it stood at that time)</a> and\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_379\">Article 21</a>, both of which contained a declaration in the same\n      negative form, this Court observed in P.D.

Anand, J., the law was summarised as follows:­\n\n             “34. The public law proceedings serve a different\n             purpose than the private law proceedings. The relief of\n             monetary compensation, as exemplary damages, in\n             proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_400\">Article 32</a> by this Court or under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_401\">Article 226</a> by the High Courts, for established\n             infringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed\n             under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_402\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is a remedy\n             available in public law and is based on the strict\n             liability for contravention of the guaranteed basic and\n             indefeasible rights of the citizen. The purpose of public\n             law is not only to civilize public power but also to\n             assure the citizen that they live under a legal system\n             which aims to protect their interests and preserve their\n             rights. Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by\n             granting “compensation” in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_403\">Article\n             32</a> or 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or\n             protection of fundamental rights, it does so under the\n             public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and\n             fixing the liability for the public wrong on the State\n             which has failed in its public duty to protect the\n             fundamental rights of the citizen. The payment of\n             compensation in such cases is not to be understood,\n             as it is generally understood in a civil action for\n             damages under the private law but in the broader\n             sense of providing relief by an order of making\n             ‘monetary amends’ under the public law for the wrong\n             done due to breach of public duty, of not protecting\n             the fundamental rights of the citizen. The\n             compensation is in the nature of ‘exemplary damages’\n             awarded against the wrongdoer for the breach of its\n             public law duty and is independent of the rights\n             available to the aggrieved party to claim compensation\n             under the private law in an action based on tort,\n             through a suit instituted in a court of competent\n             jurisdiction or/and prosecute the offender under the\n             penal law.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1375046\" id=\"span_176\">(vii) In <a href=\"/doc/1375046/\" id=\"a_404\">Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K.

All the above decisions show that on a case­to­case basis, this\n\nCourt applied horizontal effect, considering the nature of the right\n\nviolated and the extent of obligation on the part of the violator. But\n\nto enable the courts to have certain basic guidelines in place, for\n\ndealing with such cases, this Court developed a tool in Justice K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy. While affirming the right to privacy as a fundamental\n\nright, this Court laid down the landscape as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">            “397. Once we have arrived at this understanding of\n            the nature of fundamental rights, we can dismantle a\n            core assumption of the Union&#x27;s argument: that a right\n            must either be a common law right or a\n            fundamental right. The only material distinctions\n            between the two classes of right—of which the nature\n            and content may be the same—lie in the incidence of\n            the duty to respect the right and in the forum in which\n            a failure to do so can be redressed. Common law\n            rights are horizontal in their operation when they\n            are violated by one&#x27;s fellow man, he can be named\n            and proceeded against in an ordinary court of\n            law. Constitutional and fundamental rights, on\n            the other hand, provide remedy against the\n            violation of a valued interest by the “State”, as an\n            abstract entity, whether through legislation or\n            otherwise, as well as by identifiable public\n            officials, being individuals clothed with the\n            powers of the State. It is perfectly possible for an\n\n81(2015) 16 SCC 530\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                                     110</span>\n\f             interest to simultaneously be recognised as a\n             common law right and a fundamental right.\n             Where the interference with a recognised interest\n             is by the State or any other like entity recognised\n             by <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_456\">Article 12</a>, a claim for the violation of a\n             fundamental right would lie.

Thus, the answer to Question No. 2 is partly found in the 9­\n\nJudge Bench decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy itself. We have\n\nseen from the line of judicial pronouncements listed above that\n\nafter <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_457\">A.K. Gopalan vs. State of Madras82</a> lost its hold, this Court\n\nhas expanded the width of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_458\">Article 21</a> in several areas such as\n\nhealth, environment, transportation, Education and Prisoner’s life\n\netc.</span> As Vivian Bose, J., put it in a poetic language in S. Krishnan\n\nvs   State     of    Madras83“Brush           aside    for    a   moment   the\n\npettifogging of the law and forget for the nonce all the\n\nlearned disputations about this and that, and &quot;and&quot; or &quot;or &quot;,\n\nor &quot;may&quot; and &quot;must &quot;.

The original thinking of this Court that these rights\n\ncan be enforced only against the State, changed over a period of\n\ntime. The transformation was from “State” to “Authorities” to\n\n“instrumentalities of State” to “agency of the Government” to\n\n“impregnation with Governmental character” to “enjoyment of\n\nmonopoly status conferred by State” to “deep and pervasive\n\ncontrol”84 to the “nature of the duties/functions performed” 85.\n\nTherefore, we would answer Question No. 2 as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">              “A fundamental right under Article 19/21 can\n\n              be enforced even against persons other than\n\n              the State or its instrumentalities”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">Question No. 3</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">79. “Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively protect the\n\nrights of a citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India even\n\nagainst a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or omissions of\n\nanother citizen or private agency?” is the third question referred to\n\nus.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1728255\" id=\"span_208\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1281050\" id=\"span_209\">84 <a href=\"/doc/1281050/\" id=\"a_459\">R.D.

Before we proceed further, it is necessary to make a small\n\ncorrection. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_461\">Article 21</a> right is available not only to citizens but to all\n\npersons. Therefore, the word ‘citizen’ mentioned in Question No.3\n\nhas to be read as ‘person’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">81. As we have pointed out in the Table under paragraph 73\n\nabove, the expression “the State” is not used in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_462\">Article 21.</a>        This\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_463\">Article 21</a> guarantees every person that he shall not be deprived of\n\nhis life and liberty except according to the procedure established by\n\nlaw. Going by the scheme of Part­III which we have outlined both in\n\nthe preceding paragraphs and in the Table in paragraph 73, it is\n\nclear that the State has two obligations, (i) not to deprive a person\n\nof his life and liberty except according to procedure established by\n\nlaw; and (ii) to ensure that the life and liberty of a person is not\n\ndeprived even otherwise. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_464\">Article 21</a> does not say “the State shall\n\nnot deprive a person of his life and liberty”, but says that “no\n\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty”.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_221\">82. When the Constitution was adopted, our understanding of the\n\nwords “life” and “personal liberty” was not as it has evolved over the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">                                  113</span>\n\fpast seven decades. Similarly, it was not imagined or conceived at\n\nthat time that anyone other than the State is capable of depriving\n\nthe life and personal liberty of a person, except by committing a\n\npunishable offence. But with the expanding horizons of our\n\nphilosophical understanding of law, life and liberty and the\n\nadvancement of science and technology, we have come to realize\n\nthat “life is not an empty dream” and “our hearts are not muffled\n\ndrums beating funeral marches to the grave” 86, nor is “life a tale told\n\nby an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing”87.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">83. Over a period of time, this Court has interpreted ‘the right to\n\nlife’ to include, (i) livelihood; (ii) all those aspects of life which go to\n\nmake a man’s life meaningful, complete and worth living; (iii)\n\nsomething more than mere survival or animal existence; (iv) right to\n\nlive (and die) with human dignity; (v) right to food, water, decent\n\nenvironment, medical care and shelter etc.; (vi) all that gives\n\nmeaning to a man’s life, such as his tradition, culture, heritage and\n\nprotection of that heritage in its full measure; and (vii) the right to\n\nPrivacy. There are certain jurisdictions which have taken this right\n86 From H.W. Longfellow in “A Psalm of life”\n87 From Shakespeare in Macbeth\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                               114</span>\n\fto include “the right to be forgotten” or the “right not to be\n\nremembered”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_223\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_224\">84. When the word “life” was understood to mean only physical\n\nexistence, the deprivation of the same was generally conceived to be\n\npossible only by the State, except in cases where someone\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under the Penal Code. But the\n\nmoment the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_465\">Article 21</a> was developed into a\n\nbouquet of rights and science and technology intruded into all\n\nspheres to life, the deprivation of the right by non­State actors also\n\nbecame possible. Another development that has taken place in the\n\npast 3 to 4 decades is that several of the functions of the\n\nGovernment have either been out­sourced to non­State actors or\n\nbeen entrusted to public­private partnerships. This is why, the High\n\nCourts and this Court modulated the tests to be applied for finding\n\nout the maintainability of an action under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_466\">Article 226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_467\">Article 32.</a>\n\nOnce upon a time, the maintainability of a petition under Article\n\n32/226 depended upon “who the respondent was”. Later, the focus\n\nshifted to “the nature of the duties/functions performed” by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                 115</span>\n\frespondent, for finding out his amenability to the jurisdiction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_468\">Article 226.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_226\">85. Life and personal liberty are two different things, even while\n\nbeing an integral part of a whole and they have different\n\nconnotations. Question No. 3 is so worded that the focus is not on\n\n‘deprivation of life’ but on (i) ‘deprivation of personal liberty’ and that\n\ntoo by the acts or omissions of another person or private agency;\n\nand (ii) the duty of the State to affirmatively protect it. Therefore, we\n\nshall, in our discussion, focus more on two aspects, namely,\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1108032\" id=\"span_214\">(i) deprivation of personal liberty by non­State actors; and (ii) the\n\nduty of the State. An elaborate exposition of the expression\n\n“personal liberty” and its origin in Greek civilization may be found\n\nin the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1108032/\" id=\"a_469\">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre\n\nvs. State of Maharashtra88</a>. Suffice it to say for our purpose that\n\nin this judgment, this Court identified in paragraph 53 of the\n\nReport that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_470\">Article 21</a> guarantees two rights, namely, (i) right to life;\n\nand (ii) right to personal liberty. Therefore, because of the manner\n\nin which Question No. 3 is framed, we shall try to confine our\n\n88 (2011) 1 SCC 694\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">                                   116</span>\n\fdiscussion to personal liberty, though at times both may overlap or\n\nget interchanged.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_216\">86. The expression “personal liberty” appearing in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_471\">Article 21</a> was\n\nheld by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_472\">A.K.

But K. Subba Rao, J.\n\nspeaking for himself and J.C. Shah, J. held that the concept of\n\npersonal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_475\">Article 21</a> is comprehensive enough to include\n\nprivacy. The thinking reflected in A.K. Gopalan that physical\n\nrestraint was necessary to constitute infringement of personal\n\nliberty, was completely changed by K. Subba Rao, J. in his minority\n\nopinion in Kharak Singh. Giving a completely new dimension to\n\npersonal liberty, K.

The expression “coercion” in the modern\n          age cannot be construed in a narrow sense. In an\n          uncivilized society where there are no inhibitions,\n          only physical restraints may detract from\n          personal liberty, but as civilization advances the\n          psychological restraints are more effective than\n          physical ones. The scientific methods used to\n          condition a man&#x27;s mind are in a real sense\n          physical restraints, for they engender physical\n          fear     channelling      one&#x27;s   actions    through\n          anticipated and expected grooves. So also\n          creation of conditions which necessarily engender\n          inhibitions and fear complexes can be described\n          as physical restraints. Further, the right to\n          personal liberty takes in not only a right to be\n          free from restrictions placed on his movements,\n          but also free from encroachments on his private\n          life. It is true our Constitution does not expressly\n          declare a right to privacy as a fundamental right, but\n          the said right is an essential ingredient of personal\n          liberty. Every democratic country sanctifies\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                   118</span>\n\f             domestic life; it is expected to give him rest,\n             physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In\n             the last resort, a person&#x27;s house, where he lives with\n             his family, is his “castle”; it is his rampart against\n             encroachment on his personal liberty. The pregnant\n             words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter J., in (1948)\n             338 US 25, pointing out the importance of the security\n             of one&#x27;s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the\n             police, could have no less application to an Indian\n             home as to an American one. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45326369\" id=\"span_221\">If physical restraints on\n             a person&#x27;s movements affect his personal liberty,\n             physical encroachments on his private life would affect\n             it in a larger degree. Indeed, nothing is more\n             deleterious to a man&#x27;s physical happiness and health\n             than a calculated interference with his privacy. We\n             would, therefore, define the right of personal\n             liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_476\">Art. 21</a> as a right of an individual to be\n             free from restrictions or encroachments on his\n             person,      whether      those     restrictions    or\n             encroachments are directly imposed or indirectly\n             brought about by calculated measures. It so\n             understood, all the acts of surveillance under\n             Regulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the\n             petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_477\">Art. 21</a> of the Constitution.”\n\nAs pointed out by Rohinton Nariman, J., in Mohd.

Right of privacy may, apart from contract,\n           also arise out of a particular specific relationship\n           which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even\n           political.

The basis of the said writ petition was a report about a\n\nscooterist who got injured in a road traffic accident, being turned\n\naway by the nearby hospital on the ground that they were not\n\nauthorized to handle medico­legal cases. Before the victim could be\n\ntaken to an authorized hospital located 20 kilometers away, he\n\ndied, which prompted the writ petition. While issuing directions,\n\nthis Court expressed an opinion about the affirmative duty of court\n\nin paragraph 8 as follows:­\n\n\n          “8. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_503\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution casts the\n          obligation on the State to preserve life.

A doctor\n          at the government hospital positioned to meet this\n          State obligation is, therefore, duty bound to extend\n          medical assistance for preserving life.

No\n              law or State action can intervene to avoid/delay the\n              discharge of the paramount obligation cast upon\n              members of the medical profession. The obligation\n              being total, absolute and paramount, laws of\n              procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which\n              would interfere with the discharge of this\n              obligation cannot be sustained and must,\n              therefore, give way.…”\n\n\nThat the State has an obligation to help preserve life, guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_504\">Article 21</a> was spelt out clearly in Pt.

Generally collective responsibility of the\n\nCouncil of Ministers either to the House of the People or to the\n\nAssembly should be understood to correlate to the decisions\n\nand actions of the Council of Ministers and not to every\n\nstatement made by every individual Minister.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">113. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184521\" id=\"span_265\">In <a href=\"/doc/184521/\" id=\"a_553\">State of Karnataka vs. Union of India.108</a>, a Seven\n\nMember Constitution Bench of this Court, while dealing with a\n\nchallenge made by the State of Karnataka in the form of a civil suit\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/786824/\" id=\"a_554\">Article 131</a>, to the appointment by the Central Government, of\n\na commission of enquiry against the Chief Minister of Karnataka,\n\nhad an occasion to consider the exposition of the words “collective\n108 (1977) 4 SCC 608\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_266\">                                    139</span>\n\fresponsibility” appearing in <a href=\"/doc/331399/\" id=\"a_555\">Article 164(2).</a> After indicating that\n\ncollective responsibility is basically political in origin and\n\nmode of operation, Beg, C.J. opined in the said case as follows:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">           “46. The object of collective responsibility is to\n           make the whole body of persons holding\n           Ministerial office collectively, or, if one may so\n           put it, “vicariously” responsible for such acts of\n           the others as are referable to their collective\n           volition so that, even if an individual may not be\n           personally responsible for it, yet, he will be\n           deemed to share the responsibility with those who\n           may have actually committed some wrong. …\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">           47. Each Minister can be and is separately responsible\n           for his own decisions and acts and omissions also.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">           But, inasmuch as the Council of Ministers is able to\n           stay in office only so long as it commands the support\n           and confidence of a majority of members of the\n           Legislature of the State, the whole Council of Ministers\n           must be held to be politically responsible for the\n           decisions and policies of each of the Ministers and of\n           his department which could be presumed to have the\n           support of the whole Ministry. Hence, the whole\n           Ministry will, at least on issues involving matters of\n           policy, have to be treated as one entity so far as its\n           answerability to the Legislative Assembly representing\n           the electors is concerned. This is the meaning of the\n           principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/331399/\" id=\"a_556\">Article 164(2)</a> of the Constitution.\n           The purpose of this provision is not to find out facts or\n           to establish the actual responsibility of a Chief\n           Minister or any other Minister or Ministers for\n           particular decisions or Governmental acts. That can be\n           more suitably done, when wrongful acts or decisions\n           are complained of, by means of inquiries under the\n           Act. As already indicated above, the procedure of\n           Parliamentary Committees to inquire into every legally\n           or ethically wrong act was found to be unsatisfactory\n           and unsound. The principle of individual as well as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">                                     140</span>\n\f           collective ministerial responsibility can work most\n           efficiently only when cases requiring proper sifting and\n           evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions\n           involved have taken place, where this is required, in\n           proceedings before a Commission appointed under\n           <a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 3</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_272\">           48. Text­book writers on Constitutional Law have\n           indicated how collective ministerial responsibility to\n           Parliament, which has essentially a political purpose\n           and    effects,    developed   later    than    individual\n           responsibility of Ministers to Parliament which was\n           also political in origin and operation. It is true that an\n           individual Minister could, in England, where the\n           principle of individual and collective responsibility of\n           Ministers was evolved, be responsible either for\n           wrongful acts done by him without the authority of the\n           whole cabinet or of the monarch to support them, or\n           under orders of the King who could, in the eye of law,\n           do no wrong. But, apart from an impeachment, which\n           has become obsolete, or punishment for contempts of\n           a House, which constitute only a limited kind of\n           offences, the Parliament does not punish the offender.\n           For establishing his legal liability recourse to ordinary\n           courts of law is indispensable.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184521\" id=\"span_268\">114. Quoting from Wade and Phillips on Constitutional Law, this\n\nCourt pointed out in the <a href=\"/doc/184521/\" id=\"a_558\">State of Karnataka</a> (supra) that\n\n“responsibility to Parliament only means that the Minster may\n\nbe compelled by convention to resign.”</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184521\" id=\"span_269\">115. The extent to which the enforcement of collective responsibility\n\ncan be taken was also indicated in <a href=\"/doc/184521/\" id=\"a_559\">the above decision</a> as follows:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">           “50.

By\n            an extension of this logic, applied to individual\n            Ministers at first, emerged the principle of “collective\n            responsibility” which we find enacted in <a href=\"/doc/584478/\" id=\"a_560\">Articles 75(2)</a>\n            and <a href=\"/doc/331399/\" id=\"a_561\">164(2)</a> of our Constitution.

The question as to what happens\n\nwhen an individual Minister is in total disagreement with the\n\ncollective decision of the Cabinet was also spelt out in R.K.

While dealing with the question of\n\nindividual and collective accountability          and    responsibility   of\n\nMinisters, this Court said in paragraph 10 as follows:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">          “10. ...The Governor runs the Executive Government\n          of a State with the aid and advice of the Chief Minister\n          and the Council of Ministers which exercise the\n          powers and performs its duties by the individual\n          Ministers as public officers with the assistance of the\n          bureaucracy working in various departments and\n          corporate sectors etc. Though they are expressed in\n          the name of the Governor, each Minister is personally\n          and collectively responsible for the actions, acts and\n          policies.

The acts\n            done and duties performed are public acts or duties as\n            the holder of public office. Therefore, he owes certain\n            accountability for the acts done or duties performed.\n            In a democratic society governed by rule of law, power\n            is conferred on the holder of the public office or the\n            authority concerned by the Constitution by virtue of\n            appointment.

The decision in Common Cause was little peculiar and\n\nriddled with some problems. The allotment of petroleum outlets by\n\nthe then Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas, under\n\nwhat was claimed to be a discretionary quota, was first set aside by\n\nthis Court by a judgment reported in (1996) 6 SCC 530.\n\nSimultaneously, a show­cause notice was issued to the then\n\nMinister Capt. Satish Sharma as to why a criminal complaint\n\nshould not be lodged against him and why he should not be\n\ndirected to pay damages for his malafide action in wrongfully\n\nallotting the petrol outlets. After the Minister responded to the\n\nshow­cause notice, an order was passed, reported in (1996) 6 SCC\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                   147</span>\n\f593, directing the Minister to pay exemplary damages and also\n\ndirecting the initiation of prosecution. Later, a petition for review\n\nwas filed by the Minister for recalling the order which directed\n\npayment of exemplary damages and also the registration of a case\n\nby the Central Bureau of Investigation. The decision in the petition\n\nfor review, reported in (1999) 6 SCC 667, dealt with the question of\n\ncollective responsibility in the context of the contention raised. It\n\nwas argued by the delinquent Minister in the said case that under\n\nthe business rules of the Cabinet, the act of a Minister is to be\n\ntreated as the act of the President or the Governor as the case may\n\nbe and that therefore the allotment made by him should be treated\n\nto have been made while acting only on behalf of the President. As\n\nan extension of this argument, it was also contended that the\n\nMinister having acted as a part of the Council of Ministers, his act\n\nshould be treated to be the act of the entire Cabinet on the principle\n\nof collective responsibility. While rejecting the said contention, this\n\nCourt held in Common Cause that the immunity available to the\n\nPresident under <a href=\"/doc/1470888/\" id=\"a_572\">Article 361</a> of the Constitution cannot be extended\n\nto the orders passed in the name of the President under <a href=\"/doc/313937/\" id=\"a_573\">Article\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                 148</span>\n\f77(1)</a> or 77(2).

From the above, it will be seen that in spite of the\n              fact that the Council of Ministers is collectively\n              responsible to the House of the People, there may be\n              an occasion where the conduct of a Minister may be\n              censured if he or his subordinates have blundered and\n              have acted contrary to law.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">124.

Shri Kaleeswaram Raj, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nspecial leave petitioner drew our attention to the code of conduct for\n\nMinisters of the Government of Australia, code of conduct for\n\nMinisters of the Government of India and the Ministerial Code of the\n\nUnited Kingdom. However, attractive such prescriptions may be, it\n\nis not possible to enforce such code of conduct in a court of law.\n\nGovernment     servants   stand   on    a   different   footing,   as   any\n\nmisconduct on their part with reference to the Government\n\nServants (Conduct) Rules, may attract disciplinary action under the\n\nCivil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules. Even in the case of\n\nGovernment servants, it may not be possible to justify a\n\ndismissal/removal from service on the basis of a statement uttered\n\nby a Government servant, as it may not pass the proportionality\n\ntest, viz­a­viz the gravity of the misconduct.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_295\">128.    The suggestion made by Shri Kaleeswaram Raj that the\n\nPrime Minister, in the case of a Minister of the Union of India and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                                  151</span>\n\fthe Chief Minister, in the case of a Minister of the State should be\n\nallowed to take appropriate action, against the erring Minister, is\n\njust fanciful. The Prime Minister or the Chief Minister does not have\n\ndisciplinary control over the members of the Council of Ministers. It\n\nis true that in practice, a strong Prime Minister or Chief Minister\n\nwill be able to drop any Minister out of the Cabinet. But in a\n\ncountry like ours where there is a multi­party system and where\n\ncoalition Governments are often formed, it is not possible at all\n\ntimes for a Prime Minister/Chief Minister to take the whip,\n\nwhenever a statement is made by someone in the Council of\n\nMinisters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_297\">129.   Governments which survive on wafer­thin majority (of which\n\nwe have seen quite a bit), sometimes have individual Ministers who\n\nare strong enough to decide the very survival of such Governments.\n\nThis problem is not unique to our country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_298\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_299\">130.     We    have   followed   the    Westminster   Model   but   the\n\nWestminster Model itself became shaky after the United Kingdom\n\nsaw the first coalition Government in 2010, since the Churchill\n\nCaretaker Ministry of 1945. It is interesting to note that in a Report\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                  152</span>\n\fsubmitted by the Constitution Committee (UK) in the year 2014,\n\nunder the title, “Constitutional Implications of Coalition Government”\n\nit was pointed out that “collective ministerial responsibility has\n\nbeen the convention most affected by coalition Government”.\n\nThe Report proceeds to state that the coalition Government formed\n\nin 2010 (in UK) set out five specific issues on which the parties\n\nwould agree to differ. But, in reality the number of areas of\n\ndisagreement has been greater resulting on one occasion, in\n\nMinisters being whipped to vote in opposite lobbies and on another,\n\nin MPs on the Treasury Benches attempting to amend the Address\n\non the Queen’s speech.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_300\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_301\">131. In the “Briefing Paper” (Number 7755, 14 November 2016) on\n\n“Collective responsibility” by Michael Everett available in the House\n\nof Commons Library, (i) the early origins and development of the\n\nconcept     of     collective   responsibility;     (ii)   what    is   collective\n\nresponsibility; (iii) the conventions of collective responsibility; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_302\">(iv) departures from collective responsibility are dealt with. This\n\nPaper     traces    early   beginnings       of   the   doctrine   of   collective\n\nresponsibility to the reign of George III (1760­1820). According to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">                                       153</span>\n\fthe Briefing Paper, the development of today’s concept of collective\n\nresponsibility      arose     during     the    Victorian      golden      age   of\n\nParliamentary Government. In fact, the Briefing Paper quotes some\n\ncommentators who have questioned whether the convention of\n\ncollective responsibility remains appropriate for the Government of\n\ntoday. The Briefing Paper quotes Barry Winetrobe, a Research\n\nFellow at the Constitution Unit who said that the doctrine of\n\ncollective responsibility was developed at a time when a sense\n\nof coherence was required to be maintained among disparate\n\nministerial forces in the face of the Monarch and that it is not\n\nnecessarily appropriate in an age, not just of democracy, but\n\nof greater and more direct participative democracy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_303\">132.   It will be useful to quote a portion of Chapter 2.3 under the\n\nheading “Enforcing collective responsibility” from the Briefing Paper\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">              “…Dr Felicity Matthews, Senior Lecturer in Governance\n              and Public Policy at the University of Sheffield, has also\n              argued that the respect accorded to the doctrine of\n              collective responsibility “has varied”, with its\n              maintenance and disregard “owing as much to politics\n              as to propriety”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                        154</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">\f          An interesting example of this occurred in 2003 during\n          the build­up to the Iraq war. Robin Cook, the Leader of\n          the House of Commons, resigned in protest in March\n          2003 over the then Labour Government’s policy toward\n          Iraq, being unable to maintain the official Government\n          position. His actions were therefore consistent with the\n          doctrine of collective responsibility. However, Clare\n          Short, the Secretary of State for International\n          Development, was allowed to stay in the Cabinet\n          despite her own vocal opposition to military\n          intervention and despite publicly denouncing the then\n          Prime Minister as “deeply reckless” in March 2003.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">          According     to    Felicity    Matthews,  despite     her\n          “extraordinary breach” of collective responsibility, Clare\n          Short was persuaded and allowed to retain her\n          ministerial portfolio. She then remained in the Cabinet\n          for a further two months, until she decided to resign on\n          12 May 2003, following perceived mistakes in the\n          US/UK coalition after the invasion. This example,\n          according to Matthews, “underlines the extent to which\n          Prime Ministers have proven unwilling or unable to\n          enforce    a     strict    interpretation of    collective\n          responsibility, even when their personal credibility has\n          been besmirched”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_304\">133.   Thus, the convention developed in the United Kingdom for\n\nMinisters, itself appears to have gone for a toss and hence, it is not\n\npossible to draw any inspiration from the UK Model.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_305\">134. We are not suggesting for a moment that any public official\n\nincluding a Minister can make a statement which is irresponsible or\n\nin bad taste or bordering on hate speech and get away with it. We\n\nare only on the question of collective responsibility and the\n\nvicarious liability of the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_306\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                    155</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_307\">\f135.     As all the literature on the issue shows, collective\n\nresponsibility is that of the Council of Ministers. Each individual\n\nMinister is responsible for the decisions taken collectively by the\n\nCouncil of Ministers. In other words, the flow of stream in collective\n\nresponsibility is from the Council of Ministers to the individual\n\nMinisters. The flow is not on the reverse, namely, from the\n\nindividual Ministers to the Council of Ministers.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_308\">136. Our attention was also drawn to the decision of this Court in\n\nAmish Devgan. Though <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_577\">the said decision</a> considered extensively\n\nthe impact of the speech of “a person of influence”, we are not, in\n\nthis reference dealing with the same. This is for the reason that <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_578\">the\n\nsaid decision</a> concerned “hate speech”.       None of the questions\n\nreferred to us, including Question No.4 with which we are presently\n\nconcerned, relates to hate speech, and understandably so. The writ\n\npetition as well as the special leave petition out of which this\n\nreference arose, concerned speeches made by the Ministers of the\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh and the State of Kerala. The speech made by\n\nthe Minister of the State of Uttar Pradesh attempted to paint a case\n\nof robbery and gang­rape as a political conspiracy. The speech of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                                 156</span>\n\fthe Minister of the State of Kerala portrayed women in a\n\ndisrespectful way. Since the statements concerned in both the cases\n\nwere attributed to the Ministers, Question No.4 referred to us,\n\nspecifically relates to “statement made by a Minister”. Amish\n\nDevgan did not deal with the statement of a Minister traceable to\n\nany affairs of the State, though a Minister would fall under the\n\ncategory   of   “person   of   influence”.   Moreover,   the   statements\n\nattributed to the Ministers in the cases on hand may not come\n\nunder the category of hate speech. Therefore, we do not wish to\n\nenlarge the scope of this reference by going into the questions\n\nwhich were answered in Amish Devgan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_309\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_310\">137. Therefore, our answer to Question No.4 would be that a\n\nstatement made by a Minister even if traceable to any affairs\n\nof the State or for protecting the Government, cannot be\n\nattributed vicariously to the Government by invoking the\n\nprinciple of collective responsibility.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_311\">\n\n\nQuestion No.5\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">                                    157</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_312\">\f138. Question No.5 referred to us for consideration is “whether a\n\nstatement by a Minister, inconsistent with the rights of a citizen\n\nunder Part­III of the Constitution, constitutes a violation of such\n\nconstitutional rights and is actionable as ‘Constitutional Tort’?”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_313\">139.    To begin with, we have some difficulty with the words\n\n“a   statement   by   a   Minister”,   appearing    in   Question   No.5.\n\nA statement may be made by a Minister either inside or outside the\n\nHouse of People/Legislative Assembly of the State. A statement may\n\nalso be made by a Minister in writing or by words spoken. A\n\nstatement may be made in private or in public. A statement may\n\nalso be made by a Minister either touching upon the affairs of the\n\nMinistry/ department of which he is in control or touching generally\n\nupon the policies of the Government of which he is a part. A\n\nMinister may also make a statement, in the form of an opinion on\n\nmatters about which he or his department is not concerned or over\n\nwhich he has no control. All such statements need not necessarily\n\ngive rise to an action in tort or in constitutional tort.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_314\">140. Take for instance a case where a Minister makes a statement\n\nthat women are unfit to be employed in a particular avocation. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">                                   158</span>\n\fmay reflect his insensitivity to gender equality and also may expose\n\nhis low constitutional morality. The fact that due to his insensitivity\n\nor lack of understanding or low constitutional morality, he speaks a\n\nlanguage that has the potential to demean the constitutional rights\n\nof women, cannot be a ground for action in Constitutional tort.\n\nNeedless to say that no one can either be taxed or penalised for\n\nholding    an      opinion   which   is    not   in   conformity   with   the\n\nconstitutional values. It is only when his opinion gets translated\n\ninto action and such action results in injury or harm or loss that an\n\naction in tort will lie. With this caveat, let us now get into the core\n\nof the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_315\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_316\">141. A tort is a civil wrong, that causes a claimant to suffer loss or\n\nharm resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the\n\ntortious act. Halsbury’s Law of England states: “Those civil rights of\n\naction which are available for the recovery of unliquidated damages\n\nby persons who have sustained injury or loss from acts, statements\n\nor omissions of others in breach of duty or contravention of right\n\nimposed or conferred by law rather than by agreement are rights of\n\naction in tort.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">                                     159</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_317\">\f142. If Crown Proceedings Act, 1947 changed the course of the law\n\nrelating to tort in England, the Federal Tort Claims Act, 1946\n\nchanged in America, the course of law relating to the liability of the\n\nState for the tortious acts of its servants. Nevertheless, the claims\n\nfor damages continued to be resisted for a long time both here and\n\nelsewhere on the principle of sovereign immunity. It is interesting to\n\nnote that on the initiative of the President of India, the Law Ministry\n\ntook up for consideration the question whether legislation on the\n\nlines of the Crown Proceedings Act, 1947 of the United Kingdom is\n\nneeded and if so, to what extent. After the constitution of the Law\n\nCommission,    the   Law    Ministry    referred   the   matter   to   the\n\nCommission for consideration and report. In its First Report\n\nsubmitted on 11.5.1956 on “Liability of the State in Tort”, the Law\n\nCommission took note of (i) the existing law in India; (ii) law in\n\nEngland; (iii) law in America; (iv) law in Australia; (v) law in France;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_318\">(vi) rule of statutory construction; and (vii) conclusions and\n\nproposals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_319\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_320\">143. In Chapter VIII containing the conclusions and proposals, the\n\nFirst Report of the Law Commission suggested: (i) that in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                                  160</span>\n\fcontext of a welfare State, it is necessary to establish a just relation\n\nbetween the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the\n\nState; (ii) that when the Constitution was framed, the question to\n\nwhat extent, if any, the Union and the States should be made liable\n\nfor the tortious acts of their servants or agents was left for future\n\nlegislation; (iii) that the question of demarcating the line up to\n\nwhich the State should be made liable for the tortious acts, involves\n\na nice balancing of considerations, so as not to unduly restrict the\n\nsphere of the activities of the State and at the same time to afford\n\nsufficient protection to the citizen; (iv) that it is necessary that the\n\nlaw should, as far as possible, be made certain and definite, instead\n\nof leaving it to courts to develop the law according to the views of\n\nthe judges; and (v) that the old distinction between sovereign and\n\nthe non­sovereign functions or Governmental and the non­\n\nGovernmental functions should no longer be invoked to determine\n\nthe liability of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_322\">144.    Paragraph 66 of the First Report of the Law Commission\n\ncontained the principles on which appropriate legislation should\n\nproceed.

The judicial journey actually started off on a right note with\n\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/480602/\" id=\"a_586\">The State of Bihar vs. Abdul Majid112</a>, where a\n\nGovernment servant who was dismissed but later reinstated, filed a\n\nsuit for recovery of arrears of salary. Though the State raised a\n\ndefence on the basis of the doctrine of pleasure, this Court rejected\n\nthe same on the ground that said doctrine based on the Latin\n\n112 AIR 1954 SC 245\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_302\">                                  167</span>\n\fphrase “durante bene placito” (during pleasure) has no application\n\nin India.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1765956\" id=\"span_303\">This decision was followed in <a href=\"/doc/1765956/\" id=\"a_587\">State of Rajasthan vs. Mst</a>.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_332\">Vidhyawati113, which involved a claim for compensation by the\n\nwidow of a person who was fatally knocked down by a jeep owned\n\nand maintained by the State. When sovereign immunity was\n\npleaded, this Court observed in Vidhyawati (supra): “when the\n\nrule of immunity in favour of the Crown, based on common\n\nlaw in the United Kingdom has disappeared from the land of\n\nits birth, there is no legal warrant for holding that it has any\n\nvalidity in this country, particularly after the Constitution.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_333\">147. On the question of the liability of the State, for the tortious\n\nacts of its servants, this Court opined in Vidhyawati, as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">            “(10) This case also meets the second branch of the\n            argument that the State cannot be liable for the\n            tortious acts of its servants, when such servants are\n            engaged on an activity connected with the affairs of the\n            State. In this connection it has to be remembered that\n            under the Constitution we have established a welfare\n            state, whose functions are not confined only to\n            maintaining law and order, but extend to engaging in\n            all activities including industry, public transport, state\n            trading, to name only a few of them. …”\n\n\n\n113 AIR 1962 SC 933\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                                       168</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_334\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"480602\" id=\"span_305\">148.    But despite the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/480602/\" id=\"a_588\">Abdul Majid</a> (supra) and\n\nVidhyawati, this Court fell into a slippery slope in Kasturi Lal. It\n\nwas a case where the partner of a firm dealing in bullion and other\n\ngoods was arrested and detained in police custody and the gold and\n\nsilver that he was carrying was seized by the police. When he was\n\nreleased later, the silver was returned but the Head Constable who\n\neffected the arrest misappropriated the gold and fled away to\n\nPakistan in October, 1947. The suit filed by Kasturi Lal for\n\nrecovery of the value of the gold, was resisted on the ground that\n\nthis was not a case of negligence of the servants of the State and\n\nthat even if negligence was held proved against the police officers\n\nthe State could not be held liable. While upholding the contention of\n\nthe State, this Court said “if a tortious act is committed by a public\n\nservant and it gives rise to a claim for damages, the question to ask\n\nis: was the tortious act committed by the public servant in discharge\n\nof statutory functions which are referable to, and ultimately based\n\non, the delegation of the sovereign powers of the State to such public\n\nservant? If the answer is in the affirmative, the action for damages\n\nfor loss caused by such tortious act will not lie. On the other hand, if\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">                                  169</span>\n\fthe tortious act has been committed by a public servant in discharge\n\nof duties assigned to him not by virtue of the delegation of any\n\nsovereign power, an action for damages would lie. The act of the\n\npublic servant committed by him during the course of his employment\n\nis in this category of cases, an act of a servant who might have been\n\nemployed by a private individual for the same purpose.”</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_335\">149.    In fact, it was suggested by this Court in Kasturi Lal that\n\nthe Legislatures in India should seriously         consider   making\n\nlegislative enactments to regulate and control their claim for\n\nimmunity. Before proceeding further with the journey in the\n\nchronological sequence, it must be mentioned that the decision in\n\nKasturi Lal was diluted to some extent after nearly 30 years which\n\nwe shall take note of at the appropriate stage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_336\">150.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80981680\" id=\"span_307\">In <a href=\"/doc/80981680/\" id=\"a_589\">Khatri (II) vs. State of Bihar.114</a>, which came to be\n\npopularly known as Bhagalpur blinding case, this Court was dealing\n\nwith a brutal incident of Police atrocity which resulted in twenty­\n\nfour prisoners being blinded.

This shook the\n\nconscience   of   this   Court.   Therefore,   this    Court   awarded\n\ncompensation in an arbitrary sum of money, even while reserving\n\nthe right of the petitioner to bring a suit for recovery of appropriate\n\ndamages. This Court said that the order of compensation passed by\n\nthis Court was in the nature of palliative. When it is suggested by\n\nthe State that the appropriate remedy would be only to file a suit for\n\ndamages, this Court said that by refusing to order anything\n\n(towards compensation), this Court would be doing mere lip­service\n\nto the fundamental right to liberty and that one of the telling ways\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                                  171</span>\n\fin which the violation of the right by the State can be reasonably\n\nprevented, is to mulct its violators with monetary compensation.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_338\">152.

But as rightly pointed out by the\n\nlearned Attorney General in his note, the matter pre­eminently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">                                     175</span>\n\fdeserves a proper legal framework so that the principles and\n\nprocedure are coherently set out without leaving the matter open\n\nended or vague. In fact, the First Report of the Law Commission\n\nsubmitted a draft bill way back in 1956. This Court recommended a\n\nlegislative measure in Kasturi Lal in 1965 and a bill called\n\nGovernment (Liability in Torts) Bill was introduced in 1967. But\n\nnothing happened in the past 55 years. In such circumstances,\n\ncourts cannot turn a blind eye but may have to imaginatively\n\nfashion the remedy to be provided to persons who suffer injury or\n\nloss, without turning them away on the ground that there is no\n\nproper legal frame work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_372\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_373\">154. Therefore, our answer to Question No. 5 is as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">“A mere statement made by a Minister, inconsistent with the\n\nrights of a citizen under Part­III of the Constitution, may not\n\nconstitute a violation of the constitutional rights and become\n\nactionable as Constitutional tort. But if as a consequence of\n\nsuch a statement, any act of omission or commission is done\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">                                176</span>\n\fby the officers resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen,\n\nthen the same may be actionable as a constitutional tort”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">SUMMING UP\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_374\">155.

The submissions of learned Senior Counsel, Sri Kaleeswaram Raj,\n\nappearing on behalf of the Petitioners may be epitomized as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">8.1.   That while upholding the constitutional right to freedom of\n\n       speech and expression of Ministers, efforts should be made to\n\n       frame a voluntary code of conduct for Ministers and public\n\n       officials,   which   would   ensure       better   accountability   and\n\n       transparency in their political activities and also place a check on\n\n       the misuse of freedom of speech and expression exercised by\n\n       public functionaries using the apparatus of the State.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">8.2.   That while the state’s duty to protect life and liberty broadly falls\n\n       within the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_642\">Article 21</a>, it is difficult to chain the State\n\n       with responsibility in every instance where speech by a public\n\n       functionary strikes at the dignity of another person. That in the\n\n       absence of such a provision to vicariously attribute responsibility\n\n       to the State, every instance of such speech cannot be actionable\n\n       and    remediable    through        the   judiciary.   That   no    duty\n\n       corresponding to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_643\">Article 21</a> is imposed on individual Ministers\n\n       nor such duty is imposed on any government machinery to\n\n       regulate the conduct of individual Ministers warranting judicial\n\n       intervention. Therefore, even though no actionable breach of\n\n       public duty can be said to have taken place when statements are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">\f                                   12</span>\n\n       made by people in power, this in turn, postulates the desirability\n\n       to have a voluntary code of conduct in the better interest of the\n\n       government as well as the governed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">8.3.   Reliance was placed on <a href=\"/doc/1336375/\" id=\"a_644\">Article 75 (3)</a> of the Constitution to\n\n       contend that Ministers have a collective responsibility towards\n\n       the legislature and thus, a code of conduct to self-regulate the\n\n       speech and actions of Ministers is constitutionally justifiable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_421\">       That a Minister is not supposed to breach her/his collective\n\n       responsibility towards the Cabinet and the Legislature, hence, it\n\n       is advisable to have a cogent code of conduct as available in\n\n       advanced democracies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_422\">\n8.4.   Learned Senior Counsel lastly submitted that the instant cases\n\n       do not involve a question as to conflict of any other right with\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_645\">Article 19.</a> That the question herein, in sum and substance, is,\n\n       whether, any restraint justifiable under the Constitution, can be\n\n       placed on Ministers and public functionaries, to regulate their\n\n       speech.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_423\">\nArguments on behalf of the Respondent-Union of India:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_424\">9.     Submissions of Learned Attorney General for India, Sri R.\n\nVenkataramani and Learned Solicitor General of India, Sri Tushar\n\nMehta, appearing on behalf of the Respondent-Union of India, may be\n\nsummarized as under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">\f                                     13</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_425\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">9.1.   At the outset, Sri R. Venkataramani, Learned Attorney General\n\n       fairly submitted that restrictions on the freedom of speech\n\n       enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_646\">Article 19 (2)</a> have to be taken to be exhaustive\n\n       and thus, the court cannot invoke any other fundamental right,\n\n       namely, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_647\">Article 21</a> to impose restrictions on grounds which are\n\n       not enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_648\">Article 19(2).</a> Further, that as a matter of\n\n       constitutional principle, any addition, alteration or change in the\n\n       norms or criteria for imposition of restrictions, on any\n\n       fundamental right has to come through a legislative process. That\n\n       the balancing of fundamental rights, either to avoid overlapping\n\n       or to ensure mutual enjoyment, is different from treating one\n\n       right as a restriction on another right.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">9.2.   It was next submitted that the Constitution of India sets out the\n\n       scheme of claims of fundamental rights against the State or its\n\n       instrumentalities and such scheme also addresses breaches or\n\n       violations of fundamental rights by persons other than the State\n\n       or its instrumentalities. Thus, any proposition to add or insert\n\n       subjects or matters in respect of which claims can be made\n\n       against persons other than the State, would amount to a\n\n       constitutional   change.     That    any     enlargement   of   such\n\n       constitutional principles would have the consequence of opening\n\n       a flood gate of constitutional litigation.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">\f                                     14</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">9.3.   It was further contended that there are sufficient constitutional\n\n       and legal remedies available to a citizen whose liberty is\n\n       threatened by any person and beyond the constitutional and legal\n\n       remedies, there may not be any other additional duty to\n\n       affirmatively protect the right of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_649\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">9.4.   Learned Attorney General urged that Ministerial misdemeanors,\n\n       which have nothing to do with the discharge of public duty and\n\n       are not traceable to the affairs of the State will have to be treated\n\n       as acts of individual violation and individual wrongs. Thus, the\n\n       state cannot be vicariously liable for the same. That the conduct\n\n       of a public servant like a Minister in the government, if was\n\n       traceable to the discharge of a public duty or duties of the office,\n\n       was subject to the scrutiny of law. However, such misconduct\n\n       including statements that may be made by a Minister, cannot be\n\n       linked to the principles of collective responsibility.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_426\">Submissions of learned amicus curiae, Ms. Aparajita Singh, Senior\nAdvocate:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_427\">10.    The submissions of learned amicus curiae, Ms. Aparajita Singh,\n\nmay be summarized as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_428\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">10.1. At the outset she submitted that the right to freedom of speech\n\n       and expression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_650\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is subject to clearly defined\n\n       restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_651\">Article 19(2).</a> Therefore, any law seeking to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_341\">\f                                   15</span>\n\n      limit the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_652\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> has to fall within the\n\n      limitation provided under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_653\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">10.2. That the right to freedom of speech and expression of a public\n\n      functionary who represents the state has to be balanced with a\n\n      citizen’s right to fair investigation under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_654\">Article 21</a> and if the\n\n      exercise of a Minister’s right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_655\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> violates a\n\n      citizen’s right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_656\">Article 21</a> then the same would have to be\n\n      read down to protect the right of the citizen. Thus, a Minister\n\n      cannot claim the protection of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_657\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> to violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_658\">Article 21</a>\n\n      rights of citizens.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">10.3. Ms. Aparajita Singh next contended that a Minister, being a\n\n      functionary of the State represents the State when acting in his\n\n      official capacity. Therefore, any violation of the fundamental\n\n      rights of citizens by the Minister in his official capacity, would be\n\n      attributable to the State. Thus, it would be preposterous to\n\n      suggest that while the State is under an obligation to restrict a\n\n      private citizen from violating the fundamental rights of other\n\n      citizens, its own Minister can do so with impunity. However,\n\n      learned amicus curiae qualified such submission by stating that\n\n      the factum of violation would need to be established on the facts\n\n      of a given case and hence the law has to evolve from case to case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_429\">      It would involve a detailed inquiry into questions such as i)\n\n      whether the statement by the Minister was made in his personal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">\f                                      16</span>\n\n      or official capacity; ii) whether the statement was made on a\n\n      public or private issue; iii) whether the statement was made on a\n\n      public or private platform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_430\">\n10.4. It was submitted that a Minister is personally bound by the oath\n\n      of office to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of\n\n      India under <a href=\"/doc/1752614/\" id=\"a_659\">Articles 75(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1309548/\" id=\"a_660\">164(3)</a> of the Constitution. That\n\n      the code of conduct for Ministers (both for Union and States)\n\n      specifically lays down that the Code is in addition to the\n\n      “…observance     of    the    provisions     of   the   <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_661\">Constitution,    the\n\n      Representation    of    the    People      Act,   1951</a>”.    Therefore,    a\n\n      constitutional functionary is duty bound to act in a manner\n\n      which is in consonance with the constitutional obligations.\n\n\n10.5. It was lastly submitted that the State acts through its\n\n      functionaries. Therefore, an official act of a Minister which\n\n      violates the fundamental rights of the citizens, would make the\n\n      State liable by treating the said act of the Minister as a\n\n      constitutional tort. However, the principle of sovereign immunity\n\n      of the state for the tortious acts of its servants, has been held to\n\n      be inapplicable in the case of violation of fundamental rights.\n\n\n    Question No. 1 referred to this Constitution Bench reads as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">“Are the grounds specified in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_662\">Article 19(2)</a> in relation to which\nreasonable restrictions on the right to free speech can be imposed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">\f                                     17</span>\n\nby law, exhaustive, or can restrictions on the right to free speech\nbe imposed on grounds not found in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_663\">Article 19(2)</a> by invoking\nfundamental rights?”\n\nPreface:\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_431\">11.    In my view, these cases call for an analysis of the content of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_664\">Article\n\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India which grants to all citizens of India\n\nthe right to freedom of speech and expression. Before proceeding to\n\nanalyse the relevant constitutional provisions, it may be appropriate to\n\npreface the discussion with the thought that freedom of speech is not\n\ncontingent only upon the laws of a nation. The compulsion of social\n\nrelations and the informal pressures of conformity, exerted in a\n\npervasive manner, determine to a great extent, the content and limits of\n\npermissible speech in society. It is the laws, however, through their own\n\nunique methods, which reinforce social sanctions. Therefore, the\n\nConstitution, which is the fundamental law of the land, as well as the\n\nother laws which are measured on the touchstone of the Constitution,\n\nare to be interpreted, having regard, inter-alia, to the content and\n\npermissible limits of free speech in a peaceful society.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_432\">      It is necessary to observe that freedom of speech and expression\n\nhas always been closely linked with certain socio-political ideals that\n\nconstitute the foundation of democracy: respect for individual dignity\n\nand equality; fraternity; ideals of tolerance; cultural and religious\n\nsensitivity. Many of these ideals are written into the text of our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">\f                                   18</span>\n\nConstitution and permeate its structure through the very Preamble to\n\nthe Constitution. These ideals form the philosophical foundations of the\n\ndiscourse on free speech and therefore, any analysis of the same should\n\nbe compatible with these ideals. It is in that background that one must\n\nset out to examine whether additional accountability and thus, a legal\n\nobligation can be cast upon public functionaries with respect to the\n\npermissible extent of free speech. Further, it is also necessary to\n\nexamine the difference between restraints on the exercise of freedom of\n\nspeech and expression, vis-à-vis restrictions thereon, and in that\n\nbackground examine the degree of self-restraint that needs to be\n\nexercised by every citizen, whether a public functionary or not, in\n\nexercising his/her right to freedom of speech and expression in a\n\nCountry like ours which is so unique because of its diversity and\n\npluralism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_433\">\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_665\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_666\">Article 19(2):</a> An overview\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_434\">12.   At this stage, it would be useful to dilate on <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_667\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_668\">Article 19(2)</a> as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">12.1. <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_669\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> to (f) of the Constitution guarantees certain\n\n       fundamental rights to the citizens of India. These fundamental\n\n       rights are however, subject to reasonable restrictions as\n\n       enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_670\">Articles 19(2)</a> to (6) thereof which could be\n\n       imposed by the State. These fundamental rights are in the nature\n\n       of inalienable rights of man or basic human rights which inhere\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_345\">\f                                   19</span>\n\n      in all citizens of a free country. Yet, these rights are not\n\n      unrestricted or absolute, and are regulated by restrictions, which\n\n      may be imposed by the State, which have to be reasonable. The\n\n      object of prescribing restraints or reasonable restrictions on the\n\n      fundamental freedoms is to avoid anarchy or disorder in society.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_435\">      Hence,   the   founding   fathers   of   our   Constitution   while\n\n      enumerating the fundamental rights, have alongside prescribed\n\n      reasonable restrictions in clauses (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_671\">Article 19</a> and the\n\n      laws enacted within the strict limits of such restrictions are\n\n      constitutionally permissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_436\">12.2. Since, these cases involve the freedom of speech and expression,\n\n      it is unnecessary to analyse the nature of the other fundamental\n\n      rights in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_672\">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_673\">Articles 19(1) (a)</a> and\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_674\">19(2)</a> of the Constitution read as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">             “19.

The freedom of speech and expression as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_675\">Article\n\n      19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution means the right to free speech and to\n\n      express opinions through various media such as by word of\n\n      mouth,    through   the      print    or   electronic     media,   through\n\n      pictographs, writings, graphics or any other manner that can be\n\n      discerned by the mind. The right includes the freedom of press.\n\n      The content of this right also includes propagation of ideas\n\n      through   publication     and        circulation,   the    right   to   seek\n\n      information and to acquire or impart ideas. In short, the right to\n\n      free speech would include every nature of right that would come\n\n      within the scope and ambit of free speech. Hence, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_676\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n\n      in very broad and in wide terms states that all citizens shall have\n\n      the right to freedom of speech and expression. The said right can\n\n      be   curtailed   only   by    reasonable       restrictions    which     are\n\n      enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_677\">Article 19(2)</a> thereof which can be imposed by the\n\n      State under the authority of law but not by exercise of executive\n\n      power in the absence of any law. Further, the nature of\n\n      restrictions on right to free speech must be reasonable, and in\n\n      the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of\n\n      the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order,\n\n      decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court,\n\n      defamation or incitement to an offence. (<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_678\">Article 19(2)</a>).\n\n12.4. For a country like ours which is a Parliamentary Democracy,\n\n      freedom of speech and expression is a necessary right as well as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_347\">\f                                   21</span>\n\n      a concomitant for the purpose of not only ensuring a healthy\n\n      democracy but also to ensure that the citizens could be well\n\n      informed and educated on governance. The dissemination of\n\n      information    through   various   media,   including   print    and\n\n      electronic media or audio visual form, is to ensure that the\n\n      citizens are enlightened about their rights and duties, the\n\n      manner in which they should conduct themselves in a democracy\n\n      and for enabling a debate on the policies and actions of the\n\n      Governments and ultimately for the development of the Indian\n\n      society in an egalitarian way.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_438\">12.5. The right to freedom of speech and expression in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_679\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n\n      of the Constitution has its genesis in the Preamble of the\n\n      Constitution which, inter alia, speaks of liberty of thought,\n\n      expression, belief. Since, India is a sovereign democratic republic\n\n      and we follow a parliamentary system of democracy, liberty of\n\n      thought and expression is a significant freedom and right under\n\n      our constitutional setup.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_439\">12.6.

Second, whereas\n          the US First Amendment speaks of freedom of\n          speech and of the press, without any reference to\n          “expression”, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_688\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> speaks of freedom of\n          speech and expression without any reference to “the\n          press”. Third, under the US Constitution, speech\n          may be abridged, whereas under our Constitution,\n          reasonable restrictions may be imposed. Fourth,\n          under our Constitution such restrictions have to be\n          in the interest of eight designated subject-matters—\n          that is, any law seeking to impose a restriction on\n          the freedom of speech can only pass muster if it is\n          proximately related to any of the eight subject-\n          matters set out in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_689\">Article 19(2)</a>.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_352\">\f                             23</span>\n\n\n        It was further observed that insofar as the first apparent\n\n    difference is concerned, the United States Supreme Court\n\n    has never given effect to the declaration that Congress shall,\n\n    under some circumstances, make any law abridging the\n\n    freedom of speech.

So far as the second apparent difference is\n             concerned, the American Supreme Court has\n             included “expression” as part of freedom of\n             speech and this Court has included “the press”\n             as being covered under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_690\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, so that,\n             as a matter of judicial interpretation, both the\n             US and India protect the freedom of speech and\n             expression as well as press freedom. Insofar as\n             abridgement and reasonable restrictions are\n             concerned, both the US Supreme Court and this\n             Court have held that a restriction in order to be\n             reasonable must be narrowly tailored or\n             narrowly interpreted so as to abridge or restrict\n             only what is absolutely necessary. It is only\n             when it comes to the eight subject-matters that\n             there is a vast difference. In the US, if there is a\n             compelling necessity to achieve an important\n             governmental or societal goal, a law abridging\n             freedom of speech may pass muster. But in\n             India, such law cannot pass muster if it is in the\n             interest of the general public. Such law has to\n             be covered by one of the eight subject-matters\n             set out under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_691\">Article 19(2).</a> If it does not, and is\n             outside the pale of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_692\">Article 19(2)</a>, Indian courts\n             will strike down such law.”\n\n    In Shreya Singhal, there was a challenge to <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_693\">Section 66-A</a>\n\nof the Information Technology Act, 2000, which was struck down\n\nas being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_694\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and was not saved under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">\f                                  24</span>\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_695\">Article 19(2)</a> on the ground of vagueness and not providing\n\n     manageable     standards    and   clear   guidance    for   citizens,\n\n     authorities and courts for drawing a precise line between\n\n     allowable and forbidden speech, expression or information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">     When a law uses vague expressions capable of misuse or abuse\n\n     without providing notice to persons of common intelligence to\n\n     guess their meaning, it leaves them in a boundless sea of\n\n     uncertainty, conferring wide, unfettered powers on authorities to\n\n     curtail freedom of speech and expression arbitrarily.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">12.7.

These cases\n\n     are not with regard to reasonable restrictions that could be\n\n     imposed by the State on the freedom of speech and expression,\n\n     rather, what would be the content of free speech that should not\n\n     be exercised as a right by an individual citizen which would not\n\n     in any way give rise to a cause of action to another citizen to seek\n\n     a remedy.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_354\">\f                                     25</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">13.   The content of a free speech right, as described hereinabove, is\n\nto be understood in terms of the structural elements or components\n\nof a free speech right. Only when a free speech right is understood as\n\nsuch, deductions can be made as to the precise boundaries thereof\n\nand the basis on which such right can be limited or restrained.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_443\">Stephen Gradbaum, in his essay titled “The Structure of a Free Speech\n\nRight,” in the Oxford Handbook of Freedom of Speech has discussed\n\nsix components of a free speech right, in the following words:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">         “The first is the &#x27;force&#x27; of a free speech right. This\n         includes what type of legal right to free speech is\n         formally recognized or at issue: for example, common\n         law, statutory, or constitutional. This in turn helps to\n         determine whether and how easily a free speech right\n         can be legally superseded. Another aspect of force is\n         whether and how the right is judicially enforceable. The\n         second component is the &#x27;subject&#x27; of free speech rights,\n         or who are the rights-holders: for example, all persons\n         within a jurisdiction or only citizens; legal persons\n         including corporations or only natural persons? The\n         third is the ‘scope’ of a free speech right: a right to say\n         or do what exactly? Does it include falsehoods, hate\n         speech, or baking a cake? The fourth, as a distinct\n         structural element concerning content, addresses\n         whether the right includes not only negative\n         prohibitions on relevant others but also positive\n         obligations, such as a duty to affirmatively protect the\n         free speech of rights-holders from third-party threats?\n         The fifth component is the &#x27;object&#x27; of a free speech right:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">         who are these &#x27;relevant others&#x27; that are bound by the\n         holder&#x27;s rights? Against whom can the right be validly\n         asserted? Finally, there is the &#x27;limitation’ of a free\n         speech right. If the prior questions have all been\n         answered to the effect that a free speech right is\n         implicated and infringed in a particular situation, when,\n         if ever, might there be a legally justified limitation of that\n         right? Is the right an absolute bar or ‘trump’ against\n         inconsistent action and, if not, what presumptive weight\n         attaches to it? How, when, and why can the presumption\n         be rebutted? Collectively, by constituting and expressing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_355\">\f                                     26</span>\n\n           the underlying structure of the right to free speech, the\n           answers to these six questions help to define the nature\n           and extent of any particular such right in a given legal\n           system.”\n                                                 (Emphasis by me)\n\n        Referring to the aspect of limitation of a free speech right, the\n\nlearned author has observed that the teleology of a Constitutional order,\n\ncan also play a role in fashioning the contours of free speech\n\nprotections. That is to say, a free speech right may be fashioned to serve\n\nConstitutional commitments.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">14.     According to Wesley Hohfeld’s analysis of the form of rights, every\n\nright has a complex internal structure, and such structure determines\n\nwhat the rights mean for those who hold them. Such rights are ordered\n\narrangements of basic components. One of the components of a right,\n\nis a correlative duty. That is to say, if X has a right, he is legally\n\nprotected from interference in respect of such right and such right\n\ncarries with it the duty of the State, not to interfere with such right. If\n\nthe State (or any other person) is under no corelative duty to abstain\n\nfrom interfering with the exercise of a right, then such a right is not a\n\n‘right’ in the strict Hohfeldian sense. The boundaries of the protective\n\nperimeter within which a person can exercise their rights, depend on\n\nthe degree to which the State is duty bound to protect the right.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">14.1.    What emerges from the Hohfeldian conception of rights and\n\n         corelative duties, qua the right to freedom of speech and\n\n         expression may be summed up as follows:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_356\">\f                             27</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">a)   The Constitution of India confers under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_697\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, the\n\n     right to freedom of speech and expression to all its citizens.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_444\">     The State has a corelative duty to abstain from interference\n\n     with such right except as provided in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_698\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n\n     Consitution which are reasonable restrictions on the right\n\n     conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_699\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> The extent of such duty\n\n     depends upon the content of speech. For instance, in respect\n\n     of speech that is likely to be adverse to the interests of\n\n     sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State,\n\n     friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency\n\n     or morality; or speech that constitutes contempt of court,\n\n     defamation or is of such nature as would be likely to incite\n\n     the commission of an offence, the duty of the State to abstain\n\n     from interference, is nil. This principle is Constitutionally\n\n     reflected under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_700\">Article 19(2)</a> which enables the State to enact\n\n     law which would impose reasonable restrictions on such\n\n     speech as described under the eight grounds listed\n\n     hereinabove which are the basis for reasonable restrictions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_445\">b)   Per contra, in respect of speech and expression which\n\n     constitutes an exchange of ideas, including dissent or\n\n     disagreement, and such ideas are expressed in a manner\n\n     compatible with the ethos cultivated in a civilised society,\n\n     the duty of the State to abstain from interference, is high.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">\f                             28</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_446\">c)   Similarly, in respect of commercial speech, the State is\n\n     completely free to recall or curb commercial speech which is\n\n     false, misleading, unfair or deceptive. Therefore, the\n\n     threshold of tolerance towards commercial speech or\n\n     advertisements depends on the content of such speech and\n\n     the    object    of    the    material     sought     to    be\n\n     propagated/circulated. The duty of the State to abstain from\n\n     interference would also depend upon the nature and effect\n\n     of the commercial speech.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_447\">d)   As is evident from the above illustrations, the extent of\n\n     protection of speech would depend on whether, such speech\n\n     would constitute a ‘propagation of ideas’ or would have any\n\n     social value. If the answer to the said question is in the\n\n     affirmative, such speech would be protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_701\">Article\n\n     19(1)(a);</a> if the answer is in the negative, such speech would\n\n     not be protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_702\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In respect of speech\n\n     that does not form the content of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_703\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, the State\n\n     has no duty to abstain from interference having regard to\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_704\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution and only the grounds\n\n     mentioned therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_448\">e)   Having noted that the protective perimeter within which a\n\n     person can exercise his/her rights depends on the degree to\n\n     which the State is duty bound to protect the right, it may\n\n     also be said as a corollary that in respect of speech that does\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">\f                        29</span>\n\nnot form the content of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_705\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, the State has no duty\n\nto abstain from interference and therefore, speech such as\n\nhate speech, defamatory speech, etc. would lie outside the\n\nprotective perimeter within which a person can exercise his\n\nright to freedom of speech. Such speech can be subjected to\n\nrestrictions or restraints. While restrictions on the right to\n\nfreedom of speech and expression are required to be made\n\nonly under the grounds listed under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_706\">Article 19(2)</a>, by the\n\nState, restraints on the said right, do not gather their\n\nstrength from <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_707\">Article 19(2).</a> Restraints on the right to\n\nfreedom of speech and expression are governed by the\n\ncontent of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_708\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> itself; i.e., any kind of speech,\n\nwhich does not conform to the content of the right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_709\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, may be restrained. Questions pertaining to\n\nthe voluntary or binding nature of such restraint, the force\n\nbehind the same, the persons on whom such restraints are\n\nto be imposed, the manner in which compliance thereof\n\ncould be achieved, etc., are aspects left to be deliberated\n\nupon and answered by the Parliament. However, the finding\n\nmade hereinabove is only to the extent of clarifying that any\n\nkind of speech, which does not form the content of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_710\">Article\n\n19(1)(a)</a>, may be restrained as such speech does not\n\nconstitute an exchange of ideas, in a manner compatible\n\nwith the ethos cultivated in a civilised society.

It includes the freedom of communication and the right\n\nto propagate or publish one&#x27;s views and opinions. The communication\n\nof ideas may be through any medium such as a book, newspaper,\n\nmagazine or movie, including electronic and audio-visual media.\n\n\n15.1. Right to Circulate:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">           Freedom of the press takes within its fold a number of rights\n\n       and one such right is the freedom of publication. Publication also\n\n       means    dissemination    and    circulation;   indeed,   without\n\n       circulation, publication would be of little value, vide Romesh\n\n       Thappar; Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. vs. Union of India, A.I.R.\n\n       1962 SC 305 (“Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.”).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_360\">\f                              31</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"304068\" id=\"span_361\">In <a href=\"/doc/304068/\" id=\"a_715\">Life Insurance Corporation vs. Prof. Manubhai D.\n\nShah</a>, (1992) 3 SCC 637 (“Prof. Manubhai D.

That such circulation could be\n\nby word of mouth, in writing or through audio-visual media. The\n\nfreedom to ‘air one’s view’ was declared as a “lifeline of any\n\ndemocratic institution” and the Court expressed strong criticism\n\nat any attempt aimed at stifling or suffocating the right to\n\ncirculation. In the said case, the appeals concerned separate\n\ninstances of state-controlled entities (LIC and Doordarshan)\n\nrefusing to publish or broadcast work that criticized the\n\ngovernment. The Court reasoned that government-controlled\n\nmeans of publication have a greater burden to recognize an\n\nindividual’s right to defend themselves and if a state censors\n\ncontent, then it is obligated to provide reasons valid in law. That\n\nwhen a state-controlled entity refuses to circulate through its\n\nmagazine or other platform, one’s views, including one’s defence,\n\nthe right to circulate is violated.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">    This Court has therefore, on several occasions recognised\n\nthe right to circulation, as a facet of the right to freedom of\n\nspeech.   The   right   to   circulation   includes,   the   right   to\n\noptimise/maximise the volume of such circulation and also\n\ndetermine the content and reach thereof.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">\f                                   32</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">15.2.

The right to dissent, disagree and adopt\n\n      varying and individualistic points of view inheres in every\n\n      citizen of this Country. In fact, the right to dissent is the\n\n      essence of a vibrant democracy, for it is only when there is\n\n      dissent that different ideas would emerge which may be of help\n\n      or assist the Government to improve or innovate upon its\n\n      policies so that its governance would have a positive effect on\n\n      the people of the country which would ultimately lead to\n\n      stability, peace and development which are concomitants of\n\n      good governance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">15.3.

This declaration by this Court cemented the\n\n            idea that the freedom of speech and expression covers the\n\n            right to dissent or criticise, even when such right is\n\n            employed with respect to criticism of governmental policy\n\n            or action or inaction.

The definition of ‘hate speech’ as\n\n      propounded by this Court in the aforesaid case, is extracted\n\n      hereinunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_261\">        “Hate speech is an effort to marginalise individuals\n        based on their membership in a group. Using\n        expression that exposes the group to hatred, hate\n        speech seeks to delegitimise group members in the\n        eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing\n        and acceptance within society. Hate speech,\n        therefore rises beyond causing distress to individual\n        group members. It can have a societal impact. Hate\n        speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on\n        [the] vulnerable that can range from discrimination, to\n        ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in\n        the most extreme cases, to genocide. Hate speech also\n        impacts a protected group’s ability to respond to the\n        substantive ideas under debate, thereby placing a\n        serious barrier to their full participation in our\n        democracy.”\n                                            (Emphasis by me)\n\n\n          This Court referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court of\n\n      Canada in Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission vs.\n\n      William Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11 (“Saskatchewan”) (Canada)\n\n      wherein it was held that human rights obligations form the basis\n\n      for the control of publication of &quot;hate speeches.&quot; The Canadian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_383\">\f                                  42</span>\n\n      Supreme Court further declared that the repugnancy of the ideas\n\n      being expressed is not sufficient to justify restricting the\n\n      expression, and whether or not the author of the expression\n\n      intended to incite hatred or discriminatory treatment, is\n\n      irrelevant. That the key is to determine the likely effect of the\n\n      expression on its audience, keeping in mind the legislative\n\n      objectives to reduce or eliminate discrimination. Placing reliance\n\n      on the observations of the Canadian Supreme Court, this Court\n\n      in Pravasi Bhalai Sangathan observed that the offence of hate\n\n      speech is not limited to causing individual distress but would\n\n      target persons who are members of certain groups or sections of\n\n      society which breeds discrimination and consequently, hostility.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_262\">16.3. In India, human dignity is not only a value but a right that is\n\n      enforceable. In a human-dignity-based democracy, freedom of\n\n      speech and expression must be exercised in a manner that would\n\n      protect and promote the rights of fellow-citizens. But hate\n\n      speech, whatever its content may be, denies human beings the\n\n      right to dignity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179868451\" id=\"span_384\">In this regard, it may be apposite to refer to a\n\n      recent decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/179868451/\" id=\"a_753\">Amish Devgan vs. Union of\n\n      India</a>, (2021) 1 SCC 1 (“Amish Devgan”) wherein this Court\n\n      speaking through Sanjeev Khanna, J. undertook an analysis of\n\n      ‘hate speech’ as being antithetical to, and incompatible with the\n\n      foundations of human dignity. Protection of ‘Dignity’ as a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_385\">\f                             43</span>\n\njustification for criminalization of ‘hate speech’ was discussed as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_263\">  “46. […] Dignity, in the context of criminalisation of\n  speech with which we are concerned, refers to a person&#x27;s\n  basic entitlement as a member of a society in good\n  standing, his status as a social equal and as bearer of\n  human rights and constitutional entitlements. It gives\n  assurance of participatory equality in inter-personal\n  relationships between the citizens, and between the\n  State and the citizens, and thereby fosters self-worth.\n  Dignity in this sense does not refer to any particular level\n  of honour or esteem as an individual, as in the case of\n  defamation which is individualistic.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_264\">  47. Preamble to the Constitution consciously puts\n  together fraternity assuring dignity of the individual and\n  the unity and integrity of the nation. Dignity of\n  individual and unity and integrity of the nation are\n  linked, one in the form of rights of individuals and other\n  in the form of individual&#x27;s obligation to others to ensure\n  unity and integrity of the nation. The unity and integrity\n  of the nation cannot be overlooked and slighted, as the\n  acts that &#x27;promote&#x27; or are &#x27;likely&#x27; to &#x27;promote&#x27;\n  divisiveness, alienation and schematism do directly and\n  indirectly impinge on the diversity and pluralism, and\n  when they are with the objective and intent to cause\n  public disorder or to demean dignity of the targeted\n  groups, they have to be dealt with as per law. The\n  purpose is not to curtail right to expression and speech,\n  albeit not gloss over specific egregious threats to public\n  disorder and in particular the unity and integrity of the\n  nation. Such threats not only insidiously weaken virtue\n  and superiority of diversity, but cut-back and lead to\n  demands depending on the context and occasion, for\n  suppression of freedom to express and speak on the\n  ground of reasonableness. Freedom and rights cannot\n  extend to create public disorder or armour those who\n  challenge integrity and unity of the country or\n  promote and incite violence. Without acceptable\n  public order, freedom to speak and express is\n  challenged and would get restricted for the common\n  masses and law-abiding citizens. This invariably\n  leads to State response and, therefore, those who\n  indulge in promotion and incitement of violence to\n  challenge unity and integrity of the nation or public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_386\">\f                            44</span>\n\n  disorder tend to trample upon liberty and freedom of\n  others.”\n\n                                       (Emphasis by me)\n\n     Further, referring to the views of Alice E. Marwick and Ross\n\nMillers in the report titled “Online Harassment, defamation, and\n\nHateful Speech: A Primer of the Legal Landscape,” this Court in\n\nAmish Devgan elucidated as follows on three distinct elements\n\nthat legislatures and courts can use to define and identify ‘hate\n\nspeech’:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_265\">  “72.1. The content-based element involves open use of\n  words and phrases generally considered to be offensive\n  to a particular community and objectively offensive to\n  the society. It can include use of certain symbols and\n  iconography. By applying objective standards, one\n  knows or has reasonable grounds to know that the\n  content would allow anger, alarm or resentment in\n  others on the basis of race, colour, creed, religion or\n  gender.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_266\">  72.2.    The intent-based element of &#x27;hate speech&#x27;\n  requires the speaker&#x27;s message to intend only to\n  promote hatred, violence or resentment against a\n  particular class or group without communicating any\n  legitimate message. This requires subjective intent on\n  the part of the speaker to target the group or person\n  associated with the class/group.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_267\">  72.3. The harm or impact-based element refers to the\n  consequences of the ‘hate speech’, that is, harm to the\n  victim which can be violent or such as loss of self-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_470\">  esteem, economic or social subordination, physical and\n  mental stress, silencing of the victim and effective\n  exclusion from the political arena.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_471\">  72.4. Nevertheless, the three elements are not\n  watertight silos and do overlap and are interconnected\n  and linked. Only when they are present that they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_387\">\f                                   45</span>\n\n        produce structural     continuity   to   constitute   &#x27;hate\n        speech&#x27;.”\n\n          It was further clarified that the effect of the words must be\n\n      judged from the standard of “reasonable, strong-minded, firm\n\n      and courageous men and not those who are weak and ones with\n\n      vacillating minds, nor those who scent danger in every hostile\n\n      point of view.” That in order to ensure maximisation of free\n\n      speech, the assessment should be from the perspective of a\n\n      reasonable member of the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_472\">\n16.4. Further, in a landmark Judgment of the United States’ Supreme\n\n      Court in the matter of Chaplinsky vs. State of New\n\n      Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942) (“Chaplinsky”) “hate speech”\n\n      was defined by Murphy J. to mean “fighting words, which by their\n\n      very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach\n\n      of peace. It has been observed that such utterances are no\n\n      essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of slight social\n\n      value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from\n\n      them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and\n\n      morality.”\n\n\n16.5. The term ‘hate speech’ does not find a specific place in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_754\">Article\n\n      19(2)</a> of the Constitution and it appears that it does not constitute\n\n      a specific exception to the freedom of speech and expression\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_755\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Possibly the framers of the Constitution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_388\">\f                             46</span>\n\ndid not find the same to be of relevance in the Indian social\n\nmosaic considering that the other cherished values of our\n\nConstitution such as fraternity and dignity of the individual\n\nwould be strong factors which would negate any form of hate\n\nspeech to be uttered in our Country. This may be having regard\n\nto our social and cultural values. However, with the passage of\n\ntime, a wide range of Indian statutes have been enacted with a\n\nview to control hate speech. It may be useful to refer to a few of\n\nsuch provisions, with a view to examine the sufficiency of the\n\nexisting framework in checking ‘hate speech’ although, the said\n\nterm has not yet been precisely defined till date by the Parliament.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_473\">i)    The <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_756\">Indian Penal Code</a> (“<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_757\">IPC</a>”) contains provisions which\n\n      prohibit hate speech.

While speech of the\n\n      former category has been traditionally regarded as ‘hate speech,’\n\n      generally vitriolic or ‘derogatory’ statements, which are made on\n\n      the grounds of religion, race, caste or community, sex, gender,\n\n      sexual orientation, place of birth, residence, language, disability\n\n      or tribe, have traditionally not been considered to qualify as ‘hate\n\n      speech,’ no matter how unwarranted or disparaging such\n\n      statements may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_489\">\n16.7. Traditionally, ‘hate speech’ is the term used to describe speech\n\n      that can potentially cause actual material harm through\n\n      potential social, economic and political marginalisation of a\n\n      community as declared by this Court in Pravasi Bhalai\n\n      Sangathan. However, in the present case, in my opinion, we are\n\n      concerned with a more overarching area of derogatory, vitriolic\n\n      and disparaging speech, which is actually not ‘hate speech’\n\n      simplicitor as has been traditionally sought to be defined\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_395\">\f                                    53</span>\n\n        and understood. I am concerned with speech that may not be\n\n        linked to systematic discrimination and eventual political\n\n        marginalisation of a community, but which may nonetheless\n\n        have insidious effects on the societal perception of human\n\n        dignity, values of social cohesion, fraternity and equality\n\n        cherished by “We the people” of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_490\">\n16.8.   Andrew F. Sellars, in his essay published by Harvard University,\n\n        titled &#x27;Defining Hate Speech,’ has examined the concept of ‘hate\n\n        speech’ in different democratic jurisdictions. The author has\n\n        identified that certain remarks, which, although may not be ‘hate\n\n        speech’ in the strict sense of the term, border on the said term.\n\n        That even tacit elements of intent of the speaker to cause harm,\n\n        may constitute some species of hate speech. Intent may refer to\n\n        non-physical aspects like to demean, vilify, humiliate, or being\n\n        persecutorial, disregarding or hateful. The author has also\n\n        recognised that in some contexts, “at home speeches” may\n\n        themselves amount to hate speeches as such speech can now be\n\n        uploaded and circulated in the virtual world through internet etc.\n\n        The only pre-requisite is that the speech should have no\n\n        redeeming purpose, which means that “the speech primarily\n\n        carries no meaning other than hatred, hostility and ill-will.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_396\">\f                                        54</span>\n\nBeyond ‘hate speech’:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_491\">17.   The expansive scope of ‘hate speech’ as set out above, would\n\ninclude within its sweep not only ‘hate speech’ simplicitor which is\n\ndefined as speech aimed at systematic discrimination and eventual\n\npolitical marginalisation of a community, but also other species of\n\nderogatory, vitriolic and disparaging speech.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_492\">18.   A philosophical justification to control and restrain derogatory,\n\nvitriolic and disparaging speech has been very poignantly conveyed by\n\nLau Tzu, a celebrated Chinese philosopher and writer, in the following\n\nwords:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_277\">               &quot;Watch your thoughts; they become words.\n               Watch your words; they become actions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_278\">               Watch your actions; they become habit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_279\">               Watch your habits; they become character.\n               Watch your character; it becomes your destiny.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">19.   Theoretical and doctrinal underpinnings justifying restraints on\n\nderogatory and disparaging speech, may be traced to two primary\n\nfactors: human dignity as a value as well as a right; the Preambular\n\ngoals of ‘equality’ and ‘fraternity.’\n\n\nHuman dignity as a value as well as a right under the Constitution\n\nof India:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_494\">20.   As discussed supra, human dignity is not only a value but a right\n\nthat is enforceable under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_774\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. In a\n\nhuman-dignity-based democracy, freedom of speech and expression\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_397\">\f                                    55</span>\n\nmust be exercised in a manner that would protect and promote the\n\nrights of fellow-citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_495\">\nInternational practice:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_496\">21.    In attempting to justify restraints on free speech, on the argument\n\nfounded on considerations of autonomy, dignity and self-worth of the\n\nperson(s) against whom derogatory statements are made, reference may\n\nbe made to international practice in this regard.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_497\">i)    Canada: Canadian jurisprudence on the subject proceeds on the\n\n      basis of inviolability of human dignity as its paramount value and\n\n      specifically limits the freedom of expression when necessary to\n\n      protect the right to personal honour. The Canadian approach\n\n      emphasises on multiculturalism and group equality, as it places\n\n      greater emphasis on cultural diversity and promotes the idea of an\n\n      ethnic mosaic. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146045706\" id=\"span_398\">Interestingly, the Canadian position, as discernible\n\n      from the Canadian Supreme Court’s verdict in <a href=\"/doc/146045706/\" id=\"a_775\">R vs. James\n\n      Keegstra</a>, (1990) 3 SCR 697 (“Keegstra”) (Canada) considers the\n\n      likely impact of hate speech on both the targeted groups and non-\n\n      targeted groups. The former are likely to be degraded and\n\n      humiliated and experience injuries to their sense of self-worth and\n\n      acceptance in the larger society and may well, as a consequence,\n\n      avoid contact with members of the other group within the polity.\n\n      The non-targeted members of the group, sometimes representing\n\n      society at large, on the other hand, may gradually become de-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">\f                                        56</span>\n\n      sensitised and may in the long run start accepting and believing\n\n      the messages of hate directed towards racial and religious groups.\n\n      These insidious effects pose serious threats to social cohesion in\n\n      the long run rather than merely projecting immediate threats to\n\n      violence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_498\">          Further, Dixon C.J. of the Canadian Supreme Court in\n\n      Canada Human Rights Commission vs. Taylor, (1990) 3 SCR\n\n      892 (“Taylor”) (Canada) has observed as follows, as regards the\n\n      interrelationship between messages of hate propaganda and the\n\n      values of dignity and equality:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_499\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_280\">              “...messages of hate propaganda undermine the\n              dignity and self-worth of targeted group members\n              and, more generally, contribute to disharmonious\n              relations among various racial, cultural and religious\n              groups, as a result eroding the tolerance and open\n              mindedness that must flourish in a multicultural\n              society which is committed to the idea of equality.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_281\">ii)   Australia: The position of law in Australia is substantially aligned\n\n      with that in Canada. The Australian Federal Court, in the case of\n\n      Pat Eatock vs. Andrew Bolt, (2011) FCA 1103 (“Pat Eatock”)\n\n      (Australia) followed the dictum in Keegstra in holding that the\n\n      right to freedom of expression could be restricted vide legislation\n\n      which made racial hatred a criminal offence. The Australian\n\n      Federal Court stated that the rationale for a legislation restraining\n\n      free speech was as follows:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_400\">\f                                     57</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_282\">          “(a) The justification from pursuit of truth does not\n          support the protection of hate propaganda, and may even\n          detriment our search for truth.

The\n\n      Constitutional Court has expressed willingness to subjugate\n\n      freedom of expression when the same sufficiently undermines\n\n      dignity. The constitutional provision, therefore, enjoins the\n\n      legislature and the court to limit free speech rights and the exercise\n\n      of those rights which deprive others of dignity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_503\">iv)   Germany: The German law on the subject posits that freedom of\n\n      expression is one amongst several rights which is limited by\n\n      principles of equality, dignity and multiculturalism. Further, value\n\n      of personal honour always triumphs over the right to utter untrue\n\n      statements or facts made with the knowledge of their falsity. Also,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">\f                                     58</span>\n\n      if true statements of fact invade the intimate personal sphere of an\n\n      individual, the right to personal honour triumphs over the freedom\n\n      of speech. If the expression of opinion as opposed to a fact\n\n      constitutes a serious affront to the dignity of a person, the value of\n\n      dignity triumphs over the speech. Therefore, German application\n\n      strikes a balance between rights and duties, between the individual\n\n      and the community on the one hand and between the self-\n\n      expression needs of the speaker and the self-respect and dignity of\n\n      the listeners on the other.

As recognised by this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs.\n\nUnion of India, (2019) 1 SCC 1 (“Puttaswamy”), a substantive aspect\n\nof the Rule of Law is the balance between the individual and society. In\n\nthat background, this Court discussed the scope of Constitutional\n\nrights under our Constitutional scheme and the extent of their\n\nprotection. While emphasising that there are no absolute constitutional\n\nrights, this Court <a href=\"/doc/8443008/\" id=\"a_784\">laid down, in</a> the following words that one of the only\n\nrights which is treated as &quot;absolute&quot; is the right to human dignity:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_286\">         “62. It is now almost accepted that there are no\n         absolute constitutional rights [Though, debate on\n         this vexed issue still continues and some\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_405\">\f                            61</span>\n\nconstitutional experts claim that there are certain\nrights, albeit very few, which can still be treated as\n&quot;absolute&quot;. Examples given are:(a) Right to human\ndignity which is inviolable,(b) Right not to be subjected\nto torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or\npunishment. Even in respect of such rights, there is a\nthinking that in larger public interest, the extent of their\nprotection can be diminished. However, so far such\nattempts of the States have been thwarted by the\njudiciary.] and all such rights are related. As per the\nanalysis        of      Aharon         Barak        [Aharon\nBarak,Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and Their\nLimitation (Cambridge University Press 2012).], two key\nelements in developing the modern constitutional theory\nof recognising positive constitutional rights along with\nits limitations are the notions of democracy and the Rule\nof law. Thus, the requirement of proportional limitations\nof constitutional rights by a sub-constitutional law i.e.\nthe statute, is derived from an interpretation of the\nnotion of democracy itself. Insofar as the Indian\nConstitution is concerned, democracy is treated as the\nbasic feature of the Constitution and is specifically\naccorded a constitutional status that is recognised in the\nPreamble of the Constitution itself. It is also unerringly\naccepted that this notion of democracy includes human\nrights which is the cornerstone of Indian democracy.\nOnce we accept the aforesaid theory (and there cannot\nbe any denial thereof), as a fortiori, it has also to be\naccepted that democracy is based on a balance between\nconstitutional rights and the public interests. In fact,\nsuch a provision in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_785\">Article 19</a> itself on the one hand\nguarantees some certain freedoms in Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_786\">Article\n19</a> and at the same time empowers the State to impose\nreasonable restrictions on those freedoms in public\ninterest. This notion accepts the modern constitutional\ntheory that the constitutional rights are related. This\nrelativity means that a constitutional licence to limit\nthose rights is granted where such a limitation will be\njustified to protect public interest or the rights of others.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_511\">This phenomenon--of both the right and its limitation in\nthe Constitution--exemplifies the inherent tension\nbetween democracy&#x27;s two fundamental elements. On the\none hand is the right&#x27;s element, which constitutes a\nfundamental component of substantive democracy; on\nthe other hand is the people element, limiting those very\nrights through their representatives. These two\nconstitute a fundamental component of the notion of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_406\">\f                                     62</span>\n\n         democracy, though this time in its formal aspect. How\n         can this tension be resolved? The answer is that this\n         tension is not resolved by eliminating the &quot;losing&quot; facet\n         from the Constitution. Rather, the tension is resolved by\n         way of a proper balancing of the competing principles.\n         This is one of the expressions of the multi-faceted nature\n         of democracy. Indeed, the inherent tension between\n         democracy&#x27;s different facets is a &quot;constructive tension&quot;.\n         It enables each facet to develop while harmoniously\n         coexisting with the others. The best way to achieve this\n         peaceful coexistence is through balancing between the\n         competing interests. Such balancing enables each facet\n         to develop alongside the other facets, not in their place.\n         This tension between the two fundamental aspects--\n         rights on the one hand and its limitation on the\n         other hand--is to be resolved by balancing the two so\n         that they harmoniously coexist with each other.\n         This balancing is to be done keeping in mind the\n         relative social values of each competitive aspects\n         when considered in proper context.”\n                                                [Emphasis by me]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_512\">25.   It is clarified that at this juncture that it is not necessary to engage\n\nin the exercise of balancing our concern for the free flow of ideas and\n\nthe democratic process, with our desire to further equality and human\n\ndignity. This is because no question would arise as to the conflict of two\n\nseemingly competing rights, being the right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression, vis-à-vis the right to human dignity and equality. The\n\nreason for the same is because, the restraint that is called for, is only in\n\nrelation to unguided, derogatory, vitriolic speech, which in no way can\n\nbe considered as an essential part of exposition of ideas, which has little\n\nsocial value. This discourse, in no way seeks to pose a potential danger\n\nto peaceful dissenters, who exercise their right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression in a critical, but measured fashion.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_407\">\f                                    63</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_513\">      The present cases pertain specifically to derogatory, disparaging\n\nspeech, which closely resembles hate speech.

Therefore, when such\n\nspeech has the effect of infringing the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_788\">Article\n\n21</a> of another individual, it would not constitute a case which requires\n\nbalancing of conflicting rights, but one wherein abuse of the right to\n\nfreedom of speech by a person has attacked the fundamental rights of\n\nanother.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_514\">\nThe Preambular goals of ‘equality’ and ‘fraternity’:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_287\">26.   Equality, liberty and fraternity are the foundational values\n\nembedded in the Preamble of our Constitution. ‘Hate speech’, in the\n\nsense discussed hereinabove, strikes at each of these foundational\n\nvalues, by marking out a society as being unequal.

Mutual respect is the fulcrum of fraternity that assures\n\ndignity. This Court qualified its observations with the caveat that\n\n‘fraternity’ does not mean that there cannot be dissent or\n\ndifference, more so because all citizens have the right to freedom\n\nof speech and expression. However, it was unequivocally declared\n\nthat a constitutional value which is embedded in the idea of\n\nfraternity is dignity of the individual, which is required to be\n\nrespected by fellow citizens. That the Preamble consciously\n\nchooses to assure the dignity of the individual, in the context of\n\nfraternity and therefore, rights enshrined in Part III have to be\n\nexercised by individuals against the backdrop of the ideal of\n\nfraternity. This Court observed that the fraternal ideal also finds\n\nresonance in Part IVA of the Constitution.

Enemies Enigmas Oneginese on the part\nof some does not create a dent in the idea of fraternity\nbut, a significant one, liberty to have a discordant note\ndoes not confer a right to defame the others.”\n\n“163. We have referred to two concepts, namely,\nconstitutional fraternity and the fundamental duty, as\nthey constitute core constitutional values.

The individual\ninterest of each individual serves the collective\ninterest and correspondingly the collective\ninterest enhances the individual excellence.\nAction against the State is different than an action\ntaken by one citizen against the other. The\nconstitutional value helps in structuring the\nindividual as well as the community interest.\nIndividual interest is strongly established when\nconstitutional values are respected. The Preamble\nbalances different and divergent rights. Keeping in\nview the constitutional value, the legislature has\nnot repealed Section 499 and kept the same alive\nas a criminal offence. The studied analysis from\nvarious spectrums, it is difficult to come to a\nconclusion that the existence of criminal defamation\nis absolutely obnoxious to freedom of speech and\nexpression. As a prescription, it neither invites the\nfrown of any of the Articles of the Constitution nor its\nvery existence can be regarded as an unreasonable\nrestriction.”\n                                 (Emphasis by me)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_411\">\f                                   66</span>\n\n\n\n27.2. The decision of this Court in Subramanian Swamy establishes\n\n      precedent of justifying a restraint on free speech, on the ground\n\n      of promotion of fraternity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80997184\" id=\"span_412\">It has been recognized that the\n\n      constitutional value of fraternity imputes an obligation on all\n\n      citizens to subserve collective interest and respect the dignity and\n\n      equality of fellow citizen. Restraints on free speech prescribed to\n\n      secure these ends, have been held to be justified, as being aimed\n\n      at preserving the Preambular ideal of fraternity. It is also to be\n\n      noted that this Court in the said case recognized that fraternity\n\n      as a value is to be cultivated by citizens themselves as a part of\n\n      their social behavior by refraining from uttering defamatory\n\n      statements. This chord of <a href=\"/doc/80997184/\" id=\"a_790\">the said judgment</a>, acknowledges the\n\n      idea of self-restraint or inherent restraints as being read into the\n\n      right to freedom of speech and expression.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_291\">27.3. Democracy, being one of the basic features of our Constitution,\n\n      it is implicit that in a rule by majority there would be a sense of\n\n      security and inclusiveness.

Thus, the Preamble of the Constitution and\n\n      the values thereof assuring the people of India not only justice,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_413\">\f                                    67</span>\n\n       liberty, equality but also fraternity and unity and integrity of the\n\n       nation, must remind every citizen of this Country irrespective of\n\n       the office or position or power that is held, of the sublime ideals\n\n       of the Constitution and to respect them in their true letter and\n\n       spirit. There is an inbuilt constitutional check to ensure that the\n\n       values of the Constitution are not in any way undermined or\n\n       violated. It is high time that we, as a society in general and as\n\n       individuals in particular, re-dedicate ourselves to the sacred\n\n       values of the Constitution and promote them not only at our\n\n       individual level but at the macro level.

All human beings are endowed at birth, with certain inalienable\n\nrights and among such rights are right to life and liberty, including\n\nliberty of thought and expression. These rights have been recognized as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_419\">\f                                     73</span>\n\ninalienable rights, having regard to the supreme value of human\n\npersonality. Incidentally, some of such rights have come to be\n\nConstitutionally recognized under Part III of the Constitution of India.\n\nFundamental Rights were selected from what were previously natural\n\nrights and were later termed as common law rights. However, it is to be\n\nnoted that Part III of the Constitution, is not the sole repository of such\n\nrights. Even after some of such inalienable rights have come to be\n\nConstitutionally   recognised   as   Fundamental     Rights    under   the\n\nConstitution of India, the congruent rights under common law or\n\nnatural law have not been obliterated. It also follows, that the\n\ncorresponding remedies available in common law, are also not\n\nobliterated. The object of elevating certain natural and common law\n\nrights, as Fundamental Rights under the Constitution was to make\n\nthem specifically enforceable against the State and its agencies through\n\na Courts of law. These observations gain legitimacy from the judgment\n\nof Mathew, J. in His Holiness Kesavanada Bharati Sripadagalvaru\n\nvs. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225 (Kesavanada Bharati)\n\nwherein His Lordship recognized the object of Constitutions to declare\n\nrecognised natural rights as applicable qua the state.

I may also in this connection refer to a passage\non the inherent and inalienable rights in A History of\nAmerican Political Theories by C.

It is held that these natural\nrights can have no other than an ethical value, and\nhave no proper place in politics. There never was, and\nthere never can be,&#x27; says Burgess, &#x27;any liberty upon\nthis earth and among human beings, outside of state\norganization&#x27;. In speaking of natural rights, therefore,\nit is essential to remember that these alleged rights\nhave no political force whatever, unless recognized\nand enforced by the state. It is asserted by Willoughby\nthat &#x27;natural rights&#x27; could not have even a moral value\nin the supposed &#x27;state of nature&#x27;; they would really be\nequivalent to force and hence have no ethical\nsignificance.

I am also of the view that the power to amend\nthe provisions of the Constitution relating to the\nfundamental rights cannot be denied by describing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_421\">\f                                    75</span>\n\n         the fundamental rights as natural rights or human\n         rights. The basic dignity of man does not depend\n         upon the codification of the fundamental rights\n         nor is such codification a prerequisite for a\n         dignified     way    of     living.  There    was    no\n         Constitutional provision for fundamental rights\n         before January 26, 1950 and yet can it be said that\n         there did not exist conditions for dignified way of\n         living for Indians during the period between\n         August 15, 1947 and January 26,. 1950. The plea\n         that provisions of the Constitution, including those of\n         Part III, should be given retrospective effect has been\n         rejected by this Court. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_799\">Article 19</a> which makes\n         provision for fundamental rights, is not applicable to\n         persons who are not citizens of India. Can it, in view\n         of that, be said that the non-citizens cannot while\n         staying in India lead a dignified life? It would, in my\n         opinion, be not a correct approach to say that\n         amendment of the Constitution relating to\n         abridgement or taking away of the fundamental rights\n         would have the effect of denuding human beings of\n         basic dignity and would result in the extinguishment\n         of essential values of life.”\n\n                                             [Emphasis by me]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_533\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165099707\" id=\"span_422\">37.

Sanctity of life and liberty was not something\nnew when the Constitution was drafted. It\nrepresented a fact of higher values which mankind\nbegan to cherish in its evolution from a state of\ntooth and claw to a civilized existence. Likewise,\nthe principle that no one shall be deprived of ins\nlife and liberty without the authority of law was\nnot the gift of the Constitution. It was a necessary\ncorollary of the concept relating to the sanctity of life\nand liberty; it existed and was in force before the\ncoming into force, of the Constitution. The idea about\nthe sanctity of life and liberty as well as the principle\nthat no one shall be deprived of his life and liberty\nwithout the authority of law are essentially two facets\nof the same concept. This concept grew and acquired\ndimensions in response to the inner urges and nobler\nimpulses with the march of civilisation. Great writers\nand teachers, philosophers and political thinkers\nnourished and helped in the efflorescence of the\nconcept by rousing the conscience of mankind and by\nmaking it conscious of the necessity of the concept as\nnecessary social discipline in self-interest and for\norderly existence. According even to the theory of\nsocial compact many aspects of which have now been\ndiscredited, individuals have surrendered a part of\ntheir theoretically unlimited freedom in return or the\nblessings of the government. Those blessings include\ngovernance in accordance with certain norms in the\nmatter of life and liberty of the citizens. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165099707\" id=\"span_425\">Such norms\ntake the shape of the rule of law. Respect for law, we\nmust bear in mind, has a mutual relationship with\nrespect for government. Erosion of the respect for law,\nit has accordingly been said, affects the respect for the\ngovernment. Government under the law means, as\nobserved by Macdonald, that the power to govern shall\nbe exercised only, under conditions <a href=\"/doc/165099707/\" id=\"a_810\">laid down in</a>\nconstitutions and laws approved by either the people\nor their representatives. Law thus emerges as a norm\nlimiting the application of power by the government\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_426\">\f                           78</span>\n\nover the citizen or by citizens over their fellows.\nTheoretically all men are equal before the law and are\nequally bound by it regardless of their status, class,\noffice or authority.</span> At the same time that the law\nenforces duties it also protects rights, even against the\nsovereign.”\n\n                         xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_308\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_427\">158. I am unable to subscribe to the view that when\nright to enforce the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_811\">Article 21</a> is\nsuspended, the result would be that there would be\nno remedy against deprivation of a person&#x27;s life or\nliberty by the State even though such deprivation\nis without the authority of law or even in flagrant\nviolation of the provisions of law. The right not to\nbe deprived of one&#x27;s life or liberty without the\nauthority of law was not the creation of the\nConstitution. Such right existed before the\nConstitution came into force. The fact that the\nframers of the Constitution made an aspect of\nsuch right a part of the fundamental rights did not\nhave the effect of exterminating the independent\nidentity of such right and of making <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_812\">Article 21</a> to\nbe the sole repository of that right. Its real effect\nwas to ensure that a law under which a person can be\ndeprived of ins life or personal liberty should prescribe\na procedure for such deprivation or, according to the\ndictum <a href=\"/doc/165099707/\" id=\"a_813\">laid down by</a> Mukherjea, J. in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_814\">Gopalan</a>&#x27;s case,\nsuch law should be a valid law not violative of\nfundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the\nConstitution. Recognition as fundamental right of\none aspect of the pre-Constitutional right cannot\nhave the effect of making things less favourable so\nfar as the sanctity of life and personal liberty is\nconcerned compared to the position if an aspect of\nsuch right had not been recognised as fundamental\nright because, of the vulnerability of fundamental\nrights accruing from <a href=\"/doc/1594774/\" id=\"a_815\">Article 359.</a> I am also unable\nto agree that in view of the Presidential Order in the\nmatter of sanctity of life and liberty, things would be\nworse off compared to the state of law as it existed\nbefore the coining into force of the Constitution.”\n\n                         xxx\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_428\">\f                           79</span>\n\n“162. It has been pointed out above that even before\nthe coming into force of the Constitution, the position\nunder the common law both in England and in India\nwas that the State could not deprive a person of ins\nlife and liberty without the authority of law.

It was\nan offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_816\">Indian Penal Code</a>, as already\nmentioned, to deprive a person of ins life or liberty\nunless such a course was sanctioned by the laws of\nthe land. An action was also maintainable under the\nlaw of torts for wrongful confinement in case any\nperson was deprived of ins personal liberty without\nthe authority of law. In addition to that, we had\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_817\">Section 491</a> of the CrPC which provided the remedy of\nhabeas corpus against detention without the\nauthority of law.

Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud.

The judgments rendered by all the four judges\n         constituting the majority in ADM Jabalpur are\n         seriously flawed. Life and personal liberty are\n         inalienable to human existence. These rights are, as\n         recognised in Kesavananda Bharati, primordial\n         rights. They constitute rights under natural law. The\n         human element in the life of the individual is\n         integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is\n         associated with liberty and freedom. No civilized state\n         can contemplate an encroachment upon life and\n         personal liberty without the authority of law. Neither\n         life nor liberty are bounties conferred by the state nor\n         does the Constitution create these rights. The right to\n         life has existed even before the advent of the\n         Constitution. In recognising the right, the\n         Constitution does not become the sole repository of\n         the right. It would be preposterous to suggest that a\n         democratic Constitution without a Bill of Rights would\n         leave individuals governed by the state without either\n         the existence of the right to live or the means of\n         enforcement of the right.

Justice Khanna\n          was clearly right in holding that the recognition of\n          the right to life and personal liberty under the\n          Constitution does not denude the existence of that\n          right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous\n          assumption that in adopting the Constitution the\n          people of India surrendered the most precious\n          aspect of the human persona, namely, life, liberty\n          and freedom to the state on whose mercy these\n          rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary\n          to the basic foundation of the Rule of law which\n          imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the\n          modern state when it deals with the liberties of the\n          individual.

Remedies available in common\n\n      law for actualising such rights are also preserved. There are\n\n      therefore two spheres of rights, and corresponding remedies: first,\n\n      relatable to the Fundamental Rights enshrined under Part III the\n\n      Constitution of India, which correspond to the remedies under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_832\">Article 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_833\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India; second,\n\n      inalienable/natural/common          law   rights,   which   are      pre-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_540\">      constitutional rights, and may be protected by having recourse to\n\n      common law remedies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_541\">iii) While the content of a certain common law right, may be identical\n\n      to a Fundamental Right, the two rights would be distinct in two\n\n      respects: first, incidence of the duty to respect such right; and\n\n      second, the forum which would be called upon to adjudicate on the\n\n      failure to respect such right. While the content of the right violated\n\n      may be identical, the status of the violator, is what is relevant.\n\n\n      With that primer, I shall proceed to consider whether the\n\nFundamental Rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_834\">Article 19</a> or 21 of the Constitution of India\n\ncan be claimed against any person other than the State or its\n\ninstrumentalities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_542\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_543\">40.    With historical and political changes and the advent of democracy\n\nand of Constitutional government, the “State” was created under and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_435\">\f                                    84</span>\n\nby a constitution and placed at a position which renders it capable of\n\ninterfering with natural and common law rights. On the other hand, as\n\nis evident from the text of the Preamble of the Constitution of India, the\n\n“We the People of India created the State as an entity to serve their\n\ninterests. In order to reconcile the competing effects of creation of the\n\nState, certain common law rights were elevated to the constitutional\n\nplane by accommodating them in Part III of the Constitution of India to\n\nmake them specifically enforceable against the State and its agencies\n\nthrough the Courts. Part III of the Constitution was therefore enacted\n\nto dictate the relationship between citizens and the State- this is the\n\ntrue character and utility of Part III. This idea has also found resonance\n\nin Puttaswamy, wherein it was observed as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_313\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1731603\" id=\"span_436\">“251. Constitutions address the rise of the new\n         political hegemon that they create by providing for a\n         means by which to guard against its capacity for\n         invading the liberties available and guaranteed to all\n         civilized peoples. Under our constitutional scheme,\n         these means - declared to be fundamental rights -\n         reside in Part III, and are made effective by the power\n         of this Court and the High Courts Under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_835\">Articles 32</a>\n         and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_836\">226</a> respectively. This narrative of the progressive\n         expansion of the types of rights available to\n         individuals seeking to defend their liberties from\n         invasion - from natural rights to common law rights\n         and finally to fundamental rights - is consistent with\n         the account of the development of rights that\n         important strands in constitutional theory present.”\n\n    Therefore, the primary object of Part III of the Constitution was to\n\nforge a new relationship between the citizens and the State, which was\n\nthe new site of Governmental power. The realm of interaction between\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_437\">\f                                    85</span>\n\ncitizens inter-se, was governed by common law prior to the enactment\n\nof the Constitution and continued to be so governed even after the\n\ncommencement of the Constitution because as recognised hereinabove,\n\nthe common rights and remedies were not obliterated even after the\n\nConstitution   was   enacted.    These   inalienable   rights,   although\n\nsubsequently placed in Part III of the Constitution, retained their\n\nidentity in the arena of common law and continued to regulate\n\nrelationships between citizens and entities, other than the State or its\n\ninstrumentalities. It is therefore observed that the incidence of the duty\n\nto respect Constitutional and Fundamental Rights of citizens is on the\n\nState and the Constitution provides remedies against violation of\n\nFundamental Rights by the State. These observations are in consonance\n\nwith the recognition by this Court in People’s Union for <a href=\"/doc/1731603/\" id=\"a_837\">Civil Liberties\n\nvs. Union of India</a>, (2005) 2 SCC 436 (“People’s Union for Civil\n\nLiberties”) that the objective of Part III is to place citizens at centre\n\nstage and make the state accountable to them.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_544\">41.   On the other hand, common law rights, regulate the relationship\n\nbetween citizens inter-se. Although the content of a common law right\n\nmay be similar to a Fundamental Right, the two rights are distinct in so\n\nfar as, the incidence of duty to respect a common law right is on citizens\n\nor entities other than State or its instrumentalities; while the incidence\n\nof duty to respect a Fundamental Right, except where expressly\n\notherwise provided, is on the State. Remedies against violation of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_438\">\f                                    86</span>\n\nFundamental Rights by the State are Constitutionally prescribed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_838\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_839\">226;</a> while common law remedies, some of which are\n\nstatutorily recognised, are available against violation of common law\n\nrights. Such remedies are available even as against fellow citizens or\n\nentities other than State or its instrumentalities. To this extent,\n\nhorizontality is recognised in common law. Further to some extent\n\ncertain Fundamental Rights are recognised statutorily and some others\n\nare expressly recognised in the Constitution as being applicable as\n\nhorizontal rights between citizens inter se such as <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_840\">Articles 15(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_841\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_842\">, 23</a>,\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_545\">24.

Once we have arrived at this understanding of the\n       nature of fundamental rights, we can dismantle a core\n       assumption of the Union&#x27;s argument: that a right must\n       either be a common law right or a fundamental right.\n       The only material distinctions between the two classes\n       of right - of which the nature and content may be the\n       same - lie in the incidence of the duty to respect the right\n       and in the forum in which a failure to do so can be\n       redressed. Common law rights are horizontal in their\n       operation when they are violated by one&#x27;s fellow\n       man, he can be named and proceeded against in an\n       ordinary      court    of   law.

That is, although the content of a common law right\n\nand a fundamental right may be almost identical, the remedy against\n\nviolation of a common law right, shall lie under common law and not\n\nunder the Constitution; similarly, the remedy against violation of a\n\nFundamental Right is provided for under the Constitution itself\n\nexpressly against the State under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_845\">Article 19(2)</a> thereof.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_316\">42.

Such entitles are imbued with\n\nconstitutional obligations on account of the public or statutory\n\nfunctions performed by them. At this juncture, it is necessary\n\nto reflect on the difference between holding that Fundamental\n\nRights may be enforced against a private entity on account of\n\nthe public nature of its functions, as contrasted with universal\n\noperation of fundamental rights claims against all persons. A\n\nprivate body, acting in private capacity, fulfilling a private\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_450\">\f                            93</span>\n\nfunction, cannot be axiomatically amenable to the claims of\n\nfundamental rights violations.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_557\">\n    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23414761\" id=\"span_451\">The decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/23414761/\" id=\"a_875\">Ramakrishna Mission vs.\n\nKago Kunya</a>, (2019) 16 SCC 303 is also highly instructive on\n\nthe issue of amenability of actions of private entities, to judicial\n\nreview under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_876\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In the\n\nsaid case, the issue before this Court was whether the Hospital\n\nrun by the Petitioner Mission performed a public function that\n\nmade it amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_877\">Article 226.</a> This\n\nCourt found that the Hospital and the Mission were not\n\namenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_878\">Article 226</a> since running\n\na hospital would not constitute a public function. This Court\n\nfurther highlighted that even when a private entity performs a\n\npublic function, the Court would be required to enquire as to\n\nwhether the grant in aid received by the said entity covers a\n\nsignificant portion of its expenditure. This Court went on to\n\ndeclare that regulation of a private body by a statute does not\n\ngive it the colour of a public function. A public function was\n\nheld to be one which is “closely related to functions which are\n\nperformed    by   the   State    in   its   sovereign   capacity.”\n\nAccordingly, it was held that the Hospital was not performing\n\na public function since the functions it performed were not\n\n“akin to those solely performed by State authorities.” It was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_452\">\f                          94</span>\n\nheld that medical services were provided by private as well as\n\nState entities and therefore, the nature of medical services was\n\nnot such that they could be carried out solely by State\n\nauthorities.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_558\">\n    Thus, according to the decision of this Court in\n\nRamakrishna Mission, regulation by the State either through\n\na statute or otherwise; receipt of a meagre amount of aid from\n\nthe State; receipt of concessions by the State; do not make a\n\nprivate entity amenable to the writ jurisdiction of Courts under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_879\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_559\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_560\">     Thus, recognising a horizontal approach of Fundamental\n\nRights between citizens inter se would set at naught and render\n\nredundant, all the tests and doctrines forged by this Court to\n\nidentify “State” for the purpose of entertaining claims of\n\nfundamental rights violations. Had the intention of this Court\n\nbeen to allow Fundamental Rights, including the rights under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_880\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_881\">21</a>, to operate horizontally, this Court would\n\nnot have engaged in evolving and refining tests to determine\n\nthe true meaning and scope of “State” as defined under Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_561\">12. This Court would have simply entertained claims of\n\nfundamental rights violations against all persons and entities,\n\nwithout   deliberating   on    fundamental   questions   as   to\n\nmaintainability of the writ petitions. Although this Court has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_453\">\f                                95</span>\n\n      significantly expanded the scope of “State” as defined under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_882\">Article 12</a>, such expansion is based on considerations such as\n\n      the nature of functions performed by the entity in question and\n\n      the degree of control exercised over it by the State as such.\n\n      This is significantly different from recognising horizontality of\n\n      the fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_883\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_884\">21</a>, except while\n\n      seeking a writ in the nature of habeas corpus. Such a\n\n      recognition would amount to disregarding the jurisprudence\n\n      evolved by this Court as to the scope of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_885\">Article 12</a> of the\n\n      Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_562\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_563\">iv)   Another aspect that needs consideration is that a Writ Court,\n\n      does not ordinarily adjudicate to issue Writs in cases where\n\n      alternate and efficacious remedies exist under common law or\n\n      statutory law particularly against private persons. Therefore,\n\n      even if horizontal operation of the Fundamental Rights under\n\n      Article 19/21 is recognised, such recognition would be of no\n\n      avail because the claim before a Writ Court of fundamental\n\n      rights violations would fail on the ground that the congruent\n\n      common law right which is identical in content to the\n\n      Fundamental Right, may be enforced by having recourse to\n\n      common law remedies. Therefore, on the ground that there\n\n      exists an alternate and efficacious remedy in common law, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_454\">\f                            96</span>\n\nhorizontal claim for fundamental rights violations would fail\n\nbefore a Writ Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_564\">\n    This may be better understood by way of an illustration.\n\nLet me assume for the purpose of argument that the\n\nFundamental Right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_886\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_887\">Article 21</a>\n\nis allowed to operate horizontally. A person would then be\n\neligible to file a writ petition, against another private individual\n\nor entity for violation of such right. The violation may for\n\ninstance be a verbal attack at the aggrieved person, which may\n\nhave the effect of undermining such person’s dignity or\n\nreputation. Dignity and reputation are essential facets of the\n\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_888\">Article 21;</a> at the same time, they are also\n\nrecognised as common law rights as they are fundamental\n\nattributes of human personality which is regarded as a\n\nsupreme value in common law. Common law remedies,\n\nincluding declarations, injunctions and damages, are available\n\nto redress any injury to common law rights, including the right\n\nto dignity and reputation. Such remedies are also statutorily\n\nrecognised under the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_889\">Specific Relief Act, 1963</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_890\">Indian\n\nPenal Code</a>.      Therefore, on account of availability of an\n\nalternate remedy under common law, the Courts would be\n\nreluctant to entertain a writ petition under Articles 226 or 32,\n\nas the case may be.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_455\">\f                                     97</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_565\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_566\">    v)   Further, it is trite that Writ Courts do not enter into\n\n         adjudication of disputed questions of fact.       But, questions\n\n         regarding infringement of the fundamental rights under Article\n\n         19/21, by a private entity, would invariably involve disputed\n\n         questions of fact. Therefore, this is another difficulty that must\n\n         be borne in mind while determining the horizontal operation of\n\n         such rights in a writ proceeding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_567\">\n    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170679023\" id=\"span_456\">However, there is another aspect of the matter that requires to be\n\ndiscussed. A writ of habeas corpus is an order directing the person who\n\nhas detained another to produce the detainee before the court in order\n\nfor the court to ascertain on what ground or for what reason he has\n\nbeen confined, and to release him if there is no legal justification for the\n\ndetention. A writ of habeas corpus is granted ex debito justiae and the\n\napplicant must only demonstrate prima-facie, unlawful detention of\n\nhimself or any other person. If there is no justification for the detention\n\nand the same is unlawful, a writ is issued as of right vide <a href=\"/doc/170679023/\" id=\"a_891\">Union of\n\nIndia vs. Paul Manickam</a>, (2003) 8 SCC 342. The importance of a writ\n\nof habeas corpus is the duty being cast on a Constitutional Court to\n\nissue the writ to safeguard the freedom of a citizen against illegal and\n\narbitrary detention. In my humble view, an illegal detention is a\n\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_892\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, irrespective of whether the\n\ndetention is by the State or by a private person.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_457\">\f                                    98</span>\n\n    A petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_893\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would therefore lie\n\nbefore the High Court, not only when the person has been detained by\n\nthe State but also when he/she is detained by a private individual vide\n\nMohd. Ikram Hussain vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, A.I.R. 1964 SC\n\n1625 at 1630. In my view, such a petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_894\">Article 32</a> of the\n\nConstitution would also lie before this Court for seeking a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1566826/\" id=\"a_895\">Article 32 (2).</a> Such a writ could be issued not just\n\nagainst the State which may have illegally detained a person, but even\n\nas against a private person. Hence, in the context of illegal detention,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_896\">Article 21</a> would operate horizontally against private persons also. Such\n\na departure has to be made although Fundamental Rights are normally\n\nenforced against the State under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_897\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.\n\nOtherwise, the remedy by way of a writ of habeas corpus would be\n\nrendered incomplete if the said remedy is not available against a private\n\nperson under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_898\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. Hence in the context of\n\nillegal detention, even by a private person, I would opine that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_899\">Article 21</a>\n\nwould operate horizontally and the writ of habeas corpus could be\n\nissued against a private person just as under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_900\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution, the High Court can issue such a writ against any person\n\nor authority. But even in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1566826/\" id=\"a_901\">Article 32(2)</a> of the Constitution,\n\nit may not be proper to restrict the said remedy only as against the State\n\nbut the same may be made available even as against private persons, in\n\nwhich event the power exercised by this Court could be in accordance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_458\">\f                                    99</span>\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_902\">Article 142 (1)</a> of the Constitution to do complete justice in the\n\nmatter. For ease of reference <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_903\">Article 142(1)</a> may be extracted as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">  vi)   “142. Enforcement of decrees and orders of Supreme\n        Court and unless as to discovery, etc. - ( 1 ) The\n        Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction may\n        pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for\n        doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending\n        before it, and any decree so passed or orders so made\n        shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India in\n        such manner as may be prescribed by or under any law\n        made by Parliament and, until provision in that behalf is\n        so made, in such manner as the President may by order\n        prescribe.”\n\n\n\n    Therefore, a writ of habeas corpus could be issued by this Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_904\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution, not only against the ‘State’ as\n\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_905\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution but also against a private\n\nindividual. This is because illegal detention by a private person is a tort\n\nand of a nature similar to a constitutional tort. The reason for saying so\n\nis because an illegal detention whether by a State or a private person\n\nhas a direct and identical effect on the detainee. The detainee loses his\n\nliberty and there may be a threat to his life.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_568\">    Directions in the nature of writs of habeas corpus have been issued\n\nby this Court on previous occasions, against private individuals,\n\nparticularly in cases of kidnapping, child custody etc. [See for instance:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1488483\" id=\"span_459\"><a href=\"/doc/1488483/\" id=\"a_906\">Nirmaljit Kaur (2) vs. State of Punjab</a>, (2006) 9 SCC 364] In such\n\ncases, resorting to the process of instituting a criminal case before a\n\npolice station, may prove to be futile because the need of the hour in\n\nsuch cases is swift action.

Of course, there exist a plethora of statutes which\n\n    cast an obligation on the State and its machinery to contain hostile\n\n    situations between private actors; to repel any action by private\n\n    actors which would undermine the life and liberty of other persons\n\n    etc. This Court has, on several occasions, issued writs of\n\n    mandamus directing State authorities to carry out such statutory\n\n    obligations. In directing so, this Court may have referred to the\n\n    right to life and personal liberties under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_933\">Article 21.</a> However, such\n\n    reference   to   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_934\">Article   21</a>   is    not   to   be   construed   as   an\n\n    acknowledgement by the Court of an affirmative duty on the part\n\n    of the State under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_935\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution to protect the rights\n\n    of a citizen, against a threat to the liberty of a citizen by the acts or\n\n    omissions of another citizen or private agency. Given that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_936\">Article\n\n    21</a> only imposes a negative duty, a violation of the same would\n\n    occur only when the State undertakes an obligation by enacting a\n\n    statute or a scheme, but does not fulfil it.

While public law and private law are in theory, treated as\n\nanalytically different, in practice, the divide between the two spheres is\n\noften blurred. As a result, ideas, concepts and devices from one sphere,\n\ninfluence the other. Such an intermingling has given rise to the doctrine\n\nof horizontal effects as discussed hereinabove, wherein a constitutional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_473\">\f                                   108</span>\n\ndirective or norm (Fundamental Right) is interpreted by Courts to apply\n\nbetween individuals.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_335\">47.   Another concept which can be traced to the interaction between\n\npublic law and private law is that of a Constitutional tort, which in\n\nessence attributes vicarious liability on the State for acts and omissions\n\nof its agents which result in violation of fundamental rights of an\n\nindividual or group.     A constitutional tort is a violation of one’s\n\nconstitutional rights, particularly fundamental rights, by an agent of\n\nthe government, acting in his/her official capacity. The alleged\n\nconstitutional violation creates a cause of action that is distinct from\n\nany other available state tort remedy. It however, carries with it, the\n\nessential element of tort law, which seeks to redress a harm or injury\n\nby awarding monetary compensation by a competent court of law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_578\">Writ Petition: Principles of Procedure\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_579\">48.

The prerogative\n\npowers of the High Court are not exercised for enforcement of private\n\nrights of the parties but are for the purpose of ensuring that public\n\nauthorities act within the limits of law. Writ remedy is thus not a private\n\nlaw remedy except writ of habeas corpus.

In India, the government can be held liable for tortious acts of its\n\nservants and can be ordered to be paid compensation to the persons\n\nsuffering as a result of the legal wrong. <a href=\"/doc/1501859/\" id=\"a_944\">Article 294(b)</a> of the Constitution\n\ndeclares that the liability of the Union Government or the State\n\nGovernment may arise “out of any contract or otherwise”.

Therefore, this Court has\n\nbeen willing to defend life and liberty of persons against state\n\nlawlessness by holding that where <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_958\">Article 21</a> is violated, the State has\n\nto pay compensation and the concept of sovereign function does not\n\nprevail in this area.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_586\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_587\">53.   This proposition may be specifically traced to early PILs, which\n\nbegan in India in the 1980s, primarily in cases where officials of the\n\nState, such as prison officials had mistreated prisoners. The focus of\n\nthe first phase of PIL in India was on exposure of repression by the\n\nagencies of the state, notably the police, prison, and other custodial\n\nauthorities. These early PILs were essentially Constitutional tort actions\n\nwhich concerned allegations of violation of protected fundamental\n\nrights, as a result of acts or omissions on the part of officials of the\n\nState. Therefore, Constitutional law and tort law came to be merged by\n\nthis Court under the rubric of PIL, and this Court began allowing\n\nsuccessful petitioners to recover monetary damages from the State for\n\ninfraction of their fundamental rights. In such cases, there may have\n\nbeen statutory rights of persons also which would then be an\n\nenunciation of an aspect of Fundamental Rights particularly under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_959\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_487\">\f                                    112</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_588\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_589\">54.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"810491\" id=\"span_488\">In <a href=\"/doc/810491/\" id=\"a_960\">Rudul Sah vs. State of Bihar</a>, (1983) 4 SCC 141, Y.V.\n\nChandrachud, CJ., gave further momentum to fundamental rights to\n\ncombat state lawlessness by granting cash compensation to a victim of\n\nunlawful incarceration for fourteen years. It is to be noticed that His\n\nLordship, in the said case, took note of the dilemma in allowing a litigant\n\nto seek damages in a writ petition/PIL action against the State. His\n\nLordship noted that this could have the effect of ordinary civil action\n\nbeing circumvented on a routine basis, by invoking writ jurisdiction of\n\nthe High Courts and the Supreme Court as an alternative to ordinary\n\ncivil action. However, it was recognized that granting such remedies\n\nwould enhance the legitimacy of the vehicle of PIL. Therefore, this Court\n\nin Rudul Sah ultimately chose to grant monetary damages, in order to\n\n‘mulct’ the violators, as well as to offer a ‘palliative’ for victims.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1227505\" id=\"span_489\">Subsequent to the decision in Rudul Sah, compensatory relief has been\n\ngranted as a means to ‘civilize public power’ in several cases involving\n\nabrogation of Fundamental Rights, [See for instance, Sabastian M.\n\nHongray vs. Union of India, A.I.R. 1984 SC 1026; <a href=\"/doc/1227505/\" id=\"a_961\">Bhim Singh, MLA\n\nvs. State of Jammu and Kashmir, A.I.R.</a> 1986 SC 494.]</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_590\">55.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1628260\" id=\"span_490\">In <a href=\"/doc/1628260/\" id=\"a_962\">Nilabati Behera vs. State of Orissa</a>, (1993) 2 SCC 746, this\n\nCourt observed that the award of compensation in a proceeding under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_963\">Article 32</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_964\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is a remedy available in\n\npublic law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental\n\nrights. In respect of such actions, the doctrine of sovereign immunity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_491\">\f                                   113</span>\n\ndoes not apply, though it may be available as a defence in a private law\n\nin an action based on tort. Drawing a distinction between proceedings\n\nunder the private and public law, it was observed that a public law\n\nproceeding may serve a different purpose than a private law proceeding.\n\nPublic law proceedings are based on the concept of strict liability for\n\ncontravention of guarantee basic and indivisible rights of the citizens by\n\nthe State. The purpose of public law is not only to civilise governmental\n\npower and but also to assure the citizens that they live under a legal\n\nsystem which gains to protect their interest and preserve their rights.\n\nTherefore, when the court moulds the relief by granting compensation,\n\nin proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_965\">Article 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_966\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\nseeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights, it does so\n\nunder public law by way of employing elements of the law of torts and\n\nfixing the liability on the State which has been negligent and has failed\n\nin its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizens. The\n\npayment of compensation under such cases is not to be understood as\n\nit is generally understood in a civil action for damages under private\n\nlaw, but in the broader sense of providing relief by ordering monetary\n\namounts to be paid for the wrong done due to breach of public duty\n\nwhich would have the effect of violation of fundamental rights of\n\ncitizens. Such grant of damages in exercise of a writ jurisdiction by the\n\nconstitutional courts is independent of the rights available to the\n\naggrieved party to claim compensation under private law in an action\n\nbased on tort.

Therefore,\n\nnormally in case of tortious liability, the person aggrieved has to\n\napproach a civil court for ventilating his grievances and he cannot\n\ninvoke the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or a High Court.\n\nHowever, if the duty breached is of a public nature or there is violation\n\nor breach or infringement of a fundamental right by an act or omission\n\non the part of the authority, it is open to the party who has suffered a\n\n“legal wrong” to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or a High\n\nCourt by instituting the writ petition. In that case, the court, in exercise\n\nof its extraordinary jurisdiction and discretion judiciously may grant\n\nrelief to the person wronged without relegating him to avail a remedy,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_495\">\f                                   115</span>\n\notherwise available to him under private law having regard to the facts\n\nand circumstances of the particular case.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_593\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_594\">57.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113663\" id=\"span_496\">In <a href=\"/doc/113663/\" id=\"a_971\">Chairman, Railway Board vs. Chandrima Das</a>, (2000) 2\n\nSCC 465, this Court was presented with an appeal against an order of\n\nthe Calcutta High Court in a writ petition filed by a civil rights lawyer\n\non behalf of a foreign national-victim of rape, allegedly committed by\n\nrailway employees at a government-owned railway station. The events\n\nin question happened when the employees were off duty, but were\n\npresent at the premises owned and operated by the Government\n\n(Railways) . The writ petition was filed against the employer, in addition\n\nto initiating criminal proceedings against the individuals. A specific\n\nprayer was made in the writ petition for monetary compensation for the\n\nvictim, payable by the Government, alleging that its failure to protect\n\nthe victim and prevent the crime, had violated the victim’s fundamental\n\nright. The High Court awarded a sum of Rs. 10 Lakhs as compensation\n\nto the victim of rape, as it was of the opinion that the offence was\n\ncommitted at the building (Rail Yatri Niwas) belonging to the Railways\n\nand was perpetrated by the Railway employees. An appeal against <a href=\"/doc/113663/\" id=\"a_972\">the\n\nsaid judgment</a> was preferred before this Court.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_595\">58.   This Court dismissed the appeal holding that where public\n\nfunctionaries are involved and the matter relates to violation of\n\nFundamental Rights, or the enforcement of public duties, the remedy\n\nwould be available under public law, notwithstanding that a suit could\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_497\">\f                                   116</span>\n\nbe filed under private law, for damages. Since the crime of rape\n\namounted to a violation of the victim’s right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_973\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, this Court concluded that a public law remedy was\n\nwholly appropriate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_596\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_597\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1980069\" id=\"span_498\">59.    The decisions in Rudul Sah and Chandrima Das establish that\n\na public law action seeking monetary compensation for violation of\n\nfundamental rights was no longer an action in lieu of a private law\n\nclaim, but was to serve an independent and more important purpose.\n\nHowever, it cannot be ignored that the decisions of Courts to award\n\ncompensation in such cases, proceed on the basis of lower evidentiary\n\nstandards, as noted by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1980069/\" id=\"a_974\">Kumari vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>,\n\n(1992) 2 SCC 223.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_598\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_599\">60.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78791\" id=\"span_499\">In <a href=\"/doc/78791/\" id=\"a_975\">Tamil Nadu Electricity Board vs. Sumathi Das</a>, (2000) 4\n\nSCC 543, this Court held that exercise of writ jurisdiction would be\n\ninappropriate where there were disputed questions of fact that required\n\nproof through substantial evidence. However, it has been clarified that\n\nthe restriction applied only to the higher judiciary’s writ jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_976\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_977\">226</a>, and that it did not restrain this Court’s\n\npower to address the matter under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_978\">Article 142</a>, which allows this Court\n\nto pass any order ‘necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or\n\nmatter.’\n\n      Therefore, this Court has recognised that factual disputes could\n\noperate as a limit on the Courts’ ability to treat a matter as being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_500\">\f                                    117</span>\n\nactionable as a Constitutional tort but has nevertheless awarded\n\nmonetary compensation in certain cases possibly having regard to the\n\nglaring facts of those cases by exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_979\">Article 142</a> of the\n\nConstitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_600\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_601\">61.   Scholarly views suggest that the concept of Constitutional tort\n\nchallenges the ability of law to deter socially harmful behaviour of\n\ndifferent kinds, by forcing the perpetrator to internalise the costs of their\n\nactions. However, in case of a Constitutional tort action, the entity\n\nsaddled with the cost, is not the same as the entity who is to be deterred.\n\nThis absurdity is stated to be threatening to the corrective justice idea\n\nthat tort law embodies. In other words, an actor’s direct ability to alter\n\nthe injury-causing behaviour is critical to the foundation of tort law.\n\nHowever, given that an action of Constitutional tort imposes the burden\n\nof damages on an entity, other than the violator of the right, a doubt\n\nhas been cast on its effectiveness in serving as a vehicle of corrective\n\njustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_602\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_603\">62.   In light of the aforesaid discussion, it is observed that it is not\n\nprudent to treat all cases where a statement made by a public\n\nfunctionary resulting in harm or loss to a person/citizen, as a\n\nconstitutional tort. Regard must be had in every case to the nature of\n\nresultant harm or loss. Further, it is to be noted that even the cases\n\ncited hereinabove have permitted treating an act or omission as a\n\nconstitutional tort only where there has been an infraction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_501\">\f                                   118</span>\n\nfundamental right as a direct result of such act or omission. Therefore\n\nthe causal connection between the act or omission and the resultant\n\ninfraction of fundamental rights, is central to any determination of an\n\naction of constitutional tort.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_604\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_605\">63.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"379785\" id=\"span_502\">In <a href=\"/doc/379785/\" id=\"a_980\">Delhi Jal Board vs. National Campaign</a> for Dignity &amp;\n\nRights of Sewerage &amp; Allied Workers, (2011) 8 SCC 568, this Court\n\nrefused to entertain a matter against an interim order passed by the\n\nDelhi High Court in a writ petition, whereby the Petitioner Board had\n\nbeen directed to deposit compensation in favour of the family of a\n\nsewerage worker who had died while performing his duties. Dismissing\n\nthe case, this Court held that since the deceased had died due to\n\ninsensitivity on the part of the State apparatus, to the safety and well-\n\nbeing of its employees, the State would be liable to pay compensation to\n\nthe family of the deceased. This Court invoked <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_981\">Article 142</a> of the\n\nConstitution to enhance the amount of compensation payable.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_606\">64.    At this juncture, it may be apposite to sound a word of caution\n\nas regards the approach of the Courts in granting monetary\n\ncompensation as a means for vindication of fundamental rights. It is to\n\nbe noted that in the absence of a clear, cogent and comprehensive legal\n\nframework based on judicial precedent, which would clarify what harm\n\nor injury is actionable as a constitutional tort, such a device is to be\n\nresorted to only in cases where there are brutal violations of\n\nfundamental rights, such as the violations that were involved in Rudul\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_503\">\f                                    119</span>\n\nSah and Chandrima Das. This Court has acknowledged such a view\n\nin Sebastian M. Hongray, by noting that compensation was being\n\nawarded in the said case having regard to “torture, the agony and the\n\nmental oppression” which the family of the victim therein had to endure\n\ndue his death by an encounter. Similarly, this Court, in Bhim Singh\n\nstated that the compensation was awarded by taking note of the “bizzare\n\nacts” of police lawlessness. As already highlighted, compensation was\n\nawarded in Delhi Jal Board, by exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_982\">Article 142.</a>\n\nThus, the remedy provided is on a case to case basis on an evolution of\n\nthe concept of constitutional tort through judicial dicta.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_607\">65.    While it is true that the Courts must mould their tools to deal\n\nwith particularly extreme and threatening situations, and the device of\n\na ‘constitutional tort’ has evolved through such an exercise, it must be\n\nborne in mind that the tool of treating an action as a constitutional tort\n\nmust not be wielded only in instances wherein state lawlessness and\n\nindifference to the right to life and personal liberties have caused\n\nimmense suffering.       The law would have to evolve in this regard, in\n\nrespect of violation of other Fundamental Rights apart from issuance of\n\nthe prerogative writs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_608\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_609\">66.    Therefore, it is observed that presently invocation of writ\n\njurisdiction to grant damages, by treating acts and omissions of\n\nagencies of the State as Constitutional torts, must be an exception\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_504\">\f                                     120</span>\n\nrather than a rule.
