The Counsel for the RBL Bankhas referred the reply provided by CPIO\nand order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA had\nviolated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions in the matter. No\nreasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The\ncounsel for the appellant prayed before the Commission that the FAA order\ndated 16.03.2020 should be set-aside for want of reasons. The FAA in its order\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                      Page 3 of 11</span>\n has mentioned that the interim order passed in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_1\">Reserve Bank of India vs.\nJayantilal Mistry &amp; Ors.</a> would apply only to those banks which are parties to\nthe petition,namely, HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank Limited, ICICI Bank, Yes\nBank Limited andState Bank of India. As the appellant was not a party <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_2\">in that\ncase</a>, it wouldnot be possible for the appellant to take benefit of that order.He\nfurther submitted that the information sought by the RTI applicant was\ncompletely exempted as the information sought includes commercial\ninformation received in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of information sought is\nspecifically prohibited under various legislations and is specifically exempted\nunder Section 8 (1)(b), Section 8 (l) (d) and <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8(1)(h)</a> of the RTI Act.

The Supreme Court had\nissued notice in the matter and tagged the matter along with the concerned writ\npetitions. They further stated that since the matter was pending before the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and other banks had preferred similar writ petitions\n(tagged), the matter was sub-judice and order if any passed by the Hon&#x27;ble CIC,\nthere may be an irreparable injury to the appellant bank.

The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicants vide above RTI applications inter\nalia, sought, copy of Inspection Reports from year 2011-2019.

After considering the response\nfrom Appellant Banks, the CPIO decided to disclose the detail of Inspection\nReports from year 2011-2019to the applicants. He further submitted that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                         Page 6 of 11</span>\n Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs. Jayantilal N.

The appellant\nwas not a party in the aforementioned matters. Accordingly, it would not be\npossible for them to take advantage of the interim order dated 18.12.2019\npassed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">12. The representative of Reserve Bank of India has submitted that in file no.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2020/131964, they have already provided the requested\ninformation as sought from point nos. 3 to 8 of RTI Application vide their letter\ndated 05.05.2020 and no appeal is pending on these points.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Decision:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">13. The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original applicants has sought detail of\nInspection Reports made by Reserve Bank post completing the inspection, inter\nalia, pertaining to RBL Bank i.e. appellant herein and 13 other banks(as\nmentioned in RTI Application) from the year 2011-2019. The CPIO, Reserve\nBank of India issued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_20\">11(3)</a> to the respecting\nbanks mentioned above intending to disclose the information. Aggrieved by the\ndecision of the CPIO, the said banks had filed first appeals with the First\nAppellate Authority. The FAA had also dismissed the first appeals of the banks\nsummarily. Being aggrieved with the order of the FAA, banks had filed second\nappeals before this Commission.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">14. The Commission observes that the RTI applicants had insisted for\ndisclosure of information as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The Appellant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                         Page 7 of 11</span>\n Banks contested that the information sought as a whole is exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 8 (1) (b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_22\">8(1)(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_23\">8(1)(e)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_24\">8 (1) (h)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_25\">8(1) (j)</a>of the\nRTI Act and that the CPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their\nobjections nor gave any opportunity of hearing to them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">15. The Commission observes in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2020/131964, the\noriginal applicant Shri Anil Kumar Gaur has contended that he did not receive\nthe reply from the respondent. However, the respondent has contended that they\nhave provided the relevant information sought from point nos. 3 to 8 of RTI\nApplication vide their letter dated 05.05.2020. The respondent has further\ncommitted to provide a copy of the said reply again to the original applicant.\nTherefore, the Commission directs the respondent accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">16. The Commission further observes that the CPIO while issuing notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Banks to file\ntheir objections, if any, against disclosure of Inspection Reports/Audit Reports,\netc. but has not found it necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While\nnot doing so, the CPIO has not passed any reasoned order covering his\ndeliberations on their objections, his understanding of law or jurisprudence in\ndeciding specific objections, in favor of disclosure or redaction etc. Orders\npassed by the CPIO in all the cases are cryptic, almost identical without any\nreference to objections raised by the Banks which are definitely not identical.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">Similarly, the FAA instead of passing a speaking order has also given cryptic,\nalmost identical orders to the appellant banks. The CPIO and the FAA are\nexpected to apply their mind before issuing the order of intent of disclosing the\ninformation. Further, no opportunity of personal hearing was given to the\nappellant nor speaking order have been passed by FAA for not giving\nopportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for accepting /not accepting their\nobjections in his decisions in these appeals. The Commission is of the view that\nevery objection should be dealt and rejected/accepted with a reason and reasons\nfor not giving opportunity of personal hearing should be well reasoned too in\nview of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">17. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicants has\nto be adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution,\nvarious judicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts\nproviding guidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should generally be\nprovided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise if denied or not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                       Page 8 of 11</span>\n givenbe reasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, order by CPIO should\nenumerate the principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of inspection reports\nor part thereof which may include personal information, commercially sensitive\ninformation of clients or institution and hence specifically excluded disclosures\nunder various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">18. In light of the above observations and considering all the facts and\ncircumstances of the above mentioned cases, the Commission is of the view that\ncontour of the arguments are identical as held in the Full Bench judgment of this\nHon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide\norder dated 05.05.2022.

Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks may be allowed taking into account the\ncircumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a blanket manner.\nThe Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the relevant references\nfrom the said order while deciding the above mentioned cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_11\">20. Further, the Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the\nconduct of the CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the\nopinion that due care has to be taken by according opportunity of personal\nhearing and making reasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands\nof the CPIO and later in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the\nCPIO will be required to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the\nobservations of the Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the\nCPIO will take view on various objections filed by the Appellant and\nsubmissions made by applicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case\nto case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                       Page 9 of 11</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_29\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case, Commission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other\nrelevant judgments, some of which have been referred in this order as well.\nHence, with these observations the order passed by the CPIO and FAA in these\nmatters is set aside and the case is being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication\nafresh in line with the Commission full bench decision passed in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022.

Furthermore, since the original applicants has sought the requested\ninformation regarding various banks, however few of them have approached the\nCommission through present second appeals and second appeals, if filed, by the\nother banks are not known to the Commission. Therefore, if other banks\nregarding whom the information is being sought would approach the\nCommission, the decision passed in the above matters would be applicable to\nthem as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">22.
