While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the\n\n    victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless\n\n\n\n\n\n    female. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the\n\n    very core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an\n\n\n\n\n                                       of\n    accomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the\n\n    victim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher\n                    rt\n    pedestal than an injured witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">    14          Rape is the most hated crime, which tantamounts to\n\n    a serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends\n\n    both, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and\n\n\n\n    physical harm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">    Gang rape is all the more a serious and heinous offence.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">    15          The committal of rape is a beastly act and takes out\n\n\n\n\n\n    the life from the life of victim. The scars of rape always remain\n\n    engraved in her mind and she cannot overcome throughout her\n\n\n\n\n\n    life. Rape leaves physical as well as mental scars on the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">    Physical wounds may heal up, but the mental scars, though\n\n    less visible are more difficult to treat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">    16          Rape is a crime not against an individual but a\n\n    crime which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 26/09/2023 20:35:37 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                        7</span>\n\n    atmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not only lowers the dignity of a woman but\n\n    also mars her reputation. The plight of the woman and shock\n\n    suffered by the victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">    grows with traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame\n\n    haunted by the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of\n\n\n\n\n\n    terrifying melancholia. The torment on the victim has the\n\n    potentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized\n\n\n\n\n                                      of\n    society. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer\n\n    destroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and\n                   rt\n    defiles the soul of a helpless female. The offence of &quot;Rape&quot; is\n\n    grave by its nature, which warrants a strong deterrent by\n\n    judicial hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255210\" id=\"span_14\">17         In <a href=\"/doc/255210/\" id=\"a_6\">State of Punjab vs. Ramdev Singh</a>, AIR 2004\n\n\n\n    SC 1290, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">               This Court dealt with the issue and held that rape is\n\n\n\n\n               violative of victim&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of\n\n\n\n\n\n               the Constitution. So, the courts should deal with such\n               cases sternly and severely.

It is a serious\n               blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem\n               and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim\n               and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a\n               minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist\n               not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar\n               on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her\n               dignity, honour, reputation and chastity.

The consequential\n              death is more horrendous. It is to be kept in mind that an\n                  rt\n              offence against the body of a woman lowers her dignity\n              and mars her reputation.

An attempt for the momentary pleasure of\n              the accused has caused the death of a child and had a\n\n\n              devastating effect on her family and, in the ultimate\n              eventuate, on the collective at large. When a family suffers\n              in such a manner, the society as a whole is compelled to\n\n\n\n\n              suffer as it creates an incurable dent in the fabric of the\n\n\n\n\n\n              social milieu.

This process is complex and we could\n        not hope to describe it more clearly or succintly than did Lord\n        Taylor C.J. in the case of Deen (transcript: December 21,\n\n\n\n\n\n        1993), so we shall gratefully adopt his description.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">        &quot;The process of DNA profiling starts with DNA being extracted\n        from the crime stain and also from a sample taken from the\n\n\n\n\n                                   of\n        suspect. In each case the DNA is cut into smaller lengths by\n        specific   enzymes.      The    fragments               produced     are   sorted\n        according to size by a process of electrophoresis. This involves\n           rt\n        placing    the   fragments          in     a      gel\n        electromagnetically along a track through the gel. The\n                                                                 and    drawing      them\n\n        fragments with smaller molecular weight travel further than\n        the heavier ones. The pattern thus created is transferred from\n        the gel onto a membrane. Radioactive DNA probes, taken from\n        elsewhere, which bind with the sequences of most interest in\n\n\n        the sample DNA are then applied. After the excess of the DNA\n        probe is washed off, an X-ray film is placed over the\n        membrane to record the band pattern. This produces an auto\n\n\n\n\n        radiograph which can be photographed. When the crime stain\n        DNA and the sample DNA from the suspect have been run in\n\n\n\n\n\n        separate    tracks    through            the     gel,    the   resultant     auto-\n        radiographs can be compared. The two DNA profiles can then\n\n\n\n\n\n        be said either to match or not.&quot;&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">        213.

The scientific question involved is assumed to be\n        not within the court&#x27;s knowledge.       Thus cases where the\n\n\n        science involved, is highly specialized and perhaps even\n        esoteric, the central role of an expert cannot be disputed...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956064\" id=\"span_122\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"959998\" id=\"span_123\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1652872\" id=\"span_124\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"763713\" id=\"span_125\">51.

Analysis\n        of a set of 15 STRs employing Automated DNA Sequencer\n        gives   a   DNA     Profile   unique     to   an    Individual     (except\n        monozygotic twin). Similarly, STRs present on Y chromosome\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 26/09/2023 20:35:37 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                   49</span>\n\n        (Y- STR) can also be used in sexual assault cases or\n        determining paternal lineage.

In a criminal trial, it is assumed that the investigation\n        is    completed      and    the    prosecution      has,     as    such,\n        concretized    its    case        against    an    accused        before\n\n\n\n\n                                     of\n        commencement of the trial. It is further settled law that\n        the prosecution ought not to be allowed to fill up any\n        lacunae during a trial.As recognised by this Court in\n           rt\n        <a href=\"/doc/924107/\" id=\"a_85\">Central Bureau of Investigation v. R.S.Pai</a> (2002) 5 SCC\n        82, the only exception to this general rule is if the\n\n        prosecution had &#x27;mistakenly&#x27; not filed a document, the\n        said document can be allowed to be placed on record. The\n        Court held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">        &quot;7. From the aforesaid sub-sections, it is apparent that\n        normally, the investigating officer is required to produce all the\n        relevant documents at the time of submitting the charge-sheet.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">        At the same time, as there is no specific prohibition, it cannot be\n        held that the additional documents cannot be produced\n\n\n\n\n\n        subsequently. If some mistake is committed in not producing\n        the relevant documents at the time of submitting the report or\n        the charge-sheet, it is always open to the investigating officer to\n\n\n\n\n\n        produce the same with the permission of the court.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_207\">        56.    Therefore,    in    terms    of   general     procedure,       the\n        prosecution is obligated to supply all documents upon\n        which reliance may be placed to an accused before\n        commencement of the trial. Thus, the exercise of power by\n        the courts in criminal trials in permitting evidence to be\n        filed at a later stage should not result in serious or\n        irreversible prejudice to the accused. A balancing exercise\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 26/09/2023 20:35:37 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                         62</span>\n\n               in respect of the rights of parties has to be carried out by\n               the court, in examining any application by the prosecution\n               under <a href=\"/doc/205529/\" id=\"a_86\">Sections 91</a> or 311 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_87\">Cr.P.C</a> or <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 165</a> of\n               the Evidence Act.
