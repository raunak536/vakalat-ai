The appellant, Dr. Ravi Jindal participated in the hearing through audio\nconferencing. Mr. Rajeev K, ITO participated in the hearing representing the\nrespondent through audio conferencing. The written submissions are taken on\nrecord.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4.     At the outset, the appellant informed the Commission that Dr. Ratika is no\nlonger his legally wedded wife, as he has now obtained a decree of divorce. He is\nalso in receipt of the respondent&#x27;s letter dated 14-12-2018 indicating the gross\nincome and net taxable income of his erstwhile wife. However, the respondent did\nnot provide the income tax returns and its computation thereof. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"94345757\" id=\"span_2\">In support of his\ncontention for getting the income tax returns and its computation, he referred to the\norder dated 14-01-2015 of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in FAO 369/1996 titled\nas <a href=\"/doc/94345757/\" id=\"a_5\">Kusum Sharma v.

JMIC, Patiala claiming that she had no source of income while on the\nother hand she is duly filing income tax returns and is also working in a hospital.\nThus, her statement is at variance of the actual facts which is a criminal offence\nand has to be brought to the notice of the Ld. Court. Therefore, the CPIO should be\ndirected to disclose the income tax returns and its computation thereof.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.     The respondent submitted that in compliance with the 1 st appellate\nauthority&#x27;s order dated 28-11-2018, they have already provided the gross income\nand net taxable income of Dr. Ratika vide letter dated 14-12-2018. However, they\nhave claimed exemption u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 regarding non-\ndisclosure of the Income Tax Returns of Dr. Ratika.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">Decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"204838\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"94345757\" id=\"span_5\">7.     This Commission takes note of the decree of divorce indicated by the\nappellant. Now, the legal issue to be decided herein is whether the details of the\nincome tax returns of Dr. Ratika can be disclosed to the appellant at this stage\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act, 2005</a>. The appellant has alleged about wrong information being\nfurnished by Dr. Ratika before the Ld. JMIC, Patiala but he could not produce any\ncredible evidence to rebut his presumption. Therefore, personal information of an\nindividual cannot be sacrificed merely based on conjectures and surmises of the\nRTI applicant. Moreover, this Commission cannot assume the role of an\nadjudicating authority with regard to the veracity of the affidavit sworn before the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                           Page 2 of 7</span>\n Ld. JMIC, Patiala. Hence, the contention put forth by the appellant for disclosure\nof the third party information is being outrightly rejected. No larger public interest\nhas been established in the matter. The order dated 14-01-2015 of the Hon&#x27;ble\nDelhi High Court in FAO 369/1996 titled as <a href=\"/doc/94345757/\" id=\"a_9\">Kusum Sharma v. Mahinder Kumar\nSharma and the CIC</a>&#x27;s order dated 03-02-2015 in CIC/SA/A/2014/000433 titled as\n<a href=\"/doc/204838/\" id=\"a_10\">Prashnsa Sharma v.

Central\nInformation Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein, it has been held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">         13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n         censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n         as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The\n         performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily\n         a matter between the employee and the employer and normally\n         those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under\n         the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n         no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the\n         other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n         invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n         the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n         Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n         larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                            Page 3 of 7</span>\n           appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n          those details as a matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n          &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n          under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n          larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n          the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n          satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n          such information.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_9\">8.      Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger public\ninterest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated 11-06-2015\nrendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 8753 of 2013\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_16\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n          misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n          imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n          which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n          said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n          fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n          unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_10\">9.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to\n      the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n      W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n      returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n      Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n      Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and information\n      provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my\n      view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of filing\n      returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.\n      The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public\n      nature and not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute.

There is no public activity involved in filing a\n     return or an individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed.
