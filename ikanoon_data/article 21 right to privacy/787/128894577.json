Mary D&#x27;souza is resident of\n\nDoor No.7/63/13 situated at Saripalla house, Alape\n\nvillage, Mangaluru Taluk.       On 14.07.2013, at about\n\n7.15 pm, the accused called P.W.1 as CfÓ CfÓ (grand\n\nmother, grand mother) from the back door of her house.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 4</span>\n\nWhen P.W.1 opened the door, the accused trespassed\n\ninto her house by holding a knife, threatened her not to\n\nshout, otherwise, he will kill her and dragged her to the\n\nbed room, forcibly removed her clothes and committed\n\nsexual intercourse, against her will.         After committing\n\nrape, he robbed cash of `5,500/- and jewellery worth\n\n`51,000/- from the vanity bag kept in the almirah and\n\nran away from the house.            Therefore, she came out\n\nshouting PÀ¼Àî PÀ¼Àî (thief, thief) by covering with a piece of\n\ncloth. It is further case of the prosecution that on the\n\nnext day, i.e., on 15.07.2014, C.W.26/ P.W.21-Ravish,\n\nPolice Inspector, arrested the accused, seized the cash\n\nand jewels from his possession and produced the\n\naccused before the Court who was remanded to judicial\n\ncustody.         The   Investigating    Officer   recorded    the\n\nstatement of the witnesses, secured report from the\n\nDoctor     and    Forensic    Science     Laboratory.        After\n\ncompletion of the investigation, P.W.21 filed charge\n\nsheet against the accused before the Magistrate, who,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 5</span>\n\ntook cognizance of the offences in C.C.No.3422/2013\n\nand committed the matter to the Prl.

In order to bring home the guilt of the accused,\n\nthe prosecution examined P.Ws.1 to 21 and marked\n\nExs.P.1 to P.23(a) and M.Os.1 to 18. After completion of\n\nevidence of prosecution witnesses, the Court recorded\n\nthe statement of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 313</a> of the\n\nCode        of   Criminal   Procedure   by   explaining   the\n\nincriminating materials appearing against him.            The\n\naccused denied all incriminating evidence made against\n\nhim by the prosecution and filed additional statement\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 313(5)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nand did not choose to lead any defence evidence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">4.

Considering both oral and documentary evidence\n\non record, the learned Sessions Judge recorded a\n\nfinding    that,     the   prosecution   has   proved    beyond\n\nreasonable doubt that on 14.07.2013 at about 7.15 pm,\n\nthe accused by holding knife in his hand, trespassed\n\ninto the house of the complainant-Smt.Mary D&#x27;Souza\n\nbearing door No.7/63/13 situated at Saripall, Alape\n\nvillage, Mangaluru, and forcibly had sexual intercourse\n\nagainst the will of the complainant and thereafter, he\n\nrobbed cash of `5,500/- and gold from the vanity bag\n\nkept      in   the    almirah    and     committed      criminal\n\nintimidation by threatening to kill the complainant and\n\nthereby, committed the offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1947545/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 448</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_11\">376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_12\">392</a> r/w 397 and 506 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_13\">Indian\n\nPenal Code</a>.        Accordingly, the learned Sessions Judge,\n\nby the impugned Judgment and Order of conviction and\n\nsentence dated 14/18.11.2014, proceeded to convict\n\nand sentence the accused for the aforesaid offences.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  7</span>\n\nHence, the present Criminal Appeal is filed by the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nto the lis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">     III. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE LEARNED\n        COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT-ACCUSED\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">7.    Sri N.Amaresh, learned counsel for the accused\n\nappellant,     contended    with        vehemence      that    the\n\nimpugned       judgment    and       order   of   conviction   and\n\nsentence passed by the learned Sessions Judge is\n\nerroneous and contrary to the material on record and is\n\nliable to be set-aside.    He contended that the learned\n\nSessions      Judge   has not        given any weightage        or\n\ncredibility to the records pertaining to the medical\n\nexamination of the victim as well as accused. As per the\n\nmedical record, no sexual assault has taken place on\n\nthe victim.     He contended that presence of seminal\n\nstains and vaginal secretions were not detected in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                             8</span>\n\narticle Nos.A(bedsheet), D(nightie), E-1(pant), E-2(T-\n\nshirt), E-3 (underwear), F-1 (Penile swab), F-3 (public\n\nhair), F-4(nail cuttings), G-1 (vaginal swab) and G-2\n\n(pubic hair).     The learned Sessions Judge has not\n\nconsidered the said material facts before passing the\n\nimpugned judgment and order of sentence. He further\n\ncontended that the wound certificate of the victim\n\ndiscloses   &#x27;no    blood/seminal   stains,   no   foreign\n\nbodies/hair over the body except for a linear abrasion\n\nover the face&#x27;. The genital examination further states no\n\nblood stains, no seminal stains and foreign particles\n\nand hair in the genital region. The opinion states that,\n\non the basis of the said observation, &#x27;the sexual\n\nintercourse might have taken place&#x27;. So also, the FSL\n\nreport depicts &#x27;the sexual intercourse might have taken\n\nplace&#x27;. Therefore, there is no definite opinion that any\n\nkind of sexual assault has taken place on the victim.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                            9</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">8.   Learned    counsel    for   the   accused   further\n\ncontended that the investigating officer has not seized\n\nthe towel; the finger print on the knife and vanity bags,\n\nM.O.2 and 3 were not sent for expert&#x27;s opinion.      The\n\ncomplainant-P.W.1, at the inception has not alarmed or\n\nraised voice when accused forcibly trespassed into her\n\nhouse. Therefore, there is no sexual assault on P.W.1.\n\nHe further contended that the son of P.W.1 is residing\n\nin the adjoining house and there was no impediment for\n\nthe P.W.1 to resist the accused and raise her voice. The\n\nsame has not been done. Therefore, the story created\n\nby P.W.1 is nothing but false implication of the accused\n\nand the impugned judgment and order of sentence\n\ncannot be sustained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">9.   He further contended that, as per the statement of\n\nP.W.1, the intercourse continued for more than half an\n\nhour, but no medical evidence is produced to establish\n\nthe said fact. It is only a concocted story of P.W.1 in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 10</span>\n\ncollusion with P.W.8-Bashir, a Mason, only to deprive\n\nthe arrears of salary of `10,000/- to the accused, as\n\nstated by him in additional statement under <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n\n313(5)</a> of     the   Code   of   Criminal Procedure        dated\n\n16.10.2014.     He further contended that the impugned\n\njudgment and order of sentence passed by the learned\n\nSessions Judge is on the basis of the evidence of highly\n\ninterested witnesses (relatives) of P.W.1.          The same\n\ncannot be relied upon. He further contended that there\n\ncannot two acts i.e., rape and robbery at a time, in the\n\nfacts   and     circumstances        of   the   present   case,\n\nconsidering the fact that the accused is a labour\n\nworking under P.W.8.            On that ground also, the\n\nimpugned judgment and Order of sentence is liable to\n\nbe set-aside.    He further contended that, if the Court\n\ncomes to the conclusion that the accused is involved in\n\nthe alleged crime, taking into consideration the age and\n\nantecedents of the accused, it warrants reduction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 11</span>\n\nsentence imposed on the accused. Therefore, sought to\n\nallow the Appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">10.   In support of his contentions, learned counsel for\n\nthe   accused-      appellant    relied     on    the    following\n\njudgments:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"419325\" id=\"span_10\">(<a href=\"/doc/419325/\" id=\"a_15\">i) Phul Singh vs. State of Haryana</a> reported\n       in AIR 1980 SC 249.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1675266\" id=\"span_11\">(<a href=\"/doc/1675266/\" id=\"a_16\">ii) State of Rajasthan vs. N.K.(Accused</a>)\n       reported in AIR 2000 SC 1812, para-9 and\n       18;</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"376047\" id=\"span_12\">(iii)T.K.Gopal      alias     <a href=\"/doc/376047/\" id=\"a_17\">Gopi      vs.    State    of\n       Karnataka</a> reported in AIR 2000 SC\n       1669, para-20.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\"> IV. ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE LEARNED HIGH\n              COURT GOVERNMENT PLEADER\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.   Per contra, Sri S.Rachaiah, learned High Court\n\nGovernment Pleader, while justifying the impugned\n\njudgment and order of conviction, contended that the\n\nprosecution    proved    beyond      reasonable     doubt,     the\n\nforceful trespass, rape, robbery and threat by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                            12</span>\n\naccused, based on the oral and documentary evidence\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">12.   The learned HCGP further contended that, though\n\nthe accused filed additional statement dated 16.10.2014\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 313(5)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\nhe has not whispered about his voluntary statement\n\ndated 15.07.2013, made before the police, admitting the\n\nact of trespass, rape, robbery and threat to life with\n\nknife, to the P.W.1. In the absence of any material to\n\nprove his defence, the impugned judgment and order of\n\nsentence passed by the learned Sessions Judge is just\n\nand proper.    He further contended that, taking into\n\nconsideration the barbaric act of the accused on P.W.1\n\ncommitting rape on a 69 years old woman, no leniency\n\nshould be shown to the accused, as the entire material\n\non record clearly depicts, beyond reasonable doubt, that\n\nthe accused is involved in the alleged crime.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                              13</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">13.     He further contended that the evidence of P.W.1\n\nsupported by medical evidence clearly proved rape,\n\nrobbery and threat to life by the accused on P.W.1. The\n\nevidence of P.Ws.3, 4, 5 and 6 and spot mahazar/Ex.P.2\n\nclearly depicts that the accused is involved in the crime.\n\nThe statement of the victim-P.W.1 aged 69 years as on\n\nthe date of the incident has to be considered as gospel\n\ntruth, as, no women at that age would lie, as alleged by\n\nthe accused. Therefore, the appellant has not made out\n\nany ground to interfere with the impugned judgment\n\nand order of conviction and sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">14.     In support of his contentions, learned HCGP relied\n\nupon the following judgments:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1922500\" id=\"span_15\">(<a href=\"/doc/1922500/\" id=\"a_19\">i)    Siriya @ Shri Lal vs. State of Madhya\n\n             Pradesh</a> reported in (2008)3 SCC Cri\n\n             422: (2008)8 SCC 72.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (ii)   Shyam Narain vs. State (NCT of Delhi)\n\n             reported in (2013)7 SCC 77, para-27,28\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                14</span>\n\n             V.

P.W.1,   who   is   the   complainant   and   victim,\n\nreiterating the complaint averments, has stated that,\n\n&quot;on 14.07.2013, at about 7.00 pm, when I was\n\nmeditating in my house, the accused, by knocking the\n\nback door of my house, called me         CfÓ CfÓ (grand\n\nmother, grand mother).      When I slightly opened the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                            16</span>\n\ndoor, the accused pushed the door, entered the house\n\nforcibly holding a knife in his hand. At that time, there\n\nwas electric power supply in the house.     The accused\n\ndragged me to the bed room by holding the collar of my\n\nnightie and threatened me that if I shout, he would kill\n\nme. The accused, forcefully, made me naked. Though I\n\ntold the accused that I am not feeling well and I am\n\nhaving children who are elder to him, and begged him\n\nnot to do anything to me, the accused did not care. The\n\naccused opened his pant zip and had sexual intercourse\n\nagainst my will by biting my lips with his lips.\n\nThereafter, the accused sat on my chest and inserted\n\nhis penis into my mouth.    Then, with knife point, the\n\naccused terrorized me and asked me to give cash and\n\ngold.

FINDINGS RECORDED BY THE LEARNED SESSIONS\n                         JUDGE\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">38.   Based on the aforesaid material on record, the\n\nlearned    Sessions   Judge    recorded    a   finding   that,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                             25</span>\n\nknowingfully well that the complainant was alone in the\n\nhouse, the accused trespassed into the house of the\n\ncomplainant, aged 69 years old, raped her, robbed with\n\nknife point and terrorized her and the prosecution has\n\nproved the involvement of the accused in the said\n\noffences, beyond reasonable doubt.        It is further\n\nrecorded that the accused has not explained as to how\n\nhe came in possession of the cash and gold ornaments\n\nwhich were kept in the almirah of the house of the\n\ncomplainant-victim, when the same was seized by the\n\npolice.    It is not the defence of the accused that the\n\nprosecution witnesses including independent witnesses\n\nhad grudge against him and therefore, they are taking\n\nrevenge.     The learned Sessions Judge has further\n\nrecorded a finding that the independent witnesses,\n\nP.Ws.5 and 6 have categorically stated the incident\n\ndisclosed by P.W.1 on the same day at 8.00 pm. On the\n\nnext day, the visit of spot by the Investigating Officer\n\nand spot mahazar conducted by seizing M.Os.1 to 4 is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                              26</span>\n\nalso affirmed by them.        The criminal intimidation\n\ncaused by the accused holding knife is disclosed by the\n\ncomplainant with her son and neighbours i.e., P.W.5\n\nand 6 on the same day. Therefore, the learned Sessions\n\nJudge, by the impugned judgment and order of\n\nconviction and sentence, proceeded to convict the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                VII. CONSIDERATION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">39.   Having   regard   to    the   peculiar   facts   and\n\ncircumstances of the case, it is an admitted fact that the\n\naccused was a labourer working as assistant under\n\nP.W.8 who was engaged by P.W.1 for constructing a new\n\nhouse for her daughter and the accused was residing in\n\na shed near the house of the P.W.1. There is no dispute\n\nwith regard to the ownership of the building, in view of\n\nthe certificate issued by P.W.15 as per Ex.P.17.       It is\n\nalso not in dispute that, no Indian women, at an\n\nadvanced age of 69 years gives false complaint as\n\nalleged by the accused in his additional statement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                            27</span>\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 313(5)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nIn fact, in the very same statement, the accused has\n\nadmitted that he was present in the house of P.W.1 at\n\n7.00 pm on 14.07.2013. According to him, he went to\n\nthe house of P.W.1 and asked `10,000/- which was due\n\nto him from P.W.1.    But, she refused to give the said\n\nmoney and immediately shouted       PÀ¼Àî PÀ¼Àî (thief thief).\n\nThe statement of P.W.1 is corroborated by the evidence\n\nof P.W.8 who has stated on oath that he was paying\n\nsalary to the accused and there was no arrears of\n\nsalary, as alleged by the accused.     P.W.8 denied the\n\nsuggestion that he is colluding with P.W.1.         But no\n\nsuggestion was put to P.W.1 as to whether the accused\n\ncame to her house only to ask the money said to have\n\nbeen retained by her, as alleged by the accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">40.   In the additional statement, the accused took a\n\ndefence that the complainant has given false statement\n\nagainst him as he demanded money due to him towards\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  28</span>\n\nconstruction of house.           In the cross-examination of\n\nP.W.1 suggestion was put to the effect that in order to\n\nvacate the accused from the shed, a false case is\n\nregistered. The said suggestion was denied and it was\n\ninconsistent to the previous suggestion. Therefore, the\n\ninconsistent defence taken by the accused is not\n\nbelievable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">41.   It is also not in dispute that the accused made\n\nvoluntary          statement/confession   statement     dated\n\n15.07.2013 as per Ex.P.21. In the additional statement\n\ndated 16.10.2014 made under <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 313(5)</a> of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, the accused has not stated\n\nanything about his previous voluntary statement. It is\n\nwell settled that once defence is taken, it is for the\n\naccused       to     discharge   the   burden   by    himself.\n\nAdmittedly, neither any evidence is adduced nor any\n\ndocument is produced by the accused in support of his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                            29</span>\n\nadditional statement to disprove the allegations made in\n\nthe complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">42.   It is relevant to state that, in the confession\n\nstatement made by the accused, it is clearly stated that\n\nhe was fond of reading sex books, watching sex pictures\n\nand was in the habit of watching sex movies. He had\n\nfurther expressed about his lust for having sex after\n\nreading sex books. Though he was aged 24 years as on\n\nthe date of the incident, prior to that, he had evil\n\nthought in his mind whenever he saw the complainant\n\nin the nightie. How the accused who is similar to the\n\nage of grandsons of the victim thought of having sex\n\nwith the victim without caring for her age of 69 years is\n\nun-understandable.     Normally, in the Society, the\n\nelders, irrespective of gender will be given utmost\n\nrespect.   The accused who was taking help from the\n\ncomplainant calling her as CfÓ CfÓ (grand mother, grand\n\nmother) crossed   the limit and only to fulfill his lust,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                            30</span>\n\nhad sexual intercourse against her will, ignoring the\n\nsanctity of relationship of &quot;grandmother and grand son&quot;.\n\nThe act of sexual attack on an aged woman by the\n\naccused is like a &quot;cruel animal&quot; and P.W.1 never dreamt\n\nof such an inhuman behaviour by the accused who\n\nused to call her as CfÓ CfÓ (grand mother, grand mother).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">43.   The material-oral and documentary evidence on\n\nrecord clearly depicts that, the accused was residing in\n\na shed near the house of the victim-complainant-P.W.1,\n\nas deposed by all the prosecution witnesses and\n\nindependent witnesses. The sexual assault made by the\n\naccused is not against an old aged women, but against\n\nthe entire Society. It is the rape on the grand mother.\n\nSuch an act cannot be encouraged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">44.   The incident narrated by the victim-P.W.1 with\n\nregard to house trespass, rape, robbery and threatening\n\nby using a deadly weapon by the accused clearly\n\nindicate that the accused has not only violated the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                              31</span>\n\nprivacy and personal integrity of P.W.1, but also\n\ninevitably caused serious psychological as well as\n\nphysical harm to P.W.1. &quot;Rape is not merely a physical\n\nassault-it is often destructive of the whole personality of\n\nthe victim. A murder destroys the physical body of the\n\nvictim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless\n\nfemale&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"166873249\" id=\"span_34\">45.   The evidence of P.Ws.3 to 7 clearly depicts that\n\nthey have seen P.W.1 coming out of the house covering\n\nher body with a small piece of cloth and shouting PÀ¼Àî PÀ¼Àî\n\n(thief thief). P.W.4-Dixit, who turned hostile, has stated\n\nthat he heard P.W.1 shouting and coming out of her\n\nhouse by covering her body with a towel, his evidence\n\ncorroborates the evidence of P.W.1. Even the evidence\n\nof hostile witnesses can be relied upon to the extent to\n\nwhich it supports the prosecution version of the\n\nincident, as held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                 32</span>\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/166873249/\" id=\"a_27\">Bhajju @ Karan Singh vs. State of Madhya\n\nPradesh</a> reported in (2012)2 Crimes 40(SC).</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">           VIII.

It is also not in dispute that the evidence of P.W.1\n\nis supported by evidence of the Doctor who gave the\n\nopinion of    rape   on   P.W.1     on     14.07.2013.    The\n\ncomplainant being a grown up married women aged 69\n\nyears, the absence of injuries on her private parts is not\n\nof much significance, as held in Joshi&#x27;s Medical\n\nJurisprudence and Toxicology.              Thus, to constitute\n\nthe offence of rape, it is not necessary that there should\n\nbe complete penetration of penis with emission of semen\n\nand rupture of hymen. Partial penetration of the penis\n\nwithin the Labia Majora or the vulva or pudenda with or\n\nwithout emission of semen or even an attempt of\n\npenetration is quite sufficient for the purpose of the law.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                            39</span>\n\nIt is therefore quite possible to commit legally the\n\noffence of rape without producing any injury to the\n\ngenitals or leaving any seminal stains. In such a case,\n\nthe medical officer should mention the negative facts in\n\nhis report, but should not give his opinion that no rape\n\nhad been committed.       &quot;Rape is a crime and not a\n\nmedical condition&quot;.    &quot;Rape is a legal term and not a\n\ndiagnosis to be made by the medical officer treating the\n\nvictim&quot;.    The only statement that can be made by the\n\nmedical officer is that there is evidence of recent sexual\n\nactivity.   Whether the rape has occurred or not is a\n\n&quot;legal conclusion, not a medical one&quot;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_95\">55.   The learned counsel for the appellant contended\n\nthat there were no blood stains on the clothes of the\n\naccused, it may be true that the rainy season starts\n\nfrom June in Mangaluru.      Even if it is accepted that\n\nthere was heavy rain during night hours on 14.07.2013\n\ntill morning on 15.07.2013, the accused was found on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                40</span>\n\nthe next day at 5.30 am.          His admission made in the\n\nstatement itself shows that he was hiding in the forest\n\narea. Therefore, the blood stains on his clothes might\n\nhave been washed away in the rain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">56.    Though       learned   counsel      for   the   appellant\n\ncontended that the seized towel, knife and vanity bag\n\nwere not sent to finger print expert and complainant\n\nhas not raised alarm at the inception, the same cannot\n\nbe accepted, since, the fact remains that the accused\n\ntrespassed into the house of the complainant, calling\n\nher as CfÓ CfÓ (grand mother, grand mother) when she\n\nopened the door slightly, the accused pushed the door\n\nby    force   and    trespassed     into   the   house   of   the\n\ncomplainant by holding a knife in his hand and dragged\n\nher and threatened her not to shout, otherwise, he will\n\nkill her, and forcibly made her naked and had sexual\n\nintercourse against her will and he made all lustic acts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                              41</span>\n\ninhumanly.

The jurisdictional police registered the complaint\n\non 15.07.2013 and the accused was arrested on the\n\nsame day.    There was no delay as contended by the\n\nlearned counsel for the accused. A heinous offence has\n\nbeen committed on an aged women.            The delay been\n\nexplained by P.W.13. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and\n\nthis Court, time and again, have held that in any rape\n\ncase, delay in filing complaint by the victim who\n\nsuffered at the hands of accused is not fatal to the case\n\nand admittedly, in the present case, the authorities\n\nhave explained why it was delayed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">58.   As   per    the   evidence   of   P.W.14-Doctor   who\n\nexamined and found injuries on the accused has not\n\nexplained how the accused sustained those injuries.\n\nThe medical certificate shows multiple abrasion on the\n\nleft hand and right knee. The evidence of P.W.1 depicts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                42</span>\n\nhow the brutal act was done by the accused. She has\n\nstated that the accused first made her naked and\n\ncommitted sexual intercourse.         After committing the\n\nrape, the accused sat on her chest and made his private\n\npart into her mouth.      There was no necessity for the\n\ncomplainant/victim who is aged 69 years having five\n\nchildren and grand children, to make such an allegation\n\nagainst the accused.       As already stated above, the\n\naccused was aged 24 years.          On 15.07.2013, he has\n\nconfessed    his    act   of    sexual     intercourse,   his\n\ndetermination to have sexual intercourse on P.W.1. In\n\nthe confession statement, the accused has stated that,\n\nhe had determined to have sex with the complainant.\n\nHe has stated that, after knowing that the complainant-\n\nvictim was alone in the house on 14.07.2013, he\n\nentered the house at 7.15 pm with a knife deciding to\n\nhave sex with the complainant.           Accordingly, he did\n\nforcible sexual intercourse with the complainant.         The\n\nsaid   confession   statement       made   by   the   accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                             43</span>\n\ncorroborates the evidence of P.W.1 who is the victim.\n\nThe evidence of other witnesses including Medical\n\nwitness and official witnesses corroborates with the\n\nstatement made by the accused.       The same has not\n\nbeen denied when the accused made his additional\n\nstatement before the Court on 16.10.2014, under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 313(5)</a> of the Code of Criminal procedure.\n\nTherefore, the prosecution has proved the offence\n\nagainst the accused, beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">59.

There     is      clear    and\nunimpeachable evidence of the prosecutrix\nherself, as regards the offence of rape,\nthough it was argued that penetration was\nnot proved.

In view of the other\nevidence     suggesting       the   rape,     such    as\ninjuries     on    the    private    parts      of   the\nprosecutrix, moreover, there is nothing to\ncast   any    doubt      at   the   version     of   the\nprosecutrix as regards the offence of rape.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">The injuries on her throat caused by a\nsharp-edged weapon have been examined by\nthe doctor.       Her evidence in this regard is\nalso unimpeachable.

Sangeetha, who is an injured\nwitness had no reason to lie. Her presence\nin the house has also been explained.

We find from the evidence that the\nappellant came to the house driven by lust\nwith the intention of satisfying his desires at\nthe cost of the chastity of the prosecutrix.\nHe was armed with an aruval, which in all\nprobability he intended to use to intimidate\nanyone who opposed him, since he was\nprobably aware that there were no adults in\nthe house. Since he had worked as a mason\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                      48</span>\n\nin the house, he had noticed the prosecutrix\nto whom he felt greatly attracted.

His\nmotive in going to the place was not to\ncommit murder, but was to satisfy his lust,\nas suggested by the learned counsel for the\nState. The appellant attacked the deceased\nboy because he suddenly panicked at the\nthought that he would be caught. It is also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                       49</span>\n\nclear that it was in the same state of mind\nthat he attached PW 2 Sangeetha, who had\nseen him attacking the deceased. Similarly,\nhe then attacked the prosecutrix with a view\nto intimidate her. We have no doubt that if\nit was truly his intention to do so, he could\nhave killed all the three, who were much\nweaker than him, with the aruval at the\noutset, but he did not do so. We make these\nobservations only by way of assessment of\nthe predominant motive of the appellant in\ninjuring his victims and killing one of them.\nOur observations do not detract from the\nfact that the injuries were caused during the\ncourse of and as a part of, a heinous crime\nof lust. The assault on PW 2 Sangeetha and\nthe   prosecutrix   certainly   constitute   an\nattempt to murder as found by the Sessions\nCourt and the High Court.       The appellant\nhas thus been rightly convicted for the\noffences having regard to the nature of the\ninjuries, their location and the weapon with\nwhich the were caused.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                             50</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"12623793\" id=\"span_55\">63.

While a murdere\n      destroys the physical frame of the victim, a\n      rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a\n      helpless female.

Rape leaves a permanent\n      scar on the life of the victim, and therefore, a\n      rape victim is placed on a higher pedestal\n      than an injured witness.      Rape is a crime\n      against the entire society and violates the\n      human rights of the victim. Being the most\n      hated crime, rape tantamounts to a serious\n      blow to the supreme honour of a woman,\n      and offends both, her esteem and dignity.

The trespass has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                           64</span>\n\nproved by the evidence of P.W.1 and the additional\n\nstatement of accused under <a href=\"/doc/69513793/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 313(5)</a> of the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure. The offence of rape, robbery and\n\nthreat is also spoken by P.W.1 who is the victim. The\n\nevidence of other witnesses including independent\n\nwitnesses corroborates the said fact.      This clearly\n\ndepicts that the prosecution has proved all the offences\n\nalleged against the accused i.e., offences punishable\n\nunder Sections 448, 376, 392 r/w 397 and 506 of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_61\">Indian Penal Code</a>, beyond reasonable doubt.         The\n\nlearned Judge considering the entire material on record\n\nhas proceeded to pass the impugned judgment and\n\norder of sentence and the appellant-accused has not\n\nmade out any ground to interfere with the impugned\n\njudgment and order of sentence, in exercise of powers\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/929532/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 374(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nAccordingly, the point raised for consideration is\n\nanswered in the negative holding that the appellant/\n\naccused has not made out any ground to interfere with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                               65</span>\n\nthe well crafted judgment and order of sentence passed\n\nby the learned Sessions Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">73.    We     also   appreciate    the   courage,   conviction,\n\narticulation, sincerity and devotion shown by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge in considering the averments\n\nmade     in    the   complaint,    evidence-both    oral    and\n\ndocumentary, meticulously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">                         IX.
