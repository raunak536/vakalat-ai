The\n\n   petitioner having acquired requisite educational qualification, vied\n\n   for the post of Constable in the Constable Recruitment - 2013,\n                                   (2 of 14)\n                                                              [CW-14006/2016]\n\nadvertised vide notification dated 14.7.2013. The petitioner after\n\nclearing the written examination successfully underwent Physical\n\nEfficiency Test and Physical Standard Test.         Her documents and\n\ncredentials too were found in order; for which her name was\n\nshown in the select list published on 13.2.2015, at Sl.No.148 for\n\nthe District Jalore.\n\n      When the petitioner was called for medical test, it transpired\n\nthat the petitioner is a &#x27;Hermaphrodite&#x27; - commonly known as\n\n&#x27;unisex&#x27; of &#x27;transgender&#x27;.    Such being the medical report, the\n\nrespondents took their hand off and instead of permitting her to\n\njoin, they pushed her file in dormancy.         The petitioner claims to\n\nhave roamed from pillar to post in anxiety to serve the police\n\ndepartment; for which she sent scores of representations also, but\n\nall in vein.\n\n      Faced with such situation, she has knocked at the doors of\n\nthis Court, invoking its extra ordinary jurisdiction for the following\n\nreliefs :-\n\n      &quot;(i) by an appropriate writ, direction or order, the\n      respondents      may   kindly      be   directed   to   grant\n      appointment to the petitioner on the Constable in the\n      category of OBC Female in pursuance of select list\n      dated 13.02.2015 forthwith.\n\n      (ii) or in the alternative, the respondents may kindly\n      be directed to grant appointment to the petitioner on\n      the post of Constable treating her to be third gender\n      i.e. Transgender.\n\n      (iii) Cost of this writ petition may kindly be awarded in\n      favour of the petitioner.\n                                  (3 of 14)\n                                                                      [CW-14006/2016]\n\n     (iv) Any other appropriate direction or order which\n     this   Hon&#x27;ble    Court   deems         fit   in   the   facts   and\n     circumstances of the case may kindly be granted.&quot;\n\n\n\n     Mr.    Rituraj   Singh,   learned        counsel     for   the     petitioner\n\nvehemently ventilating the cause of the petitioner submitted that\n\nshe has been discriminated and has not been permitted to join the\n\nduties for the reasons, which are neither relevant nor sustainable.\n\nHe submitted that inaction on the part of the respondents in not\n\npermitting the petitioner to serve the police force despite due\n\nselection, amounts to rejection of her candidature, which is per-se\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_3\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\ndespite being oppressive and vindictive.\n\n     While showing deep concern about the predicament of the\n\npetitioner, who is otherwise looked down by the society and\n\ntreated with disgrace, learned counsel submitted that the rights of\n\ntransgenders have enticed attention and concern of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court and at the instance of National Legal Services\n\nAuthority, it has issued various directions vide its judgment dated\n\n15.4.2014, in the case of National Legal Service Authority Vs.\n\nUnion of India &amp; Ors., reported in AIR 2014 SC 1863. Counsel for\n\nthe petitioner navigated the Court through various observations\n\nmade by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court to drive home his point that the\n\npetitioner despite being a transgender, has a fundamental right to\n\nbe protected against the inequality or discrimination.\n\n     Mr. Anil Bissa, learned counsel for the respondents while\n\nshowing concern and compassion for the petitioner, exhibited the\n                                      (4 of 14)\n                                                                 [CW-14006/2016]\n\nhelplessness of the respondent - State; as the third category of\n\ngender, other than male and female has not been recognized by\n\nthe State so far.\n\n        On the basis of the reply filed by him, Mr. Bissa submitted\n\nthat the Department of Home, Government of Rajasthan, vide its\n\nletter dated 17.3.2017 has apprised that a Bill in relation to third\n\ngender (Transgender) is pending before the Parliament and after\n\npassing of the same, needful will be done.                The crux of his\n\nsubmission has been that the appointment to the petitioner will\n\nbe/     can    be   given   only   after     promulgation/enforcement        of\n\nappropriate law in relation to transgender or third gender.\n\n        Before beginning with the legal issue involved in the instant\n\ncase,     it   would   be    apt    to     understand    the    meaning      of\n\n&#x27;hermaphrodite&#x27;, which means an individual in whom reproductive\n\norgans of both sexes are present. In common parlance, they are\n\ncalled    &#x27;Transgenders&#x27;     or    &#x27;Eunuch&#x27;.     There    are   other    local\n\nterminologies and identities in different parts of India, having\n\nspecific socio-cultural and religion connotations such as &#x27;Hijras,\n\njogtas, kinnars, sakhi&#x27; etc.\n\n        It will be useful to sail through various Constitutional\n\nprovisions, to first elucidate as to whether the petitioner, who is\n\nsex neutral can claim her purported rights to be human rights or\n\nentrenched fundamental rights, guaranteed or insulated by the\n\nConstitution ?\n\n        The journey begins from the Preamble.\n\n        WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved\n        to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN, SOCIALIST,\n                               (5 of 14)\n                                                          [CW-14006/2016]\n\nSECULAR, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to\nall its citizens:\n\nJUSTICE, Social, economic and political\n\nLIBERTY of though, expression, belief, faith and\nworship;\n\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to\npromote among them\n\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and\nthe unity and integrity of the Nation;\n\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this 26th day of\nNovember, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND\nGIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 5.</a> Citizenship at the commencement of\nthe Constitution. -         At the commencement of this\nConstitution, every person who has his domicile in the\nterritory of India and;\n\n(a) who was born in the territory of India; or\n\n(b) either of whose parents was born in the territory\nof India; or\n\n(c) who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of\nIndia    for   not   less   than    five   years   immediately\npreceding such commencement, shall be a citizen of\nIndia.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 14.</a> Equality before law.- The State shall\nnot deny toi any person equality before the law or the\nequal protection of the laws within the territory of\nIndia.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 16.</a> Equality of opportunity in matters of\npublic employment. -\n\n        (1) ... ... ...\n                                 (6 of 14)\n                                                        [CW-14006/2016]\n\n           (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,\n     race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or\n     any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against\n     in respect of, any employment or office under the\n     State.\n\n\n\n     It would also be apt to refer to the meaning of the term\n\n&#x27;Person&#x27;, which means &quot;a human being as distinguished from an\n\nanimal or thing.&quot;\n\n     The dictionary meaning of word &#x27;Hermaphrodite&#x27; as defined\n\nin Oxford Dictionary (Deluxe Edition) is : A noun 1. A human being\n\nor animal combining characteristics of both sexes. A person or\n\nthing combining two opposite qualities or functions; 2. An animal\n\nhaving normally both male and female sexual organs, as many\n\nsnails and earthworms. 3 A flower in which both stamens and\n\npistils are present; a plant having such flowers. B. adjective. 1\n\nCombining the characteristics of or consisting of both sexes;\n\ncombining two opposite qualities.\n\n     Unquestionably transgenders are human beings, irrespective\n\nof their gender identity; as such they are person and by virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 5</a> of the Constitution, they are citizens.\n\n     Now there cannot be any cleavage of opinion that the\n\nConstitution of this Great Country is meant for all the persons,\n\nwhich means all living beings or human race. The petitioner being\n\ntransgender or &#x27;Hermaphrodite&#x27; is also a citizen of India as\n\ndiscussed above and hence Part-III of the Constitution equally\n\nconveys fundamental rights to her and the same are protected.\n                                 (7 of 14)\n                                                         [CW-14006/2016]\n\n     The action on the part of the respondents in not giving\n\nappointment to the petitioner, merely because of fortuitous\n\ncircumstance of being born with indeterminate sex, and called as\n\ntransgender - or unisex, cannot be scooped out of the protective\n\numbrella of fundamental rights.       The concern shown by Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court and observations made in the judgment aforesaid\n\n(AIR 2014 SC 1863), out of which some excerpts are quoted\n\nbelow leave no room for ambiguity that a person like the\n\npetitioner cannot be denied right of appointment, which is\n\nprotected and guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1011960/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 16 (2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Denial of appointment and refusal to provide place\n\nof posting to the petitioner is clearly contrary to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_11\">Articles 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_12\">&amp; 16</a>\n\nof the Constitution.\n\n     &quot;54. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India states that\n     the State shall not deny to &quot;any person&quot; equality\n     before the law or the equal protection of the laws\n     within the territory of India. Equality includes the full\n     and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedom. Right\n     to equality has been declared as the basic feature of\n     the Constitution and treatment of equals as unequals\n     or unequals as equals will be violative of the basic\n     structure of      the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 14</a> of the\n     Constitution also ensures equal protection and hence\n     a positive obligation on the State to ensure equal\n     protection of laws by bringing in necessary social and\n     economic changes, so that everyone including TGs\n     may enjoy equal protection of laws and nobody is\n     denied such protection.     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 14</a> does not restrict\n     the word person and its application only to male or\n     female.   Hijras/transgender persons who are neither\n     male/female fall within the expression person and,\n     hence, entitled to legal protection of laws in all\n                            (8 of 14)\n                                                     [CW-14006/2016]\n\nspheres    of   State activity, including employment,\nhealthcare, education as well as equal civil and\ncitizenship rights, as enjoyed by any other citizen of\nthis country.\n\n62. <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution guarantees\ncertain fundamental rights, subject to the power of\nthe State to impose restrictions from exercise of those\nrights.    The rights conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19</a> are not\navailable to any person who is not a citizen of India.\n<a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(1)</a> guarantees those great basic rights\nwhich are recognized and guaranteed as the natural\nrights inherent in the status of the citizen of a free\ncountry.    <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution states\nthat all citizens shall have the right to freedom of\nspeech and expression, which includes one&#x27;s right to\nexpression of his self-identified gender. Self identified\ngender can be expressed through dress, words, action\nor behaviour or any other form. No restriction can be\nplaced on one&#x27;s personal appearance or choice of\ndressing, subject to the restrictions contained in\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n74. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>, as already indicated, protects ones\nright of self-determination of the gender to which a\nperson belongs. Determination of gender to which a\nperson belongs is to be decided by the person\nconcerned. In other words, gender identity is integral\nto the dignity of an individual and is at the core of\npersonal        autonomy      and      self-determination.\nHijras/Eunuchs, therefore, have to be considered as\nThird Gender, over and above binary genders under\nour Constitution and the laws.\n\n76. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 14</a> has used the expression person and the\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 15</a> has used the expression citizen and sex so\nalso <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 16.</a>      <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19</a> has also used the\nexpression citizen. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> has used the expression\nperson.     All these expressions, which are gender\n                                     (9 of 14)\n                                                                     [CW-14006/2016]\n\n     neutral evidently refer to human-being. Hence, they\n     take within their sweep Hijras/Transgenders and are\n     not as such limited to male or female gender. Gender\n     identity as already indicated forms the core of ones\n     personal self, based on self identification, not on\n     surgical or medical procedure. Gender identity, in our\n     view, is an integral part of sex and no citizen can be\n     discriminated on the ground of gender identity,\n     including those who identify as third gender.\n\n     77. We, therefore, conclude that discrimination on the\n     basis of sexual orientation or gender identity includes\n     any    discrimination,         exclusion,        restriction       or\n     preference, which has the effect of nullifying or\n     transposing    equality    by       the    law   or   the      equal\n     protection of laws guaranteed under our Constitution,\n     and hence we are inclined to give various directions to\n     safeguard the constitutional rights of the members of\n     the TG community.\n\n     110 (c) The TGs are also citizens of this country.\n     They also have equal right to achieve their full\n     potential as human beings. For this purpose, not only\n     they   are    entitled    to      proper    education,         social\n     assimilation, access to public and other places but\n     employment opportunities as well.                The discussion\n     above while dealing with the first issue, therefore,\n     equally applied to this issue as well.&quot;\n\n\n\n     Adverting to the facts obtaining in the present case, it is to\n\nbe noted that the petitioner had competed in the process of\n\nrecruitment as a female candidate; she has presented herself as a\n\nfemale candidate.    As held by the Apex Court, it is a right of a\n\nperson to claim his/her sex according to his/her wishes.\n                                (10 of 14)\n                                                               [CW-14006/2016]\n\n     In the present case, the petitioner has claimed herself to be\n\na female and merely because she has been found to be a unisex -\n\nHermaphrodite, it cannot be said that the petitioner&#x27;s claim\n\nregarding gender was incorrect, as she has been found to be\n\nhaving characters of both the sexes.         As a matter of fact the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s claim in relation to her gender is correct, as she has\n\nbeen claiming herself to be a female and she has a right to decide,\n\nwhich gender she belongs to. (Re: National Legal Services\n\nAuthority (supra).\n\n     Until and unless the sex claimed by him or her is found to be\n\ncontrary to the assertion made, his/her candidature cannot be\n\nrejected.\n\n     In view of above, the writ petition is allowed.                     The\n\nrespondents are directed to issue order of appointment to the\n\npetitioner and permit her to join duties within a period of six\n\nweeks from today.     On failure of the respondents to permit the\n\npetitioner to join duties by 31.12.2017, from 01.01.2018, she\n\nshall be entitled to all the emoluments such as salary, dearness\n\nallowance etc. as is payable to the similarly situated recruits.\n\nPetitioner shall also be entitled for notional benefits from the date,\n\nwhen the candidate immediately lower to her in merit has joined.\n\n     Needless to observe that the respondents may carry out\n\npetitioner&#x27;s   documents   verification     before   issuing     order     of\n\nappointment to her.    If the petitioner&#x27;s documents are found in\n\norder, she shall be forthwith appointed.\n\n     The harassment and agony meted out to the petitioner, by\n\ndint of sheer inaction or recklessness is immeasurable. This Court\n                                (11 of 14)\n                                                        [CW-14006/2016]\n\ndoes not deem it appropriate to confine the same, by imposing\n\nthe monetary cost.\n\n     Cost is, thus, made easy.\n\n     As a parting remark, this Court would like to observe\n\nsomething about the medical test/examination, which has come to\n\nits notice during the course of hearing the matter.\n\n     Mr. Bissa, has shown rather heavily relied upon petitioner&#x27;s\n\nsex determination report, for which, she had ostensibly given her\n\nconsent. On perusal of the same, this Court is impelled to delve\n\nupon the reasonableness and requirement of sex determination\n\nunder the cloak of Medical Test.\n\n     It is often found that the appointing authority or concerned\n\nauthorities require a candidate/applicant to mention about his sex\n\n(fyax). In considered opinion of this Court, an enquiry about &#x27;sex&#x27;\n\nof a person and then its determination by way of medical\n\nexamination etc. intrudes the person&#x27;s right of privacy enveloped\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n     According to this Court, until and unless the nature of the\n\njob so requires, the appointing authority and employer cannot ask\n\nabout the &#x27;sex&#x27; of a person and in place thereof, the requisite\n\ncolumn should be &quot;gender&quot; and in Hindi version, it should be\n\n&quot;iq:&quot;k@efgyk&quot; in place of fyax. The reasons for the same are set out\n\nhereinfra :-\n\n     One has to understand the subtle difference between\n\n&#x27;gender&#x27; and &#x27;sex&#x27;. Though there is no apparent Hindi translation\n                                 (12 of 14)\n                                                                [CW-14006/2016]\n\nfor the term &#x27;gender&#x27; and the term &#x27;ling&#x27; ( fyax) is generally used for\n\nboth the English terms &#x27;gender&#x27; and &#x27;sex&#x27;.\n\n      Sex refers to biological status as male or female. It includes\n\nphysical attributes such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex\n\nhormones, internal reproductive structures, and external genitalia.\n\nGender is a term that is often used to refer the ways that people\n\nact, interact, or feel about themselves, which are associated with\n\nboys/men and girls/women. While aspects of biological sex are the\n\nsame across different cultures, aspects of gender may not be.\n\n      &quot;Gender identity&quot; refers to a person&#x27;s internal, deeply felt\n\nsense of being either man or woman, or something other or a\n\nmixed feeling. Because gender identity is internal and personally\n\ndefined, it is not visible to others. In contrast, a person&#x27;s &quot;gender\n\nexpression&quot; is external and socially perceived. Gender expression\n\nrefers to all the external characteristics and behaviors that are\n\nsocially defined as either masculine or feminine, such as dress,\n\nmannerisms, speech patterns and social interactions.\n\n      The contemporary term &quot;transgender&quot; arose in the mid-\n\n1990s from the grassroots community of gender-different people.\n\nIn contemporary usage, transgender has become an &quot;umbrella&quot;\n\nterm that is used to describe a wide range of identities and\n\nexperiences, including but not limited to transsexual people: male\n\nand    female      cross-dressers    (sometimes        referred      to    as\n\n&quot;transvestites,&quot;   &quot;drag   queens&quot;     or    &quot;drag   kings&quot;);    intersexed\n\nindividuals; and men and women, regardless of sexual orientation,\n\nwhose appearance or characteristics are perceived to be gender\n\natypical. In its broadest sense, transgender encompasses anyone\n                                 (13 of 14)\n                                                              [CW-14006/2016]\n\nwhose identity or behavior falls outside of stereotype gender\n\nnorms.&quot;\n\n     Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of National Legal Services\n\nAuthority (supra) has held that a candidate should be left free to\n\nchoose his gender with which he/she identifies himself/herself. As\n\nsuch, if a person has been claiming himself/herself to be belonging\n\nto a particular gender, the respondents are bound to accept the\n\nsame until and unless such candidate seeks to take advantage of a\n\nparticular gender.     If a candidate&#x27;s external characteristics and\n\nbehavioral pattern is in conformity with the declaration; and the\n\nnature of job does not require him to be of a specific gender, sex\n\ndetermination of a candidate cannot be resorted to.\n\n     If a candidate states, his/her gender, his credentials and\n\nphysical para-meters are to be considered in accordance with\n\nhis/her claim; of course in consonance with his other credentials\n\nor documents, the same has to be accepted albeit being mindful of\n\nthe external characteristics and behaviour. Gender determination\n\ncan be done only if the nature of work, so requires, such as\n\nFemale Constable, Auxiliary Nurse Midwifery etc. and there is\n\napparent inconsistency in his declaration/claim.\n\n     In the present case, the petitioner has applied for the post of\n\nConstable as a female candidate; she has cleared the Physical\n\nStandard Test on the para-meters fixed for a female candidate. In\n\nsuch situation, as the documents are in tune with her gender\n\ndeclaration and no doubt has been expressed about her external\n\ncharacteristics and gender behaviour, petitioner&#x27;s candidature\n\nought     to   have   been   considered      as   &#x27;female&#x27;   while   giving\n                                (14 of 14)\n                                                         [CW-14006/2016]\n\nappointment and there should be no impediment in offering\n\nappointment to her. The posts advertised were &#x27;gender neutral&#x27; or\n\nnon specific, therefore, the petitioner was entitled for appointment\n\nas a Constable. Sex of a person may have some relevance while\n\nproviding posting at a sensitive place, which requires a person of a\n\nspecific gender, looking to the nature of the duties, he/she is\n\nrequired to discharge.\n\n     In view of above, it is held that the sex determination of the\n\npetitioner, which she had to undergo in a bid to get an\n\nemployment was arbitrary and violative of right of privacy\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n     Sex determination can be ordered only if a candidates&#x27;\n\ngeneral behaviour, external characteristic or society&#x27;s perception\n\nabout such candidate is contrary to the declaration he/she has\n\nmade.\n\n     A copy of this order be sent to the Chief Secretary of the\n\nState of Rajasthan to be circulated to Rajasthan Public Service\n\nCommission, Raj.
