It was\n\nfurther stated in the said e-mail that they have come across such\n\nfake education loan sanction letters issued by different branches of\n\nSBH, including the Green Park Colony and Panderghast Road\n\nBranches. It was further stated that some Branch Managers of the\n\nSBH were also involved along with their associates in the fraud.\n\nSome of the identified consultants are one Mr. Sagar and one Mr.\n\nSrinivas. It was further informed that a copy of the mail has also\n\nbeen marked to the integrity cell of the Department of Immigration\n\nand Border Protection Australia.     Accordingly, he requested the\n\ncompetent authority of the SBH to conduct a detailed investigation\n\nin respect of the said branches and take appropriate action.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                 5</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">    (iii) Pursuant to the developments above, the petitioner, during his\n\ntenure as MSME at Moulali Branch from August 2015 to October 2017,\n\nwas issued a Show Cause Notice dated 12.10.2017, requiring him to offer\n\nhis explanation in respect of the serious irregularities and lapses said to\n\nhave been committed by him. The petitioner submitted his reply on\n\n23.10.2017, denying the allegations against him in the Show-Cause\n\nNotice. Not being satisfied with the petitioner&#x27;s reply, the Disciplinary\n\nAuthority issued a Chargesheet dated 30.07.2018 under State Bank of\n\nHyderabad (Officers) Service Regulations, 1979, against the petitioner\n\nframing the following articles of charges:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (i)     You have influenced and pressurized Sri T Bhuvan Mohan, Branch\n             Manager, Green Park Colony, Hyderabad and Sri K Chandra\n             Sekhar,      Branch      Manager,        Prenderghast         Road     Branch,\n             Secunderabad     and      forced       them    to   issue    pre-printed   fake\n             educational loan sanction letters sent by middle man named Sri\n             Sagar to several students, thus passed pecuniary benefit to third\n             parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (ii)    You have sent such pre printed sanction letters through a middle\n             man by name Sagar and pressurized the Branch Managers to sign\n             the same in the pretext that there is no real financial loss to the\n             bank and assuring that nothing will happen to anybody.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (iii)   Your above acts not are in gross violation of Bank&#x27;s norms but also\n             misguided,     thereby    cheated        the    Bank        and   International\n             Educational Institutes and caused reputational loss to the Bank\n             and Sovereign Nation.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           6</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (iv)   It is, therefore, alleged that you have failed to discharge your\n            duties with utmost devotion and diligence and violated Rule 50(4)\n            of SBH Officer&#x27;s Service Regulations, 1979 by which you are\n            governed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      (iv) The petitioner submitted his reply to the said chargesheet vide\n\nletter dated 24.08.2018, stating as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     &quot;It is a fact that I have merely given a business lead to Sri. T. Bhuvana\n     Mohan in good faith and without negligence. However, I have cautioned\n     him to be diligent in following all systems and procedures. I have neither\n     influenced, nor insisted, nor pressurized him in any manner. I have never\n     forced him to give educational loan sanction letters unauthorisedly. I am\n     not aware of the preprinted sanctioned letters by middle man by name Sri\n     Sagar. I am not aware of the pecuniary benefit to the third parties. I\n     cannot comment on the purported voice recordings in the absence of\n     listening the same by me.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     I have not told anything to Sri. K. Chandra Sekhar. Branch Manager,\n     Penderghast Road Branch. Therefore, the question of my pressurizing and\n     influencing him does not arise. I am totally unaware of sanction letters\n     issued by these officers as mentioned in the examples.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     I cannot comment on the observations made by Sri.Nishidhar Reddy\n     Borra, the General Secretary of the Australian Education Representatives\n     of India on the issue of fake education loan sanction letters by branches\n     of SBH in India, as I am not aware of anything in this regard.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     I have never misguided or cheated the bank in any way. Therefore, it is\n     not correct to say that my actions are in gross violation of Bank&#x27;s norms\n     causing reputational loss to the Bank and Sovereign Nation...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">     (v) Not being satisfied with the above reply, the 2nd Respondent,\n\nvide letter dated 28.08.2018, ordered disciplinary proceedings against\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      7</span>\n\n\nthe petitioner by appointing the Inquiring Authority. A preliminary\n\nenquiry was held on 15.09.2018, regular hearings took place on\n\n01.10.2018 and 08.10.2018; and the enquiry concluded on 09.10.2018.\n\nThe Inquiring Authority submitted its report dated 14.11.2018 to the 2nd\n\nRespondent Disciplinary Authority, inter-alia holding that Charges-1(a),\n\n1(b), 2 and 3 as proved, which was communicated to the petitioner vide\n\nletter dated 15.11.2018.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">     (vi) The Disciplinary Authority, vide letter dated 17.12.2018,\n\ncommunicated to the petitioner the proposed major penalty, i.e.,\n\n&quot;Removal from service as provided in Regulation No.67 (i) of the State\n\nBank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service Regulation, 1979&quot; and called upon\n\nthe petitioner to appear before the Disciplinary Authority on 20.12.2018\n\nfor personal hearing and make his submissions as to why the 2nd\n\nRespondent should not impose the proposed penalty on the petitioner.\n\nThe petitioner submitted his response to the same, vide letter dated\n\n20.12.2018. Thereafter, the Respondent bank issued a copy of the\n\nremoval order dated 26.12.2018, wherein the Disciplinary Authority\n\nimposed the punishment of &quot;Removal from Service&quot; as provided in\n\nRegulation No.67(i) of State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service Rules,\n\n1979 and liberty was given to the petitioner to prefer an appeal before the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                            8</span>\n\n\nAppellate Authority, if he so desires. Accordingly, the petitioner has\n\npreferred an appeal before the Appellate Authority.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">      (vii) The Appellate Authority, under the impugned order dated\n\n18.07.2019, rejected the appeal confirming the punishment of removal\n\nfrom service imposed on the petitioner by the Disciplinary Authority by\n\nobserving as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">         &quot;Considering the fact that the official has influenced and pressurized\n         Branch Managers to issue fake educational loan sanction letters and\n         there was a huge reputational loss and dent in the image of the Bank.\n         On account of the gravity of the lapses and in the absence of any new\n         submissions offering mitigation, I am of the considered view that the\n         punishment awarded is commensurate with the gravity of the proven\n         lapses and adequately meets the ends of justices.\n         I, therefore, do not intend to interfere in the process and the appeal is\n         hereby rejected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">The respondent authorities communicated the impugned order to the\n\npetitioner vide letter dated 22.07.2019. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner\n\nhas filed the present writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">4.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner contended that the\n\npetitioner filed his reply on 24.08.2018 denying the allegations made\n\nagainst him, stating that he had merely given business leads to\n\nSri T Bhuvan Mohan in good faith and without malice. Moreover, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       9</span>\n\n\npetitioner cautioned him to be diligent in following all systems and\n\nprocedures. The petitioner stated that he did not influence, insist, or\n\npressurize Sri T Bhuvan Mohan in any manner, nor did he force him to\n\ngive any educational loan sanction letters unauthorizedly at any time.\n\nThe petitioner denied being aware of the pre-printed sanction letters\n\npurported to have been prepared by a middleman named Sri Sagar, or\n\nabout any pecuniary benefits to third parties. The petitioner also denied\n\nhaving   told   anything   to   Sri   Chandrasekhar,   Branch   Manager,\n\nPanderghast Road Branch. Therefore, the question of the petitioner\n\npressurizing or influencing the said Branch Managers does not arise.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">5.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner contended that the\n\npetitioner belonged to MMGS-III Grade (Middle Management Grade\n\nScale), K Chandrasekhar, who deposed as PW-2 in the domestic enquiry,\n\nbelonged to SMGS-IV Grade (Senior Management Grade Scale), and\n\nT.Bhuvan Mohan, who deposed as PW-4, belonged to MMGS-II Grade\n\n(Middle Management Grade Scale). Sri K Chandrasekhar was in senior\n\nmanagement grade and the petitioner was only in middle management\n\ngrade at the time of the alleged incidents. Though Sri T Bhuvan Mohan\n\nbelonged to a grade lesser than the petitioner at the time of the alleged\n\nincidents, the said individual was holding a more responsible position in\n\nthe organization as a Branch Manager, and the petitioner was only a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                         10</span>\n\n\nManager (Second-in-Charge) of SBH Moula Ali. The educational loan\n\nletters were issued by K Chandrasekhar and T Bhuvan Mohan and the\n\ncharge-sheet issued against the petitioner is apparently on the basis of\n\nthe statements made by K Chandrasekhar and T Bhuvan Mohan in the\n\npreliminary enquiry. It is not possible for the petitioner, who actually\n\nbelonged to a lower grade (Middle Management Grade Scale), to have\n\npressurized or coerced the said Bank Managers, who belonged to a\n\nhigher grade than him. Therefore, the said allegations are not\n\nattributable to the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">6.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nthe Disciplinary Authority has also initiated disciplinary proceedings\n\nagainst the said Branch Managers pertaining to the same set of\n\nallegations, however, taking a lenient view in respect of the said Branch\n\nManagers, imposed minor punishments against them, whereas in respect\n\nof   the   petitioner,   the   disciplinary   authority   imposed   the   major\n\npunishment of removal from service, which is illegal and violation of\n\nprinciples of natural justice. When it is admitted by the respondent\n\nauthorities that the purported fake loan sanction letters were authored\n\nby the respective Bank Managers, then the question of imposing the\n\nmajor punishment of removal from service on the petitioner is erroneous\n\nand wholly unjustified.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          11</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">7.    The Assistant General Manager, State Bank of Hyderabad, issued\n\nMemo dated 17.10.2016 to Sri K.

One PDF email attachment of sanction letter issued to Ms. P.Anusha\n         for Rs. 20.00 lakhs could be traced from the PC of the Branch\n         Manager.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      3. The inward mails received and outward/sent mails in this regard\n         have been deleted from the branch E-mail system.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">         The Branch Manager has sent the E-mail confirmations of having sanctioned\n         the educational loans on his own.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">8.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nthe 2nd respondent has relied solely on an e-mail dated 16.08.2016 by\n\none Nishidhar Reddy Borra, purported to be an educational consultant.\n\nThe said individual stated in the said e-mail that there were students\n\nwho possessed fake loan sanction letters issued by various branches of\n\nSBH and claimed that the said letters were prepared by the Branch\n\nManagers in collusion with their own middlemen, for which the students\n\nwho are beneficiaries of such letters, typically pay the Branch Manager a\n\nsum of about Rs.60,000/- for a loan sanction letter amounting to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         12</span>\n\n\nRs.20,00,000/-. For better appreciation, the relevant and important\n\nportion of the said e-mail has been extracted below:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        &quot;We have come across many education loan sanction letters from\n        various branches of the State Bank of Hyderabad.

These are fake loans and student or the parent has\n        not visited the branch ever. The middle men arrange these loan\n        letters in association with the bank managers. The consultant or the\n        student is only the user of such document. These fraud loans are\n        used for visa purpose.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           This modus operandi involved a few of the branch managers of\n        SBH and some of their agents. They are not education consultants\n        nor are the students directly. The student or the education consultant\n        is charged almost 2% to 3% of the loan amount for such document.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           13</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">          The student or the education consultant is only the user of such fraud\n          where as the actual fraud document preparation is done by the\n          branch mangers themselves along with a few of their associates.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">            I would request your officer to investigate the above branches and\n          punish the bank mangers and also the personal involved so that\n          more students don&#x27;t use them. There has been many instances of\n          students sent back to India due to such documents.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">            While I am aware that my allegations above are quite serious but\n          they are the facts and I have sufficient evidence for the same. There\n          are many genuine students from Hyderabad. But such instances\n          spoil the name of our city and genuine students are also affected and\n          immigration authorities label Hyderabad as a high risk area.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">9.    Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner contended that the\n\ncredentials of the said Nishidhar Reddy Borra are questionable. He is\n\nneither a government officer nor a bank employee.                Though the entire\n\ndisciplinary proceedings were based on his e-mail dated 16.08.2016, he\n\nneither deposed before the Inquiry nor did the respondent authorities\n\nattempt    to   contact    him     thereafter.    Hence,     imposing      the     major\n\npunishment of removal from service on the petitioner solely on the basis\n\nof the said e-mail is wholly unjustifiable. The said e-mail only mentions\n\nthe names of some Branches and Branch Managers.                           There is no\n\nreference to the petitioner&#x27;s name in the e-mail dated 16.08.2016.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">10.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further contended that\n\nthe imposition of punishment by the disciplinary authority has not been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    14</span>\n\n\ndone in a fair and impartial manner. The respondent authorities were\n\nprejudiced against the petitioner and he has been made a scapegoat,\n\nwhen the Branch Managers were let off with lesser punishments.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">11.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that\n\nadmittedly, even as per the charge-memo issued against the petitioner,\n\nthere is no pecuniary loss to the bank at all; and only sanction letters\n\nwere issued. Further, the sanction letters were not prepared by the\n\npetitioner, and they are pre-printed sanction letters authorized by the\n\nBranch Managers. The disciplinary authority targeted only the petitioner\n\nowing to his position as a pro-active executive member of e-SBH Officers\n\nAssociation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">12.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner further contended that\n\nthe disciplinary proceedings were conducted based on mere conjectures\n\nand surmises of the Inquiring Authority. There was no monetary loss\n\ncaused to the respondent Bank, and therefore, to hold the petitioner\n\nguilty of misconduct and imposing the punishment of removal from\n\nservice, when the Branch Managers who actually authored the sanction\n\nletters were let off with minor punishments, is highly prejudicial to the\n\npetitioner. Further, under the impugned order, the appellate authority\n\nhas failed to consider the above facts and has mechanically rejected the\n\nappeal without going into the reasons thereof.    Therefore, appropriate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     15</span>\n\n\norders be passed in the writ petition by setting aside the impugned order\n\nand allow the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">13.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents filed a\n\ncounter affidavit denying the allegations made by the petitioner. Learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the respondents authorities submitted that the\n\nentire case has to be looked into on three aspects, viz. illegality in\n\ndecision making, irregularity and proportionality.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">14.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent authorities\n\nsubmitted that the e-mail by Sri Nishidhar Reddy Borra dated\n\n16.08.2016, was merely the starting point for initiating a preliminary\n\nenquiry into the allegations of issuance of fake loan sanction letters,\n\nwherein it was alleged that certain students who had been issued such\n\nletters had obtained it without proper documents or eligibility. It is\n\nincorrect to state that the said e-mail was the only evidence relied upon\n\nby the Inquiring Authority to find the petitioner to be guilty of\n\nmisconduct. A perusal of the domestic inquiry proceedings held on\n\n15.09.2018, 01.10.2018, 08.10.2018 and 09.10.2018 would show that\n\nthe same was conducted in an elaborate manner, with 19 Prosecution\n\nExhibits amounting to 139 pages and 2 pen drives being presented,\n\napart from four witnesses being examined. Further, it is incorrect to state\n\nthat the petitioner merely issued business leads to Sri T Bhuvan Mohan\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                     16</span>\n\n\nand Sri K. Chandrasekhar, Branch Managers. The petitioner&#x27;s actions\n\namounted to pressurizing and influencing the said Branch Managers, as\n\nwas clearly shown through the deposition of Sri Bhuvan Mohan,\n\nexamined as PW-4 in the domestic inquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">15.   Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities vehemently\n\ncontended that the petitioner had repeatedly attempted to influence and\n\npressurize Sri T Bhuvan Mohan and Sri K Chandrasekhar, owing to his\n\nclout as the active executive member of the e-SBH Officers&#x27; Association,\n\nand pressured them to issue the said sanction letters to fake educational\n\nloan borrowers. The said act of the petitioner resulted in the loss of\n\nreputation to the Bank, the sovereign nation, and prejudiced the\n\nstudents&#x27; future. It need not be proved that the said act of the petitioner\n\nnecessarily resulted in any monetary loss to the bank, when it is clear\n\nthat the petitioner indulged in conduct unbecoming of a bank official.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">16.   Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities further\n\nstated that the evidence presented before the disciplinary authority\n\ninclude the transcript of the mobile conversations between Sri T Bhuvan\n\nMohan and the petitioner. The transcript of these audio recordings point\n\nout to the fact that the petitioner has attempted to coerce Sri T Bhuvan\n\nMohan into issuing the said fake sanction letters. Further, it also points\n\nout to the fact that Sri T Bhuvan Mohan expresses gratitude to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                          17</span>\n\n\npetitioner for helping him get transferred to Hyderabad and that he\n\nissued the said fake sanction letters only because of his affection towards\n\nthe petitioner. It further shows that the petitioner repeatedly advised\n\nSri T Bhuvan Mohan to not disclose the name of the petitioner to the\n\nofficers from the Vigilance or the Personnel Department.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">17.   The conversation between Sri T.Bhuvan Mohan, Branch Manager\n\nand the petitioner dated 19.08.2016 has been extracted below:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">         Bhuvan :- Leave about consultancy. One thing Sir, I do not know\n         whether other branch people have issued with a malafide intention,\n         like cash or kind. But, if everybody treats me like that, that will be\n         the biggest insult for me.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">         Bhuvan :- You helped me a lot while I was in distress, while I was\n         suffering with ill-health. You are really a God for me, as you helped\n         me in getting transferred to Hyderabad, I could do this only because\n         of the respect towards you. I obeyed your word only because of the\n         affection towards you, otherwise, I could ever never do such things.\n         You believe it or not, so many people came to me for the same\n         purpose, but I refused reluctantly. I worked with utmost honesty,\n         but, only the reason behind this is you.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">         PTM :- Please don&#x27;t reveal my name with Ravi Kiran and in any\n         pressure. Unncessarily, it will become a problem. Please disclose my\n         name with nobody. Even if any body pressurizes, you also please do\n         not disclose my name.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">18.   Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities further\n\ncontended    that   both    disciplinary      proceedings     and    the    appellate\n\nproceedings were conducted in due adherence to the principles of natural\n\njustice and in consonance with the service regulations, as applicable to\n\nthe petitioner. Further, the conclusions arrived therein were based on\n\nboth oral and documentary evidence produced by both parties during the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                     18</span>\n\n\ncourse of the enquiry.

Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities also\n\ncontended that it is now well settled that the courts shall not act as an\n\nappellate court and reassess the evidence led in the domestic enquiry,\n\nnor interfere on the ground that another view is possible on the material\n\non record. If the enquiry has been fairly and properly held and the\n\nfindings are based on evidence, then the question of adequacy of the\n\nevidence or the reliable nature of the evidence will not be grounds for\n\ninterfering with the findings in departmental enquiries.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">20.   Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities further\n\ncontended that the petitioner, with no regard to the fact that he was a\n\nresponsible officer in the Bank, had committed grave irregularities by\n\ninfluencing and pressurizing the Branch Managers of Green Park Colony\n\nBranch and Pendergast Road Branch, and was instrumental in getting\n\nthe sanction letters issued to fake education loan borrowers. The\n\ncontentions raised by the petitioner are totally illogical and superfluous.\n\nTherefore, the appellate authority has rightly rejected the appeal vide the\n\nimpugned order. As such, there are no grounds to interfere with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                   19</span>\n\n\nimpugned orders passed by the respondent authorities.

Per contra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner, in\n\nsupport of his contentions with regard to judicial intervention in\n\ndisciplinary proceedings, relied upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/163837917/\" id=\"a_1\">United Bank Of India Vs.

That the Division Bench\n         conducted the kind of scrutiny that it did, cannot be a factor to hold its\n         decision erroneous. In this context, it would be worth recollecting Bernard\n         Schwartz [ In Administrative Law, 2nd Edn., p. 584.] that judicial review\n         of administrative decisions: warrants a minimum level of scrutiny:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">         &quot;If the scope of review is too broad, agencies are turned into little more\n         than media for the transmission of cases to the courts.

At the same time, the scope of judicial enquiry must not be so\n         restricted that it prevents full enquiry into the question of legality. If that\n         question cannot be properly explored by the judge, the right to review\n         becomes meaningless. It makes judicial review of administrative orders a\n         hopeless formality for the litigant. ...

An interesting side is this -- Shri Madan Mohan Saha, who\n         confessed to the misconduct, was charged and proceeded with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">1</span>\n    2022 (13) SCC 329\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                            20</span>\n\n\n      departmentally.

A reading of the\n      disciplinary authority&#x27;s order reveals that his past record of minor\n      misconduct played a major role in determining his guilt, despite lack of\n      evidence, and the extreme penalty of dismissal.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"102405424\" id=\"span_21\">22.

In the\n\n      considered opinion of this Court, the Tribunal for Disciplinary Proceedings\n\n      thoroughly failed in appreciating the evidence available on record from\n\n      proper perspective and came to the conclusions without there being any\n\n      foundation and basis.

Further, the disciplinary authority has\n               reversed the findings on Charges 3 and 5 without giving an\n               opportunity to the appellant to show cause in the matter, and\n               thereafter, the order of removal was passed by the appointing\n               authority on the advice of the CVO vide his opinion dated 1-2-2006\n               and further it is brought on record that similarly placed person,\n               namely, Mr Pradeep Kumar Das, the Manager of Hallydayganj\n               Branch, who has loaned the loan to one Mr Tapan Kumar Sangma, in\n               his case they have imposed lesser punishment of withholding on\n               increment thereby making discrimination in differently treating the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">5</span>\n    (2015) 15 SCC 184\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                           25</span>\n\n\n         appellant herein, which is violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\n         India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">28.   In the instant case, an e-mail by one Nishidhar Reddy Borra\n\ntriggered the entire disciplinary proceedings, wherein the role of a few\n\nBank Managers in issuing fake pre-printed loan sanction letters was\n\nalleged. The respondent authorities conducted the domestic enquiry,\n\nwhere the petitioner&#x27;s name was adduced by the respondent authorities\n\nby virtue of the depositions of PWs 2 and 4, which led to the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nremoval from service. However, the manner of imposing the punishments\n\nwith regard to the PWs-2 and 4, who have admitted to the act of\n\nsanctioning   the    purported      letters, is surprising.         The    self-serving\n\ndepositions of PWs 2 and 4 seem to have played a significant role in\n\nconvincing the disciplinary authority that they deserved a differential\n\ntreatment in imposing punishments, as against the petitioner, who was\n\nsquarely removed from service. As such, it is apparent that the\n\nrespondent authorities have not maintained parity while imposing\n\npunishments on all the co-delinquents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">29.

The impugned order, by any standard of measure, does not appear\n\nto be a Speaking Order. The appellate authority seems to have\n\nmechanically reproduced the findings of the disciplinary authority. Such\n\nan indifferent attitude taken by the appellate authority frustrates the\n\ncause of justice. When an appeal is preferred, an appellate authority\n\nought to appreciate the evidence examined by the Inquiring Authority\n\nand look into the aspect of whether the charges made out against the\n\ndelinquent officer could be reasonably inferred on the basis of such\n\nevidence. Additionally, it must render its independent findings and\n\nrecord the reasons for either considering or rejecting the appeal.\n\nAppellate proceedings are not to be conducted hastily, without going into\n\nthe appellant&#x27;s contentions, or without going into the detailed reasons\n\nand rationale behind the rejection of such appeal. The learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner has rightly relied upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court (6th supra) in contending that the impugned order dated\n\n18.07.2019 does not assign any reasons or rationale behind its findings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">32.

When an inquiry is conducted on charges of\nmisconduct by a public servant, the Court/Tribunal is concerned to\ndetermine whether the inquiry was held by a competent officer or\nwhether rules of natural justice are complied with. Whether the findings\nor conclusions are based on some evidence, the authority entrusted with\nthe power to hold inquiry has jurisdiction, power and authority to reach a\nfinding of fact or conclusion. But that finding must be based on some\nevidence. Neither the technical rules of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_17\">Evidence Act</a> nor of proof of fact or\nevidence as defined therein, apply to disciplinary proceeding. When the\nauthority accepts    that evidence and conclusion receives support\ntherefrom, the disciplinary authority is entitled to hold that the delinquent\nofficer is guilty of the charge. The Court/Tribunal in its power of judicial\nreview does not act as appellate authority to reappreciate the evidence\nand to arrive at its own independent findings on the evidence. The\nCourt/Tribunal may interfere where the authority held the proceedings\nagainst the delinquent officer in a manner inconsistent with the rules of\nnatural justice or in violation of statutory rules prescribing the mode of\ninquiry or where the conclusion or finding reached by the disciplinary\nauthority is based on no evidence. If the conclusion or finding be such as\nno reasonable person would have ever reached, the Court/Tribunal may\ninterfere with the conclusion or the finding, and mould the relief so as to\nmake it appropriate to the facts of each case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">13. The disciplinary authority is the sole judge of facts. Where appeal is\npresented, the appellate authority has coextensive power to re-appreciate\nthe evidence or the nature of punishment.

The scope of judicial review is\n                limited to the deficiency in decision-making process and not the\n                decision.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1854374\" id=\"span_45\">14. A bank officer is required to exercise higher standards of\n                honesty and integrity. He deals with the money of the depositors and\n                the customers. Every officer/employee of the bank is required to take\n                all possible steps to protect the interests of the bank and to discharge\n                his duties with utmost integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence and\n                to do nothing which is unbecoming of a bank officer. Good conduct\n                and discipline are inseparable from the functioning of every\n                officer/employee of the bank. As was observed by this Court\n                in <a href=\"/doc/1854374/\" id=\"a_20\">Disciplinary Authority-cum-Regional Manager v. Nikunja Bihari</a>\n\n\n10 10\n        [2003 (4) SCC 364]\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                              32</span>\n\n\n           Patnaik [(1996) 9 SCC 69 : 1996 SCC (L&amp;S) 1194] it is no defence\n           available to say that there was no loss or profit resulted in case,\n           when the officer/employee acted without authority. The very\n           discipline of an organization more particularly a bank is dependent\n           upon each of its officers and officers acting and operating within their\n           allotted sphere. Acting beyond one&#x27;s authority is by itself a breach of\n           discipline and is a misconduct. The charges against the employee\n           were not casual in nature and were serious. These aspects do not\n           appear to have been kept in view by the High Court.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">36.   This Court is conscious of the fact that the High Court, while\n\nexercising      its   jurisdiction    under       <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_21\">Article   226</a>   while   dealing     with\n\ndisciplinary proceedings, should restrict itself to the Wednesbury Test\n\nand not interfere in the orders of a disciplinary authority, which is quasi-\n\njudicial   in     nature,    unless    the        punishment      imposed    is   grossly\n\ndisproportionate to the charges levelled. Though the learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the respondent authorities is right in contending that a Writ\n\nCourt has no jurisdiction to re-appreciate the evidence when the\n\nquantum of punishment is rightly imposed, in the present case, the\n\ndisparity in the imposition of punishments would require judicial review.\n\nAs such, the above judgments are now well established principles of law,\n\nwhich do not warrant any specific re-emphasis in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">37.   This court, having considered the rival submissions made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the respective parties, is of the considered view that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     33</span>\n\n\nthe charges levelled against the petitioner pertain to his alleged role in\n\ngetting issued educational loan sanction letters to fake borrowers by\n\ninfluencing the Branch Managers of SBH Penderghast Road, Hyderabad\n\nand SBH Green Park Colony, Hyderabad. The initiation of preliminary\n\ninquiry was on the basis of an e-mail dated 16.08.2016 of one Nishidhar\n\nReddy Borra, who informed the respondent Bank about purported fake\n\nloan sanction letters, following which, the role of Sri T Bhuvan Mohan\n\nand Sri K Chandrasekhar, who were the Branch Managers of State Bank\n\nof Hyderabad Penderghast Road, Hyderabad and Green Park Colony,\n\nHyderabad, respectively, came to light. The said Branch Mangers\n\ndeposed before the Inquiring Authority, revealing the name of the\n\npetitioner about his purported role of influencing them in getting issued\n\nthe said letters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">38.   A perusal of the transcript shows that the recordings which have\n\nbeen presented as PEX 13/2 to PEX 13/3 by the P.O. in the domestic\n\ninquiry proceedings pertain to the purported conversations that the\n\npetitioner had with PW-4 Sri Bhuvan Mohan, who categorically deposed\n\nthat the said conversations were held in the context of issuance of\n\nsanction letters, where the petitioner, through one Mr. Sagar, had\n\napproached PW-4 with pre-prepared sanction letters, which PW-4 signed\n\nand delivered back to Mr. Sagar. It also goes to show that the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                        34</span>\n\n\nrepeatedly urged PW-4 Sri Bhuvan Mohan to not reveal the name of the\n\npetitioner, and that the Association would not come to the rescue of PW-\n\n4 in case he reveals any names.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">39.   This Court finds it surprising that though the disciplinary\n\nproceedings were initiated based on the e-mail dated 16.08.2016, the\n\nname of the petitioner was not mentioned in the said e-mail. Further, the\n\nrespondent authorities have not made any attempt to either contact or\n\nexamine the sender of the E-mail, Nishidhar Reddy Borra, and neither\n\nwas the petitioner given any chance to cross-examine him. This lapse\n\nhas not been addressed in the impugned appellate order dated\n\n18.07.2019. This Court is not inclined to agree with the view expressed\n\nby the learned counsel for the respondent authorities that the deposition\n\nor examination     of   the   said   Nishidhar   Reddy Borra    was of   no\n\nconsequence.    While it has been held several times in a catena of\n\ndecisions by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court that disciplinary proceedings need\n\nnot require strict standards of proof beyond all reasonable doubt, and\n\nthe only test is the preponderance of probability, the same has to be\n\nanswered by following the Wednesbury Test, namely:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      A) Have relevant facts not been taken into consideration?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      B) Have irrelevant facts been taken into consideration?\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                        35</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      C) Is the conclusion drawn so inappropriate that no reasonable\n\n      person could have arrived at such a conclusion?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">40.   This Court is of the considered view that Sri Nishidhar Reddy\n\nBorra, who was the author of the e-mail dated 16.08.2016, ought to have\n\nbeen examined by the Inquiring Authority, which would have lent more\n\ncredence to the disciplinary proceedings instituted against the petitioner.\n\nDenying an opportunity to the petitioner to cross-examine the said\n\nperson amounts to a procedural lapse which would warrant the\n\ninterference of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">41.   <a href=\"/doc/1610983/\" id=\"a_22\">Regulation 50</a> of the State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service\n\nRegulations, 1979 reads as follows :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      &quot;(4)   Every Officer shall, at all times take all possible steps to\n      ensure and protect the interests of the Bank and discharge his\n      duties with utmost integrity, honesty, devotion and diligence and\n      do nothing which is unbecoming of an officer.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">      Every Officer shall maintain good conduct and discipline and show\n      courtesy and attention to all persons in all transactions and\n      negotiations.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">42.   Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent authorities, while\n\nrightly contending that Bank Officials ought to maintain the highest\n\nstandards of integrity and probity as they deal with public money, has\n\nsurprisingly not dealt with the Bank Managers (PWs-2 and 4), in an\n\nequally stringent manner. It is strange to note that the person holding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                      36</span>\n\n\nthe position of a Bank Manager can so easily be influenced and\n\npressurized so as to go to the extent of issuing fake loan sanction letters\n\nmerely on the apprehension that the petitioner is an influential executive\n\nmember of the e-SBH Officers&#x27; Association. If such were indeed the case,\n\nthen every Branch Manager would start succumbing to the pressures of\n\nthe employees&#x27; unions and act in a manner which is prejudicial to the\n\ninterest of the banks, only to protect their personal interest. A perusal of\n\nthe transcript of the audio recordings of the conversation between the\n\npetitioner and PW-4 Sri T Bhuvan Mohan also shows that PW-4 is seen\n\nto be expressing gratitude to the petitioner for helping him in getting\n\ntransferred to Hyderabad, and affection he had towards the petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">43.   This Court considers such behaviour to be unbecoming of an\n\nOfficer holding the post of a Bank Manager. The act of issuing the loan\n\nsanction letters has seemingly been done as a quid pro quo for the help\n\nrendered by the petitioner to Sri T Bhuvan Mohan for getting him\n\ntransferred to Hyderabad, by virtue of his position as the member of e-\n\nSBH Officers&#x27; Association. As such, this Court is unable to understand\n\nthe preferential attitude shown by the respondent authorities to the co-\n\ndelinquent Bank Managers by imposing lesser punishments on them.\n\nThere is merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                            37</span>\n\n\nthat with respect to the imposing of punishments, there ought to be\n\nparity in dealing with co-delinquents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">44.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner has rightly relied upon\n\nthe judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court (5th supra), wherein it was held\n\nthat while it was not essential for the disciplinary authority to hold the\n\nco-delinquents to be guilty of identical charges, parity is to be\n\nmaintained while imposing punishments on such co-delinquents, who\n\nare similarly placed. As such, the respondent bank has failed to satisfy\n\nthis Court regarding the parity of punishments imposed on the\n\npetitioner, Sri T Bhuvan Mohan and Sri K Chandrasekhar. Further, the\n\nappeal proceedings appear to be a namesake exercise undertaken by the\n\nappellate authority, as no reasoning or rationale has been given for\n\nrejecting   the   petitioner&#x27;s     appeal,      in   the   impugned      order       dated\n\n18.07.2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">45.   The punishments imposed on the other Branch Managers are as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      &quot;Sri T Bhuvan Mohan : Reduction to a lower stage in the time scale of\n      pay by one stage(s) for a period of one year(s) with further direction that\n      the officer will not earn increments to pay during the rigor of such\n      reduction and on the expiry of such period the reduction will have effect of\n      postponing the future increments of his pays as provided for in Regulation\n      No.67(f) of State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service Rules, 1979&quot;; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                           38</span>\n\n\n      &quot;Sri K.Chandrasekhar: Reduction to a lower stage in the time scale of\n      pay by three stages for a period of two years with further direction that\n      the officer will not earn increments to pay during the rigor of such\n      reduction and on the expiry of such period the reduction will have effect\n      of postponing the future increments of his pays as provided for in\n      Regulation No.67(f) of State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service Rules,\n      1979&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">46.   While the said Branch Managers who are co-delinquents were let\n\noff with a mere reduction of time scale of pay, the petitioner was imposed\n\nthe major penalty of &quot;Removal from Service&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/884542/\" id=\"a_23\">Regulation 67(i)</a> of the\n\nRegulations. It is distinctly obvious that the petitioner was meted out\n\nsuch a stringent treatment owing to him being an executive member of\n\nthe officers&#x27; union. This Court is of the firm view that such a prejudicial\n\nattitude by the Disciplinary Authority impairs the cause of justice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">47.   It is apparent that the said sanction letters were not prepared by\n\nthe petitioner, but were pre-printed and consequently signed by the Bank\n\nManagers. Therefore, the attitude of the disciplinary authority in treating\n\nthe petitioner with a differential lens shows bias, and is therefore\n\nviolative of the principles of natural justice.             This Court is of the\n\nconsidered view that the Bank Managers should not succumb to the\n\npressures and clout of unions and associations. Associations are welfare\n\nbodies, which are established with the sole purpose of advocating and\n\nadvancing the employees&#x27; rights, and at no cost should they be deemed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                      39</span>\n\n\nas external centers of power which influence the business decisions of\n\nbanks. If such a situation were to arise, then the public would lose faith\n\nin the established channels of approaching the bank, which would lend\n\nthe banking system in jeopardy, and would be a great disservice to the\n\nnation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">48.   In view of the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that the\n\npunishment imposed on the petitioner is highly disproportionate and\n\ndisparate with the co-delinquents. Therefore, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered view that it is just and proper to direct the petitioner to make\n\na fresh representation before the respondent authorities to impose any\n\nlesser punishment other than that of &quot;dismissal&quot; and &quot;removal from\n\nservice&quot; in terms of the State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers) Service\n\nRegulations, 1979.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">49.   Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of directing the petitioner\n\nto make a fresh representation before the respondent authorities for\n\nimposing any lesser punishment other than that of &quot;dismissal&quot; and\n\n&quot;removal from service&quot; in terms of the State Bank of Hyderabad (Officers)\n\nService Regulations, 1979 within a period of four (04) weeks from the\n\ndate of receipt of a copy of this order. On such representation being\n\nmade, the respondent authorities are directed to consider the same and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                      40</span>\n\n\npass appropriate orders in accordance with law, within a period of eight\n\n(08) weeks thereafter. No order as to costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">     Pending Miscellaneous petitions, if any, shall stand closed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">                                    _____________________________________\n                                    NAMAVARAPU RAJESHWAR RAO, J\n\nDate: 03.05.2024\nL.R.copy to be marked\n     (B/o)\n      Prv\n </p>","numcites":20,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Telangana High Court","citetid":126251749,"divtype":"judgments","courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
