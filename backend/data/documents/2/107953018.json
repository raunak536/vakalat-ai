The petitioner has impugned before us the orders\n\ndated 29th October, 2009, 18th December, 2009 and 24th\n\nFebruary, 2010, which directed interception of telephone calls by\n\nrespondent No.2 on the ground of       being ultra vires of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (for short &quot;the Act&quot;), non-\n\ncompliance of Rules made thereunder, and for being in violation\n\nof the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part-III of the\n\nConstitution of India.

The right to privacy-by itself-has not been\n          identified under the Constitution. As a concept it may be\n          too broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether\n          right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in\n          a given case would depend on the facts of the said\n          case. But the right to hold a telephone conversation in\n          the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office without interference\n          can certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">          Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate\n          and confidential character. Telephone-conversation is a\n          part of modern man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important\n          that more and more people are carrying mobile\n          telephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone\n          conversation is an important facet of a man&#x27;s private\n          life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone-\n          conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office.\n          Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the\n          Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the\n          procedure established by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">          28.     <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act permits the interception\n          of messages in accordance with the provisions of the\n          said Section. &quot;Occurrence of any public emergency&quot; or\n          &quot;in the interest of public safety&quot; are the sine qua non.\n          for the application of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 5(2)</a> of\n          the Act.

Public emergency would mean the prevailing of\n          a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting the\n          people at large calling for immediate action. The\n          expression &quot;public safety&quot; means the state or condition\n          of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large.\n          When either of these two conditions are not in\n          existence, the Central Government or a State\n          Government or the authorised officer cannot resort to\n          telephone tapping even though there is satisfaction that\n          it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of\n          sovereignty and integrity of India etc. In other words,\n          even if the Central Government is satisfied that it is\n          necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the\n          sovereignty and integrity of India or the security of the\n          State or friendly relations with sovereign States or\n          public order or for preventing incitement to the\n          commission of an offence, it cannot intercept the\n          messages or resort to telephone tapping unless a public\n          emergency has occurred or the interest of public safety\n          or the existence of the interest of public safety requires.\n          Neither the occurrence of public emergency nor the\n          interest of public safety are secretive conditions or\n          situations. Either of the situations would be apparent to\n          a reasonable person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">          29.     The first step under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act,\n          therefore, is the occurrence of any public emergency of\n          the existence of a public-safety interest. Thereafter the\n          competent authority under Section 5(2) of the Act is\n          empowered to pass an order of interception after\n          recording its satisfaction that it is necessary or\n          expedient so to do in the interest of (i) sovereignty and\n          integrity of India, (ii) the security of the State, (iii)\n          friendly relations with foreign States, (iv) public order or\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">          (v) for preventing incitement to the commission of an\n          offence. When any of the five situations mentioned\n          above to the satisfaction of the competent authority\n          require then the said authority may pass the order for\n          interception of messages by recording reasons in writing\n          for doing so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">patilsr                                                              5/ 37</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                                                         wp-2367 of 19(J).doc\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">          30.     The above analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act\n          shows that so far the power to intercept\n          messages/conversations is concerned the Section\n          clearly lays-down the situations/conditions under which\n          it can be exercised.

The said procedure itself must be just, fair\n          and reasonable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_8\">It has been settled by this Court in\n          <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_16\">Maneka Gandhi v.

But the Court was not inclined to\n          require prior judicial scrutiny before intercepting telephone\n          conversations. The Court ruled that it would be necessary to lay\n          down procedural safeguards for the protection of the right to\n          privacy of a person until Parliament intervened by framing rules\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 7</a> of the Telegraph Act.

The right to privacy--by itself--has not been identified\n          under the Constitution. As a concept it may be too broad\n          and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy\n          can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would\n          depend on the facts of the said case. But the right to hold a\n          telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or\n          office without interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right\n          to privacy&quot;. Conversations on the telephone are often of an\n          intimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation\n          is a part of modern man&#x27;s life. It is considered so important\n          that more and more people are carrying mobile telephone\n          instruments in their pockets. Telephone conversation is an\n          important facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy\n          would certainly include telephone conversation in the\n          privacy of one&#x27;s home or office. Telephone-tapping would,\n          thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it is\n          permitted under the procedure established by law.&quot;\n\n\n          The Court then went on to apply <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 17</a> of the\n          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966\n          which recognizes the right to privacy and also referred to\n          <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\n          1948 which is in the same terms. It then imported these\n          international law concepts to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21</a> in\n          accordance with these concepts.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_25\">10.

There was no element of coercion\n                or compulsion in attaching the tape recorder to the\n                telephone.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_30\">This Court followed the same line of reasoning as it had in Kharak\n          Singh while rejecting a privacy based challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21.</a>\n          Significantly, the Court observed that : (<a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_75\">R.M.Malkani</a> Case, SCC p.\n          479, para 31)\n\n                 &quot;31. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 21</a> was invoked by submitting that the privacy\n                 of the appellant&#x27;s conversation was invaded. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 21</a>\n                 contemplates procedure established by law with regard to\n                 deprivation of life or personal liberty. The telephone\n                 conversation of an innocent citizen will be protected by\n                 Courts against wrongful or high handed interference by\n                 tapping the conversation. The protection is not for the\n                 guilty citizen against the efforts of the police to vindicate\n                 the law and prevent corruption of public servants. It must\n                 not be understood that the Court will tolerate safeguards\n                 for the protection of the citizen to be imperilled by\n                 permitting the police to proceed by unlawful or irregular\n                 methods.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">          In other words, it was the targeted and specific nature of the\n          interception which weighed with the Court, the telephone tapping\n          being directed at a guilty person. Hence the Court ruled that the\n          telephone conversation of an innocent citizen will be protected\n          against wrongful interference by wiretapping.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                                                 [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_31\">11.              Evidently, the nine Judge Bench was of the view that\n\nthe judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_78\">R.M. Malkani</a> (supra) follows the same line of\n\nreasoning as it held in Kharak Singh (supra), as attaching tape\n\nrecorder to the telephone was not considered as invasion of\n\nfundamental right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">patilsr                                                                    14/ 37</span>\n                                                                wp-2367 of 19(J).doc\n\n\nof India.</span> Kharak Singh (supra) has now been overruled.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">          The 9 Judge Constitution Bench further held that :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">              &quot;265. But the important point to note is that when a right is\n              conferred with an entrenched constitutional status in Part III, it\n              provides a touchstone on which the validity of executive decision\n              making can be assessed and the validity of law can be\n              determined by judicial review.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">              313.    Privacy has been held to be an intrinsic element of the\n              right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 21</a> and as a\n              constitutional value which is embodied in the fundamental\n              freedoms embedded in Part III of the Constitution. Like the right to\n              life and liberty, privacy is not absolute. The limitations which\n              operate on the right to life and personal liberty would operate on\n              the right to privacy. Any curtailment or deprivation of that right\n              would have to take place under a regime of law. The procedure\n              established by law must be fair, just and reasonable. The law\n              which provides for the curtailment of the right must also be\n              subject to constitutional safeguards.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">              317.     .......... The first part of the decision in Kharak Singh which\n              invalidated domiciliary visits at night on the ground that they\n              violated ordered liberty is an implicit recognition of the right to\n              privacy. The second part of the decision, however, which holds\n              that the right to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\n              Constitution, is not reflective of the correct position. Similarly,\n              Kharak Singh&#x27;s reliance upon the decision of the majority in\n              Gopalan is not reflective of the correct position in view of the\n              decisions in Cooper and in Maneka. Kharak Singh to the extent\n              that it holds that the right to privacy is not protected under the\n              Indian Constitution is overruled.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">              325.    Like other rights which form part of the fundamental\n              freedoms protected by Part III, including the right to life and\n              personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 21</a>, privacy is not an absolute right.\n              A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to withstand the\n              touchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. In\n              the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a> an invasion of privacy must be justified\n              on the basis of a law which stipulates a procedure which is fair,\n              just and reasonable. The law must also be valid with reference to\n              the encroachment on life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21.</a> An\n              invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the three-fold\n              requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the existence of law;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">patilsr                                                                   15/ 37</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                                                              wp-2367 of 19(J).doc\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate state aim; and (iii)\n          proportionality which ensures a rational nexus between the\n          objects and the means adopted to achieve them.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">          ...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">          428.2           The right to privacy is inextricably bound up with all\n          exercises of human liberty - both as it is specifically enumerated\n          across Part III, and as it is guaranteed in the residue under Article\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">          21.

It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 21</a>, more than any of the\n          other Articles in the fundamental rights chapter, reflects each of\n          these constitutional values in full, and is to be read in consonance\n          with these values and with the international covenants that we\n          have referred to. In the ultimate analysis, the fundamental right of\n          privacy, which has so many developing facets, can only be\n          developed on a case to case basis. Depending upon the particular\n          facet that is relied upon, either <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> by itself or in\n          conjunction with other fundamental rights would get attracted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">          526.              But this is not to say that such a right is absolute.\n          This right is subject to reasonable regulations made by the State\n          to protect legitimate State interests or public interest. However,\n          when it comes to restrictions on this right, the drill of various\n          Articles to which the right relates must be scrupulously followed.\n          For example, if the restraint on privacy is over fundamental\n          personal choices that an individual is to make, State action can be\n          restrained under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 14</a> if it is arbitrary and\n          unreasonable; and under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 19(1) (a)</a> only\n          if it relates to the subjects mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 19(2)</a> and the tests\n          laid down by this Court for such legislation or subordinate\n          legislation to pass muster under the said Article. Each of the tests\n          evolved by this Court, qua legislation or executive action, under\n          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 14;</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 19(1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">          (a) in the aforesaid examples must be met in order that State\n          action pass muster. In the ultimate analysis, the balancing act that\n          is to be carried out between individual, societal and State interests\n          must be left to the training and expertise of the judicial mind.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">patilsr                                                                 16/ 37</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">                                                                wp-2367 of 19(J).doc\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">          568.      Similarly, I also hold that the &quot;right to privacy&quot; has\n          multiple facets, and, therefore, the same has to go through a\n          process of case-to-case development as and when any citizen\n          raises his grievance complaining of infringement of his alleged\n          right in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">          578. It is not India alone, but the world that recognises the right of\n          privacy as a basic human right. The Universal Declaration of\n          Human Rights to which India is a signatory, recognises privacy as\n          an international human right. The importance of this right to\n          privacy cannot be diluted and the significance of this is that the\n          legal conundrum was debated and is to be settled in the present\n          reference by a nine-Judges Constitution Bench.\n\n\n          Test : Principle of proportionality and legitimacy\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">           638. The concerns expressed on behalf of the petitioners arising\n           from the possibility of the State infringing the right to privacy can\n           be met by the test suggested for limiting the discretion of the\n           State:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                  &quot; (i) The action must be sanctioned by law;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                  (ii) The proposed action must be necessary in a\n           democratic society for a legitimate aim;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                 (iii) The extent of such interference must be\n           proportionate to the need for such interference;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                 (iv) There must be procedural guarantees against\n          abuse of such interference.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">          643.       The aforesaid aspect has been referred to for purposes\n          that the concerns about privacy have been left unattended for\n          quite some time and thus an infringement of the right of privacy\n          cannot be left to be formulated by the legislature.

However, if the findings are that directions are\n\nnot in accordance with the provisions, then Rule 419(A)(17)\n\nfurther provides for setting aside the directions and orders for\n\ndestruction of the copies of intercepted messages or class of\n\nmessages.
