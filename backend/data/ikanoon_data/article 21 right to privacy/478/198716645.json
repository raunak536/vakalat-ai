Key facts, necessary for the adjudication of this appeal are that\n\n    the appellant has instituted the petition under Section 13 of the Hindu\n\n\n\n    marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), for dissolution of\n\n    marriage by decree of divorce. The marriage between the appellant and the\n\n\n\n\n    respondent was solemnized on 25.1.1998, according to Hindu rites, customs\n\n\n\n\n\n    and ceremonies.                 The respondent along with her brother and sister\n\n    threatened the appellant to leave the job in Bhatinda. They compelled him to\n\n\n\n\n\n    stay in his native village. The appellant had no alternative but to accede to\n\n    the wishes of the respondent and her brother.

The appellant has\n\n    disowned the child. According to him, the entries made in Zonal Hospital,\n\n\n\n\n                                         of\n    Una were fabricated.

The brother of the respondent was running a\n\n    &#x27;Dhaba&#x27; at Una. He used to intimidate the appellant. According to him, the\n\n\n    respondent consumed some poisonous substance in order to implicate the\n\n    appellant and his family members in a false case. In his cross-examination,\n\n\n\n\n    he admitted that the appellant closed down his shop and his whereabouts\n\n    were not known to anyone. He feigned ignorance about the date or month\n\n\n\n\n\n    when the respondent consumed the poison.

She\n                       rt\n    advised her to call for her parents. The mother of the respondent took the\n\n    respondent with her.

Mr. Naresh Thakur, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant,\n\n    has argued that the respondent has treated his client with physical as well as\n\n    mental cruelty.

The stand taken by the appellant that the respondent used to force\n\n    him to live at Una would not constitute cruelty.

The appellant himself has opted for DNA test. The report of the\n\n    CFSL, Chandigarh is Ext. RY. According to the contents of the report, the\n\n    appellant was biological father of Master Samaksh Saini. The appellant has\n                        rt\n    admitted that at the time of filing of the petition, the respondent was living\n\n    with him at village Ishpur at the matrimonial home. The petition was filed on\n\n    22.8.2001 and the child was born on 2.2.2002, as per the birth certificate\n\n    Ext. RX.      The child was born during the continuance of valid marriage\n\n\n\n    between the appellant and the respondent.           The appellant has failed to\n\n    maintain the respondent. The respondent has approached RW-1 Shashi Bala\n\n\n\n\n    that the appellant was not looking after him and she was on the verge of\n\n\n\n\n\n    starvation.    In these circumstances, RW-1 Shashi Bala had advised the\n\n    respondent to call her parents.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1100461\" id=\"span_10\">16.

The       word &quot;cruelty&quot; has not been defined.\n                  Indeed it could not have been defined. It has been used in\n                  relation to human conduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct\n                  in relation    to or in respect     of matrimonial duties and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:46:18 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          6</span>\n\n\n\n\n              obligations. It is a course of conduct of one which is adversely\n              affecting the other. The cruelty may be mental or physical,\n              intentional or unintentional. If it is physical the court will have\n              no problem to determine it. It is a question of fact and degree.\n              If      it is mental       the problem presents difficulty. First,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              the enquiry must begin as to the nature of the cruel treatment.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">              Second, the impact of such treatment in the mind of the spouse.\n              Whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be\n              harmful or injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a\n\n\n\n\n\n              matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the\n              nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining\n              spouse.      There may, however, be cases where the conduct\n              complained of itself is bad enough and per        se unlawful or\n\n\n\n\n                                        of\n              illegal. Then the impact or the injurious effect on the other\n              spouse need not be enquired into or considered. In       such\n              cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is\n              proved or admitted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">              5.     It will be necessary to bear in mind that there has been\n                    rt\n              marked change in          the life around us. In matrimonial\n              duties and responsibilities in particular, we      find     a    sea\n              change. They are of varying degrees from house to house or\n\n              person to person. Therefore, when a spouse makes complaint\n              about the treatment of cruelty by the partner in life or\n              relations, the Court should not search for standard in life. A set\n              of facts stigmatised as cruelty in one case may not be so in\n              another case. The cruelty alleged may largely depend upon the\n\n\n              type of life the parties are accustomed to or their economic and\n              social conditions. It may also depend upon their culture and\n              human values to which           they attach importance. We, the\n              judges and lawyers, therefore, should not import our own\n\n\n\n\n              notions of life. We may not go in parallel with them. There\n              may be a generation gap between us and the         parties.        It\n              would be better if we keep aside our customs and manners. It\n\n\n\n\n\n              would be also better if we less depend upon precedents.\n              Because as Lord Denning said in Sheldon v. Sheldon, [1966]\n              2 All E.R. 257 (259) &quot;the categories of cruelty are not closed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">              Each case may be different. We deal with the conduct of human\n              beings who are not generally similar. Among the human beings\n              there is no limit to the kind of conduct which may constitute\n              cruelty.

No court in our considered view\n\n\n\n\n\n                should even attempt to give a comprehensive definition of mental\n                cruelty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                99. Human mind is extremely complex and human behaviour\n                is equally complicated.

What is cruelty in one case\n                may not amount to cruelty in other case. The concept of cruelty\n                differs from person to person depending upon his upbringing,\n                level of sensitivity, educational, family and cultural background,\n                      rt\n                financial position, social status, customs, traditions, religious\n                beliefs, human values and their value system.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                100. Apart from this, the concept of mental cruelty cannot\n\n                remain static; it is bound to change with the passage of time,\n                impact of modern culture through print and electronic media and\n                value system etc. etc. What may be mental cruelty now may not\n                remain a mental cruelty after a passage of time or vice versa.\n                There can never be any strait-jacket formula or fixed parameters\n\n\n                for determining mental cruelty in matrimonial matters.          The\n                prudent and appropriate way to adjudicate the case would be to\n                evaluate it on its peculiar facts and circumstances while taking\n                aforementioned factors in consideration.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                101.

It may be true that there is no definition of cruelty\n                        under the said Act. Actually such a definition is not\n                        possible. In matrimonial relationship, cruelty would\n                        obviously mean absence of mutual respect and\n                        understanding between the spouses which embitters the\n                        relationship and often leads to various outbursts of\n                        behaviour which can be termed as cruelty. Sometime\n                        cruelty in a matrimonial relationship may take the form of\n                        violence, sometime it may take a different form. At times, it\n                        may be just an attitude or an approach.

The Petitioner/husband seeks annulment of marriage on the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 ground of pregnancy per alium i.e. concealed pregnancy. It is not\n                 the case of the husband that the wife was already pregnant at\n                 the time of marriage because that would be a ground for voiding\n                 the marriage by a decree of nullity under <a href=\"/doc/1882893/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 12(1)(d)</a> of the\n\n\n\n\n                                          of\n                 Act. A decree of divorce under <a href=\"/doc/808094/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 13(1)(i)</a> of the Act can be\n                 obtained only on the ground that other party to the marriage,\n                 after solemnization of the marriage, had voluntary sexual\n                 intercourse with any person other t ban his or her spouse. In the\n                 instant case, the main emphasis for seeking a decree of divorce\n                      rt\n                 by the husband is on the admission contained in the statement of\n                 wife in her cross-examination that after marriage when the\n                 husband visited her parents&#x27; place between 8-1-86 to 12-1-86 the\n\n                 wife was in menstrual period and could not have conceived.\n                 Relying on the above part of the statement of the wife, the\n                 argument sought to be built up is that the wife became pregnant\n                 due to illegitimate sexual connection with a person outside the\n                 wed-lock sometime after 12-1-86 when the menstrual period\n\n\n                 might have been over. The rule of evidence contained in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n                 112</a> of the Evidence Act raises mandatory presumption that a\n                 child born during wedlock, no matter when the child could be\n                 begotten, is the legitimate issue of the husband of the mother. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"503124\" id=\"span_38\">The\n\n\n\n\n                 presumption can be dislodged by proof of non-access during the\n                 time of conception. The husband has admitted a consummation of\n                 marriage after it took place on 29-11-85 and also admitted access\n\n\n\n\n\n                 to each other between 29-11-85 to 12-1-1986. The child born on\n                 31-10-1986 could have been conceived as the husband and wife\n                 had access to each other between the above period.

Giving birth to\n                 a viable child after 28 weeks&#x27; duration of pregnancy is not\n                 biologically an improbable or impossible event.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                  9.

The Court below observed illegally that failure or\n         refusal to surrender to medical test will result in raising adverse\n         presumption against the party when in view of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 112</a> read\n\n\n\n\n\n         with <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 4</a> of the Evidence Act, every sort of evidence, other\n         than referred in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 112</a> is barred and closed including\n         presumptive circumstantial evidence under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 114</a> and\n         then the presumption cannot be raised under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 114</a> from\n         the failure to surrender. What evidence can be lead so that\n         conclusive presumption or doctrine of conclusive proof\n         under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 112</a> may not arise is of the fact that the parties to\n         marriage had no access to each other or occasion to have access\n         during the relevant period i.e., period when the child or person\n         concerned whose paternity or legitimacy in question was\n         conceived as per the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n         Act.

This rule of law based on the dictates of justice has\n                  always made the courts incline towards upholding the legitimacy\n                  of a child unless the facts are so compulsive and clinching as to\n                  necessarily warrant a finding that the child could not at all have\n\n\n\n\n                                            of\n                  been begotten to the father and as such a legitimation of the\n                  child would result in rank injustice, to the father.

The learned Single Judge of Bombay High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1864942/\" id=\"a_61\">Sunil Eknath\n\n    Trambake Vs. Leelavati Sunil Trambake</a> AIR 2006 Bombay 140 has held\n\n    that DNA test to prove paternity of child can be ordered only in exceptional\n\n\n    and deserving cases and if it is in the interest of child, it cannot be directed\n\n    as a matter of routine. The learned Single Judge has further held that order\n\n\n\n\n    directing DNA test of child to prove his paternity is not necessary and the\n\n    factum of paternity can be proved by other evidence also. The learned Single\n\n\n\n\n\n    Judge has held as under:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_58\">&quot;6.     Merely because either of the parties have disputed a factum\n                of paternity does not mean that the Court should direct DNA test or\n                such other test to resolve the controversy. The parties should be\n                directed to lead evidence to prove or disprove the factum of\n                paternity and only if the Court finds it impossible to draw an\n                inference or adverse inference on the basis of such evidence on\n                record or the controversy in issue cannot be resolved without DNA\n                test, it may direct DNA test and not otherwise. In other words, only\n                in exceptional and deserving cases, where such a test becomes\n                indispensable to resolve the controversy the Court can direct such\n                test. DNA test, in any case, cannot be directed as a matter of\n                routine. The Courts should record reasons as to how and why such\n                test in the case is necessary to resolve the controversy and is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 18:46:18 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                           21</span>\n\n\n\n\n                indispensable. That is necessary since a result of such test, in\n                matrimonial and succession cases, being negative will have an\n                effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an\n                unchaste women as noted <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_62\">inGoutam Kundu v. State of West\n                Bengal and Anr.</a> (1993) 3 SCC 418. That may also adversely affect\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   .</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">                the child psychologically. The Courts, however, should not hesitate\n\n\n\n\n\n                to direct DNA test if it is in the best interest of a child.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">                7.      In the present case, the respondent-wife is seeking DNA test\n                not in the interest of the child but in her own interest to establish\n\n\n\n\n\n                that the petitioner-husband lives in adultery and is, therefore, not\n                entitled for divorce. The learned Judge has not recorded the\n                reasons as to why DNA is indispensable and that the other\n                evidence produce on record is not sufficient to draw an inference or\n\n\n\n\n                                          of\n                adverse inference in favour or against either of the parties. In the\n                present case the documentary evidence in the form of birth\n                certificate and school record is already produced on record which,\n                according to the respondent, reflects that the petitioner and Meena\n                are parents of child - Rupesh. The learned Judge has not recorded\n                      rt\n                its opinion in respect of that evidence. I do not wish to express any\n                opinion on merits of the case. However, in my opinion, in the\n                absence of sufficient reasons for holding the DNA test necessary,\n\n                to resolve the controversy involved in the matter the impugned\n                order is liable to be set aside.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">    30.
