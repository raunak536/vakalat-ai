Vide order dated 17th September, 2018, the\ndefendants were directed to forthwith remove the material on the URLs\ndetails whereof were given by the plaintiff in the amended plaint.\n\n4.     It may be mentioned that that the plaintiff in the suit as originally\nfiled, though impleaded Facebook, Google and YouTube but not by their\ncorrect description or the correct entities thereof and owing whereto a\nnumber of applications were filed from time to time and substitution of\ndefendants ordered.\n\n5.     Facebook Inc. USA has filed a written statement, pleading (a) that\nFacebook Inc. is an ‗intermediary&#x27; as defined under <a href=\"/doc/152950270/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000 <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_5\">(IT Act</a>) and is omitted from any liability\narising from third party content posted to the Facebook Services as per\n<a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 79</a> of the IT Act; (b) that the said <a href=\"/doc/197312935/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 79(1)</a> has an overriding\neffect by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1039298/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 81</a> of the IT Act; (c) that Facebook Inc. as an\nintermediary has no role in sharing, transmitting, selecting the receiver of\nany transmission and/or selecting or modifying the information contained in\nany information of third party; (d) that there is no averment in the plaint\nregarding any failure of Facebook Inc. to comply with <a href=\"/doc/103684089/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 79(2)</a> or\n79(3) of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_10\">IT Act</a> and does not even allege that the protection under\n<a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 79</a> of the IT Act is not available to Facebook Inc.; (e) that as per the\ndicta of the Supreme Court in Shreya Singhal Vs. Union of India (2015) 5\nSCC 1, the liability of an intermediary arises only where the intermediary\nupon receiving actual knowledge from a valid Court order or otherwise, that\nunlawful acts relatable to <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India are going\nto be committed, fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to such\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 5 of 43\n material; (f) that an intermediary is not obliged to scan all information being\nhosted on its portal, for infringement of the rights of all those persons who\nhave at any point of time complained to the intermediary; (g) that every\nwebpage has a link address on the internet i.e. a Uniform Resource Locator\n(URL) which is a standarised device to identify and locate content and other\nresources located on the internet; (h) that the plaintiff, in the plaint has\nidentified only some of the impugned content by URL and out of which only\ntwo pertain to Facebook Inc. and which had since been actioned by\nFacebook Inc. in compliance with the order of this Court; it is otherwise\nimpractical for Facebook Inc. to locate or identify the remaining impugned\ncontent; (i) that Facebook Inc., as on 30th June, 2018, had over 2.23 billion\nactive users of its Facebook Service worldwide and every day billions of\npieces of content are posted and shared on the Facebook Service; it is\nimpractical and not possible for the Facebook Inc. to sift through all the\naforesaid content to find the content impugned by the plaintiff; (j) that\nFacebook Inc. is neither the author nor the publisher of any third party\ncontent including the content impugned in this suit; (k) that as per policy of\nFacebook Service, it has reporting tools available to report objectionable\ncontent on Facebook Service including potential violation of a person&#x27;s\nprivacy rights concerning their image on Facebook; if a person believes\ncontent available on Facebook Service to be violatable of his/her privacy\nrights, can report that content by using the online reporting tool; however\nFacebook Inc. is obliged to remove and disable access to only such content\nwhich has been directed by a Court order or by a notified Government\nagency to be removed; thus, even if any content is reported via online tool,\nFacebook Inc. as intermediary, would not be required to remove access to\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                    Page 6 of 43\n the same without a Court order or direction from an authorized Government\nagency; (l) that the suit thus as far as against Facebook Inc. is not\nmaintainable; (m) that there is no possibility of Facebook Inc. misusing,\ndistorting, disseminating or publishing the impugned content to the\ndetriment of the plaintiff; and, (n) that the other contents of the plaint are\ndenied.\n\n6.

on the Google Search Engine\nby an internet user; the plaintiff did not provide a specific URL for any\nspecific image result appearing on the said general search result page; (iv)\nthat the defendants No.2&amp;3 as per their policy disable any third party\ncontent from their platform if an appropriate direction is passed by the Court\ndirecting removal of such content by providing the specific URLs where the\nplaintiff&#x27;s right have been held to be violated; (v) however the plaintiff is\nnot entitled to any injunctions against the said defendants as sought and the\ninjunctions as sought are vague, excessive and incapable of being complied\nwith and also go contrary to the established principles of defamation law as\nwell as the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_13\">IT Act</a> and the Information Technology\n(Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011;

(viii) that the injunctions as sought would also\nimply a pre-publication restraint on all materials/contents available on the\ninternet that allegedly defame the reputation of the plaintiff and which\nwould be contrary to the settled law on pre-publication injunctions; (ix) that\nGoogle Search Engine is a free internet based search service using which\nany internet user can search for any pre-existing third party data and\nwebsites available on the internet; to do so, an internet user can type its\nsearch query in the ‗search box&#x27; and based on such a search query, the\nGoogle Search Engine indexes and links to third party websites and other\ninformation that either images or is relevant to the search query; (x) that the\ndefendant No.2 Google LLC merely performs the task of indexing\ninformation that is already available on independent third party websites that\nare beyond the control and supervision of defendant No.2;

Proprietors of Indian\nExpress Newspaper (1988) 4 SCC 592 do not apply to intermediaries as the\ndefendants No.2&amp;3 are.\n\n7.     No replications to the aforesaid written statements have been filed by\nthe plaintiff.\n\n8.     The suit came up before the undersigned on 14th January, 2019, when\nfinding that no person who according to the plaintiff is responsible for\nputting up the impugned content had been impleaded as defendant and\nfurther finding that no direction had been sought against Facebook Inc. or\nagainst Google LLC and YouTube LLC or against any other portal for\ndisclosing the identity of such person, it was observed that the plaintiff\ncannot fight a proxy battle without impleading the person who has posted\nthe impugned photographs and other content removal whereof was sought in\nthe plaint. The counsel for the plaintiff, on enquiry during the hearing on\n14th January, 2019, as to whom the plaintiff suspected, stated that the\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                   Page 10 of 43\n plaintiff does not suspect anyone and there are a lot of people inimical to the\nplaintiff because the plaintiff was a Member of Parliament from Rajya\nSabha. The counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing on 14th January,\n2019 handed over the photographs to which objection was taken in the suit.\nHowever on going through the same, it was prima facie observed that there\nwas nothing objectionable in the photographs. It was further observed in the\norder dated 14th January, 2019 that the order of removal of any content\nposted on the portals / e-platforms, cannot be made merely at the asking,\nwithout a case therefor being made out. It was enquired from the counsel\nfor the plaintiff, under which provision of law, the plaintiff was entitled to\nseek removal of the contents / photographs put up by others, even if found to\nbe objectionable. The counsel for the plaintiff appearing on 14 th January,\n2019 however only referred to the interim order dated 4th October, 2016 and\ncould not reply to the queries. Observing that the plaintiff, to be entitled to\nfinal relief was required to justify the interim order and could not shy away\nfrom answering the queries of the Court, on the request of the counsel for\nthe plaintiff, the hearing was adjourned to 27th February, 2019.\n\n9.     On 27th February, 2019, the counsel for the plaintiff was heard on the\nqueries contained in the order dated 14th January, 2019. The plaintiff along\nwith the plaint has only filed four photographs in a sealed envelope. The\nfirst photograph appeared to be from a newspaper or a click shot of a news\nchannel, in turn having three photo frames and one of which is of the\nplaintiff alone and the other two besides the plaintiff also depict a man in\nwhat appears to be a private garden of a house. The second photograph is\nagain of the plaintiff with the said man inside a room and also shows half\neaten food and an empty bottle of water. The third photograph is a repeat of\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                    Page 11 of 43\n one of the three frames in the first photograph i.e. of the plaintiff and the\nman in the private garden of a house. The fourth photograph is of the said\nman sitting on a chair and holding a cell phone with the plaintiff bending\nbehind him and pointing something in the phone, again in a private garden\nof a house. I may mention that none of the said photographs would classify\nas obscene or showing the plaintiff and the man in any compromising or\nscandalizing position, though indeed show both smiling and happy in the\ncompany of each other. At least in one of the frames of the first photograph,\nthe plaintiff and the man appear to be posing for the photograph though\nother photographs may fall in the genre of those taken without the\nknowledge of the plaintiff and the man. I may clarify that the plaintiff is\nfully clothed in all the photographs and the man, in two of the frames of the\nfirst photograph is bare chest but which is nothing out of ordinary in the\nState to which the plaintiff belongs.\n\n10.    The counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing on 27th February, 2019\nalso handed over a large number of other photographs on the URLs which\nvide interim order in the suit had been ordered to be blocked; however the\nsaid photographs were / have not been filed on record.              The said\nphotographs also however do not fall in the genre of obscene or having any\nsexual overtones.\n\n11.    The counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing on 27th February, 2019\nfurther informed, though again not pleaded, that the man shown in the\nphotographs along with the plaintiff belongs to Dravida Munnetra\nKazhagam (DMK) Party, a political rival of AIADMK Party to which the\nplaintiff belongs and is a member of; that the plaintiff is married to another\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                   Page 12 of 43\n person. The counsel for the plaintiff further fairly agreed that though the\nphotographs did not qualify as obscene but contended that they were in the\ncircumstances of the political rivalry and the plaintiff being married to\nanother man, qualify as defamatory and pose a threat to the membership of\nthe plaintiff of Rajya Sabha as a nominee of AIADMK. It was contended\nthat the photographs were not genuine. Alternatively, it was argued that the\nphotographs even if were held to be genuine and taken with the consent of\nthe plaintiff, uploading thereof on the social media platforms violated the\nprivacy of the plaintiff.\n\n12.    It was on 27th February, 2019 enquired from the counsel for the\nplaintiff that since it was the case of the plaintiff that the photographs were\nmorphed and were defamatory of the plaintiff because showed the plaintiff\nin the company of a man other than her husband and who was also her\npolitical rival, whether not the said man who also figured in the\nphotographs, removal whereof was sought, was a necessary party to the\npresent suit. It was enquired, whether not the man shown in the photographs\nhad an equal stake in removal or not wanting removal of the photographs\nand how could this Court direct removal equivalent to obliteration of\nphotographs showing persons other than the plaintiff, without hearing the\nsaid person/s.\n\n13.    Though the counsel for the plaintiff on 27th February, 2019 stated that\nhe did not think that the plaintiff would like to implead the said person as a\ndefendant to the suit but further stated that he would obtain instructions.\n\n14.    The factum of the plaintiff belonging to AIADMK Party, a regional\npolitical party of the State of Tamil Nadu and though as per own averments\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                     Page 13 of 43\n is widely known in the State of Tamil Nadu in comparison to Delhi, having\ninstituted this suit not in Tamil Nadu where the plaintiff has a reputation but\nin Delhi where the plaintiff does not enjoy the reputation as claimed to be\nenjoyed by her in Tamil Nadu also shows an attempt of the plaintiff to not\nallow the subject litigation itself to become news in Tamil Nadu and to\nsurreptitiously obtain the order for removal of undesirable content from the\ninternet.\n\n15.    It was on 27th February, 2019 further enquired from the counsel for\nthe plaintiff that since the plaintiff was a political person representing her\nState i.e. Tamil Nadu, in Rajya Sabha in Delhi, whether not the photographs\nconcerning her which are admittedly not obscene but are claimed to be\ndefamatory and showing her in the company of her political rival,\nconstituted information which public at large has a right to know about their\nrepresentatives in Parliament and how can the Court restrain such news from\nbeing disseminated.\n\n16.    The counsel for the plaintiff then again sought adjournment to obtain\ninstructions. I may however record that the aforesaid happenings during the\nhearing on 27th February, 2019 are not recorded in detail in the order dated\n27th February, 2019 as it was felt that if the plaintiff was choosing to not\npursue the present suit owing to the damage / further damage which it is\nlikely to cause to not only the matrimony but also to the political career of\nthe plaintiff, as appeared from the submissions made in the hearing, the said\ndamage should not be done by recording the same in the order of that date.\nWhile adjourning the hearing to 1st April, 2019, Mr. Arun Kathpalia, senior\ncounsel appearing for defendants No.2&amp;3 and which defendants were\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                    Page 14 of 43\n seeking their deletion, was requested to, besides appearing on behalf of\ndefendants No.2&amp;3, as an Amicus Curiae also assist this Court on the\nquestions which had arisen during the hearing.\n\n17.    The counsel for the plaintiff, on 1st April, 2019 stated that his\ninstructions were that the plaintiff did not want to implead the man also\nfiguring in the photographs removal of which is sought in the present suit.\nThe counsel for the plaintiff however stated that the plaintiff would make an\napplication to implead as John Doe the person who had uploaded the\nimpugned photographs on the internet and that the plaintiff, to prove that the\nphotographs were morphed, besides herself would examine an expert. It\nwas thus contended that an opportunity for leading evidence be granted.\nThe counsel for the plaintiff, during the hearing also drew attention to\nClause 3 of the Intermediary Guidelines but upon the senior counsel for the\ndefendants No.2&amp;3 pointing out that the same had been read down in\nShreya Singhal supra, did not press further on the said aspect.\n\n18.    The counsel for the plaintiff, on 1st February, 2019 also handed over a\ncompilation of:\n\n       (I)    my judgment dated 1st June, 2018 in CS(OS) No.291/2018\n       titled Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Facebook Inc., to contend\n       that therein ex-parte direction was issued to block the URLs\n       containing disparaging video, with further direction to block URLs\n       containing disparaging video or other content on intimation by the\n       plaintiff;\n\n       (II)   order dated 10th October, 2018 of this Court in CS(OS)\n       No.394/2018 titled Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.

Shetty Vs. Magna Publications Co. Ltd.

State of Tamil Nadu (1994) 6 SCC 632, to\n       contend that the same holds right to privacy to be implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article\n       21</a> of the Constitution of India and a citizen has a right to safeguard\n       the privacy of own, family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-\n       bearing etc. and that in matters not relevant to the discharge of duties,\n       a public officer enjoys the same protection as any other citizen;\n\n       (V)    Selvi J.

Thiru.     P.   Varadarajan\n       MANU/TN/2339/2018, to contend that the same, relying on Justice\n       K.S. Puttuswamy Vs. Union of India (2017) 10 SCC 1 case holds that\n       an individual has a right to protect reputation from being unfairly\n       harmed and that matters not related to the public life cannot be\n       published.\n\n19.    Per contra, the senior counsel for the defendants No.2&amp;3 again\nreferred to Shreya Singhal supra.\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 16 of 43\n 20.    Though part judgment qua the submissions made, was dictated in the\nCourt on 1st April, 2019 itself, but remained to be completed and is being\npronounced now.\n\n21.    I may at the outset record, that the a nine Judge Bench of the Supreme\nCourt in Justice K.S. Puttuswamy supra was constituted to determine\nwhether privacy is a constitutionally protected value. Prior thereto, the\nexistence of a fundamental right of privacy was in doubt in view of M.P.\nSharma        Vs.   Satish     Chandra,       District    Magistrate,      Delhi\nMANU/SC/0018/1954 and Kharak Singh Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\nMANU/SC/0085/1962 containing observations that the Indian Constitution\ndid not specifically protect the right to privacy. However, now the Nine\nJudge Bench has authoritatively held (i) that the right of privacy is a\nfundamental right; (ii) that it is a right which protects the inner sphere of the\nindividual from interference from both State and Non-state actors and allows\nthe individuals to make autonomous life choices; (iii) technology has made\nit possible to inter a citizen&#x27;s house without knocking at his/her door and\nthis is equally possible both by the State and Non-state actors; (iv) it is an\nindividual&#x27;s choice as to who enters his house, how he lives and in what\nrelationship; (v) that the privacy of the home must protect the family,\nmarriage, procreation and sexual orientation which are all important aspects\nof dignity; (vi) that if the individual permits someone to enter the house it\ndoes not mean that others can enter the house; the only check and balance is\nthat it should not harm the other individual or affect his/her right; (vii) that\nthe only permitted exception is where there is a countervailing public\ninterest which in particular circumstances is strong enough to outweigh it;\n(viii) that the question to be asked is, was it necessary and proportionate for\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 17 of 43\n the intrusion to take place, for example, in order to expose illegal activity or\nto prevent the public from being significantly mislead by public claims\nmade by the individual concern or what it necessary because the information\nwould make a contribution to a debate of general interest; and, (ix) that the\nCourt, in order to decide a case, must carry out a balancing operation,\nweighing the public interest in maintaining confidence against a\ncountervailing public interest favouring disclosure.\n\n22.    Having perused the record and having heard the counsels on the\nqueries raised during the hearing on 14th January, 2019, and being fully\nconscious that the suit is still at a pre-issue stage, I am of the opinion that the\nfollowing questions arise for adjudication:\n\n       (A)    Whether the suit is entitled to be put to trial on the plea of the\n       plaintiff, of the four photographs aforesaid, as well as other\n       photographs verbally argued to have been put on the internet, being\n       not genuine and being morphed, forged and fabricated; and,\n\n       (B)    If the above question is answered in favour of the plaintiff,\n       whether the claim of the plaintiff against the defendants, for removal\n       of the said photographs from the internet and/or for blocking of the\n       access to the said photographs is required to be put to trial.\n\n       (The answer to the above question would entail adjudication of,\n       whether on the averments in the plaint and the documents filed\n       therewith, a case of defamation of the plaintiff is made out and\n       whether any special law or principles are to be applied qua\n       defamation through the medium of internet.)\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                         Page 18 of 43\n 23.    Having also researched the law on the subject, besides considering the\njudgments cited by the counsels, I hold the plaintiff to be failing in both the\nquestions above. My reasons therefor are as under:\n\n       (I)    As far as the claim of the plaintiff, of the impugned\n       photographs showing the plaintiff with a man, having been morphed,\n       forged and fabricated is concerned, the same, on a reading of the\n       plaint is found to be half-hearted, vague and without the requisite\n       particulars. The counsel for the plaintiff during the hearing admitted\n       that the claim of the plaintiff to the reliefs is not based on the\n       impugned photographs being obscene. It is not so pleaded in the\n       plaint either. The claim, in the pleadings and during the hearing, has\n       been premised on the photographs being defamatory because of the\n       photographs showing the plaintiff with a politician belonging to\n       DMK, a rival political party to the political party to which the plaintiff\n       belongs and because of showing the plaintiff, an elected\n       representative of the people, in the company of a man other than her\n       husband. However, there is not a whisper in the plaint of what is\n       argued. In the plaint, neither has the identity of the man shown with\n       the plaintiff in the photographs been disclosed nor is the factum of the\n       said man belonging to the rival political party to the political party to\n       which the plaintiff is affiliated nor of the plaintiff being married, is\n       pleaded.    It is only vaguely pleaded that the photographs are\n       defamatory of the plaintiff and tarnish the image of the plaintiff,\n       without disclosing how. Once the plaintiff has described herself as a\n       politician and an elected representative of the people i.e. a public\n       persona, mere presence of a man, even if other than the husband of\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 19 of 43\n        the plaintiff, alongside the plaintiff in photographs, can by no\n       standard of a reasonable person be said to be defamatory of the\n       plaintiff, as the plaintiff in the course of her political journey is bound\n       to come in contact not only with women but also men. Thus, the\n       photographs of the plaintiff, I repeat, a politician, with a man other\n       than husband, can by any stretch of imagination be considered by any\n       person of average intellect and moral standard, to be lowering the\n       esteem in which the plaintiff is held or as tarnishing the image of the\n       plaintiff. In Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd., Patanjali Ayurved\n       Ltd., Shilpa S. Shetty, Selvi J. Jayalalithaa and Kanimozhi\n       Karunanidhi supra relied upon by the counsel for the plaintiff the\n       impugned content was per se defamatory. It cannot be so said of the\n       photographs impugned in the suit which are per se not defamatory but\n       which become defamatory owing to the man shown alongside the\n       plaintiff therein being a political rival of the plaintiff. However, as\n       aforesaid, there is no plea to the said effect.\n\n       (II)   As discussed by me above, the photographs appear to be taken\n       inside a house and/or in the private garden of a house. Had the\n       photographs been morphed / fabricated, the plaintiff would have\n       pleaded the identity of the person, described the reason for the\n       plaintiff and the said man being together in a house, given the address\n       of the house depicted in the photographs, pleaded that others also\n       were present on the occasion and who had been deleted from the\n       photographs or pleaded that the plaintiff had never met the said man\n       or that the face of the man had been placed on the body of another\n       man, in the photographs or that the body of the female shown in the\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                       Page 20 of 43\n        photographs was not hers and only her face had been added on body\n       of some other woman or given such like particulars. The plaintiff has\n       not pleaded any such thing. Rather, while invoking the territorial\n       jurisdiction of this Court, it is pleaded that the house shown in the\n       photographs was the plaintiff&#x27;s residence at Delhi. The plaintiff, if\n       the photographs were indeed morphed, would have pleaded that the\n       man shown in the photographs had never visited the house of the\n       plaintiff at Delhi or given the reason for his visit. In the absence of all\n       the said particulars, the plea of the photographs being morphed,\n       forged and fabricated is not a material one within the meaning of\n       <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_16\">Order XIV Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_17\">CPC</a>) to\n       invite the framing of an issue. The argument of the counsel for the\n       plaintiff, that the plaintiff to prove that the photographs are morphed,\n       will examine herself and an expert has also been made at the spur of\n       the moment inasmuch as it has not been explained how images\n       appearing on the internet can be opined by any expert in the subject to\n       be morphed. To my knowledge, no definite opinion can be given by\n       any expert on the basis of the said images. Moreover, no foundation\n       for such expert opinion has been laid and no report of any expert has\n       been filed inspite of the suit having been instituted four years back.\n       The stage for filing documents is long past gone and once the plaintiff\n       has not filed any expert opinion, the counsel for the plaintiff when\n       quizzed how the plea of the photographs being morphed will be\n       proved, cannot make any such argument.\n\n       (III) Not only are the pleas of the photographs being morphed vague\n       as aforesaid but the half-hearted nature thereof is also evident from\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                       Page 21 of 43\n        the alternative plea of the plaintiff, of the same even if genuine, being\n       liable to be removed / blocked for the reason of being defamatory of\n       the plaintiff and which aspect will be discussed hereunder.\n\n       (IV) I am therefore of the opinion that the claim of the plaintiff, of\n       the photographs being morphed, forged and fabricated, does not\n       deserve to be put to trial. Issues are not to be framed mechanically on\n       all the pleas in the pleadings, howsoever vague and frivolous.\n       Reference in this regard can be made to Precision Steels Vs. Reeta\n       Salwan (2013) 205 DLT 695, Kawal Sachdeva Vs. Madhu Bala\n       Rana 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1479, Adarsh Kumar Puniyani Vs.\n       Lajwanti Piplani 2015 SCC OnLine Del 14022, Abbott Healthcare\n       Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Raj Kumar Prasad (2018) 249 DLT 220, Anil Kumar\n       Vs. Devender Kumar 2019 SCC OnLine Del 8782, Bhavna Khanna\n       Vs. Subir Tara Singh 2019 SCC OnLine Del 6978 and Satish Kumar\n       Vs. Purshottam Maheshwari MANU/DE/2741/2019. It has also been\n       held that the Court is not required to at the cost of other deserving\n       cases, put a suit to trial, if on the pleadings finds the plaintiff to have\n       not laid any foundation for succeeding therein.\n\n       (V)    There is another reason for which the claim of the plaintiff of\n       the photographs being morphed, forged and fabricated does not\n       deserve to be put to trial i.e. the reason of non-joinder of necessary\n       parties. The plaintiff has instituted the suit only against Facebook\n       Inc., Google LLC and YouTube LLC which are but the electronic\n       platforms on which the photographs has been uploaded and who as\n       per the pleas in the written statement are intermediaries / search\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                       Page 22 of 43\n        engine within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1154453/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of the IT Act and of\n       which pleas in their written statement, there is no denial neither by\n       filing a replication nor during the hearing. For a plaintiff to succeed\n       on a plea of morphing, forgery or fabrication of photographs, the\n       alleged forger / fabricator or the person who has morphed the\n       photographs, is necessary party and without the said person, no\n       finding of the photographs being morphed, forged and fabricated can\n       be returned. As observed in the order dated 14 th January, 2019, a\n       plaintiff cannot be permitted by a Court to fight a mock litigation i.e.\n       by filing the suit not against the wrong doer but against those who are\n       not interested or would not be interested in contesting the claim of the\n       plaintiff. The grievance of morphing, forging and fabricating the\n       photographs of the plaintiff is against the doer of such acts. It is not\n       the case of the plaintiff that Facebook Inc., Google LLC or YouTube\n       LLC have morphed, forged and fabricated the photographs. It is also\n       not the case of the plaintiff that the defendant Union of India who in\n       any case is described only as a necessary and proper party and against\n       which no relief has been claimed, has done so.\n\n       (VI) The counsel for the plaintiff, being unable to reply to the\n       aforesaid, during the hearing on 27th February, 2019 stated that the\n       person who morphed, forged and fabricated the photographs was not\n       impleaded because his/her identity was not known.          Upon being\n       reminded that the law provides a recourse thereto by impleading the\n       unknown person as John Doe / Ashok Kumar and by seeking\n       disclosure of identity thereof from the electronic platforms, it was\n       stated that the steps in that regard will be taken. However the fact\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                    Page 23 of 43\n        remains that till the hearing on 1st April, 2019, no steps were taken.\n       Moreover, it is not the function of the Court to make out a case for the\n       plaintiff.   It is the plaintiff / her counsel who have to, before\n       approaching the Court, ensure that the wrong doer, relief against\n       whom is sought or without whom the relief cannot be granted, is\n       impleaded. It has not been so done in the present case. As aforesaid,\n       more than four years have lapsed since the institution of the suit and\n       the said claim would now also be barred by limitation. In fact, had\n       the grievance of the plaintiff been that the photographs are morphed,\n       forged and fabricated, a declaration to the said effect would have been\n       sought and which relief has also not been sought in the plaint.\n\n       (VII) I am also of the view that ordinarily if the photographs showing\n       the plaintiff with a man, according to the plaintiff had been morphed,\n       forged and fabricated and the plaintiff was suing for relief on the said\n       basis, the first person to be impleaded would have been the subject\n       man inasmuch as it is that man only who was best in a position to\n       comment on the genuineness of the photographs. Even if the said\n       man had pleaded that the photographs were genuine and it was the\n       case of the plaintiff that he was falsely pleading so, the plaintiff would\n       have had an opportunity to cross-examine him to prove the falsity of\n       his plea.    Strangely the plaintiff instituted the suit without even\n       impleading the said man.       As aforesaid, even his identity is not\n       pleaded in the plaint. Even when during the hearing on 27 th February,\n       2019 it was so put to the counsel for the plaintiff, the counsel for the\n       plaintiff fairly stated that in his opinion the plaintiff would not be\n       wanting to implead the said man and confirmed so on 1 st April, 2019,\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 24 of 43\n        after obtaining instructions. From the failure/refusal of the plaintiff to\n       implead the said man as defendant to the suit, adverse inference arises\n       against the plaintiff i.e. that the plea of the plaintiff, of the\n       photographs showing her with the said man are morphed, forged and\n       fabricated, is untrue and false. Once it is so, the question of putting\n       the said issue to trial does not arise.\n\n       (VIII) Thus, from whichever way one looks at, the answer to question\n       No.(A) above is against the plaintiff. The plaintiff has not made out a\n       case for putting her claim, of the impugned photographs being\n       morphed, forged and fabricated, to trial.\n\n       (IX) I now proceed to discuss the alternative plea of the plaintiff\n       that, even if the photographs are genuine, the plaintiff is entitled to\n       removal thereof for the reason of the same being defamatory.\n\n       (X)    In this context also, question arises, whether the plaintiff alone\n       is entitled to seek the relief of removal from an electronic platform\n       and/or obstruction of the access thereto of a photograph showing the\n       plaintiff with another.     In my view, in a suit for removal of a\n       photograph showing the plaintiff and another, the said another is a\n       necessary and proper party, inasmuch as obliteration of the content\n       affects the rights of said another also. The Court would not grant a\n       relief affecting others without such others being before it and without\n       hearing them. It is not the case of the plaintiff that the plaintiff had\n       agreed to being photographed with the said man on the condition that\n       the said photograph will not be published.

It thus follows that merely\n       because any information on the internet is offensive or causes\n       announce, inconvenience, danger etc. to a person does not entitle that\n       person     to   call   upon   the   intermediary     to   remove      that\n       information/content or to disable access thereto and the intermediary\n       is not liable to do so. It further follows that such a person is required\n       to either approach the designated governmental agency or the Court\n       for issuance of such a direction to the intermediary and the Court will\n       issue such a direction only if the person concerns makes out a case of\n       the information being actionable in law and not merely because the\n       information may be an irritant without being actionable in law.\n\n       (XII) The plaintiff has sought order from this Court for removal of\n       the impugned photographs alleging that the unlawful act of\n       defamation is thereby committed against the plaintiff. What thus falls\n       for consideration is, whether on the contents of the plaint, a case of\n       defamation is made out.\n\n       (XIII) As aforesaid, the plaintiff in the plaint has not disclosed, as to\n       how the photographs showing her with another man, even if inside the\n       house or a garden of the house, tarnish her image or are defamatory of\n       her, particularly considering that the plaintiff is a politician and an\n       elected representative of the people and who in a daily routine is\n       bound to meet men as well as women including in her house and also\n       at times break-bread with them. Rather, photographs of politicians\n       eating with public including persons from the disadvantaged strata of\n       the society, are the order of the day, to build a connect with the\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                     Page 32 of 43\n        classes. It is only during the hearing that the reason why the said\n       photographs are perceived to be tarnishing her, image and defaming\n       her have been disclosed i.e. of the plaintiff being married to another\n       man and the man shown in the photographs belonging to a rival\n       political party.      However, the said disclosure during the hearing\n       cannot take the place of a pleading and thus it has but to be held that\n       the plea of defamation, in the context and facts concerning the\n       plaintiff, is vague and without any particulars. Once it is so, again the\n       Court is not compelled to put the same to trial.\n\n       (XIV) However, even if what is disclosed in the arguments were to be\n       considered, the photographs cannot be said to be violating the privacy\n       of the plaintiff or defamatory of the plaintiff.\n\n       (XV) R.

Subhash Chandra Agarwal\n              2019 SCC OnLine SC 1459, holding that (i) public interest,\n              sometimes criticised as inherently amorphous and incapable of\n              a precise definition, is a time tested and historical conflict of\n              rights test which is often applied in the right to information\n              legislation to balance right to access and protection of the\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                       Page 41 of 43\n               conflicting right to deny access; (ii) comparison or balancing\n              exercise of competing public interests and privacy rights has to\n              be undertaken; and,(iii) right of the public to information on the\n              assets of the Judges of the Supreme Court was held to not\n              impinge upon the right to privacy of the Judges.\n\n       (XVII) As would follow on the conspectus of the aforesaid case law,\n       this Court is required to balance the right claimed by the plaintiff of\n       privacy qua whom she meets at her residence, has to be balanced with\n       the right of the public to know the identity of the person whom the\n       plaintiff meets and hobnobs with, behind closed doors.\n\n       (XVIII) Considering the fact that the plaintiff is a politician,\n       participating in the electoral process and is a representative of the\n       people, the people and/or the electorate certainly have a right to know\n       that the plaintiff behind closed doors meets and hobnobs a man to\n       whom she is not married and particularly a man who belongs to a\n       political party which is a rival of political party to which the plaintiff\n       belongs. The plaintiff, as a representative of people and whether\n       performing executive function or functions as a Legislator, would be\n       issuing orders / directions and/or participate in law making, regulating\n       the conduct of human beings and in the said context the electorate has\n       a right to know of the behind curtains meetings of the plaintiff with a\n       man other than her husband and particularly a man belonging to a\n       political party which the plaintiff, before the public criticises or\n       opposes in the elections. If such meetings with member of a rival\n       political party, which the plaintiff wants to remain hidden from the\n\n\nCS(OS) 510/2016                                                      Page 42 of 43\n        public, are not of interest to the public for the purposes of maintaining\n       purity of administration and law making, little else would qualify as\n       of public interest. The plaintiff, of course cannot be permitted to\n       publically oppose and criticise a political party to whose members she\n       is otherwise close. Or, at least public has an interest in knowing the\n       true state of affairs. For the said balancing act, no trial is required,\n       particularly when the plaintiff, in the plaint, has not even pleaded\n       what was argued on 27th February, 2019.\n\n       (XIX) Thus, in the facts of the present case, the public interest in\n       knowing the meeting of the plaintiff at her residence with a man\n       belonging to a rival political party far outweigh the private interest of\n       the plaintiff of keeping the same hidden from public eyes.            The\n       plaintiff has not pleaded the public interest in her said meetings and/or\n       in keeping the same hidden.\n\n24.
