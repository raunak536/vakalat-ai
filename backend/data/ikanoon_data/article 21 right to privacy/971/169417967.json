This appeal is at the instance of the Union of India and others being the\n\nunsuccessful respondents before the High Court and is directed against the\n\njudgement and order dated 15.05.2019 passed by the Gauhati High Court in Writ\n\nPetition (C) No. 7876 of 2015 by which the High Court allowed the writ petition\n\nfiled by the respondent herein (original petitioner) and thereby set aside the order\n\nof penalty of withholding of 50% pension for all times to come, imposed upon the\n\nrespondent herein in connection with the disciplinary proceedings initiated on the\n\nallegations of sexual harassment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">2.    We are dealing with a litigation relating to sexual harassment. Sexual\n\nharassment in any form at the work place must be viewed seriously and the harasser\n\nshould not be allowed to escape from the clutches of law. We say so because the\n\nsame humiliates and frustrates a victim of sexual harassment, more particularly\n\nwhen the harasser goes unpunished or is let off with a relatively minor penalty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">However, at the same time, it should be kept in mind that the charge of this nature\n\nis very easy to make and is very difficult to rebut. When a plea is taken of false\n\nimplication for extraneous reasons, the courts have a duty to make deeper scrutiny\n\nof the evidence and decide the acceptability or otherwise of the accusations. Every\n\ncare should be taken to separate the chaff from the grain. The veracity and\n\ngenuineness of the complaint should be scrutinised to prevent any misuse of such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                       Page 3 of 104</span>\n\flaudable laws enunciated for the upliftment of the society and for equal rights of\n\npeople without gender discrimination by anybody under the garb of “sexual\n\nharassment”, lest justice rendering system would become a mockery. In such\n\ncircumstances, we have decided to look into this matter closely and in details.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">A.     FACTUAL MATRIX\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.     The respondent herein was serving as the Area Organizer i.e., the Local Head\n\nof Office of the Service Selection Board (for short, “the SSB”), Rangia, State of\n\nAssam between September, 2006 to May, 2012. In the very same office, a lady\n\nemployee was serving as the Field Assistant (Lady) (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n“complainant”). She lodged a complaint (hereinafter referred to as the “first\n\ncomplaint”) addressed to the Inspector General (for short, “IG”), Frontier\n\nHeadquarters, Guwahati with one copy each forwarded to the DG SSB, New Delhi,\n\nDy. IG, SSB, SHQ, Tezpur and the Chairperson of the National Women Rights\n\nCommission, New Delhi inter alia alleging sexual harassment at the hands of the\n\nrespondent. The first complaint dated 30.08.2011 reads thus: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        “To,\n               The Inspector General,\n               Frontier Hqrs.

I have joined the office of the A.O Rangia in March, 2009, Since\n        my joining I have been entrusted the task of receiving telephones\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                       Page 4 of 104</span>\n\f   and Mobiles in the Control Room, CAP, Training, Sports. Then I\n   was the only female employee in the Office.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">2. Having just started discharging my duties devotedly the AO Mr.\n   Dilip Paul started teasing me tactically. He started making phone\n   calls to me sometimes at night using unofficial and\n   multimeaninged word. Even he went to the extent of visiting my\n   residence where I stay alone with two of my children as my\n   husband is a state Government employee in Manipur.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">3. Sometimes CAP work needs close working with the officers.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">   Taking the advantage he used to call me in his room and started\n   teasing indirectly and unnecessarily makes me sit for hours. One\n   day he went to the extent of saying &quot;If you want to work happily\n   in my office, then agree to my saying.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">4. I have been tolerating his acts since the last two and half years.\n   I could neither inform my husband nor lodge any written\n   complaint against such acts as it will be difficult to give evidence.\n   Unable to bear the situation I have verbally complaint to the then\n   DIG Shri S. C. Katoch over Telephone in May, 2010 about Mr.\n   Paul uncivilized altitude. The DIG did a favour and warned Mr.\n   Paul of severe consequences if he did not stopped misbehaving.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">5. Since then, he stopped teasing but instead began torturing me\n   mentally. I have not been entrusted any work and ex-\n   communicated in the office. Throughout the day all I have to do\n   is sit silently in the office. If any of my colleagues talk with me,\n   Mr. Paul would immediately call him and scold him bitterly. Sir,\n   I am now so much depressed and mentally disturbed I have\n   visited to the Doctors many times for which I have taken many\n   medical leaves. Now, I am not in position to work even for a day\n   under him. It also began affecting my family life.\n   In view of the above, I request your kind honour to look into the\n   matter sympathetically and it is also requested to take necessary\n   action against the Shri D. Paul, AO Rangia to get rid of this\n   problem as soon as possible for which I shall remain ever\n   grateful to you.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                                                      Yours faithfully,\n                                                       Sd/- 30.8.2011\n                                                              (Smt.

The Dy. IG, SSB, SHQ, Tezpur held a common “on-the-spot” fact finding\n\ninquiry in relation to the first complaint dated 30.08.2011 and recorded the\n\nstatements of the employees working in the office of the respondent. The\n\nrespondent was given an opportunity to file his reply to the allegations levelled in\n\nthe complaints. On 13.12.2011, the “on-the-spot” fact finding inquiry was\n\nconcluded, and two reports in that regard were submitted to the IG, Frontier HQ,\n\nGuwahati.\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">a)    On the first complaint of sexual harassment, the staff members stated that\n\nthey had not seen anything in the office which could be termed as indirect teasing\n\nor harassment to the complainant.

All the staff available in the office on the date, were\n       summoned one after another individually, but none of them stated\n       to have seen or known Shri Dilip Paul, Area Organiser\n       misbehaving with Smt. X, FA(Lady) in the office. Further most of\n       them stated that due to reasons best known to Shri Paul, Area\n       Organiser, she was not allotted with any work for about 3 months\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                       Page 6 of 104</span>\n\f       before her release on transfer to Ftr.

But it is also duty\n       of supervisory officer as administrator and manager to somehow\n       motivate his sub-ordinate staff and take work from them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            In the case of Smt.

The said report further noted that\n\nduring the inquiry the only thing that surfaced was the occasional rudeness and\n\nuncordial inter-personal relations of the respondent with three of his subordinate\n\nemployees.

The statement given by all the\n      prosecution witnesses are not enough to prove the complaint. She\n      has lodged a complaint after a gap of more than two years. The\n      complainant failed to produce any documentary evidence based\n      on the allegations levelled against the charged officer”\n\n\nA.3   Central Complaints Committee’s Inquiry Report\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">6.    While the Frontier Complaints Committee’s Report dated 17.01.2012 was\n\npending for consideration, the Ministry of Home Affairs / Competent Authority,\n\nconstituted another inquiry committee on 06.08.2012 being the Central Complaints\n\nCommittee to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the complainant’s allegations of\n\nsexual harassment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">7.    Prima facie, it appears from the materials on record that the Central\n\nComplaints Committee had to be constituted, in view of Clause 9 of the 2006\n\nStanding Order. Clause 9 of the 2006 Standing Order envisages two levels of\n\ncomplaints committee; (i) a Frontier Complaints Committee for the “combatised\n\nand in-field officers” (ii) a Central Complaints Committee for the “non-combatised\n\nofficers”. At the time of lodging of the complaint, the respondent was serving as a\n\nnon-combatised officer i.e., Area Organizer. For such reason, the decision to\n\nconstitute the Central Complaints Committee had to be taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">8.    On 18.09.2012, the complainant through fax submitted a second complaint\n\ncontaining additional allegations against the respondent (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe “second complaint”) along with few other documents including the\n\nanonymous complaints made against the respondent in October 2011.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                      Page 10 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">\f9.    Accordingly, the Central Complaints Committee undertook the inquiry, and\n\nin the preliminary hearing held on 27.09.2012, it decided to treat the complaint as\n\nthe charge-sheet in view of the fact that no specific charges were framed against\n\nthe respondent. The respondent was provided with all the relevant documents\n\nincluding the original copy of the first complaint dated 30.08.2011. After,\n\nconfirming with the respondent as regards the receipt of all relevant documents,\n\nthe Central Complaints Committee inquired with the respondent whether he\n\npleaded guilty to the charges or not. The respondent pleaded not guilty and\n\ncategorically denied the charges levelled against him. The relevant portion of the\n\nCentral Complaints Committee’s Report reads as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      “VI. CHARGES WHICH WERE ADMITTED/ DROPPED/\n      NOT PRESSED:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      Shri Dilip Paul, the charged officer did not plead guilty to any of\n      the allegations made by Smt. X, FA (Lady) vide complaint dated\n      30.08.2011 framed against him.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">10.   The Central Complaints Committee in the course of its inquiry examined in\n\nall 20 witnesses produced by the complainant (incl. 5 witnesses who were earlier\n\nexamined by the Frontier Level Complaints Committee) and 6 witnesses on behalf\n\nof the respondent (incl. 1 witness earlier examined by the Frontier Level\n\nComplaints Committee). Later, the Central Complaints Committee delineated the\n\ncharges to be inquired by it into 10 distinct points. The points of determination\n\nframed by the Committee reads thus: -\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                     Page 11 of 104</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\f“VII. CHARGES ACTUALLY INQUIRED INTO AND POINTS\nTO BE DETERMINED\n\nThe Complaints Committee is aware that aspects of this complaint\nare implicated in the FIR that Shri Dilip Paul lodged on 26.08.2011\nat P.S. Rangia, on the matter of an allegedly threatening message\nsent to him on his mobile phones by Smt. X&#x27;s husband. In the\ncounter-case filed by Smt. X&#x27;s husband, similar allegations of sexual\nharassment have been raised. The Committee has ascertained from\nthe SP Kamrup that both the cases are still pending investigation.\nNevertheless, going by what has been stated in the CCS, CCA Rules\n14(3), which states that action of prosecution in a court and\ndepartmental proceedings can go on simultaneously. The CCS CCA\nRules require the fact that the approach and objective in the\ncriminal and disciplinary proceedings are altogether distinct and\ndifferent, be kept in view, as is laid down by the various Supreme\nCourt rulings to this effect. Accordingly, the Committee decide to\nproceed with enquiry and submit its findings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">Smt. X has alleged that a few months after she joined Area Office,\nRangia in April 2009, Shri Dilip Paul, then A.O. Rangia, started\nmaking unwelcome sexual advances to her, and that upon her\nrefusal to submit to his advances and his sexually determined\nmisconduct, he withdrew all work from her. She has cited the\nfollowing incidents as the substance of her complaint.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">Point 1: That Shri Dilip Paul would use the pretext of summoning\ninto his room with work-related files in order to make comments of\na sexually loaded and personal nature, such as remarks about her\npersonal appearance and her looks, about how he wanted to marry\na Manipuri girl like her. He would also boast at times about his\nsexual prowess and abilities in satisfying women who were unhappy\nwith their husbands. He would also make comments that had a\ndouble meaning (of a sexual nature). On such occasions, he would\ndetain her in his office for inordinately long periods. This charge, if\nsubstantiated, is admissible under the Vishaka definition of sexual\nharassment as it involves sexually coloured remarks and other\nunwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual\nnature. Furthermore, it may also be shown to be discriminatory if it\nis substantiated that Smt. X believed that her objection to Shri Dilip\nPaul&#x27;s conduct would disadvantage her in connection with her\nemployment and her apprehension that it would create a hostile\nwork environment.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                  Page 12 of 104</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\fPoint 2: That Shri Dilip Paul would stare at her in the workplace,\nsuch as the repeated incidents in which he would come out from his\noffice into the room that she was sitting, on the pretext of drinking\nwater. This charge, if substantiated, is admissible under the Vishaka\ndefinition of sexual harassment as it involves sexually coloured\nremarks and other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal\nconduct of sexual nature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">Point 3: That Shri Dilip Paul would attempt to touch her in an\nunwelcome sexually determined manner in the workplace, such as\nan incident when, on the pretext of teaching her to operate a laptop,\nhe come close to her and touched her shoulder and body. This\ncharge, if substantiated, is admissible under the Vishaka definition\nof sexual harassment as it involves physical contact and advances\nand other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of\nsexual nature. Furthermore, it may also be shown to be\ndiscriminatory if it is substantiated that Smt. X believed that her\nobjection to Shri Dilip Paul&#x27;s conduct would disadvantage her in\nconnection with her employment and her apprehension that if would\ncreate a hostile work environment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">Point 4: That Shri Dilip Paul would often make her work much\nbeyond office hours, often after 2000 hours. He would then offer to\ndrop here in his vehicle to her home. In general, Shri Dilip Paul\nwould pressure her to drive with him in his vehicle, either when she\nwas returning from work or in the town.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Point 5: That Shri Dilip Paul, on the occasion that Smt. X with other\noffice colleagues had accompanied him to the railway station to\nbook train tickets for the study tour to South India in march 2010,\nmade an unwelcome sexual advance to her in full public view. While\nshe was standing in the queue at the ticket booking counter, Shri\nDilip Paul came to stand next to her and putt his arm around her\nshoulder and tried to hug her close to his body. Shri Dilip Paul said\nto her that he is sending her on the study tour to make her &quot;mind\nfresh&quot; so that she may forget her previous life and when she\nreturned, begin a new one as Mrs. Paul.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">Point 6: That Shri Dilip Paul subjected her to further unwelcome\nsexually determined conduct by the statements that he made when\nhe came to the railway station to see off the group departing for the\nstudy tour. After the luggage had been loaded onto the train, Shri\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                Page 13 of 104</span>\n\fDilip Paul came into the train compartment and said to Smt. X &quot;tum\njaa rahe ho to mari jaan jaa rahi hai. Ham ka saath jaanaa hi\nacchaa hota. Koi baat nahiin, tum study tour se waapas aa jaaoo,\nto tum Mrs Paul banogi.”\n\n\nPoint 7: That Shri Dilip Paul made unwelcome sexual advances to\nher outside the workplace as well, where on several occasions, he\npropositioned her, asking her to leave her husband and marry him\non the assurance that he would adopt her children as his own. Since\nJuly 2009, Shri Dilip Paul made it a habit to visit her uninvited and\nshe felt unable to refuse entry to her hierarchically superior officer,\nfearing future discrimination. These visits took place even late at\nnight. Several incidents have been cited in the complaint in this\nconnection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">a. That Shri Dilip Paul used to make unsolicited phone calls to her,\n   frequently at night and insisted on speaking to her for long\n   durations, sometime up to half and hour. The phone calls were\n   usually made between 19:00 and 20:00 hours, but occasionally,\n   she also received calls from Shri Dilip Paul as late as 4.30 a.m.\n   The substance of these calls mostly consisted of unwelcome\n   comments of sexual nature with the objective of making her\n   submit to his unwelcome sexual advances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">b. On one occasion, Shri Dilip Paul came to Smt. X&#x27;s home at\n   around 4.45 a.m. and insisted that she came out for a morning\n   walk with him. Fearful that if she refused, he would insist on\n   coming into her house at that hour, she accompanied him for a\n   short distance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">c. That, on one uninvited visit to Smt. X&#x27;s home, Shri Dilip Paul\n   came with a bottle of alcohol and sought to pressure her to join\n   him in drinking. When she tried to get away from him by going\n   to the kitchen, Shri D. Paul followed her and tried to force\n   himself upon her by embracing her. She somehow managed to\n   extricate herself and ran out the house, and remained there until\n   Shri D. Paul left the house.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">d. That on his uninvited visits to Smt. X&#x27;s home, Shri Dilip Paul\n   showed an unnatural and unhealthy interest in her daughter. He\n   would call the child and draw her to him, and would then attempt\n   to hold her in a very &#x27;dirty&#x27; manner. On the occasion that this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                  Page 14 of 104</span>\n\f   happened, he only let go of the child when Smt. X called the child\n   to her in Manipuri.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">e. That when Shri Dilip Paul visited her house one evening in April\n   2010, shortly after her return from the Study Tour to South India,\n   he made unwelcome sexual advances to her by his statement that\n   they would become one in a few days time and that she should\n   stop resisting. He also tried to forcibly embrace her, but she\n   extricated herself and ran into the room that her children were\n   sleeping in.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">f. That Shri Dilip Paul, during an official trip to Nagrijuli in\n   connection with the Civic Action Programme, made her sit next\n   to him and tried to hold her hand and touch her, all of which\n   behaviour was sexually determined, unwelcome and insulting.\n   Smt. X also stated that there were no eyewitnesses to these acts,\n   as only she ·and Shri Dilip Paul were seated in the middle seat\n   of the car.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">Point 8: That Shri Dilip Paul began victimising her for her refusal\nto submit to his unwelcome sexual advances soon after he learnt\nthat she had made a complaint about his misconduct to Shri S.C.\nKatoch, who happened to be DIG of another area. Smt. X had\ntelephoned Shri S.C. Katoch after the incident reported in point 10,\nand told him all that had been taking place. She stated that Shri\nKatoch informed her in a subsequent phone call that she made to\nhim that he had issued a verbal reprimand to Shri Dilip Paul.\nHowever, a few days after the incident, Shri Dilip Paul called her\ninto his office and asked her whether she had made a complaint\nagainst him to Shri Katoch. Smt. X confirmed to him that she had\nindeed done so, and to scare him, told him that she had made a\nwritten complaint. From that day on, Shri Dilip Paul withdrew all\nthe work that was assigned to her and assigned it to another\nemployee. Thereafter, and for the next three months, Smt. X was\nmade to sit idle in the office.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">Point 9: In late August 2010, Smt. X approached IG S.K. Singhal\nwith a written complaint of sexual harassment in the workplace,\nwhich also contained an application for her transfer to Ftr Hqr\nGuwahati. Shri Singhal asked her to separate the two complaints of\nsexual harassment in the workplace from the transfer request and\nissued an order transferring her to Ftr Hqr Guwahati on 1\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                Page 15 of 104</span>\n\f      September 2011. However, the transfer order did not contain\n      directions for the payment of TA/DA and did not provide her any\n      joining time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">      Point 10: Smt. X has also complained that the now-quashed enquiry\n      into her complaint of sexual harassment in November 2011 did not\n      provide her sufficient time or opportunity to submit additional\n      documents and produce additional witnesses relating to the past\n      history of the accused. She has also stated that she was not afforded\n      the right of cross-examination of Shri Paul, or a chance to rebut his\n      alleged false statements. After the completion of the thereafter\n      quashed enquiry, she was not also provided a copy of the enquiry\n      report. In her deposition as well as the written submissions made to\n      the Complaints Committee, she also pleaded that due cognizance be\n      taken of the fact that, as a woman employee of the SSB, she was\n      entirely unaware of that a Complaints Committee mechanism for\n      dealing with complaints of sexual harassment was in place, and that\n      as a complainant, she had the right to submit a request for either\n      her own transfer or the transfer of the defendant. She has also\n      queried whether the promotion of Shri Dilip Paul on 11 September\n      2012 to the rank of DIG is maintainable when a complaint of sexual\n      harassment in the workplace against him was pending.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">11.

However, it is manifest from the\n        inquiry report that the complaint submitted on 18.09.2012 was\n        also taken into consideration. It is noted by the CCC in the report\n        under      the    heading      &quot;VI.

Though the copy of the complaint\n        dated 30.08.2011 was furnished, the same was not given in the\n        form of articles of charge. The requirement of the officer\n        proceeded against to be formally asked whether he pleads guilty\n        or not would, according to the understanding of the court, is not\n        an opportunity to such officer only to answer the same in a mono-\n        syllable. To give meaning to the word &quot;formally&quot;, a real and\n        effective opportunity has to be granted to the officer concerned\n        to make his comment in writing in response to the complaint.\n        Apparently, no such opportunity was afforded. There is no\n        indication that in respect of the complaint dated 18.09.2012, the\n        officer was even asked as to whether he pleads guilty to the\n        allegations made therein or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_56\">             xxx                        xxx                        xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">        43.

He had, in other words, negated\n         the assertions made in the complaint that she had informed about\n         sexual harassment meted out by the petitioner. The CCC,\n         however, noted that it appeared that Shri Katoch had pre-judged\n         the complaint as untrue. When his evidence was that there was\n         no complaint of sexual harassment, there was no occasion for the\n         CCC to opine that he pre-judged the complaint.

Further, the\nlist of ‘witnesses to be examined’ submitted by the Complainant on\n18.09.2012 was also supplied to the Respondent. The Respondent\nappeared and submitted that he will provide the name of his\ncounsel within an hour. Therefore, on his request, the proceedings\nwere adjourned to 2 PM. At 2 PM, he submitted an application\nseeking 30 days’ time for engagement of counsel. The Committee\nafter taking into account his request granted one week’s time to\nprovide name of his counsel in order to complete the proceedings\nwithin the stipulated time period.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_62\">c. It is important to mention that the next date of the hearing\nwas fixed for 26.11.2012 i.e., after 2 months. When the Respondent\nwas enquired about the name of his counsel, he submitted before\nthe Committee that he will represent himself and cross-examine\nthe witnesses and he himself examined as many as 11 witnesses.\nThus, the Respondent participated in the enquiry proceedings and\nchose to defend himself despite sufficient time being given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">d. The allegation made by the Respondent that the Complainant\nsubmitted a list of witnesses later on 18.09.2012, which the\nCommittee could not look into is misconceived.

The allegation raised by the Respondent that he was not\ninformed of the charges in the form of a ‘charge-sheet’ is frivolous\nas he was supplied with the copies of all the complaints and all\nother relevant documents. This goes to show that he was well\nacquainted with the nature of allegations levelled against him and\nknew what he had to state in his defence.

It is submitted that the first alleged inquiry dated 13.12.2011\n was pursuant to conducting of an on-spot enquiry and by the very\n nature of it, is summary in nature and not an inquiry of the nature\n envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1031794/\" id=\"a_2\">Vishaka &amp; Ors. v State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>, (1997) 6\n SCC 241 line of cases and the SSB Standard Operating Procedure\n on sexual harassment.

It is relevant to note that before the report of on-the-spot\n enquiry was submitted, Frontier Level Complaint Committee\n (FLCC) was already constituted. The FLCC submitted its report\n on 17.01.2012. However, the same was cancelled by Memorandum\n dated 10.12.2012 on the ground that the Chairperson of the FLCC\n was not an officer who was senior to the petitioner against whom\n the complaint was made as required under Rule 9(b)(a) of the\n Departmental Standard Operating Procedure on Sexual\n Harassment. The said decision was conveyed to the Respondent\n vide Memo dated 10.12.2012.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\"> c.

The\n       scope is limited to the decision-making process, not the decision\n       per se. This Hon’ble Court in a recent judgment <a href=\"/doc/38950634/\" id=\"a_4\">Aureliano\n       Fernandes vs State of Goa</a> 2023 SCC OnLine SC 621 while\n       pondering upon the extent to which a High Court can interfere with\n       respect to the departmental proceedings and findings thereof,\n       observed the following:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">          “62…Disciplinary Authority is the sole judge of facts and once\n          findings of fact, based on appreciation of evidence are recorded,\n          the High Court in its writ jurisdiction should not normally\n          interfere with those factual findings unless it finds that the\n          recorded findings were based either on no evidence or that the\n          findings were wholly perverse and/or legally untenable. The\n          Court is under a duty to satisfy itself that an inquiry into the\n          allegations of sexual harassment by a Committee is conducted\n          in terms of the service rules and that the concerned employee\n          gets a reasonable opportunity to vindicate his position and\n          establish his innocence.”\n       c. The Respondent herein was a member of the disciplined force\n       and was holding a significant post at the time of commission of\n       offence. He harassed the Complainant continuously for a period of\n       more than 2 years despite warning issued by his superior. He did\n       not stop despite the warning and started torturing the Complainant\n       by not giving her work and making her sit idle till late in the night.\n       Having superannuated during the pendency of the proceedings\n       before the disciplinary authority, the Respondent superannuated\n       on 31.03.2013 as DIG.

SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">29.   Mr. Avijit Roy, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent in his\n\nwritten submissions has stated thus: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       “1. The Hon’ble High Court in para 25 of the its judgment (Page\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">       -39 of SLP) rightly held that the scope of judicial review in case of\n       misconduct and imposition of penalty under the service\n       jurisprudence is circumscribed as the court is only required to\n       examine as to whether the charges have been established on the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                        Page 32 of 104</span>\n\fbasis of a fair enquiry as the Hon’ble High Court was also\nconscious of the fact that judicial review is not against the decision\nbut the decision making process.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">2. It is relevant to mention here that Rule 15 of the CCS (CCA)\nRules, 1965, more particularly sub-rule 1 and 2 of Rule 15 imposed\na categorical restriction on holding of a 2nd and further statutory\ninquiry. But in the instant case, in spite of the fact that the sole\nrespondent was exonerated from the alleged complaint by three\nsuccessive enquiries i.e. i) the Fact Finding enquiry, ii) first the\nstatutory enquiry conducted by the duly constituted Frontier Level\nCommittee and iii) a second statutory enquiry (in fact it was 4th\nenquiry in the series which includes inquiry on the basis of another\nanonymous complaint) by the Central Complaint Committee was\ninstituted.

Further, in K.R.

The above quoted decisions of the Apex Court conclusively\nmandate that – (1) A second enquiry is not permissible, and (2) It\nis the correctness of the conclusion recorded in the enquiry report\nwhich determines the legality of the conclusions and not the mere\ntechnical flaws. These principles are fit to be extrapolated in the\ninstant case.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                                  Page 33 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_75\">\f6. That, the complaint dated 30.08.2011 contained only 2 (two)\nallegations, but the Central Complaint Committee extrapolated the\nallegations to as many as 10 nos. incorporating therein the newly\nadded exaggerated versions of the complainant and delved into\nthose, thus travelling beyond the allegations in the complaint dated\n30.08.2011 and overstepping its jurisdiction in violation of\nprocedure <a href=\"/doc/38950634/\" id=\"a_5\">laid down in</a> CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">7. The Hon’ble High Court in para 41 of its impugned judgment\n(Page 54 of the SLP) rightly observed that a complaint dated\n18.09.2012 along with five Annexures was submitted by Smt. X\n(Complainant) to the Chairperson of the Central Complaint\nCommittee (CCC) and copy of such complaint was also made\navailable to the sole respondent. In the inquiry report the above\nfact is not mentioned. It also does not appear that the said\ncomplaint was brought to the notice of the disciplinary authority.\nThe Hon’ble High Court rightly held that the Central Complaint\nCommittee (CCC) was mandated by the authority to inquire into\nthe complaint dated 30.08.2011. However, it is manifest from the\ninquiry report that the complaint submitted on 18.09.2012 was\nalso taken into consideration. It was also noted by the Hon’ble\nHigh Court that the CCC in the report under the heading “VI.\nCharges which were admitted/dropped/not pressed” that the\npetitioner did not plead guilty to any of the allegations made by\nthe complainant in her complaint dated 30.08.2011. Though the\ncopy of the complaint dated 30.08.2011 was furnished, the same\nwas not given in the form of articles of charge. The requirement of\nthe officer proceeded against to be formally asked whether he\npleads guilty or not would, according to the understanding of the\ncourt, is not an opportunity to such officer only to answer the same\nin a mono-syllable. The Hon’ble High Court held that to give\nmeaning to the word “formally”, a real and effective opportunity\nhas to be granted to the officer concerned to make his comment in\nwriting in response to the complaint. Apparently, no such\nopportunity was afforded. There is no indication that in respect of\nthe complaint dated 18.09.2012, the officer was even asked as to\nwhether he pleads guilty to the allegations made therein or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">8. That, the Hon’ble High Court at para 43 of its judgment (\nPage 70-71 of the SLP) rightly held that few points of allegations\nare no way connected to the complaint dated 30.08.2011. The\nHon’ble High Court held that two inquiries had also taken place\nand, after more than a year later, after lodging of the complaint\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                               Page 34 of 104</span>\n\fdated 30.08.2011, another complaint with many allegations was\nsubmitted to the Chairperson of the CCC on 18.09.2012.\nAccordingly the Hon’ble High Court rightly held that the CCC\ncould not have entertained such a complaint for the purpose of a\ndisciplinary proceeding in absence of entrustment in terms of\nStanding Order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">9. That, the Hon’ble High Court at para 44 &amp; 45 of its judgment\n(Page 71-74 of the SLP) rightly held that the orders dated\n26.11.2012, 27.11.2012, 28.11.2012 and 10.12.2012 go to show\nthat the committee asked questions to the prosecution witnesses\nand examination-in-chief was done by the committee. Prosecution\nwitness, Mr. S.C. Katoch, who was cross-examined by the\ncomplainant, in his statement had stated that the complainant had\nmade only one call on his mobile and that she had mentioned that\nthe sole respondent is harsh in his office work and had given her\nduty in control room for which she is to sit in the control room\nafter office hours. He had, in other words, negated the assertions\nmade in the complaint that she had informed about sexual\nharassment meted out by the sole respondent. The CCC, however,\nnoted that it appeared that Shri Katoch had pre-judged the\ncomplaint as untrue. When his evidence was that there was no\ncomplaint of sexual harassment, there was no occasion for the\nCCC to opine that he pre-judged the complaint. He was also put\nfifteen questions by the CCC, which was styled as “examination-\nin-chief”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">10. That, the Hon’ble High Court at para 46 of its judgment (\nPage 74 of the SLP) rightly held that the prosecution witnesses\nwere also put questions by the CCC, which is evident from the\nreport of the CCC under the heading “V. Examination of\nwitnesses”, wherein the CCC itself recorded that CCC had\nconducted the examination-in-chief whenever it felt necessary.\nThus, it is evident that the CCC also played the role of prosecutor,\nwhich vitiates the proceeding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">11. That the Hon’ble High Court at para 47 of its judgment (Page\n75-76 of the SLP) rightly held that the CCC had recorded that it\nhad noted that no witness examined by it had specific knowledge\nof the events listed in. The Hon’ble High Court observed that\nevents alleged pertain to allegation of making unsolicited phone\ncalls at unearthly hours and, that too, for long duration. No call\nrecords were produced. However, CCC accepted the allegations\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                               Page 35 of 104</span>\n\fby merely holding that the committee saw no reason what gain the\ncomplainant would have in fabricating the allegations and that it\nis understandable that no woman would be expected to confide\nmatters of sexual nature even to her female colleagues. In this\nregard, the Hon’ble High Court correctly held that the Central\nComplaint Committee (CCC) ought to have recorded its finding\nbased on evidence on record and not on surmises and conjectures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">12. That, it may be mentioned here that the sole respondent was\nmost decorated officer in his cadre in SSB. He was awarded by the\nPresident of India for his exemplary services.

Now after putting in 35 glorious years of\nservice in SSB, he has been victimized and forced to proceed on\nsuperannuation without a single penny from the department. Even\nhis personal accumulation under different heads has also not been\nsanctioned to him. The sole respondent is still deprived of his\nretiral benefit like gratuity and others as the gratuity due to him\ncannot be withheld as the nature of allegation is not related any\nfinancial issues and there was no order by any quarter about any\nsuch withholding of his retiral benefit. Moreso, the Punishment\norder dated 05.01.2016 (@ page 447-453 of Vol-II of present SLP)\npassed by the Authority concerned clearly directed that the\ngratuity amount shall be released to the sole respondent and the\nsaid order of release of gratuity by the respondent authority is not\nopposed or assailed by the petitioner authority.

Surprisingly, the\nauthority on same allegations instituted 4th inquiry and imposed\npenalty just to victimize the sole respondent for reasons best known\nto them. The sole respondent was the unfortunate victim of\ninterdepartmental rivalry and he was traumatized due to unproved\nallegations and his innocence was upheld time to time by the first\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                               Page 36 of 104</span>\n\f        three inquiries and same was discussed in detail by the Hon’ble\n        High Court at para 40, 43, 46 and 47 of the impugned judgment\n        while rightly setting aside the impugned order of penalty.

Before adverting to the rival contentions canvassed on either side, we must\n\nlook into the statutory scheme relating to the complaints of sexual harassment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">32.   Sexual harassment is a pervasive and deeply rooted issue that has plagued\n\nthe societies worldwide. In India, it has been a matter of serious concern, and the\n\ndevelopment of laws to combat sexual harassment is a testament to the nation&#x27;s\n\ncommitment towards addressing this problem. Sexual harassment has existed in\n\nIndia for centuries, but it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that it began\n\nto gain legal recognition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1031794\" id=\"span_47\">33.   The turning point against the growing social menace of sexual harassment\n\nof women at work place could be traced back to the pathbreaking decision of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1031794/\" id=\"a_6\">Vishaka and Others v. State of Rajasthan and Others</a> reported in (1997)\n\n6 SCC 241, whereby this Court recognized sexual harassment at the workplace as\n\na violation of a woman&#x27;s fundamental right to equality and dignity. The relevant\n\nobservations are as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">      “1. This writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of the\n      fundamental rights of working women under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Articles 14 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">21</a>\n      of the Constitution of India in view of the prevailing climate in\n      which the violation of these rights is not uncommon. With the\n      increasing awareness and emphasis on gender justice, there is\n      increase in the effort to guard against such violations; and the\n      resentment towards incidents of sexual harassment is also\n      increasing. The present petition has been brought as a class action\n      by certain social activists and NGOs with the aim of focusing\n      attention towards this societal aberration, and assisting in finding\n      suitable methods for realisation of the true concept of “gender\n      equality”; and to prevent sexual harassment of working women in\n      all work places through judicial process, to fill the vacuum in\n      existing legislation.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                           Page 38 of 104</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">\f2. The immediate cause for the filing of this writ petition is an\nincident of alleged brutal gang rape of a social worker in a village\nof Rajasthan. That incident is the subject-matter of a separate\ncriminal action and no further mention of it, by us, is necessary. The\nincident reveals the hazards to which a working woman may be\nexposed and the depravity to which sexual harassment can\ndegenerate; and the urgency for safeguards by an alternative\nmechanism in the absence of legislative measures. In the absence of\nlegislative measures, the need is to find an effective alternative\nmechanism to fulfil this felt and urgent social need.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">3. Each such incident results in violation of the fundamental rights\nof “Gender Equality” and the “Right to Life and Liberty”. It is a\nclear violation of the rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_10\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">21</a> of the\nConstitution. One of the logical consequences of such an incident is\nalso the violation of the victim&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_12\">Article\n19(1)(g)</a> “to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation,\ntrade or business”. Such violations, therefore, attract the remedy\nunder <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 32</a> for the enforcement of these fundamental rights of\nwomen. This class action under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution is for\nthis reason. A writ of mandamus in such a situation, if it is to be\neffective, needs to be accompanied by directions for prevention, as\nthe violation of fundamental rights of this kind is a recurring\nphenomenon. The fundamental right to carry on any occupation,\ntrade or profession depends on the availability of a &quot;safe&quot; working\nenvironment. Right to life means life with dignity. The primary\nresponsibility for ensuring such safety and dignity through suitable\nlegislation, and the creation of a mechanism for its enforcement, is\nof the legislature and the executive. When, however, instances of\nsexual harassment resulting in violation of fundamental rights of\nwomen workers under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_16\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">21</a> are brought before us\nfor redress under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 32</a>, an effective redressal requires that\nsome guidelines should be laid down for the protection of these\nrights to fill the legislative vacuum.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">             xxx                 xxx                 xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">7. In the absence of domestic law occupying the field, to formulate\neffective measures to check the evil of sexual harassment of working\nwomen at all workplaces, the contents of international conventions\nand norms are significant for the purpose of interpretation of the\nguarantee of gender equality, right to work with human dignity in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                 Page 39 of 104</span>\n\f      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_20\">, 15 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">21</a> of the Constitution and the\n      safeguards against sexual harassment implicit therein. Any\n      international convention not inconsistent with the fundamental\n      rights and in harmony with its spirit must be read into these\n      provisions to enlarge the meaning and content thereof, to promote\n      the object of the constitutional guarantee.

State of Goa and Others</a> reported in 2023 SCC OnLine SC 621\n\nwherein it was held that the same is to provide flexibility for achieving a balance\n\nbetween sensitivity and fairness in an inquiry into sexual harassment.

The relevant observations are given below: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">      “51. As can be seen from the above, when the misconduct\n      relates to a complaint of sexual harassment at the work place,\n      the Complaints Committee constituted by the respondent no. 2-\n      University to examine such a complaint, dons the mantle of the\n      inquiring authority and is expected to conduct an inquiry in\n      accordance with the procedure prescribed in the rules, as far as\n      may be practicable. The use of the expression “as far as is\n      practicable” indicates a play in the joints available to the\n      Complaints Committee to adopt a fair procedure that is feasible\n      and elastic for conducting an inquiry in a sensitive matter like\n      sexual harassment at the workplace, without compromising on\n      the principles of natural justice.

They must\n      examine the entire material to determine the genuineness of the\n      complaint. The statement of the victim must be appreciated in the\n      background of the entire case. Where the evidence of the victim\n      inspires confidence, as is the position in the instant case, the\n      courts are obliged to rely on it. Such cases are required to be\n      dealt with great sensitivity. Sympathy in such cases in favour of\n      the superior officer is wholly misplaced and mercy has no\n      relevance. The High Court overlooked the ground realities and\n      ignored the fact that the conduct of the respondent against his\n      junior female employee, Miss X, was wholly against moral\n      sanctions, decency and was offensive to her modesty. Reduction\n      of punishment in a case like this is bound to have demoralising\n      effect on the women employees and is a retrograde step. There\n      was no justification for the High Court to interfere with the\n      punishment imposed by the departmental authorities.

Mudrika Singh</a> reported in 2021\n\nSCC OnLine SC 1173, this Court speaking through one of us Dr. D.Y.\n\nChandrachud, CJI., cautioned the courts from invalidating inquiries into sexual\n\nharassment on specious pleas and hyper-technical interpretations of the service\n\nrules. The relevant observations are reproduced hereunder: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">      “47. Before we conclude our analysis, we would also like to\n      highlight a rising trend of invalidation of proceedings inquiring into\n      sexual misconduct, on hyper-technical interpretations of the\n      applicable service rules. For instance, the Sexual Harassment of\n      Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act\n      2013 penalizes several misconducts of a sexual nature and imposes\n      a mandate on all public and private organizations to create\n      adequate mechanisms for redressal. However, the existence of\n      transformative legislation may not come to the aid of persons\n      aggrieved of sexual harassment if the appellate mechanisms turn\n      the process into a punishment. It is important that courts uphold the\n      spirit of the right against sexual harassment, which is vested in all\n      persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is also important to be mindful of\n      the power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the\n      workplace. There are several considerations and deterrents that a\n      subordinate aggrieved of sexual harassment has to face when they\n      consider reporting sexual misconduct of their superior. In the\n      present case, the complainant was a constable complaining against\n      the respondent who was the head constable - his superior. Without\n      commenting on the merits of the case, it is evident that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                       Page 64 of 104</span>\n\f         discrepancy regarding the date of occurrence was of a minor nature\n         since the event occurred soon after midnight and on the next day.\n         Deeming such a trivial aspect to be of monumental relevance, while\n         invalidating the entirety of the disciplinary proceedings against the\n         respondent and reinstating him to his position renders the\n         complainant&#x27;s remedy at nought. The history of legal proceedings\n         such as these is a major factor that contributes to the deterrence\n         that civil and criminal mechanisms pose to persons aggrieved of\n         sexual harassment. The High Court, in this case, was not only\n         incorrect in its interpretation of the jurisdiction of the Commandant\n         and the obligation of the SSFC to furnish reasons under the <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_66\">BSF\n         Act</a> 1968 and Rules therein, but also demonstrated a callous attitude\n         to the gravamen of the proceedings. We implore courts to interpret\n         service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of\n         sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out\n         procedural and substantive justice to all the parties.”\n                                                        (Emphasis supplied)\n\nE.2      Whether the Central Complaints Committee could have looked into\n         the second complaint dated 18.09.2012?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">45.      The High Court in its impugned judgment observed that the Disciplinary\n\nAuthority had constituted the Central Complaints Committee on the basis of the\n\ncomplaint filed by the victim. Since, at the time when the Central Complaints\n\nCommittee came to be constituted, there was only one complaint i.e., the\n\ncomplainant’s first complaint dated 30.08.2011, it necessarily meant that the\n\nCentral Complaints Committee was mandated and empowered to inquire into only\n\nthat complaint to which the committee owed its existence or in other words, the\n\ncomplaint that was before the Disciplinary Authority which led the authority to\n\ntake the decision of constituting the Central Complaints Committee in the first\n\nplace.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">46.      At this juncture, it would be apposite to refer to the 2006 Standing Order\n\nmore particularly Clause 10(i), which prescribes the first step for making a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                         Page 65 of 104</span>\n\fcomplaint of sexual harassment and provides how the complaint and redressal\n\nmechanism for sexual harassment is set-into motion. The said provision is being\n\nreproduced below: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">      “10. COMPLAINT MECHANISM\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">      i) Any person aggrieved shall prefer a complaint before the\n      Complaints Committee at the earliest point of time.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">47.   A bare perusal of the aforementioned provision makes it abundantly clear\n\nthat the complaint mechanism begins with a complaint being made to the\n\n“complaints committee” and as such any inquiry into the complaint of sexual\n\nharassment under Rule 14 of the 1965 CCS Rules read with the 2006 Standing\n\nOrder begins the moment any complaint is made to a complaints committee\n\nspecified in Clause 9, be it a Frontier Complaints Committee or a Central\n\nComplaints Committee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">48.   The use of the words “Any person aggrieved shall prefer a complaint before\n\nthe Complaints Committee at the earliest point of time” connotes two pertinent\n\naspects; (i) first, that the word “prefer” stipulates that the said provision is an\n\nenabling provision that permits a person from making a complaint of sexual\n\nharassment directly to the complaints committee which is the designated\n\ncommittee for looking into such complaints and (ii) secondly, the said provision\n\ncontains nothing which could be construed to inhibit the filing of a subsequent or\n\nadditional complaint before the complaints committee.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                                     Page 66 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_183\">\f49.    What emerges from the aforesaid is that irrespective of whether a prior\n\ncomplaint had already been made to any authority, a complaint regarding sexual\n\nharassment could be made under Clause 10(i) of the 2006 Standing Order to the\n\ncomplaints committee as-well. Whether the additional or second complaint should\n\nbe entertained by the complaints committee is a completely different tangent and\n\nmust be ascertained on the touchstone of whether it was filed at the earliest point\n\nof time and whether the same has been mischievously filed at a belated stage to\n\ncause prejudice to the person-charged. In the instant case, the Central Complaints\n\nCommittee was constituted on 06.08.2012 and its first hearing took place on\n\n25.09.2012 whereas the second complaint had been filed by the complainant before\n\nthe Central Complaints Committee on 18.09.2012. Thus, the second complaint had\n\nbeen promptly preferred right after the Central Complaints Committee was\n\nconstituted and duly before its first hearing.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">50.    The High Court’s reasoning that as the Central Complaints Committee was\n\nconstituted on the basis of the first complaint, its scope of inquiry was restricted to\n\nits content, is completely erroneous inasmuch as the Central Complaints\n\nCommittee owed its existence to the 2006 Standing Order and not to the complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_185\">Moreover, even if it is assumed for a moment that the complaints committee owed\n\nits existence to the complaint, Clause 10(i) of the 2006 Standing Order envisages\n\nfiling of a complaint to the complaints committee i.e., it envisages a situation where\n\nafter a complaints committee had come into existence, a complaint may be\n\npreferred to it.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                         Page 67 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">\f51.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1397649\" id=\"span_95\">In the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1397649/\" id=\"a_67\">State\n\nof Haryana and Another v. Rattan Singh</a> reported in (1977) 2 SCC 491, wherein\n\nthe Court held that all material that are logically probative to a prudent mind ought\n\nto be permissible in disciplinary proceedings keeping in mind the principles of fair\n\nplay. The relevant observations are reproduced below: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">       “4. It is well settled that in a domestic enquiry the strict and\n       sophisticated rules of evidence under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_68\">Indian Evidence Act</a> may\n       not apply. All materials which are logically probative for a prudent\n       mind are permissible. There is no allergy to hearsay evidence\n       provided it has reasonable nexus and credibility. It is true that\n       departmental authorities and administrative tribunals must be\n       careful in evaluating such material and should not glibly swallow\n       what is strictly speaking not relevant under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_69\">Indian Evidence\n       Act</a>. For this proposition it is not necessary to cite decisions nor\n       text books, although we have been taken through case law and\n       other authorities by counsel on both sides. The essence of a\n       judicial approach is objectivity, exclusion of extraneous materials\n       or considerations and observance of rules of natural justice. Of\n       course, fairplay is the basis and if perversity or arbitrariness, bias\n       or surrender of independence of judgment vitiate the conclusions\n       reached, such finding, even though of a domestic tribunal, cannot\n       be held good. However, the courts below misdirected themselves,\n       perhaps, in insisting that passengers who had come in and gone\n       out should be chased and brought before the tribunal before a\n       valid finding could be recorded. The ‘residuum’ rule to which\n       counsel for the respondent referred, based upon certain passages\n       from American Jurisprudence does not go to that extent nor does\n       the passage from Halsbury insist on such rigid requirement. The\n       simple point is, was there some evidence or was there no evidence\n       — not in the sense of the technical rules governing regular court\n       proceedings but in a fair commonsense way as men of\n       understanding and worldly wisdom will accept. Viewed in this\n       way, sufficiency of evidence in proof of the finding by a domestic\n       tribunal is beyond scrutiny. Absence of any evidence in support of\n       a finding is certainly available for the court to look into because it\n       amounts to an error of law apparent on the record.”\n\n                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                                        Page 68 of 104</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">\f52.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1397649\" id=\"span_97\">In view of this unequivocal and clear proposition of law set out in <a href=\"/doc/1397649/\" id=\"a_70\">Rattan\n\nSingh</a> (supra), it could be said that there was no legal bar on the Central Complaints\n\nCommittee to look into the allegations levelled in the second complaint dated 18.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">09.2012. Since strict and technical rule of evidence and procedure does not apply\n\nto departmental enquiry the connotation “evidence” cannot be understood in a\n\nnarrow technical sense as to include only that evidence adduced in a regular court\n\nof law when a person is examined as a witness by administering oath.

It means that he must not spin a coin or consult an\n        astrologer, but that he must take into account any material which,\n        as a matter of reason, has some probative value. If it is capable of\n        having any probative value, the weight to be attached to it is a\n        matter for the person to whom Parliament has entrusted the\n        responsibility of deciding the issue.

From the above case law, it becomes clear that it is open to the adjudicating\n\nauthority to accept, rely and evaluate any evidence having probative value and\n\ncome to its own conclusion, keeping in mind judicial approach and objectivity,\n\nexclusion of extraneous material and observance of the rule of natural justice and\n\nfair play.

The\n\nHigh Court should not exercise appellate powers and substitute its findings for the\n\nfindings recorded by the disciplinary authority. It is no doubt true that if there is\n\n“no evidence” or the decision is “so unreasonable that no reasonable man could\n\nhave ever come to it”, or the decision is “so outrageous” in its defiance of logic or\n\nof accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to\n\nthe question to be decided could have arrived at it “or that it is so absurd that one\n\nis satisfied that the decision-maker must have taken leave of his senses”, it calls for\n\ninterference by a competent court of law.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"856194\" id=\"span_99\">55.

Does it mean that any and every violation of the\nregulations renders the enquiry and the punishment\nvoid or whether the principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/94712671/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 99</a> CPC and\n<a href=\"/doc/338903/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 465</a> CrPC is applicable in the case of disciplinary\nproceedings as well. In our opinion, the test in such cases should\nbe one of prejudice, as would be later explained in this judgment.\nBut this statement is subject to a rider. The regulations may\ncontain certain substantive provisions, e.g., who is the competent\nauthority to impose a particular punishment on a particular\nemployee/officer. Such provisions must be strictly complied with.\nBut there may be any number of procedural provisions which\nstand on a different footing. We must hasten to add that even\namong procedural provisions, there may be some provisions\nwhich are of a fundamental nature in the case of which the theory\nof substantial compliance may not be applicable. For example,\ntake a case where a rule expressly provides that the delinquent\nofficer/employee shall be given an opportunity to produce\nevidence/material in support of his case after the close of\nevidence of the other side. If no such opportunity is given at all\nin spite of a request therefor, it will be difficult to say that the\nenquiry is not vitiated. But in respect of many procedural\nprovisions, it would be possible to apply the theory of substantial\ncompliance or the test of prejudice, as the case may be. The\nposition can be stated in the following words: (1) Regulations\nwhich are of a substantive nature have to be complied with and\nin case of such provisions, the theory of substantial compliance\nwould not be available. (2) Even among procedural provisions,\nthere may be some provisions of a fundamental nature which\nhave to be complied with and in whose case, the theory of\nsubstantial compliance may not be available. (3) In respect of\nprocedural provisions other than of a fundamental nature, the\ntheory of substantial compliance would be available. In such\ncases, complaint/objection on this score have to be judged on the\ntouchstone of prejudice, as explained later in this judgment. In\nother words, the test is: all things taken together whether the\ndelinquent officer/employee had or did not have a fair hearing.\nWe may clarify that which provision falls in which of the\naforesaid categories is a matter to be decided in each case\nhaving regard to the nature and character of the relevant\nprovision.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">      xxx                        xxx                        xxx\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                                  Page 72 of 104</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">\f28. … In our respectful opinion, the principles emerging from the\ndecided cases can be stated in the following terms in relation to\nthe disciplinary orders and enquiries: a distinction ought to be\nmade between violation of the principle of natural justice, audi\nalteram partem, as such and violation of a facet of the said\nprinciple. In other words, distinction is between “no notice”/“no\nhearing” and “no adequate hearing” or to put it in different\nwords, “no opportunity” and “no adequate opportunity”. To\nillustrate — take a case where the person is dismissed from\nservice      without      hearing       him     altogether       (as\nin Ridge v. Baldwin [1964 AC 40 : (1963) 2 All ER 66 : (1963) 2\nWLR 935] ). It would be a case falling under the first category\nand the order of dismissal would be invalid — or void, if one\nchooses to use that expression (Calvin v.

Tripathi [(1984)\n1 SCC 43 : 1984 SCC (L&amp;S) 62] ) it would be a case falling in\nthe latter category — violation of a facet of the said rule of\nnatural justice — in which case, the validity of the order has to\nbe tested on the touchstone of prejudice, i.e., whether, all in all,\nthe person concerned did or did not have a fair hearing. It would\nnot be correct — in the light of the above decisions to say that for\nany and every violation of a facet of natural justice or of a rule\nincorporating such facet, the order passed is altogether void and\nought to be set aside without further enquiry.

The Court or the Tribunal should\n      enquire whether (a) the provision violated is of a\n      substantive nature or (b) whether it is procedural in\n      character.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_193\">      (2) A substantive provision has normally to be\n      complied with as explained hereinbefore and the theory of\n      substantial compliance or the test of prejudice would not\n      be applicable in such a case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">      (3) In the case of violation of a procedural provision,\n      the position is this: procedural provisions are generally\n      meant for affording a reasonable and adequate\n      opportunity to the delinquent officer/employee. They are,\n      generally speaking, conceived in his interest. Violation of\n      any and every procedural provision cannot be said to\n      automatically vitiate the enquiry held or order passed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">      Except cases falling under — “no notice”, “no\n      opportunity” and “no hearing” categories, the complaint\n      of violation of procedural provision should be examined\n      from the point of view of prejudice, viz., whether such\n      violation has prejudiced the delinquent officer/employee\n      in defending himself properly and effectively. If it is found\n      that he has been so prejudiced, appropriate orders have to\n      be made to repair and remedy the prejudice including\n      setting aside the enquiry and/or the order of punishment.\n      If no prejudice is established to have resulted therefrom, it\n      is obvious, no interference is called for. In this connection,\n      it may be remembered that there may be certain\n      procedural provisions which are of a fundamental\n      character, whose violation is by itself proof of prejudice.\n      The Court may not insist on proof of prejudice in such\n      cases. As explained in the body of the judgment, take a\n      case where there is a provision expressly providing that\n      after the evidence of the employer/government is over, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                                                  Page 74 of 104</span>\n\femployee shall be given an opportunity to lead defence in\nhis evidence, and in a given case, the enquiry officer does\nnot give that opportunity in spite of the delinquent\nofficer/employee asking for it. The prejudice is self-\nevident. No proof of prejudice as such need be called for\nin such a case. To repeat, the test is one of prejudice, i.e.,\nwhether the person has received a fair hearing\nconsidering all things. Now, this very aspect can also be\nlooked at from the point of view of directory and\nmandatory provisions, if one is so inclined. The principle\nstated under (4) hereinbelow is only another way of\nlooking at the same aspect as is dealt with herein and not\na different or distinct principle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">(4)(a) In the case of a procedural provision which is not of\na mandatory character, the complaint of violation has to\nbe examined from the standpoint of substantial\ncompliance. Be that as it may, the order passed in violation\nof such a provision can be set aside only where such\nviolation has occasioned prejudice to the delinquent\nemployee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">(b) In the case of violation of a procedural provision,\nwhich is of a mandatory character, it has to be ascertained\nwhether the provision is conceived in the interest of the\nperson proceeded against or in public interest. If it is\nfound to be the former, then it must be seen whether the\ndelinquent officer has waived the said requirement, either\nexpressly or by his conduct. If he is found to have waived\nit, then the order of punishment cannot be set aside on the\nground of the said violation. If, on the other hand, it is\nfound that the delinquent officer/employee has not waived\nit or that the provision could not be waived by him, then\nthe Court or Tribunal should make appropriate directions\n(include the setting aside of the order of punishment),\nkeeping in mind the approach adopted by the Constitution\nBench in B. Karunakar [(1993) 4 SCC 727 : 1993 SCC\n(L&amp;S) 1184 : (1993) 25 ATC 704] . The ultimate test is\nalways the same, viz., test of prejudice or the test of fair\nhearing, as it may be called.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">(5) Where the enquiry is not governed by any\nrules/regulations/statutory provisions and the only\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                                            Page 75 of 104</span>\n\fobligation is to observe the principles of natural justice —\nor, for that matter, wherever such principles are held to be\nimplied by the very nature and impact of the order/action\n— the Court or the Tribunal should make a distinction\nbetween a total violation of natural justice (rule of audi\nalteram partem) and violation of a facet of the said rule,\nas explained in the body of the judgment. In other words,\na distinction must be made between “no opportunity” and\nno adequate opportunity, i.e., between “no notice”/“no\nhearing” and “no fair hearing”. (a) In the case of former,\nthe order passed would undoubtedly be invalid (one may\ncall it ‘void’ or a nullity if one chooses to). In such cases,\nnormally, liberty will be reserved for the Authority to take\nproceedings afresh according to law, i.e., in accordance\nwith the said rule (audi alteram partem). (b) But in the\nlatter case, the effect of violation (of a facet of the rule of\naudi alteram partem) has to be examined from the\nstandpoint of prejudice; in other words, what the Court or\nTribunal has to see is whether in the totality of the\ncircumstances, the delinquent officer/employee did or did\nnot have a fair hearing and the orders to be made shall\ndepend upon the answer to the said query. [It is made clear\nthat this principle (No. 5) does not apply in the case of rule\nagainst bias, the test in which behalf are laid down\nelsewhere.]\n\n(6) While applying the rule of audi alteram partem (the\nprimary       principle     of    natural     justice)    the\nCourt/Tribunal/Authority must always bear in mind the\nultimate and overriding objective underlying the said rule,\nviz., to ensure a fair hearing and to ensure that there is no\nfailure of justice. It is this objective which should guide\nthem in applying the rule to varying situations that arise\nbefore them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\">(7) There may be situations where the interests of State\nor public interest may call for a curtailing of the rule of\naudi alteram partem.

The matter may be examined from another viewpoint. There\n       may be cases where there are infractions of statutory provisions,\n       rules and regulations. Can it be said that every such infraction\n       would make the consequent action void and/or invalid? The statute\n       may contain certain substantive provisions, e.g., who is the\n       competent authority to impose a particular punishment on a\n       particular employee. Such provision must be strictly complied with\n       as in these cases the theory of substantial compliance may not be\n       available. For example, where a rule specifically provides that the\n       delinquent officer shall be given an opportunity to produce\n       evidence in support of his case after the close of the evidence of\n       the other side and if no such opportunity is given, it would not be\n       possible to say that the enquiry was not vitiated.

The answer to this question has to be relative to\n      the punishment awarded. When the employee is dismissed or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                                                      Page 79 of 104</span>\n\f      removed from service and the inquiry is set aside because the\n      report is not furnished to him, in some cases the non-furnishing of\n      the report may have prejudiced him gravely while in other cases it\n      may have made no difference to the ultimate punishment awarded\n      to him. Hence to direct reinstatement of the employee with back-\n      wages in all cases is to reduce the rules of justice to a mechanical\n      ritual. The theory of reasonable opportunity and the principles of\n      natural justice have been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to\n      assist the individual to vindicate his just rights. They are not\n      incantations to be invoked nor rites to be performed on all and\n      sundry occasions.

The answer to\n\nthis has to be an emphatic “No”. We say so because the respondent had denied all\n\nthe ten charges which were framed against him. In other words, the respondent\n\nanswered to all the ten points by way of his written statement of defence and even\n\nhad an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses on each of the charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">66.   We are of the view that the High Court completely failed to advert itself to\n\nthe principles <a href=\"/doc/1246653/\" id=\"a_79\">laid down by</a> this Court as aforesaid, and mechanically proceeded to\n\nset-aside the order of punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority on the\n\nground that there was nothing to indicate that the respondent was asked whether\n\nhe pleaded guilty to the charges imputed in the second complaint without applying\n\nthe principle of “test of prejudice”.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">E.3   Whether the Central Complaints Committee could have put questions\n      to the witnesses in a departmental inquiry?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">i)    “Fact Finding” Authority in Disciplinary Proceedings\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">67.   The High Court observed that the Central Complaints Committee in the\n\ncourse of the inquiry had put questions to the prosecution witnesses, and even the\n\nexamination-in-chief was recorded by it, and as such it played the role of a\n\nprosecutor which it could not have, thereby vitiating the inquiry proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_215\">68.   Ordinarily, in a disciplinary proceeding conducted under Rule 14 of the 1965\n\nCCS Rules, the disciplinary authority as per Rule 14 sub-rule 2 read with sub-rule\n\n5(c) may either conduct the inquiry itself or appoint an inquiry committee to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                     Page 81 of 104</span>\n\fconduct the inquiry. The inquiry committee may further appoint a presenting\n\nofficer to present the case on its behalf in support of the articles of charge. It is\n\nworthwhile to note that it is the Inquiry Authority and the Disciplinary Authority\n\nwho are the fact finding authorities in a disciplinary proceeding. Rule 14 is\n\nreproduced below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">      “14. Procedure for imposing major penalties.\n      (2) Whenever the disciplinary authority is of the opinion that\n      there are grounds for inquiring into the truth of any imputation\n      of misconduct or misbehaviour against a Government servant, it\n      may itself inquire into, or appoint under this rule or under the\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1774870/\" id=\"a_80\">Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1850</a>, as the\n      case may be, an authority to inquire into the truth thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">                    xxx                xxx                 xxx\n      (5)(c) Where the disciplinary authority itself inquires into any\n      article of charge or appoints an inquiring authority for holding\n      an inquiry into such charge, it may, by an order, appoint a\n      Government servant or a legal practitioner, to be known as the\n      &quot;Presenting Officer&quot; to present on its behalf the case in support\n      of the articles of charge.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">69.   A perusal of the aforesaid makes it clear that, where a ‘Presenting Officer’\n\nhas been appointed by the Disciplinary Authority, such Officer shall present the\n\ncase in support of the articles of charge. Conversely, what logically transpires from\n\nthe aforesaid is that, where no presenting officer has been appointed, the duty or\n\nrole to present the case in support of the articles of charge falls back on the\n\nDisciplinary Authority or the Inquiry Authority as the case may be.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48293767\" id=\"span_117\">70.

Often the victims during their testimony were\n\nput embarrassing questions by accused with the sole purpose of confusing or\n\nsuppressing out of shame. To remedy this, directions were issued by this Court that\n\nfor cross-examination of victims, the question would be given to the presiding\n\nofficer who in turn would ask them in clear language which is not embarrassing.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">The relevant observations are reproduced below: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">      “32. The mere sight of the accused may induce an element of\n      extreme fear in the mind of the victim or the witnesses or can put\n      them in a state of shock. In such a situation he or she may not be\n      able to give full details of the incident which may result in\n      miscarriage of justice. Therefore, a screen or some such\n      arrangement can be made where the victim or witnesses do not\n      have to undergo the trauma of seeing the body or the face of the\n      accused. Often the questions put in cross-examination are\n      purposely designed to embarrass or confuse the victims of rape\n      and child abuse. The object is that out of the feeling of shame or\n      embarrassment, the victim may not speak out or give details of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                                       Page 83 of 104</span>\n\f      certain acts committed by the accused. It will, therefore, be better\n      if the questions to be put by the accused in cross-examination are\n      given in writing to the presiding officer of the court, who may put\n      the same to the victim or witnesses in a language which is not\n      embarrassing. There can hardly be any objection to the other\n      suggestion given by the petitioner that whenever a child or victim\n      of rape is required to give testimony, sufficient breaks should be\n      given as and when required.

There appears to be neither any statutory bar nor any logic to restrict the\n\npower of the complaints committee to put questions to the witnesses only to the\n\ncontext enumerated in the aforesaid provision.

Even otherwise, the aforesaid issue has been answered by this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/108065727/\" id=\"a_92\">Pravin Kumar v. Union of India and Others</a> reported in (2020) 9 SCC 471. The\n\nvery same argument was canvassed before a three-Judge Bench that the Inquiry\n\nOfficer could not have put his own questions to the prosecution witnesses and could\n\nalso have not cross-examined the witnesses. In the said case, it was argued that the\n\nsame would amount to making the prosecutor the judge. This argument was\n\nnegatived by the Court observing in para 31 as under:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">       “31. Significant emphasis has been placed by the appellant on\n       the fact that the enquiry officer put his own questions to the\n       prosecution witness and that he cross-examined the witnesses\n       brought forth by the defence. This, it is claimed, amounts to\n       making the prosecutor the Judge, in violation of the natural\n       justice principle of “nemo judex in sua causa”. However, such a\n       plea is misplaced. It must be recognised that, under <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 165</a>,\n       Evidence Act, Judges have the power to ask any question to any\n       witness or party about any fact, in order to discover or to obtain\n       proper proof of relevant facts. While strict rules of evidence are\n       inapplicable to disciplinary proceedings, enquiry officers often\n       put questions to witnesses in such proceedings in order to\n       discover the truth. Indeed, it may be necessary to do such direct\n       questioning in certain circumstances. Further, the learned\n       counsel for the appellant, except for making a bald allegation\n       that the enquiry officer has questioned the witnesses, did not\n       point to any specific question put by the officer that would\n       indicate that he had exceeded his jurisdiction. No specific malice\n       or bias has been alleged against the enquiry officer, and even\n       during the enquiry no request had been made to seek a\n       replacement, thus, evidencing how these objections are nothing\n       but an afterthought.”\n                                                    (Emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                                      Page 86 of 104</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">\f77.   If <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 165</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 permits a Judge to put\n\nquestions to the parties or to the witnesses in order to discover or obtain proper\n\nproof of relevant facts and this provision being widely used by the judges\n\nthroughout the country, we fail to understand as to how the complaints committee\n\nafter being equated with a judge in a judicial proceeding be denied that privilege.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">However, it would be a different situation if a specific case of personal bias is made\n\nout against the members of the committee. After all, the very purpose of the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings is to reach to the bottom of the fact while affording\n\nadequate opportunities to the affected party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">78.   Thus, the High Court was not correct in taking the view that the proceedings\n\nstood vitiated because the Central Complaints Committee put questions to the\n\nprosecution witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_222\">E.4   Whether the Central Complaints Committee based its findings on\n      conjectures and surmises?

It is well settled that the findings of fact recorded in the course of any\n\ndomestic inquiry, unless they are collateral or jurisdictional, are exempt from\n\njudicial review and that the court exercising writ jurisdiction should not sit in\n\nappeal over the ultimate decision based on such findings and review it on merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">However, there are two well-known exceptions to the said rule. First, the case must\n\nnot be one where there is “no evidence” to support the findings. Secondly, the\n\nultimate decision based on such findings must not be perverse or unreasonable.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                        Page 87 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">\fThese two concepts have affinity with each other; indeed, the “no evidence”\n\nprinciple clearly has something in common with the principle that perverse or\n\nunreasonable action is unauthorised and ultra vires. As pointed out by Lord\n\nRadcliffe in Edward (Inspector of Taxes, Bairstow. (1956) Appeal Cases, 14 at\n\npage 36 “I do not think that it much matters whether this state of affairs is described\n\nas one in which there is no evidence to support the determination or as one in\n\nwhich the evidence is inconsistent with and contradictory of the determination, or\n\nas one in which the true and only reasonable conclusion contradicts the\n\ndetermination.” Rightly understood, each phrase propounds the same test, in each\n\nof these cases, according to Lord Radcliffe, there would be an error in point of law\n\nrequiring the court&#x27;s intervention.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">80.   We must explain the true meaning of the ‘no evidence’ principle. The rule\n\nhas been adopted in India from England and we may, therefore, ascertain, in the\n\nfirst instance, how the rule over there is understood. Prof. H.W.R. Wade in his\n\ntreatise on Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, has observed as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">        “It is one thing to weigh conflicting evidence which might justify\n        a conclusion either way. It is another thing altogether to make\n        insupportable findings. This is an abuse of power and may\n        cause grave injustice. At this point, therefore, the court is\n        disposed to intervene.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">        ‘No evidence’ does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It\n        extends to any case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not\n        reasonably capable of supporting the finding; or where, in other\n        words, no tribunal could reasonably reach that conclusion on\n        that evidence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">        There is, indeed, the well-established rule that to find facts on no\n        evidence is to err in law.”\n                                                      (Emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                                         Page 88 of 104</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">\f81.   The learned Author has pointed out that the “no evidence” rule has some\n\naffinity with the substantial evidence rule of American law which, as explained by\n\nBernard Schwartz in his treatise on Administrative Law, 1976 Edition, at page 595,\n\nmeans “such evidence as might lead a reasonable person to make finding.” In other\n\nwords, according to the learned Author, “The evidence in support of a fact-finding\n\nis substantial when from it an inference of existence of the fact may be drawn\n\nreasonably.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">82.   The earliest English decision which has touched upon the concept of “no\n\nevidence” is that of the Court of Appeal in The King v. Carson Roberts reported\n\nin 1908 (1) K.B., 407. The question in that case was whether the superior court\n\nhaving the power to issue a writ of certiorari, if it appeared to it that the decision\n\nof the auditor in regard to disallowances and surcharges, under the Public Health\n\nAct, 1875, was erroneous, could review the same only when such decision was\n\nerroneous in point of law and not when the auditor had come to an erroneous\n\nconclusion in fact. Fletcher Moulton L.J. observed in that case as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">       “It is admitted by the appellant that if there was no evidence on\n       which any tribunal could reasonably come to the conclusion to\n       which the auditor has come the superior Courts have a\n       jurisdiction to quash the surcharge, and in my opinion this is the\n       case here.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">83.   In the Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner (supra), two learned law\n\nLords have made certain observations on the true content of the “no evidence” rule\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                                        Page 89 of 104</span>\n\fby treating the said rule as a principle of natural justice. Willmar L.J. observed as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">          “Where so much is left to the discretion of the Commissioner,\n          the only real limitation, as I see it, is that the procedure must be\n          in accordance with natural justice.

The\n\nSecretary of State accepted the findings of fact recorded by the Inspector at the\n\nconclusion of the public inquiry which followed the Borough Council&#x27;s refusal of\n\npermission but not his recommendation that the appeal should be allowed. The\n\nSecretary of State, in deciding the appeal, took into consideration the contents of a\n\ndocument and accepted them as correct, notwithstanding the fact that the Inspector\n\nhad regarded the document as of no evidential value. The argument before Willis\n\nJ. was that the Secretary of State should have ignored the document, or any\n\nreference to its contents, as the Inspector did, since it was not produced by any\n\nwitness, its provenance was unexplained and it could not be tested by cross-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">examination.

Nonetheless some limit must surely be\n       imposed in fairness to an appellant on the scope of so-called\n       evidence which by no stretch of the imagination can be said to have\n       the slightest evidential value. This must, I should have thought,\n       particularly be so when if such ‘evidence’ is considered, it is used\n       to support a conclusion unfavourable to the appellant.

It is only on the\n\nissue of point 7(a) that the High Court seems to have taken the view that the\n\nfindings in that regard are based on conjecture and surmises.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">96.   The High Court took the view that in respect of the allegations contained in\n\nPoint 7(a) which relates to the respondent making unsolicited phone calls to the\n\ncomplainant, although no evidence of the call recordings had been produced to\n\nsubstantiate the same, yet the Central Complaints Committee accepted the\n\nallegations as true, and therefore its findings could be said to be based on\n\nconjectures and surmises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_248\">97.   The aforesaid in our opinion is not correct. The allegation in Point 7(a) was\n\nrightly accepted by the Central Complaints Committee keeping in mind the\n\nbackground of the case. The Central Complaints Committed duly noted that the\n\nnon-availability of the call records was owed to the fact that the inquiry into the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                                                      Page 100 of 104</span>\n\fcomplainant’s grievances was undertaken after a lapse of significant time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_249\">Moreover, the said finding is fortified by the oral evidence of one of the witnesses\n\nwho deposed that he was aware of the respondent making calls to the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">The relevant portion is reproduced below: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_247\">       “POINT 7\n       “x. … Shri Samir Nandi has also stated that he knew that Shri\n       Dilip Paul was calling Smt.

The Complaints Committee made every effort to substantiate\n       the charge that Shri Dilip Paul often telephoned Smt. X, and that\n       too at odd hours, but since call records for Shri Dilip Paul&#x27;s\n       mobile phone were not available and Smt.

The Complaints Committee also notes that the unavailability\n       of corroboration from call records cannot be laid at Smt.

Before we close this judgement, we must deal with one submission very\n\nvociferously canvassed on behalf of the respondent as regards the multiple inquiries\n\nconducted by the appellant. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the\n\nnormal rule is that there can be only one inquiry. It was also submitted that once\n\nthe on-spot / preliminary inquiry revealed nothing incriminating against the\n\ndelinquent, no further committee could have been constituted to inquire into the\n\nallegations once again.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">99.   It was further submitted that even the Frontier Complaints Committee came\n\nto the conclusion that the charges were not held to be proved.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                                                     Page 101 of 104</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">\f100. In such circumstances <a href=\"/doc/856194/\" id=\"a_109\">referred to above</a>, according to the learned counsel,\n\nthe Central Complaints Committee could not have been constituted to probe further\n\ninto the allegations. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"181282031\" id=\"span_149\">In this regard, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/181282031/\" id=\"a_110\">Vijay Shankar Pandey v. Union of India</a> reported in (2014) 10 SCC</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_254\">589.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">101. In the aforesaid context, we may only say that the aforesaid point was raised\n\neven before the High Court and the same came to be negatived holding as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">        “22. The report dated 13.12.2011 was submitted pursuant to\n        conducting of an on-the-spot enquiry. On-the-spot enquiry, by\n        the very nature of it, is summary in nature. Such enquiry cannot\n        be equated with a disciplinary enquiry. It will be relevant to note\n        that before the report of the on-the-spot enquiry was submitted,\n        the competent authority had constituted FLCC, which had also\n        commenced its proceedings. In that context, even if in such an\n        on-the-spot enquiry, no allegation was found to have been\n        established, same would not have any material bearing in the\n        facts of the instant case. It is not in dispute that the petitioner was\n        posted at the frontier and, accordingly, in terms of the Standing\n        Order No. 1/06, FLCC was constituted to enquire into the\n        allegation of sexual harassment. As noticed earlier, though the\n        FLCC had submitted report on 17.01.2012, the same was\n        cancelled by Memorandum dated 10.12.2012 on the ground that\n        the Chairperson of the FLCC was not an officer who was senior\n        to the petitioner against whom the complaint was made.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">        23. We are unable to subscribe to the submission of the learned\n        counsel for the petitioner that report of FLCC could not have\n        been cancelled and the report was required to be acted upon as\n        the Chairperson of the FLCC being from a different stream, the\n        question of comparison of seniority did not arise. It is not the\n        contention of the petitioner that the Chairperson was, indeed,\n        higher in rank than the petitioner. Therefore, the significance of\n        appropriate constitution of the Complaints Committee, in terms\n        of the norms laid down, cannot be lost sight of. True, the\n        authorities themselves had constituted the Complaints\n        Committee, but the fact by itself cannot detract the competent\n        authority from cancelling the proceeding or the report of an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                                                          Page 102 of 104</span>\n\f       improperly constituted committee. It was in this background the\n       CCC had come into the picture. Though earlier the FLCC had\n       conducted enquiry, we find that the CCC can also enquire into\n       any matter of sexual abuse in the organization which necessarily\n       includes the frontier also and, therefore, it cannot be said that\n       the CCC could not have exercised authority in the instant case.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"856194\" id=\"span_151\">The decision in <a href=\"/doc/856194/\" id=\"a_111\">K.

It was also observed that disciplinary\n       authority in terms of the rules had enough power to reconsider\n       the evidence and come to its own conclusion.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"856194\" id=\"span_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"181282031\" id=\"span_154\">In <a href=\"/doc/181282031/\" id=\"a_113\">Vijay Shankar\n       Pandey</a> (supra), the Supreme Court followed <a href=\"/doc/856194/\" id=\"a_114\">K.R.

Materials on record do not indicate that at the time of\n       submission of the complaint dated 30.08.2011, there was any\n       specific Complaints Committee in place and on the contrary, it\n       appears that only after the complaint was received by the\n       authority, FLCC was constituted to go into the complaint.
