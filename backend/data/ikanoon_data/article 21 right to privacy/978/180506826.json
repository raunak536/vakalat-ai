Subsequently,\n\n                  based on the results of the written examination, a list of provisionally admitted\n\n                  candidates      for   on-screen   certificate   verification   was    published     on    the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                  Page 5/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                            W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  Commission’s website on 22.02.2023.

Additionally, W.P.No.7141 of 2023 was filed for a direction\n\n                  to TNPSC to disclose the reasons for not including the petitioner&#x27;s register number\n\n                  and enable him to rectify the technical defects, if any, and permit him to attend\n\n                  oral test. Furthermore, W.P.No.7414 of 2023 was filed to direct the TNPSC to\n\n                  include the petitioner&#x27;s register number in the list of numbers provisionally\n\n                  admitted to on-screen certificate verification.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                             4.3.

On the very same day, the learned Judge disposed of other two writ\n\n                  petitions viz., W.P.Nos.7414 and 7934 of 2023, in the same lines as that of the\n\n                  order in W.P.Nos.7141, 7486 and 8059 of 2023. However, there was a deviation\n\n                  in one aspect, with respect to direction no.(ii), which was replaced with the\n\n                  instruction that &quot;in the event of the said petitioners fail to produce the required\n\n                  documents on the specified dates, their respective applications shall be treated as\n\n                  rejected for not producing proof for the required qualification for the post.&quot; This\n\n                  modification was made, since these cases pertain to rejection of candidatures for\n\n                  not uploading the UG certificate. Similar W.P.No.7718 of 2023 came to be\n\n                  disposed of, on 20.03.2023, with the following direction:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                  Page 8/89</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                   W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                                    &quot;7.     At the same time, such rejection of the application of the\n                            Petitioner would only disentitle him to claim the benefit of reservation\n                            under the category of persons who studied through Tamil Medium, but\n                            would not deprive him of the right to be treated as general candidate\n                            entitled to participate in the recruitment in open competition category.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                            This would obviously mean that it is incumbent upon the Respondent to\n                            call upon the Petitioner through SMS, e-mail and publication in its official\n                            website to appear for oral interview along with all required documents on\n                            a specified date for verification, and consider him for appointment as if his\n                            name had been included in the list of candidates provisionally admitted to\n                            on-screen certificate verification.

Exercise of the power of relaxation without informing the\n                            candidates about the existence of such power would be detrimental to the\n                            interests of others who did not possess the certificate and did not take\n                            part in the selection process. We are unable to accept the submission that\n                            selection is on the basis of the performance of the candidates in the\n                            written test and interview and that the DOEACC certificate is not an\n                            essential requirement. The Rule as well as the advertisement provide for\n                            submission of the certificate at the time of interview, compulsorily. The\n                            Rule further provides for production of the certificate as an additional\n                            requirement for selection. The above stipulation in the Rule as well as the\n                            advertisement cannot be Ignored.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">                                      13. On the basis of the said findings, the point that remains to be\n                            considered is whether the High Court was right in upholding the relaxation\n                            in respect of candidates who submitted the certificate before 28-3-2012.\n                            The High Court took note of the fact that the certificates were not being\n                            issued by DOEACC to candidates who had already completed the course.\n                            The learned Division Bench of the High Court was of the opinion that\n                            there was a genuine problem and in the interest of those meritorious\n                            candidates who could not secure the certificate for no fault of theirs, they\n                            could not be penalised. The High Court placed reliance on the judgment of\n                            this Court in Amlan Jyoti Borooah v. State of Assam [Amlan Jyoti Borooah\n                            v.

The question that then arises is whether the High Court could\n                            have granted such a relief after holding that the relaxation of the Rule\n                            could not have been made. The final relief in a case can be different from\n                            the ratio decidendi. It was held in <a href=\"/doc/1509628/\" id=\"a_12\">Sanjay Singh v. U.P.

Broadly speaking, every judgment of superior\n                                   courts has three segments, namely, (i) the facts and the\n                                   point at issue; (ii) the reasons for the decision; and (iii) the\n                                   final order containing the decision. The reasons for the\n                                   decision or the ratio decidendi is not the final order\n                                   containing the decision. In fact, in a judgment of this\n                                   Court, though the ratio decidendi may point to a particular\n                                   result, the decision (final order relating to relief) may be\n                                   different and not a natural consequence of the ratio\n                                   decidendi of the judgment. This may happen either on\n                                   account of any subsequent event or the need to mould the\n                                   relief to do complete justice in the matter. It is the ratio\n                                   decidendi of a judgment and not the final order in the\n                                   judgment, which forms a precedent.”\n                                                                               (emphasis supplied)</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">                           (iii)   P.Prabu      v.

We have considered the entire matter in detail. In our opinion,\n                            it is too well settled to need any further reiteration that all appointments\n                            to public office have to be made in conformity with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 14</a> of the\n                            Constitution of India. In other words, there must be no arbitrariness\n                            resulting from any undue favour being shown to any candidate. Therefore,\n                            the selection process has to be conducted strictly in accordance with the\n                            stipulated selection procedure. Consequently, when a particular schedule\n                            is mentioned in an advertisement, the same has to be scrupulously\n                            maintained. There cannot be any relaxation in the terms and conditions of\n                            the advertisement unless such a power is specifically reserved. Such a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                  Page 17/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                    W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                            power could be reserved in the relevant statutory rules. Even if power of\n                            relaxation is provided in the rules, it must still be mentioned in the\n                            advertisement. In the absence of such power in the rules, it could still be\n                            provided in the advertisement. However, the power of relaxation, if\n                            exercised, has to be given due publicity. This would be necessary to\n                            ensure that those candidates who become eligible due to the relaxation,\n                            are afforded an equal opportunity to apply and compete. Relaxation of\n                            any condition in advertisement without due publication would be contrary\n                            to the mandate of equality contained in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_17\">16</a> of the\n                            Constitution of India.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                                     30. A perusal of the advertisement in this case will clearly show\n                            that there was no power of relaxation. In our opinion, the High Court\n                            committed an error in directing that the condition with regard to the\n                            submission of the disability certificate either along with the application\n                            form or before appearing in the preliminary examination could be. relaxed\n                            in the case of Respondent 1. Such a course would not be permissible as it\n                            would violate the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_19\">16</a> of the Constitution of\n                            India.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">                                     32. In the face of such conclusions, we have little hesitation in\n                            concluding that the conclusion recorded by the High Court is contrary to\n                            the facts and materials on the record. It is settled law that there can be\n                            no relaxation in the terms and conditions contained in the advertisement\n                            unless the power of relaxation is duly reserved in the relevant rules and/or\n                            in the advertisement. Even if there is a power of relaxation in the rules,\n                            the same would still have to be specifically indicated in the advertisement.\n                            In the present case, no such rule has been brought to our notice. In such\n                            circumstances, the High Court could not have issued the impugned\n                            direction to consider the claim of Respondent 1 on the basis of identity\n                            card submitted after the selection process was over, with the publication\n                            of the select list.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">                             5.5.

Mrs.Nalini Chidambaram, learned senior counsel representing Ms.C.Uma,\n\n                  learned counsel appearing for the respondents in W.A Nos.682 and 684 of 2023\n\n                  would submit that there was a list published by the appellant-TNPSC stating the\n\n                  particulars of candidates whose online applications were rejected. Though it was\n\n                  stated that the reasons for rejection would be mentioned in the Annexure, no\n\n                  reasons were found in the Annexure itself. Consequently, candidates were\n\n                  arbitrarily thrown out from the selection process without being informed of the\n\n                  grounds for their rejection, which amounts to violation of the principles of natural\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                  Page 19/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                          W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  justice. The learned senior counsel further submitted that the reasons for\n\n                  rejection pointed out by the TNPSC in the course of writ proceedings was that the\n\n                  respondent in W.A.No.682 of 2023         inadvertently uploaded the certificates\n\n                  certifying that he had studied Standards 9th and 10th in Tamil twice instead of\n\n                  uploading certificates certifying that he had studied Standards 11th and 12th in\n\n                  Tamil. With regard to the respondent in W.A.No.684 of 2023, by mistake he had\n\n                  uploaded PG certificate, instead of UG certificate. According to the learned senior\n\n                  counsel, the respondents have fully qualified for the post in question and hence,\n\n                  the rejection of their candidature for want of production of documents, which is\n\n                  purely procedural in nature, is unsustainable. Even as per the Notification, the\n\n                  same can be done only by following due process and not unilaterally without\n\n                  affording any opportunity to them. Taking note of the same in proper perspective,\n\n                  the learned Judge has given direction to the appellant TNPSC to the effect that\n\n                  opportunity to produce documents be given not just to the candidates, who are\n\n                  before the Court, but also to all the candidates whose candidatures have been\n\n                  rejected, by the orders impugned herein, which need not be interfered with by\n\n                  this court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">                           6.1. Adding further, Mr.R.Thamaraiselvan, learned counsel representing\n\n                  Mr.N.Kesavaraj, learned counsel appearing for the respondent in W.A.No. 683 of\n\n                  2023, by relying upon Clause 12(L) of the Notification, would submit that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                  Page 20/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                          W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  incomplete applications should be rejected after following due process of law,\n\n                  however, no such process was followed in this case. The learned counsel would\n\n                  also contend that the claim made in the online application for the recruitment will\n\n                  be taken into consideration as per Clause 12 (M) of the Notification and in this\n\n                  case, the respondent claimed that he belongs to MBC Community and however,\n\n                  instead of uploading community certificate, 12th certificate was uploaded. The\n\n                  learned counsel would further assert that the respondent did not provide false\n\n                  information and is willing to produce the community certificate during physical\n\n                  verification. Furthermore, the learned counsel referring to Clause 15(B) of the\n\n                  Notification, pointed out that modifications can be made up to 12 days before the\n\n                  examination date. However, due to a technical glitch in the TNPSC&#x27;s document\n\n                  upload software, the respondent was unable to upload the required documents\n\n                  within the stipulated time.

Continuing further, Mr.T.Muthukrishnan, learned counsel appearing for\n\n                  the respondents in W.A.Nos. 685 and 687 of 2023, would submit that the\n\n                  respondent in W.A.No.685 of 2023 had uploaded the mark sheet for Classes X\n\n                  and XII, instead of the required PSTM certificate for Classes X and XII. Similarly,\n\n                  the respondent in W.A.No.687 of 2023 had uploaded her PG Certificate instead of\n\n                  the required UG Certificate. As a result of these errors, the applications of the\n\n                  respondents were rejected. It is further contended that on 13.01.2023, the results\n\n                  were published on the basis of 1:3 ratio (Selection list 1), which included the\n\n                  respondents&#x27; names. However, on 22.02.2023, the TNPSC published a revised 1:2\n\n                  ratio list (Selection list 2), and in this updated result, the respondents&#x27; names\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                  Page 22/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                           W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  were not found and their names were found in the annexure list stating that\n\n                  &quot;rejected for various reasons”, which according to the learned counsel, is against\n\n                  the principles of natural justice.

This entails informing the person concerned of the case against them and\n\n                  providing an opportunity to be heard for the purpose of explaining or defending\n\n                  their position.

Furthermore, it is highlighted by the learned\n\n                  counsel that the respondents come from remote villages and are first-generation\n\n                  candidates and if the appeals are allowed, they will be put to irreparable loss and\n\n                  hence, their cases may be considered leniently.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                            7.

The learned Additional Advocate General would further submit that the\n\n                  TNPSC, as an institution, takes its commitment to transparency, fairness, and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                  Page 23/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                            W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  integrity very seriously.

When the individuals resort to legal\n\n                  intervention to bypass prescribed procedures, it not only disrupts the application\n\n                  process, but also sets a dangerous precedent that can lead to chaos and an\n\n                  inundation of court cases. Hence, the learned Additional Advocate would submit\n\n                  that no leniency should be shown to the respondents/writ petitioners in enforcing\n\n                  these rules.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                            8.

It was expected that the setting up of\n                            administrative tribunal to deal exclusively in service matters would go a\n                            long way in not only reducing the burden of the courts but also provide to\n                            the persons covered by the Tribunals speedy relief in respect of their\n                            grievances. The basic idea as evident from the various provisions&#x27; of the\n                            act is that the tribunal should guickly. redress the grievance in relation to\n                            service matters. The definition of service matters found in section 3(q)\n                            shows that in relation to a person, the expression means all service\n                            matters relating to the condition of his service. The significance of the\n                            word &#x27;&#x27;his” cannot be ignored. Section 3(b) defines the word “Application”\n                            as an application made under section 19. The latter section refers to\n                            “Person Aggrieved”. In order to bring a matter before the Tribunal, an\n                            application has to be made and the same can be made only by a person\n                            aggrieved by any order pertaining to any- matter within the jurisdiction of\n                            the Tribunal. The word “Order” has been defined in the explanation to\n                            sub-section (1) of section 19 so that all mattes referred to in section 3(q)\n                            as service matter could be brought before the Tribunal. If in that context\n                            sections 14 and 15 are read, there is no doubt that a private citizen or a\n                            stranger having no existing right to any post and not intrinsically\n                            concerned with any service matter is not entitled to approach the\n                            Tribunal. If public interest litigations at the instance of strangers are\n                            allowed to be entertained by the Tribunal, the very object of speedy\n                            disposal of service matters would get defeated. There is no substance in\n                            the contention that the proceedings before the Tribunal are in the nature\n                            of quo warranto and it could be filed by any member of the public as he is\n                            an aggrieved person in the sense public interest is affected. The\n                            Applications in the present case have been filed before the appointment of\n                            the petitioner as a lecturer and the relevant prayers are to quash the\n                            creation of the post itself and preventing the authorities from appointing\n                            the petitioner as a lecturer. Hence, the applications filed by the\n                            respondents cannot be considered to be in the nature of quo warranto&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                            8.1.

It is further submitted by the learned senior counsel apeparing for the\n\n                  respondents 2 to 5 in WA No.684 of 2023 that pursuant to the interim order dated\n\n                  23.03.2023, the respondents herein were not issued with the orders of\n\n                  appointment to the post of Assistant Engineers and suffered even after they got\n\n                  selected by competing with more than 35000 candidates those who have\n\n                  participated in the said selection process. Hence, the learned senior counsel prays\n\n                  for appropriate orders in this writ appeal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                  Page 27/89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                  W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                  Page 28/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                               W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">                           9.

The notification also explicitly makes it clear that the candidate\n\n                  must be eligible as on the date of notification. Clause 13 (g) clearly states that if\n\n                  the candidates do not fulfil any of the eligibility conditions upon verification of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                  Page 38/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                  W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  certificates, then their candidature would be rejected.

Mathew (Dr</a>), [(1980)\n\n                  2 SCC 752 : 1980 SCC (L&amp;S) 305], wherein, it was held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">                                     “20. There is nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in adding 10 marks\n                            for holders of a diploma. But to earn these extra 10 marks, the diploma\n                            must be obtained at least on or before the last date for application, not\n                            later. Proof of having obtained a diploma is different from the factum of\n                            having got it. Has the candidate, in fact, secured a diploma before the\n                            final date of application for admission to the degree course? That is the\n                            primary question. It is prudent to produce evidence of the diploma along\n                            with the application, but that is secondary. Relaxation of the date on the\n                            first is illegal, not so on the second. Academic excellence, through a\n                            diploma for which extra mark is granted, cannot be denuded because\n                            proof is produced only later, yet before the date of actual selection. The\n                            emphasis is on the diploma; the proof thereof subserves the factum of\n                            possession of the diploma and is not an independent factor.

To confuse\n                            between a fact and its proof is blurred perspicacity. To make\n                            mandatory the date of acquiring the additional qualification\n                            before the last date for application makes sense.

If he has, the marks must be\n                            added. The manner of proving the qualification is indicated and should\n                            ordinarily be adopted.

Acquisition of a diploma\n                            later may qualify him later, not this year. Otherwise, the dateline makes\n                            no sense. So, the short question is when can a candidate claim to have\n                            got a diploma?

In fact in this context,\n                            when we refer to the interview proceedings of the appellant as well as two\n                            other candidates we find that the appellant produced the original BSc/MSc\n                            degree in Zoology and also submitted the attested photocopy of BSc\n                            Zoology degree. The outcome of the said interview was that the appellant\n                            should be cleared of his selection. Insofar as other two candidates,\n                            namely, Miss Babyto and Miss Imrana, are concerned, we find that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                  Page 43/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                  W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                            production of their caste certificate was not in the prescribed pro forma\n                            initially, nevertheless those candidates were allowed to produce the\n                            original caste certificate issued by the competent authority and after\n                            verifying the same by accepting the attested photocopies of such caste\n                            certificates, their cases were cleared. Therefore, when such a course was\n                            adopted by the respondent Commission in regard to those two candidates\n                            there is no reason why the candidature of the appellant alone was kept in\n                            suspension, though he also cleared interview process. Even assuming\n                            such clearance was not made awaiting the outcome of the order of the\n                            Tribunal, when the Tribunal upheld his selection and directed the\n                            respondent to issue necessary orders for appointment, in all fairness the\n                            respondent Commission should have issued the order of appointment. We\n                            are of the view that such an approach of the respondent Commission was\n                            unfair having regard to the very trivial issue, namely, a non-production of\n                            an added qualification as part of the essential qualification at the degree\n                            level which the appellant did possess and for mere asking, the appellant\n                            could have readily produced the same through his employer.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134835894\" id=\"span_54\">16.

However, as per clause 13 (g),\n\n                  unless specific instructions are given, the documents need not be uploaded and as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                  Page 44/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                              W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  per clause 14 (10) (c), the applicants need not send a print of the application and\n\n                  the documents. Though clause 14 states that the particulars mentioned in the\n\n                  application shall not be permitted to be modified after the last date for submitting\n\n                  the on-line application, clause 15 (b) is converse to earlier clauses <a href=\"/doc/134835894/\" id=\"a_31\">referred to\n\n                  above</a>, as it conveys that the applicants are entitled to edit the credentials,\n\n                  upload/re-upload documents which were either wrongly uploaded or not uploaded\n\n                  till two days prior to the date of hosting of hall tickets for that particular post or in\n\n                  other terms, twelve days prior to the date of examination. At this juncture, it is\n\n                  pertinent to mention here that the examination was postponed to 02.07.2022 in\n\n                  the present cases. From the above clauses, it is clear that the condition to upload\n\n                  the document is not mandatory as clause 15 (b) also covers a situation where\n\n                  documents were not uploaded along with the application. Clause 16 of the\n\n                  notification partially confirms clause 14, but varies with clause 15 as it states that\n\n                  the uploading of documents can take place till 14.06.2022 when clause 15 has\n\n                  granted time till two days prior to uploading of hall ticket or 12 days prior to the\n\n                  examination. When the notification gives two different dates, the uploading of the\n\n                  documents being procedural, the interpretation which confers benefit to the\n\n                  applicants must be considered. Hence, in the present cases, the last date would\n\n                  have to be reckoned        as twelve days prior to 02.07.2022 or the date if\n\n                  examinations are held on various dates. The clauses in the notification as well as\n\n                  the instructions explicit that the effect of failure to upload the documents is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                  Page 45/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                           W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  rejection of the application after due process. The word “due process” has not\n\n                  been defined in the notification or in the instructions. Therefore, it should be\n\n                  understood or considered in its natural meaning, that is to say, as understood in\n\n                  common parlance.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">                            17. The concept of ‘due process’ in the legal jurisprudence is understood\n\n                  as something that is fair, just and reasonable. The concept of “due process” is\n\n                  conceived from “natural law”. Prior to codification of laws by the crown, rules,\n\n                  which provided for standard behaviuors were followed by social groups, with\n\n                  consensus came to known as “norms”. Such norms contemplated procedures, the\n\n                  observance of which may be rewarded and when violated, resulted in imposition\n\n                  of sanctions. Such norms also reflected the culture and tradition of the group.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">                  Later, the application of such norms, followed by dominant groups, were either\n\n                  accepted as such or with modification by other groups. Such norms when they\n\n                  received the assent of the crown and codified, became law.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">                            17.1. Natural law is interested in absolute justice. Every law must be in\n\n                  conformity with the natural law which is rested on the principles of fairness,\n\n                  reason and equality. Fairness would not only mean a fair law, but also a fair\n\n                  procedure, by which proper, equal and adequate opportunity are offered to the\n\n                  parties in the dispute. This natural law later developed into the concept of natural\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                  Page 46/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                             W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  justice, which has many facets. Two important facets of natural justice are the\n\n                  adherence to the procedure where opportunity is provided to a person who is\n\n                  either accused of committing an act prohibited by law or when his civil right is\n\n                  threatened; and the second facet being the right to know the reason for adverse\n\n                  proceedings. The principles of natural justice grew rapidly in every jurisprudence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">                  The rules of evidence, the right against self-incrimination, right against illegal\n\n                  detention are some excerpts from criminal jurisprudence. The development in\n\n                  civil jurisprudence resulted in development of concepts like doctrine of\n\n                  proposition. The natural laws paved way for fundamental rights, which has since\n\n                  been incorporated in every constitution in the world. The above rights and\n\n                  protections which are determined and indispensable to the justice delivery system\n\n                  came to be known as “due process”. The concept of “due process” is divided into\n\n                  two categories known as “substantive due process” and “procedural due process”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">                  “Substantive due process” is the principle by which the fundamental rights of a\n\n                  citizen are protected. The “procedural due process” requires that a fair procedure\n\n                  is to be followed before the deprivation of life, liberty, property and rights.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">                            17.2. The concept of due process was first brought into a codified law in\n\n                  the “Charter of Magna Carta” in 1215. Clause 39 of the Magna Carta stated that\n\n                  no free man could be imprisoned or stripped of his rights or possessions without\n\n                  following the due process”. The Magna carta, in a way brought the crown\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                  Page 47/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                   W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  amenable to law and offered various protections amongst other protections like\n\n                  access to justice, protection against illegal imprisonment, limitations on payments,\n\n                  protection of property rights, protection against deprivation of rights without due\n\n                  process.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">                            17.3. The due process concept was brought into the American Constitution\n\n                  in the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment. The due process clause in\n\n                  the fifth Amendment applies to the Federal Government and the Fourteenth\n\n                  Amendment to the state governments. <a href=\"/doc/45211300/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 1</a> of the Fourteen Amendment\n\n                  reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">                                   “<a href=\"/doc/45211300/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 1</a>.

The American courts have interpreted the “due process” clause\n\n                  widely and offered protection against vague and arbitrary laws in addition to\n\n                  protection against arbitrary and unreasonable state action against civil rights and\n\n                  liberties of its citizens.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">                            17.5.

There can be no doubt that\n                            it is a founding faith of the Constitution.

In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one\n                            belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim and\n                            caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in\n                            it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law\n                            and is therefore violative of Article 14”. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 14</a> strikes at arbitrariness in\n                            State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment.

The question immediately arises : does the procedure\n                            prescribed by the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_110\">Passports Act, 1967</a> for impounding a passport meet the\n                            test of this requirement? Is it “right or fair or just”? The argument of the\n                            petitioner was that it is not, because it provides for impounding of a\n                            passport without affording reasonable opportunity to the holder of the\n                            passport to be heard in defence. To impound the passport of a person,\n                            said the petitioner, is a serious matter, since it prevents him from\n                            exercising his constitutional right to go abroad and such a drastic\n                            consequence cannot in fairness be visited without observing the principle\n                            of audi alteram partem. Any procedure which permits impairment of the\n                            constitutional right to go abroad without giving reasonable opportunity to\n                            show cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence,\n                            there is in the present case clear infringement of the requirement of\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 21.</a> Now, it is true that there is no express provision in the\n                            <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_112\">Passports Act, 1967</a> which requires that the audi alteram partem rule\n                            should be followed before impounding a passport, but that is not\n                            conclusive of the question. If the statute makes itself clear on this point,\n                            then no more question arises.

In fact,\n                            there are two main principles in which the rules of natural justice are\n                            manifested, namely, nemo judex in causa sua and audi alteram partem.\n                            We are not concerned here with the former, since there is no case of bias\n                            urged here.

Natural justice is a great\n                            humanising principle intended to invest law with fairness and to secure\n                            justice and over the years it has grown into a widely pervasive rule\n                            affecting large areas of administrative action. Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest\n                            spoke of this rule in eloquent terms in his address before the Bentham\n                            Club:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                                          “We can, I think, take pride in what has been done in\n                                  recent periods and particularly in the field of administrative\n                                  law by invoking and by applying these principles which we\n                                  broadly classify under the designation of natural justice. Many\n                                  testing problems as to their application yet re-remain to be\n                                  solved. But I affirm that the area of administrative action is\n                                  but one area in which the principles are to be deployed. Nor\n                                  are they to be invoked only when procedural failures are\n                                  shown.

We often speak of the rules of\n                                   natural justice. But there is nothing rigid or mechanical\n                                   about them. What they comprehend has been analysed\n                                   and described in many authorities. But any analysis must\n                                   bring into relief rather their spirit and their inspiration than\n                                   any precision of definition or precision as to application. We\n                                   do not search for prescriptions which will lay down exactly\n                                   what must, in various divergent situations, be done. The\n                                   principles and procedures are to be applied which, in any\n                                   particular situation or set of circumstances, are right and\n                                   just and fair. Natural justice, it has been said, is only ‘fair\n                                   play in action’. Nor do we wait for directions from\n                                   Parliament. The common law has abundant riches : there\n                                   may we find what Byles, J., called ‘the justice of the\n                                   common law’ ”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                            Thus, the soul of natural justice is “fair-play in action” and that is why it\n                            has received the widest recognition throughout the democratic world. In\n                            the United States, the right to an administrative hearing is regarded as\n                            essential requirement of fundamental fairness. And in England too it has\n                            been held that “fair-play in action” demands that before any prejudicial or\n                            adverse action is taken against a person, he must be given an opportunity\n                            to be heard. The rule was stated by Lord Denning, MR in these terms\n                            in Schmidt v. Secretary of State or Home Affairs [(1969) 2 Ch D 149 :\n                            (1969) 1 All ER 904] — “where a public officer has power to deprive a\n                            person of his liberty or his property, the general principle is that it has not\n                            to be done without his being given an opportunity of being heard and of\n                            making representations on his own behalf”. The same rule also prevails in\n                            other Commonwealth countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It\n                            has even gained access to the United Nations (vide American Journal of\n                            International Law, Vol. 67, p. 479). Magarry, J., describes natural justice\n                            “as a distillate of due process of law” (vide Fontaine v. Chastarton [(1968)\n                            112 Solicitor General 690] ). It is the quintessence of the process of\n                            justice inspired and guided by “fair-play in action”. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1004041\" id=\"span_89\">If we look at the\n                            speeches of the various Law Lords in <a href=\"/doc/1004041/\" id=\"a_115\">Wiseman</a> case [1971 AC 297 :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">                            (1969) 3 All ER 275] it will be seen that each one of them asked the\n                            question “whether in the particular circumstances of the case, the Tribunal\n                            acted unfairly so that it could be said that their procedure did not match\n                            with what justice demanded”, or, was the procedure adopted by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                  Page 58/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                     W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                            Tribunal “in all the circumstances unfair?” The test adopted by every Law\n                            Lord was whether the procedure followed was fair in all the circumstances\n                            and “fair-play in action” required that an opportunity should be given to\n                            the taxpayer “to see and reply to the counter-statement of the\n                            Commissioners” before reaching the conclusion that “there is a prima facie\n                            case against him”. The inquiry must, therefore, always be : does fairness\n                            in action demand that an opportunity to be heard should be given to the\n                            person affected?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">                                     10. Now, if this be the test of applicability of the doctrine of\n                            natural justice, there can be no distinction between a quasi-judicial\n                            function and an administrative function for this purpose. The aim of both\n                            administrative inquiry as well as quasi-judicial inquiry is to arrive at a just\n                            decision and if a rule of natural justice is calculated to secure justice, or to\n                            put it negatively, to prevent miscarriage of justice, it is difficult to see why\n                            it should be applicable to quasi-judicial inquiry and not to administrative\n                            inquiry. It must logically apply to both. On what principle can distinction\n                            be made between one and the other? Can it be said that the requirement\n                            of “fair-play in action” is any the less in an administrative inquiry than in a\n                            quasi-judicial one? Sometimes an unjust decision in an administrative\n                            inquiry may have far more serious consequences than a decision in a\n                            quasi-judicial inquiry and hence the rules of natural justice must apply\n                            equally in an administrative inquiry which entails civil consequences. There\n                            was, however, a time in the early stages of the development of the\n                            doctrine of natural justice when the view prevailed that the rules of\n                            natural justice have application only to a quasi-judicial proceeding as\n                            distinguished from an administrative proceeding and the distinguishing\n                            feature of a quasi-judicial proceeding is that the authority concerned is\n                            required by the law under which it is functioning to act judicially. This\n                            requirement of a duty to act judicially in order to invest the function with\n                            a quasi-judicial character was spelt out from the following observation of\n                            Atkin, L.J. in Rex v. Electricity Commissioners [(1924) 1 KB 171 : (1923)\n                            All ER Rep 150] , “wherever any body of persons having legal authority to\n                            determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty\n                            to act judicially, act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to\n                            the controlling jurisdiction of the King Bench Division . . .”. Lord Hewart,\n                            C.J., in Rex v. Legislative Committee of the Church Assembly [(1928) 1 KB\n                            411] read this observation to mean that the duty to act judicially should\n                            be an additional requirement existing independently of the “authority to\n                            determine questions affecting the rights of subjects”— something super-\n                            added to it. This gloss placed by Lord Hewart, C.J., on the dictum of Lord\n                            Atkin, LJ., bedevilled the law for a considerable time and stultified the\n                            growth of the doctrine of natural justice. The Court was constrained in\n                            every case that came before it, to make a search for the duty to act\n                            judicially sometimes from tenuous material and sometimes in the services\n                            of the statute and this led to oversubtlety and over-refinement resulting in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                  Page 59/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                   W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                            confusion and uncertainty in the law. But this was plainly contrary to the\n                            earlier authorities and in the epoch-making decision of the House of Lords\n                            in Ridge v. Baldwin [1964 AC 40 : (1963) 2 All ER 66] which marks a\n                            turning point in the history of the development of the doctrine of natural\n                            justice, Lord Reid pointed out how the gloss of Lord Hewart, C.J., was\n                            based on a misunderstanding of the observations of Atkin, L.J., and it\n                            went counter to the law laid down in the earlier decisions of the Court.\n                            Lord Reid observed:“If Lord Hewart meant that it is never enough that a\n                            body has a duty to determine what the rights of an individual should be,\n                            but that there must always be something more to impose on it a duty to\n                            act judicially, then that appears to me impossible to reconcile with the\n                            earlier authorities”. The learned Law Lord held that the duty to act\n                            judicially may arise from the very nature of the function intended to be\n                            performed and it need not be shown to be super-added. This decision\n                            broadened the area of application of the rules of natural justice and to\n                            borrow the words of Prof. clark in his article on “Natural Justice,\n                            Substance and Shadow” in Public Law Journal, 1975, restored light to an\n                            area “benighted by the narrow conceptualism of the previous decade”.\n                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1455346\" id=\"span_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"911769\" id=\"span_93\">This development in the law had its parallel in India in the <a href=\"/doc/911769/\" id=\"a_116\">Associated\n                            Cement Companies Ltd. v.

A brief summation of the judgment on privacy would indicate\n                            that privacy is treated as fundamental right. It is predicated on the basis\n                            that privacy is a postulate of dignity and the concept of dignity can be\n                            traced to the Preamble of the Constitution as well as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 21</a> thereof.\n                            Further, privacy is considered as a subset of personal liberty thereby\n                            accepting the minority opinion in Kharak Singh v.

In developing the aforesaid\n                            concepts, the Court has been receptive to the principles in international\n                            law and international instruments. It is a recognition of the fact that\n                            certain human rights cannot be confined within the bounds of\n                            geographical location of a nation but have universal application.

The rights that are guaranteed to differently-abled\n                                  persons under the 1995 Act, are founded on the sound principle\n                                  of human dignity which is the core value of human right and is\n                                  treated as a significant facet of right to life and liberty. Such a\n                                  right, now treated as human right of the persons who are\n                                  disabled, has its roots in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n                                  Jurisprudentially, three types of models for determining the\n                                  content of the constitutional value of human dignity are\n                                  recognised. These are : (i) Theological Models, (ii) Philosophical\n                                  Models, and (iii) Constitutional Models. Legal scholars were called\n                                  upon to determine the theological basis of human dignity as a\n                                  constitutional value and as a constitutional right. Philosophers\n                                  also came out with their views justifying human dignity as core\n                                  human value. Legal understanding is influenced by theological\n                                  and philosophical views, though these two are not identical.\n                                  Aquinas and Kant discussed the jurisprudential aspects of human\n                                  dignity based on the aforesaid philosophies. Over a period of\n                                  time, human dignity has found its way through constitutionalism,\n                                  whether written or unwritten. Even right to equality is interpreted\n                                  based on the value of human dignity. Insofar as India is\n                                  concerned, we are not even required to take shelter under\n                                  theological or philosophical theories. We have a written\n                                  Constitution which guarantees human rights that are contained in\n                                  Part III with the caption “fundamental rights”. One such right\n                                  enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 21</a> is right to life and liberty. Right to life is\n                                  given a purposeful meaning by this Court to include right to live\n                                  with dignity. It is the purposive interpretation which has been\n                                  adopted by this Court to give a content of the right to human\n                                  dignity as the fulfilment of the constitutional value enshrined in\n                                  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 21.</a> Thus, human dignity is a constitutional value and a\n                                  constitutional goal.

Some of the excerpts thereof, are reproduced below\n                                  which give a glimpse of these goals:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">                                         ‘The first role of human dignity as a constitutional value is\n                                  expressed in the approach that it comprises the foundation for all\n                                  of the constitutional rights. Human dignity is the central\n                                  argument for the existence of human rights. It is the rationale for\n                                  them all. It is the justification for the existence of rights.\n                                  According to Christoph Enders, it is the constitutional value that\n                                  determines that every person has the right to have rights …\n                                           The second role of human dignity as a constitutional value\n                                  is to provide meaning to the norms of the legal system.\n                                  According to purposive interpretation, all of the provisions of the\n                                  Constitution, and particularly all of the rights in the constitutional\n                                  Bill of Rights, are interpreted in light of human dignity …\n                                          Lastly, human dignity as a constitutional value influences\n                                  the development of the common law. Indeed, where common\n                                  law is recognised, Judges have the duty to develop it, and if\n                                  necessary, modify it, so that it expresses constitutional values,\n                                  including the constitutional value of human dignity. To the extent\n                                  that common law determines rights and duties between\n                                  individuals, it might limit the human dignity of one individual and\n                                  protect the human dignity of the other.’”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">                                    134. From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that dignity as a\n                            jurisprudential concept has now been well defined by this Court. Its\n                            essential ingredients can be summarised as under. The basic principle of\n                            dignity and freedom of the individual is an attribute of natural law which\n                            becomes the right of all individuals in a constitutional democracy. Dignity\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                  Page 67/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                                    W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                            has a central normative role as well as constitutional value. This normative\n                            role is performed in three ways:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">                                   First, it becomes basis for constitutional rights;\n                                   Second, it serves as an interpretative principle for determining the\n                            scope of constitutional rights; and,\n                                    Third, it determines the proportionality of a statute limiting a\n                            constitutional right. Thus, if an enactment puts limitation on a\n                            constitutional right and such limitation is disproportionate, such a statute\n                            can be held to be unconstitutional by applying the doctrine of\n                            proportionality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_112\">138. The aforesaid discourse on the concept of human dignity is\n                            from an individual point of view. That is the emphasis of the petitioners as\n                            well. That would be one side of the coin. A very important feature which\n                            the present case has brought into focus is another dimension of human\n                            dignity, namely, in the form of “common good” or “public good”. Thus,\n                            our endeavour here is to give richer and more nuanced understanding to\n                            the concept of human dignity. Here, dignity is not limited to an individual\n                            and is to be seen in an individualistic way.

Clause 9 of the Instructions as it stood then speaks about educational\n\n                  qualifications. It also refers to <a href=\"/doc/102188069/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 25</a> of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants\n\n                  (Conditions of Service) Act, 2016, and confirms the position that when a degree is\n\n                  prescribed as a qualification, a post graduate degree will also be a qualification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">                  This is again fortified by clauses 14 G (vi), which specifies that if the candidate\n\n                  claims to be in possession of higher qualification, then, the same is to be\n\n                  produced.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">                            19.3. In the note to clause 4 (B), there is a reference to <a href=\"/doc/102188069/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 25</a>. The\n\n                  Explanation I to <a href=\"/doc/102188069/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 25</a> would be applicable in the present case. A Conjoint\n\n                  reading of Clause 4 (B) with the note and <a href=\"/doc/102188069/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 25</a> of the Tamil Nadu\n\n                  Government Servants (Conditions of Service) Act, 2016, makes it clear that the\n\n                  qualification prescribed in the notification is only a minimum requirement and a\n\n                  candidate with higher qualification is also eligible to apply. It goes without saying\n\n                  that insofar as the professional courses are concerned, if the candidate has not\n\n                  completed       Under Graduation, he will not be permitted to undergo post-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">                  graduation. Further, as per Annexure V, a consolidated mark sheet can also be\n\n                  furnished to prove the educational qualification, if the provisional certificate or\n\n                  degree certificate is not available at the time of filling up the application. Once the\n\n                  basic requirement of eligibility is proved, this court is of the opinion that the\n\n                  requirement is satisfied to be eligible. We have already held that the TNPSC has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                  Page 79/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                            W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  not followed the “due process” by giving an opportunity to the candidate before\n\n                  rejecting his/her candidature, which amounts to clear violation of the principles of\n\n                  natural justice. We do not find any error in the reasoning and directions given by\n\n                  the Learned Judge. In view of the same, the grounds and the contentions raised\n\n                  by the appellants are unsustainable and hence, the same are rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">                            20. Moving on to the next issue of certificates relating to PSTM, we have\n\n                  already seen that the appellants are bound to follow the due process before\n\n                  rejecting the application, which they have failed. Further, in proof of the claim\n\n                  that the candidate has undergone the entire duration of study in Tamil Medium, it\n\n                  is sufficient if the certificates as mentioned in Clause 14 ( R) (ii) are uploaded or\n\n                  produced. If such documents are not available, as per sub clause (iv) of clause\n\n                  14 (R), a certificate from the Principal or Head of Institution or any other person\n\n                  mentioned therein is sufficient to prove the same. Clause 14 (R) (v) &amp; (vi), which\n\n                  again also speaks about ‘due process”. Clause 13 (B) of the instructions clearly\n\n                  states that if the documents are not scanned and uploaded for on-screen\n\n                  certificate verification, during the period stipulated by the Commission, the\n\n                  candidature will have to be rejected after due process. There is nothing on record\n\n                  to show that the appellant TNPSC had specifically granted any time for the\n\n                  candidates to upload or produce the documents after having found the same to\n\n                  not satisfy the claim.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                  Page 80/89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                               W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n\n\n\n                            20.1. Further, similar provisions are also found in the notification dated\n\n                  04.04.2022 in clauses 12 (B) (ii), (iv),(v) and (vi). Further as per clause\n\n                  12 (B) (iii), it is sufficient, if the certificates mentioned to prove all educational\n\n                  qualifications upto the qualification prescribed in clause 12 B(ii) are produced. The\n\n                  documents then to be produced are the 10th and HSC certificates with medium of\n\n                  instruction in Tamil for candidates who have a UG degree and 10 th, HSC and UG\n\n                  Degree certificate in case of PG Degree. The only notable difference with the\n\n                  previous issue and this issue is the UG degree certificate is only required to verify\n\n                  whether his medium of instruction for his entire duration of study is in Tamil as\n\n                  the candidate has claimed the benefit of reservation under PSTM Quota.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">                            20.2. That apart, it is evident from the notification and the instructions that\n\n                  mark sheets can also be produced in proof of claim of reservation under PSTM\n\n                  quota. The other condition to be satisfied is that it must reflect that the candidate\n\n                  has undergone the educational qualification through the Tamil medium. In any\n\n                  case, as we have already held that in view of the failure to follow the due process\n\n                  by giving an opportunity, the Learned Judge was right in issuing the directions for\n\n                  production of certificates/documents and inclusion of the candidature in the list\n\n                  for oral interview.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                  Page 81/89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                           W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n\n\n\n                            20.3. Insofar as the claim of the candidate who had claimed to have made\n\n                  a regular study for the entire period from standard I to VIII, when the standard I\n\n                  and II were undertaken through private study as the certificate produced did not\n\n                  include Standard I and II, we do not find error in the orders of the Learned Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41636927\" id=\"span_142\">As regards the candidate with private study, once the claim for PSTM could not be\n\n                  substantiated, the candidate will not be entitled to the benefit of reservation\n\n                  under PSTM Quota. That apart, in the present case, no reasons have been\n\n                  adduced for rejecting the candidatures except by claiming during the hearing of\n\n                  the writ petition that the writ petitioner had not uploaded the certificates for\n\n                  standard I and II. In a recent Judgment in <a href=\"/doc/41636927/\" id=\"a_205\">Bharath Sanchar Nigam Ltd vs.\n\n                  Sandeep Choudhary &amp; Others</a> [2022 Livelaw (SC) 419], considering\n\n                  various orders including Saurav Yadav case and Indra Sawhney Case, the\n\n                  Apex Court clearly held that the reserved category candidates securing higher\n\n                  marks than the last of the general category candidates are entitled to get\n\n                  seat/post in unreserved categories. In view of the same, the direction issued by\n\n                  the learned Judge is also in order.

Hence, there is no infirmity in the\n\n                  order of the learned Judge and the appeal is accordingly, rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">                            22. Regarding the claim of visual disability, the writ petition was not\n\n                  disposed for want of report regarding the percentage of disability, which\n\n                  ultimately turned out to be against the writ petitioner. The observations regarding\n\n                  due process, failure to furnish reasons for rejecting the candidature and\n\n                  interpretation of the clauses regarding uploading of the documents are equally\n\n                  applicable to this case as well. Similarly, the rules of reservation as determined by\n\n                  the Apex Court in BSNL Case (Supra) also apply. Since the writ petitioner is not\n\n                  entitled to avail the reservation under visual disability /Physically disabled persons\n\n                  quota, his candidature can be considered on merits under the general category.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">                  With the said direction, the writ petition is disposed of.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                  Page 83/89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                               W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_174\">                            23.

Clause 12 (L) of the notification dealing with the furnishing of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                  Page 84/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                           W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  incorrect or wrong or incomplete particulars in the application also cannot be\n\n                  pressed into service by the appellants and the respondents 2 to 5 in WA No.684\n\n                  of 2023. Even then, the due process has to be followed. The case before us does\n\n                  not involve relaxation of any of the conditions. The issues involved in the present\n\n                  cases are more in the nature of interpretation and grant of opportunity as per the\n\n                  terms and conditions of the notification. The judgment in Duryodhana Sahu’s\n\n                  case cannot be pressed into service, is also not applicable, as the subject matter\n\n                  is completely different. It was a matter arising out of Central Administrative\n\n                  Tribunal, where third parties by applications had challenged the creation of the\n\n                  post and sought a direction not to select a candidate. In the present case, the\n\n                  Learned Judge has correctly directed the Commission to give opportunity to all the\n\n                  persons, who have not been provided with opportunity. This is to be considered\n\n                  not only in terms of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_207\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_208\">16</a> of the Constitution, but also with a view\n\n                  that appointments to public posts are to be filled at the earliest by avoiding\n\n                  multiplicity of proceedings. Therefore, the contention of the respondents 2 to 5 in\n\n                  WA. No. 684 of 2023 is liable to be rejected and is accordingly, rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"826277\" id=\"span_146\">25. Further, it is not the case of the appellants that the applicants /\n\n                  respondent candidates were not eligible to apply. As held by the Apex Court in\n\n                  <a href=\"/doc/826277/\" id=\"a_209\">Charles K Sakaria</a> (Supra), Dolly Chhanda [(2005) 9 SCC 779] and\n\n                  Dheerender Singh Paliwal [2017 (11) SCC 276], once the eligibility is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                  Page 85/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                          W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  satisfied, the furnishing of the proof is only procedural, which cannot take away\n\n                  the right of the applicants on technicalities and by way of interpretation. The\n\n                  object of the examinations and interview is to select the meritorious persons from\n\n                  among the different categories under which they fall. The respondents 2 to 5 in\n\n                  WA.No.684 of 2023 have sought to be impleaded in the appeal, as they have not\n\n                  been issued with appointment orders, despite being selected. In view of the fact\n\n                  that we have already rejected the appeals filed by the Commission, the question\n\n                  of issuing appointment orders to the respondents 2 to 5 in WA No.684 of 2023\n\n                  does not arise and the directions issued by the Learned Judge are to be followed,\n\n                  if not followed already. However, the appellants are duty bound to ensure that the\n\n                  rules of reservation are implemented.</span> As a consequence of dismissal of the\n\n                  appeals, the appellants will have to consider the case of the respondent\n\n                  candidates to be appointed to the posts in Combined Engineering Services by\n\n                  following the rules of reservation as enumerated in Saurav Yadav v. State of\n\n                  UP and BSNL case (supra) and on merits along with the case of the\n\n                  respondents 2 to 5 in WA. No. 684 of 2023, within a period of six weeks from the\n\n                  date of receipt of copy of this judgment.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_177\">                            26. As held by us in paragraphs 16, 16.1 and 16.2 (supra), there is a\n\n                  significant difference between eligibility and proof of documents. Once the\n\n                  candidates are eligible, their candidature cannot be rejected for submission of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                  Page 86/89</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                            W.A.No.682 of 2023 &amp; etc. batch\n\n                  wrong documents or insufficient documents without following the due process of\n\n                  providing opportunity. When the instructions permit production of documents,\n\n                  which is clearly distinct from uploading of documents, it must mean that the\n\n                  documents must be produced when they are called for. The clause relating to\n\n                  production of the documents “when called for”, when read in conjunction with the\n\n                  “due process” would have to be read to mean that the due process contemplated\n\n                  in the notification requires the appellants to call for the documents before\n\n                  rejection. This stage to call for the documents by providing opportunity in\n\n                  compliance with the principle of “due process” would come only after the\n\n                  commission has identified that either the documents are not uploaded or wrongly\n\n                  uploaded. As rightly pointed out by the Learned Judge, the appellants must have\n\n                  called for the documents. The date of examination was also revised. Therefore,\n\n                  the appellants could have very well intimated the respective candidates/writ\n\n                  petitioners about the flaws in the documents uploaded and directed them to\n\n                  produce the documents, considering the fact that the writ petitioners are eligible\n\n                  as they satisfy the necessary qualifications.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_178\">                            27.
