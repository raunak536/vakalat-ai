In this batch of matters, a scheme propounded  by  the  Government  of\nIndia popularly known as “Aadhaar Card Scheme” is under  attack  on  various\ncounts.  For the purpose of this order, it is not necessary  for  us  to  go\ninto the details of the nature of the  scheme  and  the  various  counts  on\nwhich the scheme is attacked. Suffice it to say that under the  said  scheme\nthe Government of India is collecting and  compiling  both  the  demographic\nand biometric data of the residents of this country to be used  for  various\npurposes, the details of which are not relevant at present.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">2.    One of  the  grounds  of  attack  on  the  scheme  is  that  the  very\ncollection of such biometric data is violative of the  “right  to  privacy”.\nSome of the petitioners assert that the right to privacy  is  implied  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India while other petitioners assert  that\nsuch a right emanates not only from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> but also from  various  other\narticles embodying the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part-III  of  the\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_1\">3.    When the matter was taken up for hearing, Shri Mukul Rohatgi,  learned\nAttorney General made a submission that in view of  the  judgments  of  this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_3\">M.P. Sharma &amp; Others v. Satish Chandra &amp; Others</a>, AIR  1954  SC  300\nand Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. &amp; Others, AIR 1963 SC  1295,  (decided  by\nEight  and  Six  Judges  respectively)  the  legal  position  regarding  the\nexistence of the fundamental right to  privacy  is  doubtful.  Further,  the\nlearned Attorney General also submitted that in a  catena  of  decisions  of\nthis  Court  rendered  subsequently,  this  Court  referred  to  “right   to\nprivacy”,  contrary to the  judgments  in  the  abovementioned  cases  which\nresulted  in  a  jurisprudentially  impermissible  divergence  of   judicial\nopinions.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_2\">“A power of search and  seizure  is  in  any  system  of  jurisprudence  an\noverriding power of the State for the  protection  of  social  security  and\nthat power is necessarily regulated by law.  When  the  Constitution  makers\nhave  thought  fit  not  to  subject  such  regulation   to   constitutional\nlimitations by recognition of a fundamental right to privacy,  analogous  to\nthe American Fourth Amendment, we have no justification to import  it,  into\na  totally  different  fundamental  right,  by  some  process  of   strained\nconstruction.

Learned Attorney General submitted that such impermissible  divergence\nof opinion commenced with the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_7\">Gobind v.  State  of\nM.P. &amp; Another</a>, (1975) 2 SCC 148, which formed the basis for the  subsequent\ndecision of this Court wherein the “right to  privacy”  is  asserted  or  at\nleast referred to.  The most important of such  cases  are  <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_8\">R.  Rajagopal  &amp;\nAnother v. State of Tamil Nadu &amp; Others</a>, (1994) 6 SCC 632  (popularly  known\nas Auto Shanker’s case) and People’s Union for  <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_9\">Civil  Liberties  (PUCL)  v.\nUnion of India &amp; Another</a>, (1997) 1 SCC 301.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_7\">5.    All the <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_10\">judgments <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_11\">referred to above</a></a> were rendered by  smaller  Benches\nof two or three Judges.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_8\">6.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for one  of  the\nrespondents submitted that the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_12\">Gobind</a>  (supra)  is\nnot consistent with the decisions of this Court in M.P.  Sharma  and  Kharak\nSingh.   He  submitted  that  such  divergence  is  also  noticed   by   the\nacademicians, Shri F.S. Nariman, Senior Advocate  of  this  Court  and  Shri\nA.M. Bhattacharjee[1], Former Chief Justice,  High  Court  at  Calcutta  and\nHigh Court at Bombay.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.    Therefore, it is submitted by the learned Attorney  General  and  Shri\nVenugopal that to settle the  legal  position,  this  batch  of  matters  is\nrequired to be heard by a larger Bench of this Court as these matters  throw\nup for debate important questions – (i)  whether  there  is  any  “right  to\nprivacy” guaranteed under our Constitution.  (ii) If such  a  right  exists,\nwhat is the source and what are the contours of such a right as there is  no\nexpress provision in the Constitution adumbrating the right to privacy.   It\nis therefore submitted that these batch of matters are required to be  heard\nand decided by a larger bench of  at  least  five  Judges  in  view  of  the\nmandate contained under <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 145(3)[2]</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.    On behalf of the petitioners Shri Gopal  Subramanium  and  Shri  Shyam\nDivan, learned senior counsel very vehemently opposed  the  suggestion  that\nthis batch of matters is required to be heard by a larger bench.   According\nto them:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(i)   The conclusions recorded by this Court in R. Rajagopal  and  PUCL  are\nlegally tenable for the reason that the observations  made  in  M.P.  Sharma\nregarding the absence of right to privacy under  our  Constitution  are  not\npart of ratio decidendi of  that  case  and,  therefore,  do  not  bind  the\nsubsequent smaller Benches.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_9\">(ii)  Coming to the case of Kharak Singh, majority in Kharak Singh did  hold\nthat the right of a person not to be  disturbed  at  his  residence  by  the\nState and its officers is recognized to be a part  of  a  fundamental  right\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> which is nothing but an aspect of privacy.   The\nobservation in para 20 of the majority judgment at  best  can  be  construed\nonly to mean that there is no  fundamental  right  of  privacy  against  the\nState’s authority to keep surveillance on the activities of a person.   Even\nsuch a conclusion cannot be good  law  any  more  in  view  of  the  express\ndeclaration made by a seven-Judge bench decision of this  Court  in   <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_15\">Maneka\nGandhi v. Union of India &amp; Another</a>, (1978) 1 SCC 248[3].</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(iii) They further argued that both M.P. Sharma  (supra)  and  Kharak  Singh\n(supra) came to be decided on an interpretation of  the  Constitution  based\non the principles expounded in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950  SC\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">27.  Such principles propounded  by  A.K.  Gopalan  themselves  came  to  be\ndeclared wrong by a larger Bench of this Court in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper  v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC 248.  Therefore,  there  is  no  need  for  the\ninstant batch of matters to be heard by a larger Bench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_10\">9.    It is true that <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_16\">Gobind</a> (supra) did not make a clear  declaration  that\nthere is a right to privacy flowing  from  any  of  the  fundamental  rights\nguaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India,  but  observed  that\n“Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the  right  to\nmove freely throughout the territory of India  and  the  freedom  of  speech\ncreate an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them  which  one\ncan characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the  right  is\nabsolute”.  This Court proceeded to decide the case on such basis.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_12\">10.   However, the subsequent decisions in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_17\">R.  Rajagopal</a>  (supra)  and  <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_18\">PUCL</a>\n(supra), the Benches were more  categoric  in  asserting  the  existence  of\n“right to privacy”.  While R. Rajagopal’s case[4] held that  the  “right  to\nprivacy” is implicit under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, PUCL’s case  held\nthat the “right to privacy” insofar as it pertains  to  speech  is  part  of\nfundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">21</a> of the Constitution[5].</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.   Elaborate submissions are made at the bar by the learned  counsel  for\nthe petitioners to demonstrate that world over in all  the  countries  where\nAnglo-Saxon  jurisprudence  is  followed,  ‘privacy’  is  recognised  as  an\nimportant aspect of the liberty of human beings.  It  is  further  submitted\nthat it is too late in the day for the Union of  India  to  argue  that  the\nConstitution of India does  not  recognise  privacy  as  an  aspect  of  the\nliberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of  India.   At  least  to  the\nextent that the right of a person to be secure in his house and  not  to  be\ndisturbed unreasonably by the State or its officers is expressly  recognized\nand protected in Kharak Singh (supra) though the majority did  not  describe\nthat aspect of the liberty as a right of privacy,  it  is  nothing  but  the\nright of privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_13\">12.   We are of the opinion that  the  cases  on  hand  raise  far  reaching\nquestions  of  importance  involving  interpretation  of  the  Constitution.\nWhat is at stake is the amplitude of the fundamental rights  including  that\nprecious and inalienable right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21.</a>  If the  observations  made\nin <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_24\">M.P. Sharma</a> (supra) and Kharak Singh (supra) are  to  be  read  literally\nand accepted as the law of this country, the fundamental  rights  guaranteed\nunder the Constitution of India  and  more  particularly  right  to  liberty\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> would be denuded of  vigour  and  vitality.   At  the  same\ntime, we are also of  the  opinion  that  the  institutional  integrity  and\njudicial discipline require that pronouncement made  by  larger  Benches  of\nthis Court cannot be ignored by the smaller  Benches  without  appropriately\nexplaining the reasons for not following the  pronouncements  made  by  such\nlarger Benches.  With due respect to all the  learned  Judges  who  rendered\nthe subsequent judgments - where right to privacy is  asserted  or  referred\nto their Lordships concern for the liberty of human beings, we  are  of  the\nhumble  opinion  that  there  appears  to  be  certain  amount  of  apparent\nunresolved contradiction in the law declared by this Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_14\">13.    Therefore,  in  our  opinion  to  give  a  quietus  to  the  kind  of\ncontroversy raised in this batch of cases once for all, it  is  better  that\nthe ratio decidendi of <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_26\">M.P. Sharma</a>  (supra)  and  Kharak  Singh  (supra)  is\nscrutinized and the jurisprudential correctness of the subsequent  decisions\nof this Court where the right to privacy is either asserted or  referred  be\nexamined and authoritatively decided by a Bench of appropriate strength.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">14.   We, therefore, direct the Registry to place these matters  before  the\nHon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                                                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_15\">………….…………………..J.\n\n      (J.

The\nlast interim order in force is the  order  of  this  Court  dated  23.9.2013\nwhich reads as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      “....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            All the matters require to be heard finally.  List  all  matters\nfor final hearing after the Constitution Bench is over.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            In the meanwhile, no person should suffer for  not  getting  the\nAadhaar card inspite of the fact that some authority had issued  a  circular\nmaking it mandatory and when any person applies  to  get  the  Aadhaar  card\nvoluntarily, it may be checked whether that person is entitled for it  under\nthe law and it should not be given to any illegal immigrant.”\n\n\n\n      It was  submitted  by  Shri  Shyam  Divan,  learned  counsel  for  the\npetitioners that the petitioners having pointed  out  a  serious  breach  of\nprivacy in their submissions, preceding the reference, this Court may  grant\nan injunction restraining the authorities from  proceeding  further  in  the\nmatter of obtaining biometrics etc. for an Aadhaar card.  Shri  Shyam  Divan\nsubmitted that the biometric information of an individual can be  circulated\nto other authorities or corporate bodies which, in turn can be used by  them\nfor commercial exploitation and, therefore, must be stopped.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      The learned Attorney General pointed out,  on  the  other  hand,  that\nthis Court has at no point of time, even  while  making  the  interim  order\ndated 23.9.2013 granted an injunction restraining the Unique  Identification\nAuthority of India  from  going  ahead  and  obtaining  biometric  or  other\ninformation from a citizen  for  the  purpose  of  a  Unique  Identification\nNumber, better known as “Aadhaar card”.  It was further submitted  that  the\nrespondents have gone ahead with the project and have issued  Aadhaar  cards\nto about 90% of the population.  Also that a large amount of money has  been\nspent by the Union Government on this project for issuing Aadhaar cards  and\nthat in the circumstances, none of the well-known  consideration  for  grant\nof injunction are in favour of the petitioners.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      The learned Attorney General stated that the respondents do not  share\nany personal information of an Aadhaar card  holder  through  biometrics  or\notherwise with any other person or authority.   This  statement  allays  the\napprehension for now, that there is a widespread breach of privacy of  those\nto whom an Aadhaar card has  been  issued.   It  was  further  contended  on\nbehalf of the petitioners that there still is breach of privacy.  This is  a\nmatter which need not be gone into further at this stage.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      The learned Attorney General has further submitted  that  the  Aadhaar\ncard is of great benefit since it ensures  an  effective  implementation  of\nseveral  social  benefit  schemes  of  the  Government  like  MGNREGA,   the\ndistribution of food, ration and kerosene through PDS system  and  grant  of\nsubsidies in the distribution of LPG.  It  was,  therefore,  submitted  that\nrestraining the respondents from issuing  further  Aadhaar  cards  or  fully\nutilising  the  existing  Aadhaar  cards  for  the  social  schemes  of  the\nGovernment should be allowed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      The learned Attorney General further stated that the respondent  Union\nof India would  ensure  that  Aadhaar  cards  would  only  be  issued  on  a\nconsensual basis after informing the public at large  about  the  fact  that\nthe  preparation  of  Aadhaar  card  involving  the  parting  of   biometric\ninformation of the individual, which shall  however  not  be  used  for  any\npurpose other than a social benefit schemes.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      Having considered the matter, we are of the view that the  balance  of\ninterest would be best served, till the  matter  is  finally  decided  by  a\nlarger Bench if the Union of India or the  UIDA  proceed  in  the  following\nmanner:-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">1.    The Union of India shall give wide publicity  in  the  electronic  and\nprint  media  including  radio  and  television  networks  that  it  is  not\nmandatory for a citizen to obtain an Aadhaar card;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">2.    The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for  obtaining\nany benefits otherwise due to a citizen;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">3.    The Unique Identification Number or the Aadhaar card will not be  used\nby the respondents for  any  purpose  other  than  the  PDS  Scheme  and  in\nparticular for the purpose of distribution of  foodgrains, etc. and  cooking\nfuel, such as kerosene.  The Aadhaar card may also be used for  the  purpose\nof the LPG Distribution Scheme;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">4.     The  information  about  an  individual  obtained   by   the   Unique\nIdentification Authority of India while issuing an Aadhaar  card  shall  not\nbe used for any other purpose, save as above, except as may be  directed  by\na Court for the purpose of criminal investigation.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">      Ordered accordingly.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                                            ………….…………………..J.\n\n       (J.

It was in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_32\">Kharak Singh v. State  of  U.P.</a>,  AIR  1963  SC\n1295 that the question as to the proper scope and meaning of the  expression\n&#x27;personal liberty&#x27; came up pointedly for consideration for  the  first  time\nbefore this Court. The majority of the Judges took the view &quot;that  &#x27;personal\nliberty&#x27; is used in the article as a  compendious  term  to  include  within\nitself all the varieties of  rights  which  go  to  make  up  the  &#x27;personal\nliberties&#x27; of man other than those- dealt with in  the  several  clauses  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words,  while  <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19(1)</a> deals  with  particular\nspecies  or   attributes,   of   that   freedom,   &#x27;personal   liberty&#x27;   in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> takes  in  and  comprises  the  residue&quot;.  The  minority  judges,\nhowever, disagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained  their\nposition  in  the  following  words:  &quot;No  doubt  the  expression  &#x27;personal\nliberty&#x27; is a  comprehensive  one  and  the  right  to  move  freely  is  an\nattribute of personal liberty. It is said that the freedom  to  move  freely\nis carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the  expression  &#x27;personal\nliberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our view, this is  not  a\ncorrect approach. Both are independent fundamental rights, though  there  is\noverlapping. There is no question of one being carved out  of  another.  The\nfundamental right of life and personal liberty has many attributes and  some\nof them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19.</a>  If  a  person&#x27;s  fundamental  right  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State can  rely  upon  a  law  to  sustain  the\naction, but that cannot be a complete answer unless the said  law  satisfies\nthe test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_39\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(2)</a> so far  as  the  attributes  covered  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 19(1)</a> are concerned&quot;.</span> There can be no doubt  that  in  view  of  the\ndecision of this Court in R. C. Cooper  v.  Union  of  India, (1970)  2  SCC\n298 the minority view must be regarded as  correct  and  the  majority  view\nmust be held to have been overruled. \n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">[4]    Para 9.  “Right to privacy is not enumerated as a  fundamental  right\nin our Constitution but has been inferred from Article 21.”\n\n[5]     Para 18.  “The  right  to  privacy  —  by  itself  —  has  not  been\nidentified under the Constitution. As a concept it  may  be  too  broad  and\nmoralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be  claimed\nor has been infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the  said\ncase. But the right to hold a  telephone  conversation  in  the  privacy  of\none’s home or office  without  interference  can  certainly  be  claimed  as\n“right to privacy”. Conversations on the telephone are often of an  intimate\nand confidential character. Telephone  conversation  is  a  part  of  modern\nman’s life. It is considered so important that  more  and  more  people  are\ncarrying  mobile  telephone  instruments   in   their   pockets.   Telephone\nconversation is an important  facet  of  a  man’s  private  life.  Right  to\nprivacy would certainly include telephone conversation  in  the  privacy  of\none’s home or office.
