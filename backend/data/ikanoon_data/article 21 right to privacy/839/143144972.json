VIJAYSEN REDDY\n\n                WRIT PETITION No.24850 of 2021\nORDER:</pre>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">      This writ petition is filed by xxxxx, who is aged 16 years,\n\nthrough her mother and natural guardian, seeking for a direction to\n\nthe respondent No.4 to terminate her pregnancy medically, as per the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_1\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> and as\n\namended in 2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    It is stated in the affidavit by the petitioner that a member of\n\nher extended family sexually exploited her without her consent.\n\nShe was threatened and emotionally abused with dire consequences.\n\nShe did not reveal the situation to anyone in her family. Subsequently,\n\nwhen she was not keeping good health, she was taken for medical\n\ncheck up on 29.09.2011 to the respondent No.4/hospital. As directed\n\nby the said hospital, she approached C.C. Shroff Memorial Hospital for\n\nmedical check-up where she was diagnosed with foetus of 25 weeks.\n\nCurrently, the gestational age of the foetus is 26 weeks. On enquiry by\n\nthe parents, the petitioner stated that she was threatened with dire\n\nconsequences and the accused threatened to kill her mother. On a\n\ncomplaint lodged on 24.09.2021 by the mother of the petitioner\n\nagainst one Anjaneyulu @ Anji, FIR.No.239 of 2021 was registered for\n\nthe offences under <a href=\"/doc/1677485/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 376(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_3\">506</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1863458/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 6</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 5</a> of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,\n\n2012. Later during investigation, A2 was also included as accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.    It is submitted that during check-up at C.C. Shroff Memorial\n\nHospital, the concerned doctors have submitted detailed observation\n\nstating the foetal biometry as 25 weeks as on 22.09.2021 and that the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s health is not in a stable condition and she was advised with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      2</span>\n\n\nnecessary medical care. It is further submitted that there is a threat to\n\nthe physical and mental health of the petitioner, aged 16 years, as the\n\nformation of foetus is not a choice but purely circumstantial, as the\n\npregnancy is the result of sexual assault and rape. The petitioner at\n\nher tender age is not in a position to bear the child physically, mentally\n\nand financially. Considering the situation of the petitioner, who is in\n\ndire need of protection and dependency, she is not in a stage to bear\n\nor nourish the foetus. The respondent No.4/hospital did not terminate\n\nthe pregnancy of the petitioner as the petitioner was beyond gestation\n\nperiod and needs permission as established by law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Ms. Sravya Katta, learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted\n\nthat a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive choice is also a dimension\n\nof personal liberty as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India. It is important to recognize that reproductive choice can be\n\nexercised to procreate as well as to abstain from procreating.\n\nThe crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity\n\nand bodily integrity should be respected. A woman has self-rule over\n\nher body. The right to life and individual freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India envelops the option to settle on regenerative\n\ndecisions. It is inhuman to subject woman, who is over 24 weeks\n\npregnant, to legal deferrals. Infringement of right to life of a rape\n\nvictim outweighs the right to life of the child in the womb.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">5.

Due to preterm pregnancy the\n          aborting process may be lengthy may lead to sepsis and\n          sometimes may be subjected for surgical procedure like\n          hysterotomy. For surgical procedure the petitioner requires\n          anesthesia which can risk her conscious levels and central\n          nervous system derailment. In the due course above, the\n          petitioner may have the above complications which can\n          endanger her life during procedure, and later on may have\n          psychological depression.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">10.       In xxx. v. UNION OF INDIA1, the High Court of Kerala at\n\nErnakulam held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">          &quot;9. The position of law regarding medical termination of\n          pregnancy is well settled. When the period of gestation exceeds\n          that prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47920/\" id=\"a_12\">4</a> of the Medical Termination\n          of   Pregnancy   Act,   1971   (for   short   &#x27;the   Act&#x27;),   medical\n          termination of pregnancy can be carried out only by an order of\n          a Court of law. The statute has provided in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 3</a> of the Act\n          that if the length of pregnancy exceeds 12 weeks but does not\n          exceed 20 weeks, termination can be carried out only after two\n          registered medical practitioners form an opinion that the\n          continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n    2021 SCC OnLine Ker 1800\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           6</span>\n\n          the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical and\n          mental health or there is substantial risk to the child after born.\n          Explanation 1 to <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3</a> specifies that if the pregnancy is\n          caused on account of a rape committed on the woman, it shall\n          be presumed that the anguish caused by the pregnancy would\n          constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant\n          woman. The words used in explanation is &quot;shall be presumed&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">          The   word   &quot;shall   be   presumed&quot;   created   as   a   statutory\n          presumption clearly shows the intention of the legislature. In\n          the case of rape, the anguish on account of the pregnancy is\n          statutorily regarded as a grave injury to the mental health of\n          the pregnant woman, sufficient to terminate the pregnancy on\n          the basis of opinion of two registered medical practitioners.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">          10.

Since in the present case, the period of gestation\n          has reached 26 weeks and more, the question as to the effect\n          of the amendment and whether the amendment has been\n          notified are not being considered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">          ...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">          15. In view of the opinion of the Medical Board that the medical\n          termination of pregnancy can be considered, if the higher risk\n          and facts mentioned in the report are acceptable, this Court\n          elicited the views of the parents of the victim through the\n          counsel for the petitioner. They also expressed their desire to\n          terminate the pregnancy taking into account the traumatic\n          experience for the victim as well as the possible genetic\n          disorders that may befall the unborn child due to the close\n          relationship with the alleged offender of the rape.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">          16.

It is clear from the\n\nreport that the health condition of the petitioner and foetus is stable.\n\nHowever, it needs to be noted that under Explanation 2 to <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(2)</a>\n\nof the Act of 2021, there is a presumption that anguish caused to the\n\nrape victim by pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave\n\ninjury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">14.   The circumstances which lead to the petitioner&#x27;s pregnancy on\n\naccount of unfortunate events of sexual abuse without any shadow of\n\ndoubt would cause mental and physical stress and anguish to the\n\npetitioner. Though there is restriction under the statute for terminating\n\npregnancy, if the gestation of foetus is more than 24 weeks, it is\n\nsettled law that the Constitutional Courts are empowered to direct\n\ntermination of pregnancy. If the petitioner is compelled to continue\n\nwith pregnancy caused by rape, it would infringe her right to life\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">15.   A woman has right to make a choice to carry pregnancy, at the\n\nsame time, it is her right not to carry pregnancy, however, subject to\n\nconditions and restrictions enumerated under the provisions of the Act\n\nof 2021. If the petitioner is not permitted to terminate the pregnancy,\n\nthere is every possibility of the petitioner undergoing severe physical\n\nand mental stress, which may have adverse effect on her future health\n\nand prospects. So also it needs to be noted, the petitioner is 16 years\n\nold, and with the mental stress she is undergoing, it cannot be said\n\nwith certainty that the petitioner would be able to carry the pregnancy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                      10</span>\n\n\nuntil the child and that too a healthy child is delivered. There may be\n\nmedical complications encountered by the petitioner and also to the\n\nfoetus or to be born child. The parents of the petitioner have\n\nexpressed, through their counsel, that the petitioner is not in a\n\nposition to continue the pregnancy and there is threat to life of the\n\npetitioner on account of physical and mental stress she is undergoing\n\non day-to-day basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">16.      This Court is of the opinion that the life of the foetus or to be\n\nborn child cannot be placed at higher pedestal than that of the life of\n\nthe petitioner. The dignity, self-respect, healthy living (mental or\n\nphysical) etc. are facets of right to life and personal liberty enshrined\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, which also include right of\n\na woman to make a choice of pregnancy and terminate pregnancy, in\n\ncase, where pregnancy is caused by rape or sexual abuse or for that\n\nmatter unplanned pregnancy, subject to reasonable restrictions under\n\nlaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">17.
