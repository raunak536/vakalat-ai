One of the submissions raised by the appellants is that marks of\n             deleted questions ought not to have been redistributed in other\n             questions. It is submitted that either all the candidates should have\n             been given equal marks for all the deleted questions or marks ought to\n             have been given only to those candidates who attempted those\n             questions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">             25.      The questions having been deleted from the answers, the\n             question paper has to be treated as containing the question less the\n             deleted questions. Redistribution of marks with regard to deleted\n             questions cannot be said to be arbitrary or irrational.              The\n             Commission has adopted a uniform method to deal with all the\n             candidates looking to the number of the candidates. We are of the\n             view that all the candidates have been benefited by the\n             redistribution of marks in accordance with the number of correct\n             answers which have been given by them. We, thus, do not find\n             any fault with redistribution of marks of the deleted marks. The\n             High Court has rightly approved the said methodology.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      In Varun Chandiok&#x27;s case (supra), the judgment relied upon by the\n\ncounsel for the petitioners in Guru Nanak Dev University&#x27;s case (supra) has\n\nbeen referred to in extenso and the following observations have been made:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">             7.       In Guru Nanak Dev University&#x27;s case (supra), the Punjab\n             Medical Entrance Test conducted by the appellant-University was\n             subject matter of consideration. The writ petitions were filed before this\n             Court by some of the candidates raising a grievance that the key\n             answers in respect of 21 questions were incorrect. The High Court\n             appointed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to\n             examine the correctness of key answers. The report was submitted to\n             the effect that 10 key answers out of 21 were incorrect. Thereafter, the\n             High Court directed that key answers in respect of 200 questions\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">                                     10 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                           [ 11 ]\n\n\n\n\n           deserves to be re-examined without cancelling the entire Entrance Test.\n           It was ordered that the majority view of the Committee appointed by\n           the High Court would be the basis of the revised/correct key answers.\n           In an appeal, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court sought report from the CBSE\n           as well as from the Delhi University on the correctness of 10 key\n           answers. The Court found that out of such questions, 8 questions are\n           demonstrably erroneous, whereas in respect of 2 questions, benefit of\n           doubt as per law well settled has to go in favour of the examining body.\n           The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court directed that the key answers of such\n           questions should be re-examined by the University in the light of the\n           reports of the CBSE and the Delhi University.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">           8.       The Court also found that 7 questions are so vague as that they\n           are incapable of having a correct answer. The University has given\n           credit to all the students, who had participated in the Entrance Test.\n           Such course was not found to be proper. Having said so, the Court\n           found that the reasonable procedure would be to give credit only to\n           those, who attempted such questions or some of them. The University\n           was directed to revise the result accordingly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">           9.       We do not find that the said judgment provides any assistance to\n           the arguments raised. The action of the University in giving credit to all\n           the students, whether they have attempted the questions or not, was\n           found to be unjustified. In the present case, the examining body has\n           taken a conscious decision that credit or discredit of such questions\n           shall not be given to any student irrespective of the fact whether a\n           student has attempted such questions or not. Therefore, all students\n           have been assessed on the basis of 120 questions rather than on the\n           basis of 125 questions. Numerous eventualities can be conceived as a\n           result of such decision; such as, a candidate, who has answered the\n           questions correct, has been deprived of the marks, whereas a candidate,\n           who has not understood the questions correctly and not attempted the\n           same or attempted wrongly, would stand to benefit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">           10.      In a writ petition, we are not to examine the numerable\n           circumstances, which may ensue as a result of deletion of such\n           questions. As a part of judicial review, the jurisdiction of this Court is\n           to examine the decision making process. Whether the decision making\n           process of deleting the questions is so arbitrary, unreasonable or\n           irrational that it cannot be sustained. The examining body is the most\n\n\n\n                                   11 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                             [ 12 ]\n\n\n\n\n             suitable to decide, whether such questions are vague or the options are\n             incorrect or not possible. Such decision of the examining body has to\n             be respected. The decision of the examining body that questions need\n             to be deleted cannot be said to be arbitrary, unreasonable or irrational,\n             which may warrant interference by this Court in exercise of its writ\n             jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">             11.      We find that the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner\n             to be contradictory, when the petitioner seeks deletion of three\n             questions i.e. 78, 83 &amp; 125. Again, whether the question should be\n             deleted or not depends upon the opinion of the examining body. The\n             decision of the examining body to delete some questions or not to\n             delete other questions cannot be said to be violative of any principle of\n             natural justice or arbitrary or irrational, which may warrant interference\n             in any manner.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43441416\" id=\"span_22\">In <a href=\"/doc/43441416/\" id=\"a_5\">Monika Goyal</a>&#x27;s case (supra) also, this Court was dealing with the\n\ncorrectness of the answer key in regard to the preliminary examination held for\n\nthe selection in the cadre of Punjab Civil Services (Judicial Branch).

Undoubtedly, the Question\n           as printed in the concerned Booklet is Grammatically incorrect,\n           although a common sense inference might be drawn that what was\n           being asked is which of the given Answers could be described as\n           &#x27;Immovable Property&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1345438/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 3</a> of the Transfer of Property Act.\n           The Committee however chose to play safe and therefore deleted this\n           question altogether on the premise that it could have prejudiced some\n           of the candidates, who were provided with the Booklet Code &#x27;A&#x27;.\n           Admittedly, there was no printing mistake in relation to this question in\n           Booklets &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27;. It emerges that the question was deleted\n           only after the examination had already been completed. Consequently,\n           three quarters (3/4ths) of the candidates in whose booklets, where there\n           was no mistake, surely stand to be prejudiced for deletion of this\n           question after they had attempted it and presumably given the correct\n           answer. Even in relation to the small typographical error in the question\n           where the letter &#x27;f&#x27; has been printed in place of the words &#x27;is&#x27; or &#x27;can be&#x27;,\n           our view is that question was certainly capable of being understood by\n           any average student of Law conversant with the relevant Section of the\n           Transfer of Property Act.

The question, thus, arose as to whether the\n\npetitioners have been taken by surprise by the examiner by inserting these two\n\nquestions in the question paper.      Had the questions been inserted from some\n\nsubjects other than law, then the matter would have been different but since the\n\nexaminees are aspirants to become judicial officers, the said questions have\n\nbeen asked by the examiner generally to test their legal aptitude.

The accused need not take the plea explicitly. He can succeed\n              in his plea if he is able to bring out from the evidence of the\n              prosecution witnesses or other evidence that the apparent criminal act\n              was committed by him in exercise of his right of private defence.

There is a clear\n           distinction between the nature of burden that is cast on an accused\n           under <a href=\"/doc/429611/\" id=\"a_53\">section 105</a> of the Evidence Act (read with <a href=\"/doc/777353/\" id=\"a_54\">section 96</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1606852/\" id=\"a_55\">106</a> of\n           Indian Penal Code) to establish a plea of private defence and the burden\n           that is cast on the prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/147127/\" id=\"a_56\">section 101</a> of the Evidence Act to\n           prove its case. The burden on the accused is not as onerous as that\n           which lies on the prosecution. While the prosecution is required to\n           prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused can discharge his\n           onus by establishing a preponderance of probability (vide Partap vs.\n           State of U.P.

In order to find whether right\n           of private defence is available or not, the injuries received by the\n           accused, the imminence of threat to his safety, the injuries caused by\n           the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to\n           have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be\n           considered. Whether in a particular set of circumstances, a person acted\n           in the exercise of the right of private defence, is a question of fact to be\n           determined on the facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the\n           abstract for determining such a question can be laid down. In\n           determining this question of fact, the Court must consider all the\n           surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to plead\n           in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances\n           show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is\n           open to the Court to consider such a plea. In a given case, the Court can\n           consider it even if the accused has not taken it.

The court\n                      shall presume the absence of such circumstances.

An accused taking\n                      the plea of the right of private defence is not required to call\n                      evidence; he can establish his plea by reference to circumstances\n                      transpiring from the prosecution evidence itself.

When the right of private defence is\n                      pleaded, the defence must be a reasonable and probable version\n                      satisfying the court that the harm caused by the accused was\n                      necessary for either warding off the attack or for forestalling the\n                      further reasonable apprehension from the side of the accused.\n                      The burden of establishing the plea of self-defence is on the\n                      accused and the burden stands discharged by showing\n                      preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis\n                      of the material on record.

While addressing these challenges, the Bench of three judges of this\n           Court took note of several decisions of this Court in which the right to\n           privacy has been held to be a constitutionally protected fundamental\n           right. Those decisions include: <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_66\">Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>,\n           (1975) 2 SCC 148 (&#x27;Gobind&quot;), R Rajagopal v.

These\n           subsequent decisions which affirmed the existence of a constitutionally\n           protected right of privacy, were rendered by Benches of a strength\n           smaller than those in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh. Faced with this\n           predicament and having due regard to the far-reaching questions of\n           importance involving interpretation of the Constitution, it was felt that\n           institutional integrity and judicial discipline would require a reference\n           to a larger Bench. Hence the Bench of three learned judges observed in\n           its order dated 11 August 2015:</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_74\">&quot;12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand raise far\n                  reaching questions of importance involving interpretation of the\n                  Constitution. What is at stake is the amplitude of the\n                  fundamental rights including that precious and inalienable right\n                  under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21.</a> If the observations made in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_69\">M.P.

At the same time, we are also of the opinion that the\n\n\n\n                                 38 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">             ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                             [ 39 ]\n\n\n\n\n                   institutional integrity and judicial discipline require that\n                   pronouncement made by larger Benches of this Court cannot be\n                   ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately\n                   explaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements\n                   made by such larger Benches. With due respect to all the\n                   learned Judges who rendered the subsequent judgments - where\n                   right to privacy is asserted or referred to their Lordships concern\n                   for the liberty of human beings, we are of the humble opinion\n                   that there appears to be certain amount of apparent unresolved\n                   contradiction in the law declared by this Court.</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_77\">13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the kind of\n                   controversy raised in this batch of cases once for all, it is better\n                   that the ratio decidendi of <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_72\">M.P.

The\n                   determination of this question would essentially entail whether\n                   the decision recorded by this Court in M.P.

The opinion of experts is, admittedly,\n      advisory in nature and it is open to a Judge to form an opinion contrary to that\n      of an expert. In this view of the matter, both options &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; were correct\n      and consequently, option &#x27;D&#x27; was the correct answer also on account of the\n      fact that the Option &#x27;D&#x27; gives the most correct and appropriate answer whether\n      question asked in the examination. Once both the option were correct and the\n      question was not whether one options was better worded than the other, the\n      submission of the Petitioner that option &#x27;B&#x27; was the correct answer, is liable to\n      be rejected.</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_15\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">      Q      Question No. 6</span>\n             &quot;6.

A non-testamentary document means any\n      document except a Will. For such a document, it is imperative that it should\n      not only be final and irrevocable but should also be intended to take effect or\n      become operative immediately on its execution. Thus, a document like a sale\n      deed not only becomes operative immediately on its execution but is also final\n      and irrevocable. Thus for a non-testamentary document to acquire recognition\n      in law, it needs to possess a final and irrevocable character and thus, option\n      &#x27;D&#x27;, out of all the options, was the most appropriate answer.\n      In respect of question No.40, counsel for the petitioners have submitted\n\nthat the respondents have wrongly given the answer as Option `D&#x27;, whereas it\n\nshould have been Option `A&#x27;. According to them, there is nothing like &quot;Indian\n\nBiometric Identification Scheme&quot;. In this regard, counsel for the petitioners\n\nhave referred to &quot;The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other\n\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, whereas counsel for the\n\nrespondents has referred to a decision of the Supreme Court rendered in the\n\ncase of Justice K.S.Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs. UOI and others, AIR 2017 SC\n\n\n                                       43 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                       [ 44 ]\n\n\n\n\n4161.

She\n\nhas also referred to the view of Justice S.A.Bobde to contend that the dispute\n\nbefore the Court was in regard to the Aadhaar project much-less to the\n\nbiometric scheme introduced by the Government of India. Further, learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents has submitted that the examinee has to read the\n\nquestion carefully before attempting the same. In the said question, it has been\n\nspecifically asked that in what context, the Supreme Court, in 2017, held that\n\nright to privacy is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

It is further submitted that the examiner wanted to test the knowledge of\n\nthe examinees else he would have definitely mentioned in one of the answers to\n\nthe question, a trespasser in settled possession. Since it has been categorically\n\nmentioned &quot;a trespasser&quot;, therefore, the answer cannot be &quot;a trespasser&quot; and it\n\nshould have been &quot;a trespasser in settled possession&quot; because a trespasser, may\n\nbe for a short period, cannot file a suit under <a href=\"/doc/885718/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 6</a> of the Act of 1963.

Thus, as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 14</a> of the Act, the aforesaid period can be excluded for the purpose of\n\nbringing the suit within the period of limitation. Thus, <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_115\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_116\">14</a> are\n\nindependent where <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 14</a> has no applicability in the facts of the case and,\n\nthus, both are independent and operate in different fields. However, where an\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 has been filed and\n\nwarrants adjudication and wherever such an application is found to be\n\nmeritorious, the time period spent by a litigant in proceedings before a wrong\n\nforum in a bona fide manner would have to be excluded from the period of\n\nlimitation and the bar of limitation under <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 3</a> would thus be subject to the\n\nprovisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">       Thus, the objection raised by the petitioners in this regard is hereby\n\nrejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">       Insofar as question No.114 is concerned, it has not been pressed by the\n\npetitioners and, therefore, it is not delved into by this Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">       Insofar as question No.27 is concerned, the answer given by the\n\nrespondents is Option `D&#x27;, whereas according to the petitioners, it should have\n\n\n                                    46 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                 ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                       [ 47 ]\n\n\n\n\nbeen Option `B&#x27;.

The explanation given by the respondents is that admittedly, an\n\nopinion of the expert is only advisory in nature and the judge can form an\n\nopinion other than that of the expert, whereas the explanation given by the\n\npetitioners is that the question is &quot;what is the effect of the opinion of the\n\nexpert&quot; would carry one answer and Option `B&#x27; is the right answer and not\n\nOptions `B&#x27; and `C&#x27; both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">       We are not satisfied with the explanation given by the petitioners\n\nbecause the effect of opinion of the experts upon the Court is only advisory in\n\nnature as the judge can also form an opinion contrary to that of the expert,\n\ntherefore, the answer Option `D&#x27; is found to be more appropriate and hence, the\n\nobjection raised by the petitioners in this regard is also rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">       Insofar as Question No.6 is concerned, it pertains to a non-testamentary\n\ndocument.

As the Ordinance does\n           not specifically prescribe that the offence shall be bailable or non-\n           bailable, hence, the provisions of the General Law i.e. Part II of the\n           First Schedule appended with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_140\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> shall\n           apply, which provides               that if the offence is punishable with\n           imprisonment for three years and upwards but not more than 7 years it\n           shall be non-bailable and if punishable within imprisonment for less\n           than three years or with a fine only, it shall be a bailable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">                    Therefore, it cannot be said that declaration of Talaq under the\n           Ordinance is a non-bailable offence as has been claimed by the\n           Petitioner.

The High Court has committed a serious illegality in coming to the\n                conclusion that &quot;it cannot be said with certainty that answers to six\n                questions given in the key answers were erroneous and incorrect&quot;. As\n                already noticed, the key answers are palpably and demonstrably\n                erroneous. In that view of the matter, the student community, whether\n                the appellants or interveners or even those who did not approach the\n                High Court or this Court, cannot be mace to suffer on account of errors\n                committed by the University. For the present, we say no more because\n                there is nothing on record as to how this error crept up in giving the\n                erroneous key answers and who was negligent. At the same time,\n                however, it is necessary to note that the University and those who\n                prepare the key answers have to be very careful and abundant caution is\n                necessary in these matters for more than one reasons. We mention few\n                of those; first and paramount reason being the welfare of the student\n                and a wrong key answer can result in the merit being made a casualty.\n                One can well understand the predicament of a young student at the\n                threshold of his or her career if despite giving correct answer, the\n                student suffers as a result of wrong and demonstrably erroneous key\n                answer; the second reason is that the courts are slow in interfering in\n                education matters which, in turn, casts a higher responsibility on the\n                University while preparing the key answers; and thirdly, in cases of\n                doubt, benefit goes in favour of the University and not in favour of the\n                students. If this attitude of casual approach in providing key answer is\n                adopted by concerned persons, directions may have to be issued for\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">                                      56 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n CWP No.2943 of 2019 and other connected cases                                        [ 57 ]\n\n\n\n\n             taking appropriate action, including the disciplinary action, against\n             those responsible for wrong and demonstrably erroneous key answers\n             but we refrain from issuing such directions in the present case.&quot;\n      Thus, we issue only a piece of advice to the respondents to be very\n\ncareful in future with regard to framing of questions and finalizing the answer\n\nkey(s) whenever any competitive examination is to be held by them.</p><pre id=\"pre_20\">\n\n\n\n                                                         (Rakesh Kumar Jain)\n                                                                 Judge\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2019                                        (Harnaresh Singh Gill)\nvinod*                                                          Judge\n\n\n             Whether speaking / reasoned         : Yes\n\n             Whether reportable                  : Yes\n\n\n\n\n                                   57 of 57\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">               ::: Downloaded on - 17-02-2019 08:31:19 :::</span>\n </pre>","numcites":63,"numcitedby":24,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":141379817,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"maintenance under section 125","formInput":"maintenance%20under%20section%20125"},{"value":"sec 14 limitation act","formInput":"sec%2014%20limitation%20act"},{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"settled possession","formInput":"settled%20possession"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"aadhaar","formInput":"aadhaar"},{"value":"typographical error","formInput":"typographical%20error"},{"value":"section 14 of limitation ","formInput":"section%2014%20of%20limitation%20"},{"value":"private defence","formInput":"private%20defence"},{"value":"transfer of property act","formInput":"transfer%20of%20property%20act"},{"value":"concubine","formInput":"concubine"},{"value":"right of private defence","formInput":"right%20of%20private%20defence"},{"value":"specific relief act","formInput":"specific%20relief%20act"},{"value":"expert opinion","formInput":"expert%20opinion"},{"value":"self defence","formInput":"self%20defence"},{"value":"section 125","formInput":"section%20125"},{"value":"indian evidence act","formInput":"indian%20evidence%20act"},{"value":"sec.125 of cr pc","formInput":"sec.125%20of%20cr%20pc"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"wrong forum","formInput":"wrong%20forum"}],"cats":[{"value":"time-exclusion-from-limitation","formInput":"tag:time-exclusion-from-limitation"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"bar-of-limitation","formInput":"tag:bar-of-limitation"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
