In default of payment of\n      fine the convict shall further undergo Simple\n      Imprisonment for a period of three months.

The appellant convict being aggrieved by the\n\njudgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the\n\nTrial Court went in appeal before the High Court of Delhi.\n\nThe High Court upon re-appreciation of the entire evidence\n\non record, dismissed the appeal and thereby affirmed the\n\njudgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the\n\nTrial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">13.     In such circumstances referred to above, the\n\nappellant is here before this Court with the present appeal.\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">14.     Mr. Jayesh Gaurav, the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellant convict vehemently submitted that the\n\nCourts below committed a serious error in holding that the\n\nprosecution was successful in establishing its case against\n\nthe appellant convict beyond reasonable doubt.                He\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                              19</span>\n\fsubmitted that the conviction of the appellant convict is\n\nessentially based on the evidence of the PW 1 – Sushil\n\nKumar. According to the learned counsel, there is no other\n\nevidence on record to connect the appellant convict with the\n\nalleged crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">15.   The learned counsel laid much stress on the fact that\n\nthe case of the prosecution is one of robbery and murder.\n\nThe time of the alleged incident is early in the morning at\n\n3.30. He argued that although the incident occurred at a\n\nvegetable market, yet there were no sufficient lights in that\n\narea to enable the assailants to easily identify or to put it in\n\nother words, the PW 1 as an injured eye witness must not\n\nhave had the occasion to even have a bare glimpse of the\n\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">16.   It was argued that the investigating officer had\n\narranged a TIP but the appellant convict had declined to\n\nparticipate in the same as he had already been shown to\n\nthe witnesses in the police station. He further submitted\n\nthat the PW 4, namely, Pradeep Kumar also claims to be an\n\neye witness to the incident. However, both the Trial Court\n\nand the High Court disbelieved his oral evidence as his\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                              20</span>\n\fpresence at the place of occurrence was found to be\n\ndoubtful. Therefore, according to the learned counsel, the\n\nentire case hinges on the evidence of a solitary eye witness\n\ni.e. PW 1 Sushil Kumar. He argued that PW 1 Sushil Kumar\n\nidentified the appellant convict herein and other three\n\nco-accused for the first time before the Trial Court. This\n\nidentification for the first time before the Trial Court could\n\nnot have been relied upon being a weak piece of evidence to\n\nhold the appellant convict guilty of the offences charged\n\nwith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">17.     The learned counsel vehemently submitted that the\n\nCourts below ought not to have drawn any adverse\n\ninference against the appellant convict for not having\n\nparticipated in the TIP. According to the learned counsel,\n\nthe TIP is a part of the police investigation and the accused\n\ncannot be compelled to submit himself to the TIP, more\n\nparticularly if the case of the accused is that he was already\n\nshown to the witness before the TIP could be undertaken.\n\nIn other words, the submission of the learned counsel is\n\nthat if the identification of the appellant convict for the first\n\ntime before the Trial Court is eschewed from consideration,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                              21</span>\n\fthen there is no other evidence to connect him with the\n\nalleged act. The learned counsel submitted that the\n\nprosecution seeks to rely upon the discovery of the weapon\n\nof offence i.e. the ice pick and an amount of Rs. 7,000/- of\n\nthe denomination of one thousand from the house of the\n\nappellant convict, but it is not a discovery in the eye of law\n\nas the same is not in conformity with <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 (for short, ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_25\">Evidence Act</a>’).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">18.   In such circumstances referred to above, the learned\n\ncounsel prayed that there being merit in his appeal, the\n\nsame may be allowed and the appellant convict be acquitted\n\nof all the charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE (NCT OF\nDELHI)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">19.   On the other hand, this appeal was vehemently\n\nopposed by Mr. K.M. Nataraj, the learned Additional\n\nSolicitor General appearing for the State (NCT of Delhi). He\n\nsubmitted that no error, not to speak of any error of law,\n\ncould be said to have been committed by the Courts below\n\nin holding the appellant convict guilty of the offences he was\n\ncharged with. The learned ASG submitted that the Courts\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                             22</span>\n\fbelow were justified in drawing adverse inference against\n\nthe appellant convict for having declined to participate in\n\nthe TIP. It was argued that once having declined to\n\nparticipate in the TIP, the accused thereafter cannot object\n\nor say anything against as regards the evidentiary value of\n\nthe identification by the eye witnesses of the accused\n\npersons before the Trial Court. He further argued that the\n\nidentification of the accused by the eye witnesses before the\n\nTrial Court constitutes substantive evidence and, if TIP is\n\ncarried out in the course of the investigation, then the\n\nproceedings of such TIP would corroborate the substantive\n\nevidence of identification before the Court. The learned ASG\n\nsubmitted that the Courts below have believed and found\n\nthe identification of the accused appellant for the first time\n\nbefore the Trial Court, absolutely reliable and trustworthy.\n\nThis being a question of fact, the same may not be disturbed\n\nby this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 136</a>\n\nof the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">20.   The learned ASG further submitted that over and\n\nabove the evidence of identification, there is evidence of\n\ndiscovery of the currency notes of Rs. 7,000/- of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                             23</span>\n\fdenomination of one thousand as well as the weapon of\n\noffence i.e. the ice pick from the house of the appellant\n\nconvict. This, according to the learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral, is one additional incriminating circumstance\n\nagainst the appellant convict pointing towards his guilt.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">21.     In such circumstances referred to above, the learned\n\nASG prayed that there being no merit in this appeal, the\n\nsame may be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">ANALYSIS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">22.

It is true that an accused\n\nmay be said to be compelled to attend a test identification\n\nparade, but this compulsion does not involve any positive\n\nvolitional evidentiary act. His mere attendance or the\n\nexhibition of his body at a test identification parade even\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                            27</span>\n\fthough compelled, does not result in any evidentiary act\n\nuntil   he   is   identified   by    some   other   agency.   The\n\nidentification of him by a witness is not his act, even though\n\nhis body is exhibited for the purpose. His compelled\n\nattendance at a test identification parade is comparatively\n\nremote to the final evidence and cannot be said by itself to\n\nfurnish any positive volitional evidentiary act.

But\n          the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal\n          court to be witness against himself is a\n          prohibition of the use of physical or moral\n          compulsion to extort communications from him,\n          not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it\n          may be material.

The newly inserted Section 54A provides for the\n\nidentification of the arrested person where it is considered\n\nnecessary for the purpose of investigation by the officer-in-\n\ncharge of a police station. The said Section empowers the\n\ncourt, on the request of the officer-in-charge of a police\n\nstation,    to   direct   for    placing   the   accused   at   test\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                  34</span>\n\fidentification parade for identification by any person or\n\npersons in such manner as the court may deem fit.

First Proviso : Identifier mentally or physically\n\ndisabled.─ When the person identifying the suspect is\n\nmentally or physically disabled, the process of identification\n\nmust be under the supervision of a Judicial Magistrate.\n\nThis mandatory requirement of law has been incorporated\n\nin the statute by the amending Act 13 of 2013 w.e.f.\n\n03.02.2013. It is the duty of the Magistrate supervising TIP\n\nto take appropriate steps to ensure that such identifier\n\nidentifies the suspect using methods to which he was\n\ncomfortable with. The Magistrate cannot discharge his duty\n\nlightly or in a slip-shod manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">32.     Second Proviso : Identification when suspect is\n\nmentally or physically disabled. ─ The second proviso to\n\nSection 54A has been inserted in the statute by the\n\namending Act 13 of 2013 w.e.f. 03.02.2013.

It appears that the requirements specified in the\n\nfirst proviso are not attracted for the second proviso. But it\n\nis obligatory that the process of identification of the person\n\narrested shall have to be videographed. Unless this\n\nrequirement is complied with, the identification shall fall to\n\nthe ground and no reliance can be placed on it at any stage\n\nof the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">33.    This Section is restricted to identification of persons\n\nonly. So this Section has no application where the question\n\nof identification of articles arises. TIP is part of investigation\n\nand the investigation of a case is to be conducted by the\n\ninvestigating agency and it is their statutory prerogatives.\n\nThere was no statutory provision authorizing the accused\n\nto pray for placing him in the test parade.

Without having any provision like Section 54A there\n\nhas been so long no difficulty in holding test identification\n\nparades. There are plenty of judicial pronouncements to\n\nshow   the   safeguards    to    be   followed   while   holding\n\nidentification parade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">35.    Thus we are of the view that after the introduction of\n\nSection 54A in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_77\">CrPC</a> <a href=\"/doc/1352483/\" id=\"a_78\">referred to above</a>, an accused is\n\nunder an obligation to stand for identification parade. An\n\naccused cannot resist subjecting himself to the TIP on the\n\nground that he cannot be forced or coerced for the same. If\n\nthe coercion is sought to be imposed in getting from an\n\naccused evidence which cannot be procured save through\n\npositive volitional act on his part, the constitutional\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                37</span>\n\fguarantee as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution will step in to protect him. However, if that\n\nevidence can be procured without any positive volitional\n\nevidentiary act on the part of the accused, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 20(3)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution will have no application. The accused while\n\nsubjecting himself to the TIP does not produce any evidence\n\nor perform any evidentiary act. As explained very succinctly\n\nby the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court as above,\n\nit may be a positive act and even a volitional act, but only\n\nto a limited extent, when the accused is brought to the place\n\nwhere the TIP is to be held. It is certainly not his evidentiary\n\nact. The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground\n\nto resist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a\n\nchance to see him either at the police station or in the\n\nCourt, as the case may be, however, on such ground alone\n\nhe cannot refuse to face the TIP. It is always open for the\n\naccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating\n\nto the legitimacy of the TIP or the evidentiary value of the\n\nsame in the course of the trial. However, the accused cannot\n\ndecline or refuse to join the TIP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                              38</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">\f36.      Thus, our aforesaid discussion answers two of the six\n\nquestions framed by us i.e. (i) whether an accused can\n\ndecline to submit himself to the TIP on the ground that the\n\nsame is violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution and (ii)\n\nthe true purport of any order that the Magistrate may pass\n\nin exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/19936383/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 54A</a> of the CrPC\n\ndirecting any person to subject himself or herself to the TIP.\n\nIMPORTANCE AND EVIDENTIARY VALUE OF TIP\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">37.

The   term\n\n‘identification’ means proving that a person, subject or\n\narticle before the Court is the very same that he or it is\n\nalleged, charged or reputed to be.

Consequently, in\n      a case, such as the present, the Court would be\n      circumspect about drawing an adverse inference from\n      the facts, as they have emerged. In any event, as we\n      have noticed, the identification in the course of a TIP\n      is intended to lend assurance to the identity of the\n      accused.

The test is done to check upon their veracity.\n      In other words, the main object of holding an\n      identification parade, during the investigation stage,\n      is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon\n      first impression and also to enable the prosecution to\n      decide whether all or any of them could be cited as\n      eyewitnesses of the crime. The identification\n      proceedings are in the nature of tests and\n      significantly, therefore, there is no provision for it in\n      the Code and the Evidence Act. It is desirable that a\n      test identification parade should be conducted as\n      soon as after the arrest of the accused. This becomes\n      necessary to eliminate the possibility of the accused\n      being shown to the witnesses prior to the test\n      identification parade. This is a very common plea of\n      the accused and, therefore, the prosecution has to be\n      cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making\n      such an allegation.

This rule of\nprudence, however, is subject to exceptions, when,\nfor example, the court is impressed by a particular\nwitness on whose testimony it can safely rely,\nwithout such or other corroboration.

Under these circumstances, identification\n      of such a named accused only in the Court when the\n      accused was not known earlier to the witness had to\n      be treated as valueless.

Izhar Hussain</a> [(1973) 2\nSCC 406 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 828]) The necessity for\nholding an identification parade can arise only\nwhen the accused are not previously known to the\nwitnesses. The whole idea of a test identification\nparade is that witnesses who claim to have seen\nthe culprits at the time of occurrence are to identify\nthem from the midst of other persons without any\naid or any other source. The test is done to check\nupon their veracity. In other words, the main\nobject of holding an identification parade, during\nthe investigation stage, is to test the memory of the\nwitnesses based upon first impression and also to\nenable the prosecution to decide whether all or\nany of them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the\ncrime. The identification proceedings are in the\nnature of tests and significantly, therefore, there\nis no provision for it in the Code and the Evidence\nAct. It is desirable that a test identification parade\nshould be conducted as soon as after the arrest of\nthe accused. This becomes necessary to eliminate\nthe possibility of the accused being shown to the\nwitnesses prior to the test identification parade.\nThis is a very common plea of the accused and,\ntherefore, the prosecution has to be cautious to\nensure that there is no scope for making such an\nallegation. If, however, circumstances are beyond\ncontrol and there is some delay, it cannot be said\nto be fatal to the prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">17. It is trite to say that the substantive evidence\nis the evidence of identification in court. Apart from\nthe clear provisions of <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence\nAct, the position in law is well settled by a catena\nof decisions of this Court. The facts, which\nestablish the identity of the accused persons, are\nrelevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act. As a\ngeneral rule, the substantive evidence of a witness\nis the statement made in court. The evidence of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                       54</span>\n\fmere identification of the accused person at the\ntrial for the first time is from its very nature\ninherently of a weak character. The purpose of a\nprior test identification, therefore, is to test and\nstrengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence. It\nis, accordingly, considered a safe rule of prudence\nto generally look for corroboration of the sworn\ntestimony of witnesses in court as to the identity\nof the accused who are strangers to them, in the\nform of earlier identification proceedings. This rule\nof prudence, however, is subject to exceptions,\nwhen, for example, the court is impressed by a\nparticular witness on whose testimony it can\nsafely rely, without such or other corroboration.\nThe identification parades belong to the stage of\ninvestigation, and there is no provision in the Code\nwhich obliges the investigating agency to hold or\nconfers a right upon the accused to claim a test\nidentification parade. They do not constitute\nsubstantive evidence and these parades are\nessentially governed by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 162</a> of the Code.\nFailure to hold a test identification parade would\nnot make inadmissible the evidence of\nidentification in court. The weight to be attached\nto such identification should be a matter for the\ncourts of fact.

Later, on 15.09.2008, the PW 1 and PW 4 who had\n\n     gone to meet the police officials at the Rohini Court\n\n     complex, identified all the accused persons, who were\n\n     produced before the Metropolitan Magistrate in connection\n\n     with the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">     66.

The PW 11 SI Kishan Lal who at the relevant time was\n\nposted as Sub-Inspector in the Adarsh Nagar Police Station\n\nin his examination in chief as stated thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">      “On 15.9.2008 I alongwith SHO Ram Chander came\n      to the court and there we met PWs Sushil and\n      Pradeep and they had identified all the four accused\n      who were produced in the court for taking the judicial\n      custody. PWs pointed out towards the accused\n      Pawan and Sharwan that they had surrounded\n      Sushil and Pappu and they pointed out towards\n      accused Mukesh and Vijay and told that Mukesh had\n      taken out the money from the pocket of Sushil and\n      Vijay had taken out money from Pappu and they had\n      attacked on them with ice picks on 16.8.2008. IO\n      recorded their statements.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">68.     Thus, from the oral evidence of the PW 1 and       the\n\nPW 11, it is evident that the PW 1 (injured eye witness) had\n\nthe opportunity to see the accused persons when they were\n\npresent at the Rohini Court Complex. When the PW 11 says\n\nthat the witnesses were able to identify all the four accused\n\nat the time when they were produced in the court for taking\n\nthem into judicial custody, the same should be understood\n\nas conveying that as an investigating officer, he took a\n\nchance to get the accused persons identified through the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                              60</span>\n\fwitnesses. Indisputably, it was not a regular identification\n\nin accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">69.   The    appellant    convict   argues    that   the   only\n\nsubstantive evidence against him is in the form of his\n\nidentification by the PW 1 before the Trial Court. He says\n\nthat there is no question of drawing any adverse inference\n\nagainst him for refusing to participate in the TIP because\n\nfrom day one, he had been saying that the witnesses had\n\nseen the accused persons. He further says that the PW 1\n\nwas in a position to identify him for the first time before the\n\nTrial Court only because he had the opportunity to see him\n\non 15.09.2008. In such circumstances, it is argued on\n\nbehalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence\n\nworth the name to hold him guilty for the alleged crime. On\n\nthe other hand, the State says that although the witnesses\n\nhad a chance to see the accused persons on 15.09.2008\n\nwhen they were present at the Rohini Court Complex, but\n\nthat, by itself, is not a sufficient or a good ground to discard\n\nthe substantive evidence of identification before the Trial\n\nCourt. The State wants us to draw adverse inference against\n\nthe appellant convict as he had refused to participate in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                              61</span>\n\fTIP and at the same time also wants us to accept the\n\nidentification of the appellant by the PW 1 before the Trial\n\nCourt.   The State further says that the PW 1 being an\n\ninjured eye witness had an opportunity of having more than\n\na fair glimpse of the four accused persons including the\n\nappellant convict and, therefore, irrespective of the fact that\n\nthe PW 1 had an opportunity to see the appellant convict\n\non    15.09.2008   at   the   Rohini   Court   Complex,    the\n\nidentification before the Trial Court should be accepted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1484068\" id=\"span_108\">70.    The evidence of PW 1 Sushil Kumar regarding the\n\noccurrence that took place on 16.08.2008 early in the\n\nmorning at 3.30 is fully supported by the medical evidence\n\non record. The PW 1 along with the deceased was\n\nimmediately taken for medical attention. The deceased was\n\nfound to have suffered multiple injuries in the form of\n\npunctured wounds caused by a sharp pointed weapon. The\n\nPW 1 was also found to have suffered two injuries and one\n\nof those was in the form of a punctured wound in the chest\n\ncaused by a sharp pointed weapon. Considering the nature\n\nof injuries suffered by the PW 1 and the deceased and the\n\nfact that the PW 1 and the deceased were cornered by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                              62</span>\n\faccused persons and further that they were robbed of their\n\nmoney, the entire incident could certainly have afforded\n\nsufficient time and opportunity to the PW 1 to recall and\n\nidentify the assailants including the appellant convict\n\nherein. It is a long settled law that if a witness is trustworthy\n\nand reliable, the mere fact that no identification parade\n\ncould be conducted and the appellant convict was identified\n\nfor the first time before the Trial Court, would not be a\n\nreason to discard the evidence of the witness. As held by\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1484068/\" id=\"a_128\">Munna</a> (supra), that in a case\n\nwhere an accused himself refused to participate in the TIP,\n\nit is not open to him to contend that the statement of the\n\neye witnesses made for the first time in Court, wherein they\n\nspecifically point towards him as a person who had taken\n\npart in the commission of the crime, should not be relied\n\nupon. Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is\n\nitself responsible for not holding a TIP. However, in a case\n\nwhere the accused himself declines to participate in a TIP,\n\nthe prosecution has no option but to proceed in a normal\n\nmanner like all other cases and rely upon the testimony of\n\nthe witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                              63</span>\n\fof the trial of the case. It will be too much for us to say that\n\nthe PW 1 was able to identify the accused convict for the\n\nfirst time before the Trial Court only because the PW 1 had\n\nan opportunity to have a look at him on 15.09.2008 at the\n\nRohini Court Complex. As observed above, the PW 1 could\n\nbe said to have had more than a fair glimpse of the\n\nassailants at the time of the incident and on the strength of\n\nthe same, the PW 1 identified the appellant convict as one\n\nof the assailants.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">71.   We deem it appropriate to refer to the factors which\n\nare to be considered for in-Court identification and were\n\nrelied by the American Supreme Court in John R.\n\nMANSON, Commissioner of Correction of Connecticut v.\n\nNowell A. BRATHWAITE reported in 432 U.<a href=\"/doc/1300329/\" id=\"a_129\">S. 98 (1977)</a>,\n\nwhere while referring to its earlier decision in William S.\n\nNEIL, Warden v. Archie Nathaniel BIGGERS, reported in\n\n409 U.S. 188 (1972), it held that reliability is the linchpin\n\nin determining the admissibility of identification testimony\n\nand the factors to be considered are: the opportunity of the\n\nwitness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; the\n\nwitness’ degree of attention; the accuracy of his prior\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                              64</span>\n\fdescription     of   the   criminal;   the   level   of   certainty\n\ndemonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between\n\nthe crime and the confrontation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">72.     In the aforesaid context, we should also look at the\n\nline of reasoning assigned by the High Court. In para 37 of\n\nthe impugned judgment, the High Court took into\n\nconsideration the site plan Ex. PW-8/A. The site plan was\n\nlooked into to ascertain whether there was sufficient light\n\nat the place of the occurrence or not. In this regard, the\n\nHigh Court held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      “37. One of the contentions raised by counsel for the\n      appellant Vijay was that there were no sufficient\n      lights at the place of incident and this is apparent\n      from the fact that in the site plan proved on record as\n      Ex. PW8/A, existence of any such lights have not\n      been shown. Contention of learned counsel for the\n      appellant was that in the absence of any light being\n      there PW-1 could not have seen any of the assailants,\n      and later recognised them as being the actual\n      perpetrators of the crime. This contention raised by\n      counsel for the appellant Vijay Kumar is devoid of\n      any merit as PW-1 in his testimony categorically\n      stated that there was sufficient street light with\n      yellow colour lamps being lit around to see the faces\n      of the assailants. PW-1 also deposed that the\n      accused persons had not covered their faces at the\n      time of occurrence. In his cross-examination he\n      denied the suggestion that it was pitch dark at the\n      spot of occurrence or that he could not have seen any\n      of the assailants. With such clear stand taken by PW-\n      1 that there was sufficient street light to see the faces\n      of the assailants, we find no merit in the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                65</span>\n\f      contention raised by counsel for the appellant Vijay.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">      Even otherwise in the scaled site plan proved on\n      record as Exhibit PW-8/A at point C, D and E the\n      position of lights as were existing at the site have\n      been duly shown.”              [Emphasis supplied]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">73.     In para 41 of the impugned judgment, the High Court\n\nhas discussed about the identity of the accused persons.\n\nPara 41 reads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      “41. Learned counsel for the appellant laid much\n      emphasis on the contention that the prosecution has\n      utterly failed to prove the involvement of these\n      appellants in the commission of the said crime\n      through any cogent and clinching evidence. As per the\n      counsel for appellant, PW-1 failed to give description\n      of these assailants to the police in his first statement\n      and he could recognise the assailants only at the time\n      of his deposition in court after these assailants were\n      shown to him by the police. Counsel also justified the\n      refusal of the appellants to participate in the Test\n      Identification Parade conducted on 02.09.08 because\n      of they being already shown to PW-1 by the police.\n      This contention raised by counsel for the appellant\n      lacks any merit. There can be no dispute that one of\n      the important task of the investigation is to\n      apprehend the real and actual culprit of the crime.\n      The Investigation which is carried out by the\n      Investigating Officer and his team should be\n      judicious, fair, independent, transparent, totally\n      uninfluenced by any extraneous factors. There\n      should not be undue and undesirable delay in the\n      investigation of any crime as any slackness in the\n      investigation can always prove fatal. The entire\n      pursuit of any criminal trial is to see that no innocent\n      man is punished and no guilty man goes scot free.\n      PW-1, in his very first statement categorically stated\n      that he can recognise all the four assailants if brought\n      before him. While giving his statement in court, he\n      could easily identify all these four assailants who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                               66</span>\n\f      were present in the court. He specifically pointed out\n      to the two accused persons who had snatched money\n      from his pocket and the other two who were armed\n      with ice pricks and started attacking him and the\n      deceased Pappu. In his cross-examination, he also\n      stated that the person who stabbed him was dark in\n      complexion and had a cut mark on his face. It would\n      be therefore seen that right from the first statement,\n      the stand of PW-1 had been that he can identify the\n      assailants and in fact he had identified them when\n      they were also present at the time of his deposition in\n      court. The refusal of these assailants to participate in\n      the test identification parade proceedings thus goes\n      against them. The trial court is correct in taking a\n      view that the onus shifted on the accused persons to\n      prove on record that their photographs were shown to\n      PW-1 prior to the holding of the said test identification\n      parade. PW-1 is quite candid in stating in his court\n      deposition that he had seen these assailants on 15th\n      September 2008 when they were produced in a court\n      at Rohini Courts Complex. In this background, it is\n      difficult to accept the argument of counsel for the\n      appellant that the prosecution had failed to establish\n      the identity of these assailants who committed the\n      said crime.”                      [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">74.     In para 42, the High Court elaborated further the\n\nissue of identification. Para 42 reads thus:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">      “42. Learned counsel for the appellant – Mukesh was\n      quite emphatic in his contention that PW-1 in his cross\n      examination admitted the fact that he had clearly\n      seen the face of one assailant, who stabbed him and\n      this deposition of PW-1 clearly meant that he was\n      stabbed by the assailant to whom he described as\n      person with dark complexion having a cut mark on\n      his face and therefore, Mukesh had no role in the\n      commission of the said crime. The court has to take\n      an overall view of the entire testimony of a witness,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                67</span>\n\f      which includes his examination in chief as well as his\n      cross examination. PW-1 while giving his evidence in\n      examination in chief, had clearly identified all the four\n      accused persons being the assailants who were\n      involved in the said incident and in cross examination\n      he merely said that he had clearly seen the face of\n      only one assailant who stabbed him. The said\n      statement of PW-1 in his cross examination can lead\n      to only one inference that so far as the face of one\n      assailant was concerned, he could see him with more\n      clarity, but that would not mean that he did not see\n      the faces of the other assailants or he was not in a\n      position to identify the other assailants, may be with\n      the help of their other descriptions including their\n      height, gait and manner of walking, etc. We also\n      cannot subscribe to the said contention raised by\n      counsel for these appellants as we find no reason for\n      PW-1 to implicate these persons to save the actual\n      culprits of the said crime. We thus find no force in the\n      above contention raised by counsel for the appellant.”\n                                       [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">75.     Although the appellant convict in his further\n\nstatement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 313</a> CrPC stated that he\n\nhad refused to participate in the TIP as the eye witnesses\n\nhad already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, no other\n\nfoundation has been laid for offering such an explanation.\n\nIt is true that the explanation that the accused may offer\n\nwhen the Court confronts him with the incriminating\n\nmaterials in his further statement has to be tested on\n\npreponderance of probability and not on proof beyond\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                68</span>\n\freasonable doubt. However, even while testing the answer\n\non preponderance of probability some foundation has to be\n\nlaid for such explanation to be accepted.        A mere bald\n\nassertion is not sufficient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">76.     The matter does not rest over here. There is\n\nsomething more against the appellant convict. It appears\n\nthat the appellant was arrested on 20.08.2008. At the time\n\nof his arrest, he is said to have made a disclosure statement\n\nrecorded in Ex. PW10/A. The statement was one relating\n\nto the weapon of offence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately\n\ndiscovered from his house. The proceedings recorded in\n\nregard to the actual discovery of the ice pick is in the form\n\nof Ex. PW10/V. The statement is said to have been made by\n\nthe appellant convict before the PW 10 SI Arvind Pratap\n\nSingh which led to the discovery of the fact i.e. the discovery\n\nof the ice pick. The PW 10 in his examination in chief has\n\ndeposed as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">      “On 20-8-2008 in the evening I along with Inspt. Ram\n      Chander and Ct.

Even if we have to discard the evidence of discovery\n\non the ground that no independent witnesses were present\n\nat the time of discovery, still the fact that the appellant\n\nherein led the police party to his house and handed over the\n\nice pick used at the time of the assault, would be reflective\n\nof his conduct. By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act,\n\nthe conduct of an accused is relevant, if such conduct\n\ninfluences or influenced by any fact in issue or relevant fact.\n\nThe evidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the\n\naccused pointed out to the police officer, the place where he\n\nhad concealed the weapon of offence i.e. ice pick, would be\n\nadmissible as conduct under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 8</a> irrespective of the\n\nfact whether the statement made by the appellant convict\n\ncontemporaneously with or antecedent to such conduct\n\nfalls within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act or\n\nnot. Even if we hold that the discovery statement made by\n\nthe appellant convict referred to above is not admissible\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                             71</span>\n\funder <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, still it is relevant\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">79.   In the overall view of the matter, we have reached to\n\nthe conclusion that it is difficult for us to say that the\n\nprosecution has not been able to establish its case against\n\nthe appellant convict beyond a reasonable doubt. We are\n\nconvinced with the line of reasoning adopted by the Trial\n\nCourt as well as by the High Court in holding the appellant\n\nconvict guilty of the alleged crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">80.   In the result, this appeal fails and is hereby\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">81.   In the course of the hearing of this appeal, it was\n\nbrought to the notice of this Court that the appellant hails\n\nfrom a very poor family and is undergoing sentence past\n\nmore than sixteen years. In other words, he has been in jail\n\nfor the past sixteen years. We grant liberty to the appellant\n\nherein to file a representation addressed to the competent\n\nauthority of the State (NCT of Delhi) for premature release.\n\nIf any such representation is preferred by the appellant\n\nherein, then the competent authority shall at the earliest\n\nprocess the same and take an appropriate decision in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                             72</span>\n\faccordance with law, more particularly in accordance with\n\nthe policy prevailing at the time of commission of the offence\n\nas regards remission within a period of two months from\n\nthe date of receipt of such representation and further\n\ncommunicate the same to the appellant in writing without\n\nfail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">                                  ………………………………..J.\n                                  ( M.M.
