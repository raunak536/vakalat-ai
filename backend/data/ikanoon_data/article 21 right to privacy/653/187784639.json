The Respondent reiterated the\nsubmissions of the CPIO / FAA and stated that due to the sensitivities of the matter, the\ninformation could not be disclosed.

It was noted by the Commission that the FAA did not follow the\nprocedure laid down under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 and merely sought shelter under\n<a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 8 (1) (d)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">RTI Act, 2005</a> without giving a reasoned response in view of the\nearlier decision pronounced by the Commission dated 20.04.2017 in the instant matter.

It is the\n        Political Parties that form the Government, man the Parliament and run the governance of the\n        country. It is therefore, necessary to introduce internal democracy, financial transparency and\n        accountability in the working of the Political Parties. A political party which does not respect\n        democratic principles in its internal working cannot be expected to respect those principles in the\n        governance of the country. It cannot be dictatorship internally and democratic in its functioning\n        outside.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">The Commission in its previous decision had also observed that much before the legislative\nenactment of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act, 2005</a>, our Judiciary, in a progressive interpretation of the\nConstitutional provisions, had paved the way towards delineating the Right to Information. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_3\">In\n1975, in <a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_14\">State of UP vs. Raj Narain</a> (1975 AIR 865, 1975 SCR (3) 333), Justice Mathew had\nruled:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        &quot;In a government of responsibility like ours, where all the agents of the public must be\n        responsible for their conduct, there can be but few secrets.

When\n       there is a competition between the right to privacy of an individual and the right to\n       information of the citizens, the former right has to be subordinated to the latter right as it\n       serves larger public interest. The right to know about the candidate who intends to\n       become a public figure and a representative of the people would not be effective and real\n       if only truncated information of the assets and liabilities is given&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Furthermore, Justice M.B.

This Court\n       only considered--to what extent a citizen would have right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21.</a>\n       The court itself has carved out the exceptions and restrictions on absolute right of\n       privacy. Further, by declaration of a fact, which is a matter of public record that a\n       candidate was involved in various criminal cases, there is no question of infringement of\n       any right of privacy. Similarly, with regard to the declaration of assets also, a person\n       having assets or income is normally required to disclose the same under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_19\">Income Tax\n       Act</a> or such similar fiscal legislation. Not only this, but once a person becomes a\n       candidate to acquire public office, such declaration would not affect his right of privacy.\n       This is the necessity of the day because of statutory provisions of controlling wide spread\n       corrupt practices as repeatedly pointed out by all concerned including various reports of\n       Law Commission and other Committees as stated above.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">Furthermore, the Commission in the decision in CIC/AT/A/2007/01029, CIC/AT/A/2007/01263,\nCIC/AT/A/2007/01264, CIC/AT/A/2007/01265, CIC/AT/A/2007/01266, CIC/AT/A/2007/01267,\nCIC/AT/A/2007/01268, CIC/AT/A/2007/01269, CIC/AT/A/2007/01270 dated 29.04.2008 had held as\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;38. The laws of the land do not make it mandatory for political parties to disclose the\n       sources of their funding, and even less so the manner of expending Page 17 of 24 those\n       funds. In the absence of such laws, the only way a citizen can gain access to the details of\n       funding of political parties is through their Income Tax Returns filed annually with\n       Income Tax authorities. This is about the closest the political parties get to accounting\n       for the sources and the extent of their funding and their expenditure. There is\n       unmistakable public interest in knowing these funding details which would enable the\n       citizen to make an informed choice about the political parties to vote for. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_20\">The RTI Act</a>\n       emphasizes that &quot;democracy requires an informed citizenry&quot;, and that transparency of\n       information is vital to flawless functioning of constitutional democracy. It is nobody&#x27;s\n       case that, while all organs of the State must exhibit maximum transparency, no such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                         Page 4 of 11</span>\n        obligation attaches to political parties. Given that political parties influence the exercise\n       of political power; transparency in their organization, functions and, more\n       particularly, their means of funding is a democratic imperative, and, therefore, is in\n       public interest.

Rakesh Kumar\nGupta</a> in W.P.(C) 85/2010 &amp; CM Nos.156/2010 &amp; 5560/2011 dated 24.11.2014 while observing\nthat the act of filing returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity held that\ninformation contained in the income tax returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The relevant extract of the decision is mentioned below:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       &quot;25. Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to the information\n       pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information\n       contained in the income tax returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n       8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr Trehan also\n       by concluding that income tax returns and information provided for assessment was in\n       relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The\n       act of filing returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity. The\n       expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public nature and not necessarily\n       act done in compliance of a statute. The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would denote\n       activity done for the public and/or in some manner available for participation by public or\n       some section of public. There is no public activity involved in filing a return or an\n       individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax authorities. In this view, the\n       information relating to individual assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held\n       that the same was justified &quot;in the larger public interest&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">However, the aforesaid observations were made in reference to individual assesses and not\nbodies/ organizations/ institutions incorporated entities such as listed or private limited\ncompanies and other legal entities such as societies. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in the\nmatter of Naresh Trehan had clarified on this issue in the following paragraphs:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       &quot;20. It has been contended by the petitioners that the expression &quot;personal information&quot; must\n       also extend to information relating to corporate entities. Inasmuch as they may also fall within\n       the definition of expression &quot;person&quot; under the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_32\">General Clauses Act, 1897</a> as well as under the\n       <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_33\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>. However, I am unable to accept this contention for the reason that the\n       expression &quot;personal information&quot; as used in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act has to be\n       read in the context of information relating to an individual. A plain reading of the aforesaid\n       clause would indicate that the expression &quot;personal information&quot; is linked with &quot;invasion of\n       privacy of the individual&quot;. The use of the word &quot;the&quot; before the word &quot;individual&quot; immediately\n       links the same with the expression &quot;personal information&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                                          Page 6 of 11</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">        21. Black&#x27;s law dictionary, sixth edition, inter alia, defines the word &quot;personal&quot; as under:- &quot;The\n       word &quot;personal&quot; means appertaining to the person; belonging to an individual; limited to the\n       person; having the nature or partaking of the qualities of human beings, or of movable property.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">       23. In my view, the aforesaid reasoning would also be applicable to the expression &quot;personal&quot;\n       used in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The expression &#x27;individual&#x27; must be construed in an\n       expansive sense and would include a body of individuals. The said exemption would be\n       available even to unincorporated entities as also private, closely held undertaking which are in\n       substance alter egos of their shareholders. However, the expression individual cannot be used\n       as a synonym for the expression &#x27;person&#x27;. <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_36\">Under the General Clauses Act, 1897</a> a person is\n       defined to &quot;include any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated\n       or not&quot;. Thus, whereas a person would include an individual as well as incorporated entities\n       and artificial persons, the expression &#x27;individual&#x27; cannot be interpreted to include such\n       entities. The context in which, the expression &quot;personal information&quot; is used would also\n       exclude it application to large widely held corporations. While, confidential information of a\n       corporation is exempt from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 8(1) (d)</a> of the Act, there is no scope to\n       exclude other information relating to such corporations under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act as the\n       concept of a personal information cannot in ordinary language be understood to mean\n       information pertaining to a public corporation.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">       22. A perusal of the above definition also indicates that the ordinary usage of the word\n       &quot;personal&quot; is in the context of an individual human being and not a corporate entity. The U.S.\n       Supreme Court has also interpreted the expression &quot;personal&quot; to be used in the context of an\n       individual human being and not a corporate entity. In the case of Federal Communications\n       Commission v. AT&amp;T Inc: 2011 US LEXIS 1899 the US Supreme Court considered the meaning\n       of the expression &quot;personal privacy&quot; in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_39\">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which\n       required Federal Agencies to make certain records and documents publically available on\n       request. Such disclosure was exempt if the records &quot;could reasonably be expected to constitute\n       an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the expression\n       &quot;Personal&quot; used in the aforesaid context could not be extended to corporations because the word\n       &quot;personal&quot; ordinarily refers to individuals. The Court held that the expression &quot;personal&quot; must\n       be given its ordinary meaning. The relevant extract of the said judgment is as under: &quot;Person&quot; is\n       a defined term in the statute; &quot;personal&quot; is not. When a statute does not define a term, we\n       typically &quot;give the phrase its ordinary meaning,&quot; [Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S., 559 U.S.\n       133, 130 S. Ct. 1265, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1, 8 (2010)]. &quot;Personal&quot; ordinarily refers to individuals. We\n       do not usually speak of personal characteristics, personal effects, personal correspondence,\n       personal influence, or personal tragedy as referring to corporations or other artificial entities.\n       This is not to say that corporations do not have correspondence, influence, or tragedies of their\n       own, only that we do not use the word &quot;personal&quot; to describe them. Certainly, if the chief\n       executive officer of a corporation approached the chief financial officer and said, &quot;I have\n       something personal to tell you,&quot; we would not assume the CEO was about to discuss company\n       business. Responding to a request for information, an individual might say, &quot;that&#x27;s personal.&quot; A\n       company spokesman, when asked for information about the company, would not. In fact, we often\n       use the word &quot;personal&quot; to mean precisely the opposite of businessrelated: We speak of personal\n       expenses and business expenses, personal life and work life, personal opinion and a company&#x27;s\n       view.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">Therefore it is clear from the above observations that the expression &quot;personal information&quot; as\nused in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act has to be read in the context of information relating\nto an individual and that the ordinary usage of the word &quot;personal&quot; is in the context of an individual\nhuman being and not bodies/ organizations/ institutions incorporated entities such as listed or\nprivate limited companies and other legal entities such as societies. Moreover, the Commission\nfelt that the information which is held and available with the Public Authority in its regulatory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                                            Page 7 of 11</span>\n capacity ought to be disclosed to the information seekers. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_15\">In this context, the Commission\nreferred to the following observation from the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\n<a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_41\">Reserve Bank of India v. Jayantilal N. Mistry and Ors.</a>, dated 16.12.2015, wherein interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_42\">section\n2(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_43\">8 (1) (e)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, the following was held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       &quot;62. The exemption contained in <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> applies to exceptional cases and only\n       with regard to certain pieces of information, for which disclosure is unwarranted or\n       undesirable. If information is available with a regulatory agency not in fiduciary\n       relationship, there is no reason to withhold the disclosure of the same. However, where\n       information is required by mandate of law to be provided to an authority, it cannot be\n       said that such information is being provided in a fiduciary relationship. As in the instant\n       case, the Financial institutions have an obligation to provide all the information to the\n       RBI and such an information shared under an obligation/duty cannot be considered to\n       come under the purview of being shared in fiduciary relationship. One of the main\n       characteristic of a Fiduciary relationship is &quot;Trust and Confidence&quot;. Something that RBI\n       and the Banks lack between them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       65. And in this case the RBI and the Banks have sidestepped the General public&#x27;s demand\n       to give the requisite information on the pretext of &quot;Fiduciary relationship&quot; and\n       &quot;Economic Interest&quot;. This attitude of the RBI will only attract more suspicion and\n       disbelief in them. RBI as a regulatory authority should work to make the Banks\n       accountable to their actions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       67. From reading of the above section it can be inferred that the Legislature&#x27;s intent was\n       to make available to the general public such information which had been obtained by the\n       public authorities from the private body. Had it been the case where only information\n       related to public authorities was to be provided, the Legislature would not have included\n       the word &quot;private body&quot;. As in this case, the RBI is liable to provide information\n       regarding inspection report and other documents to the general public.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89279518\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89279518\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89279518\" id=\"span_18\">The Apex Court while dealing with several contempt petitions of its aforementioned order in\nContempt Petition (C) No.928 of 2016 In <a href=\"/doc/89279518/\" id=\"a_45\">Girish Mittal vs. Parvati V.

The expression &quot;public interest&quot; has to be understood in its true connotation so as to\n       give complete meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The expression &quot;public\n       interest&quot; must be viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions so as to justify denial of\n       a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its common parlance, the expression &quot;public\n       interest&quot;, like &quot;public purpose&quot;, is not capable of any precise definition. It does not have\n       a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the statute in which it occurs, the\n       concept varying with time and state of society and its needs (<a href=\"/doc/41868/\" id=\"a_51\">State of Bihar v.
