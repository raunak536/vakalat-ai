The term &#x27;Liberty&#x27; as used in the Constitutional provisions connotes something more than mere freedom from physical restraints or the chains of a prison. Charles Warren &amp; Louis D. Brandeis, while dealing with the concept of right to privacy though that law should provide both a criminal and private law remedy to protect man&#x27;s &#x27;inviolate personality&#x27; against the intrusive behaviour of State. Once a civilization has made a distinction between the &#x27;outer&#x27; and the &#x27;inner&#x27; man, between the life of the soul and the life of the body, between the spiritual and the material, between the sacred and the profane, between the realm of God and the realm of Caesar, between Church and State, between rights inherent and inalienable and rights that are in the power of government to give and take away between public and private, between society and solitude, it becomes impossible to avoid the idea of privacy by whatever name it may be called the idea of a private space in which man may become and remain himself. See Privacy and the law. A philosophical prelude&quot; by Milton R. Konvitz in 31 Law and Contemporary Problems (1966) p. 272, 273.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_1\">2. The Supreme Court of India took notice of what was said by the above authors in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_1\">Govind v. State of M.P.</a>, AIR 1975 SC 1378 : (1975 Cri LJ 1111) and observed that there can be no doubt that the makers of our Constitution wanted to ensure conditions favourable to the pursuits of happiness and realise the signficance of man, spirtual nature of his feelings, and of his intellect and that only a part of the pain, pleasure satisfaction of life can be found in material things and therefore, they must be deemed to have conferred upon the individual as against the government a sphere where he should be left alone. Reference was made again to privacy, freedom and respect for persons by Benn, in a book J. Peennock &amp; J. Chapman, Eds., Privacy, Nomos, XIII, 1,15-16, to the following excerpt:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> The liberal individualist tradition has stressed, in particular, three personal ideals, to each of which corresponds a range of &#x27;private affairs&#x27;. The first is the ideal of personal relations; the second, the Lockian ideal of the politically free man in a minimally regulated society, the third, the Kantian ideal of the morally autonomous man, acting on principles that he accepts as rational.&#x27;\n \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3. Coming to the facts of the case. The petitioner claims to be a businessman and an Income-tax assessee. He was involved in an offence under <a href=\"/doc/844968/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 412</a> of the Indian Penal Code but was acquitted. His grievance is that police is keeping surveillance over him and a history sheet of his is being maintained at police station Sabalgarh. This assertion that history sheet has been opened and this is of Category &#x27;B&#x27; has not been denied by the State. It is stated that even after order of acquittal was passed with regard to the case under <a href=\"/doc/844968/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 412</a> of the Indian Penal Code, the petitioner has not abandoned his Criminal traits and preponsities. The allegation that the petitioner is called to police station Sabalgarh repeatedly has however been denied. The State has ultimately made a prayer that the petition be dismissed.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4. The petitioner submits that action taken by the police is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5. Legal position be now noticed.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">6. In Munn v. Illions (1876) 94 US 113 Field J., while dealing with the concept of Liberty&#x27; observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> By the term liberty as used in the provision some thing more is meant than mere freedom from physical restraint or the bounds of a prison.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Earlier it was mentioned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"> The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body or amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an eye or the destruction of an other organ of the body through which the soul communicates with the outer world.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_2\">The above observations were considered by the Supreme Court in the case reported as <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_6\">Kharak Singh v. State of U. P.</a> 1963 SC 1295 : (1963 (2) Cri LJ 1111). Kharak Singh was challenged in a dacoity case. He was released under <a href=\"/doc/481610/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 169</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. On the basis of the acquisition made against him police opened a history sheet in regard to him. This was done under Chapter XII of LJ. P. Police Regulations. <a href=\"/doc/1446884/\" id=\"a_8\">Regulation 236</a> provided as under:-</span>\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">Without prejudice to the right of Superintendents of Police to put into practice any legal measures, such as shadowing in cities, by which they find they can keep in touch with suspects in particular localities or special circumstances, survelliance may be most practical purposes be defined as consisting of one or more of the following measures :\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(a) Secret picketing of the house or approaches to the house of suspects;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(b) domiciliary visits at night;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(c) through periodical inquiries by officers not below the rank of Sub-Inspector into repute, habits, associations, income, expenses and occupation;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(d) the reporting by constables and chaukidars of movements and absence from home;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(e) the verification of movements and absences by means of inquiry slips.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(f) the collection and record on a history sheet of all information bearing on conduct.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">7. The Supreme Court was of the view :\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">i) secret picketing of the house of a suspect or keeping watch over his movements under police survelliance does not amount to deprivation of personal liberty;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">ii) same would be the position when a suspect is shadowed by the police and watch is kept over his activities;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">However,\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">iii) domiciliary visits to the house of a suspect at night involving the inclusion into the privacy of his home were held to amount to deprivation of his personal liberty as it is likely to disturb him in his sleep etc.\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8. The matter was again considered by the Supreme Court in a case arising from the State of Madhya Pradesh. This is reported as Govind v.&quot; State, AIR 1975 SC 1378 : (1975 Cri LJ 1111) in this case history sheet was opened under paragraph/ Regulation 856 of Police Regulations. These regulations were held to have the force of law. In para 11 of the judgment Regulation 885 and 856 were held to have the force of law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_3\">Great stress was laid oh the concept of dignity to live in privacy; It was observed that this includes right to protect personal intimacies of home, the family, marriage, mother-hood etc. etc. As a matter of fact the right to privacy was sought to be equated with freedom to live ones&#x27; life without governments&#x27; interference. Some of the observations made in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_9\">Govinds</a>&#x27; case (supra) are relevant and be noticed:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims deserve to be examined with care and to be denied only when an important countervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the compelling state interest test. Then the question would be whether a State interest is of such paramount importance as would justify an infringement of the right. Obivously, if the enforcement of morality were held to be a compelling as well as a perrmissible State interest, the characterization of a claimed right as a fundaless significance. The question whether enforcement of morality is a State interest sufficient to justify the infringement of a fundamental privacy right need not he considered for the purpose of this case and therefore we refuse to enter the controversial thicket whether enforcemnent of morality is a function of State.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system of limited government, is protected in part under out Constitution by explicit constitutional guarantees. &quot;In the application of the Constitution our contemplation cannot only be of what has been but wave may be&quot;. Time works changes and brings into existence new conditions. Subtler and far-reaching means of invading privacy will make it possible to be heard in the street what is whispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of privacy raises serious questions about the propeerty of judicial reliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of course, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in autonomy must also be placed in the context of other right and values.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child rearing. This catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as intructive as it does not give analytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">Right and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the Constitution in order to guarantee that the individual, his personality and those things stamped with his personality shall be free from official inteference except where a reasonable basis for intrusion exists. &quot;Liberty against government&quot; a phrase coined by Professor Corwin expresses this idea forcefully. In this sense, many of the fundamental rights of citizens can be described as contributing to the right to privacy.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">There are two possible theories for protecting privacy of home. The first is mat activities in the home harm others only to the extent that they cause offence resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be engaging in such activities and that such &#x27;harm&#x27; is not constitutionally protectible by the State. The second is that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can be free from societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary is that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from projecting on the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves. An image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than the realities of their natures; see 26 Stanford Law Rev. 1161 at 1187.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">The Court however ultimately concluded :-\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">The right to privacy in any even, will necessarily have to go through a process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the right is absolute.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Having reached this conclusion, we are satisfied that drastic inroads directly into the privacy and indirectly into the fundamental rights, of a citizen will be made if Regulations 855 and 856 were to be read widely. To interpret the rule in harmony with the Constitution is therefore necessary and canalisation of the powers vested in the policy by the two Regulations earlier read becomes necessary, if they are to be saved at all. Our founding fathers were thoroughly opposed to a Police Raj even as our history of the struggle for freedom has borne eloquent testimony to it. The relevant Articles of the Constitution we have adverted to earlier behove us therefore the narrow down the scope for play of the two Regulations. We proceed to give direction and restriction to the application of the said regulations with the caveat that if any action were taken beyond the boundaries so set. The citizen will be entitled to attach such action as unconstitutional and void.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">Depending on the character and antecedents of the person subjected to surveillance as also the objects and the limitation under which surveillance is made, it cannot be said surveillance by domiciliary visits would always be unreasonable restriction upon the right of privacy. Assuming that the fundamental rights explicitly guaranteed to a citizen have penumbral zones and that the right to privacy is itself a fundamental right, that fundamental right must be subject to restriction on the basis of compelling public interest. As <a href=\"/doc/1760174/\" id=\"a_10\">Regulation 356</a> has the force of law, it cannot be said that the fundamental right of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> has been violated by the provisions contained in it; for, what is guaranteed under that article is that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by the procedure established by &#x27;law&#x27;. We think that the procedure is reasonble having regard to the provisions of Regulation 853(c) and 857. Even if we hold that <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> guarantees to a citizen a right to privacy in his movement as an emanation from that Article and is itself a fundamental right, the question will arise whether Regulation 856 is a law imposing reasonable restriction in public interest on the freedom of movement falling within <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19(5);</a> or, even if it be assumed that <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 19(5)</a> does not apply in terms, as the right to privacy of movement cannot be absolute. A law imposing reasonable restriction upon it for compelling interest of State must be upheld as valid.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">When there are two interpretations, one wide and unconstitutional, the other narrower but within constitutional bounds. This Court will read down the overflowing expressions to make them valid. So read, the two regulations are more restricted than counsel for the petitioner sought to impress upon us. <a href=\"/doc/1258665/\" id=\"a_15\">Regulation 355</a> in our view, empowers surveillance only of persons against whom reasonable materials exist to induce the opinion that they show &#x27;a determination, to lead a life of crime&#x27; - crime in this context being confined to such as involve public peace or security only and if they are dangerous security risks. Mere convictions in criminal cases where nothing gravely imperils safety of society can be regarded as warranting surveillance under this Regulation. Similarly domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should be reduced to the clearest cases of danger to community security and not routine follow up at the end or at the whim of a police officer. In truth, legality apart, these regulations illaccord with the essence of personal freedoms and the State will do well to revise these old police regulations verging perilously near unconstitutionality.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9. It be again seen that Rule of Audi Alterum Partem is not attracted to such a case. Thus in Malak Singh etc. v. State of Pun jab and Haryana, AIR 1981 SC 760 : (1981 Cri LJ 320) it was observed that an entry in the surveillance registrar of a habitual offencers made on the basis of history sheet is confidential. It was held observance of the principles of natural justice, apart from not serving the ends of justice may lead to undesirable results of the source of information being disclosed. The rule audi alteratn partem&#x27; was held to be not attracted in such cases.One safeguard was indicated. It was observed that while it may not be necessary to supply the ground of belief that the person to be entered in the surveillance register is a habitual offender etc.to the persons concerned, it may in some cases- be necessary to satisfy the court that there are grounds to entertain such reasonable belief and that there is no illegal interference in the life of a citizen under the guise of surveillance.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10. From the above mentioned decisions it becomes apparent that in these matters:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(i) principles of natural justice are not attracted;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(ii) regulations permitting surveillance do interfere with the personal freedom and should be recorded to only where public peace or security is involved;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(iii) mere convictions in criminal case where nothing gravely imperils safety of society cannot be regarded as warranting surveillance under these regulations.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">Some of the ideals dealing with human rights would remain ideals only because the State in its endeavour to protect the fabric of social life has to resort to imposing of some restrictions and if these restriction&#x27;s are reasonable then no grievance can be made. The Europeon Convention of Human Rights makes a brave attempt to being out this problem. <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 8</a> of the Convention which came into force on 3rd September, 1953 and as noticed in &#x27;Privacy and Human Rights&#x27; Ed - A.H. Robotson. 176 be noticed :-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">1. Every one has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a &#x27;democratic society in the interests of national security public safety or the economic well-being of the country for the prevention of dis-order of crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">11. In the present case a suggestion appears to have been made by the concerned police ineharge to open up a surveillance sheet. This was submitted to the Deputy Superintendent of Police. He made a one line observation &#x27;submitted to S P. for perusal and necessary action&#x27;. The Superintendent of Police appear to have put his signatures under these remarks. This happened on 2nd August, 1973. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_4\">Twenty two years have lapsed. Even though the stand taken in the return is that petitioner is not being called to the police station and that history sheet was opened because the petitioner was still possessing criminal traits yet this aspect of the matter is not apparent from annexure R-l. The police authorities should have been more explicit and should have given reasons or some concrete instances. The fact that the petitioner has been acquitted should be now given due consideration. Annexure R-l would accordingly be not given effect to and the police authorities would reconsider the matter and act within the guidelines indicated by the Supreme Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_17\">Kharak Singh and Govind</a> (supra). The facl that the action of the police would have the effect of making a drastic inroad into the privacy of the petitioner cannot be ignored.</span> As indicated by the Supreme Court the mere convictions without there being any evidence that the persons concerned has not abandoned criminal pursuits which arc likely to imperil social relations or cause threst to public order is requiied to be taken note of.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">12. This petition is disposed of accordingly.\n</p>\n \n\n","numcites":12,"numcitedby":7,"docsource":"Madhya Pradesh High Court","citetid":1911212,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"Right to privacy is fundamental right","formInput":"Right%20to%20privacy%20is%20fundamental%20right"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"kharak singh","formInput":"kharak%20singh"},{"value":"police regulations","formInput":"police%20regulations"},{"value":"unconstitutional","formInput":"unconstitutional"},{"value":"picketing","formInput":"picketing"},{"value":"moral ","formInput":"moral%20"},{"value":"\" human rights\"","formInput":"%22%20human%20rights%22"},{"value":"history","formInput":"history"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"dishonestly-receiving-property-stolen-in-dacoity","formInput":"tag:dishonestly-receiving-property-stolen-in-dacoity"},{"value":"freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions","formInput":"tag:freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions"},{"value":"criminal-force-to-attempt-theft","formInput":"tag:criminal-force-to-attempt-theft"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
