Prayer has also been made to restrain the State Government or the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies from interfering in the working of the Rajathan Cricket Association and also from enforcing the provisions of the Act of 2005.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">\tAt the outset, it may be mentioned that in the instant writ petition the original petitioners-Rajasthan Cricket Association (for short, &#x27;the RCA&#x27;) &amp; Others had challenged the constitutional validity of the Rajasthan Sports Association (Registration, Recognition and Regulation) Ordinance, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the said Ordinance of 2004&#x27;) and sought directions for restraining the State Government or the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies for the State from interfering in the working of the petitioner-RCA and from enforcing the provisions of the said Ordinance of 2004. The Division Bench of this Court, after hearing the learned counsel for the parties, had dismissed the petition vide the order dated 20.12.2004. The said order came to be challenged by Shri Kishore Rungta, the then Secretary of the RCA by filing civil appeal being No.1206/2005 before the Supreme Court. During the pendency of the said appeal before the Supreme Court, the said Ordinance of 2004 came to be replaced by the  <a href=\"/doc/31868921/\" id=\"a_2\">Rajasthan Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005</a> (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the said Act of 2005&#x27;), which received the assent of His Excellency the Governor of Rajasthan on 13.3.2005 and was published in the Official Gazette on 14.3.2005. In the meantime, the management and control of the RCA was also changed. The Apex Court, thereafter, disposed of the said civil appeal vide the order dated 20.1.2011. The Apex Court interalia passed the following order:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">xxx we are constrained to set aside the impugned judgment passed by the Division Bench of the High Court and remand the matter to the High Court for giving specific findings on the issues raised or may be canvassed by the learned counsel for the parties before the High Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\tDuring the pendency of this appeal, number of interlocutory Applications have been filed. For ensuring the expeditious disposal of the matter, we deem it appropriate to dispose of all those applications as not pressed, except applications for impleadment of Kamal Morarka and Tonk District Cricket Association with liberty to the parties to file any application for any interim relief, if it is so advised.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\tThis appeal has been pending over five years. Apart from that, the issues raised in this appeal have far reaching implications. Therefore, we request the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of the High Court to ensure that this appeal is disposed of at an early date, in any event, within six months from the date of communication of this order. Applications for impleadment of Kamal Morarka and Tonk District Cricket Association are allowed and these applicants are impleaded as respondent nos.6 and 7 respectively. We request the High Court to hear the appellant-Kishore Rungta and respondent nos.1 to 7 herein and pass appropriate orders, in accordance with law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\tAll questions of law raised are kept open.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\tThe Civil Appeal is disposed of accordingly, leaving the parties to bear their respective costs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\tIn view of the said order passed by the Apex Court, the said appellant before the Apex Court Shri Kishore Rungta was permitted to pursue the present petition as the petitioner; and Shri Kamal Morarka and Tonk District Cricket Association were permitted to be impleaded as respondents No.6 and 7 respectively. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\tAt this juncture, it is pertinent to note that since the Ordinance of 2004 was already replaced with certain modifications, by the Act of 2005, during the pendency of the proceedings before the Apex Court, an oral request was made by the learned Senior Counsel Mr.Paras Kuhad for the petitioner to treat the challenge in the petition as the challenge of the validity of the Act of 2005, in place of the Ordinance of 2004. The said prayer was accepted by the Court. Accordingly, the submissions were made by the respective learned counsels for the parties with regard to the validity of the Act of 2005, without being technical in the matter.\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\tIt is also pertinent to note that the State Government, in exercise of powers conferred by <a href=\"/doc/38075504/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 31</a> of the said Ordinance of 2004 had made the Rules namely, Rajasthan Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Rules, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules of 2004). Reliance was placed on the said Rules during the course of arguments by the learned counsels for the parties, however, it appears that the said Rules of 2004 were framed under the Ordinance of 2004, which have already been replaced by the Act of 2005.  Since consequences fell at the time when Ordinance of 2004 as well as Rules framed thereunder were in force, presently we have considered the issues involved accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">I- Case of the Petitioner:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\tIt is the case of the petitioner that the RCA was constituted as an Association by a group of individuals in the year 1933 with the object of promoting the game of cricket in Rajasthan. RCA is affiliated to and is full member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (for short the BCCI). RCA had  33 district cricket clubs as its members  and in addition to that, RCA had 63 other individual members falling under different categories inducted in the period of last 70 years.  The function of the RCA was governed by its own Memorandum and Rules and Regulations. The Rules specified the objects, categories of members, eligibility for membership, control over the rights to induct members including District Association as members, the powers of management committee, the mode of election thereto, the voting and contesting rights of the members, dispute resolution etc. The governance and functioning of RCA was to be decided by its members alone as per its constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t\tIt    is    further    case    of    the   petitioner    that  vide   Notification   dated  18th August, 2004,  the   Governor   of Rajasthan    promulgated    the   Ordinance  of  2004,  later  on, substituted  by  the  Act  of  2005.   Aggrieved  by  the promulgation  of  Ordinance  of  2004, which  has  been substituted    by    the  Act    of    2005,  the   writ  petition   has    been   pursued   contending   inter-alia    that   the   provisions   of    the   Act  of   2005   are   violative   of   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles  14</a>   and  <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_5\">19(1)(c)</a>   of   the   Constitution;

the Ordinance of  2004  could not have been promulgated and enacted as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           no immediate circumstances existed for such promulgation of ordinance; the RCA has fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19 (1)(c)</a> to form association to manage its business and to continue as Association  fulfilling its objects with persons of its choice; restrictions imposed by the Act of 2005 are arbitrary, unreasonable and illegal; Registrar has been given uncanalized, unguided and uncontrolled power to refuse registration under <a href=\"/doc/174468258/\" id=\"a_23\">section 6</a>, to call for records under <a href=\"/doc/164734547/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 20</a>, to make disaffiliation under <a href=\"/doc/137515601/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 21</a>, to make enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/168378949/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 23</a>, and  to make disqualification under <a href=\"/doc/14500826/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 24</a>;  the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/46772497/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8</a> are also ultra vires the Constitution as it imposes unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioner and seeks to dictate the discretion of the Association in framing its bye laws; there may be some games which due to lack of infrastructure or involvement of heavy expenditure, are not capable of being provided to every section of society; <a href=\"/doc/74831933/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 9</a>, <a href=\"/doc/66322231/\" id=\"a_30\">10</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/197016950/\" id=\"a_31\">12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/102399111/\" id=\"a_32\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/2478830/\" id=\"a_33\">14</a>, <a href=\"/doc/164734547/\" id=\"a_34\">20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/137515601/\" id=\"a_35\">21</a>, <a href=\"/doc/127667048/\" id=\"a_36\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/168378949/\" id=\"a_37\">23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/86671479/\" id=\"a_38\">25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/155202031/\" id=\"a_39\">26</a> of the Act of 2005  have also been questioned on the ground that the provisions are harsh and unenforceable; the Act of 2005 has made serious inroads on the rights vested to establish Association of choice and to administer them; the Act is colourable exercise of power by the State Government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">II- Stand of the State of Rajasthan:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\tIn the return filed on behalf of the State of Rajasthan, it is contended that  the petitioner had challenged the validity of the Ordinance of 2004 and not the Act of 2005, which was promulgated, thus, the petitioner did not come to this Court with clean hands;

the Act of 2005 aimed at advancing, encouraging and promoting sports and games activities in the State of Rajasthan at State, District and lower level;  the Act of 2005 intends to make Association to operate in a representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports; there is no discrimination; no restriction has been imposed to form association; provisions of the Act of 2005 cannot be said to be illegal or arbitrary in any manner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\tRespondent no.7 has also filed reply in which it is contended that the petition is not maintainable;  original ordinance has changed its character; there is legislative competence of the State to enact the Act of 2005; right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution does not carry with it a concomitant  right that unions formed shall achieve their object such that any interference to any such law would be unconstitutional unless it could be justified by <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 19(4);</a> there is no take over of property of any association by the State;

Vishal Sharma\tappearing on behalf of the petitioner has submitted that there is violation of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution of India; Act of 2005 takes away the fundamental right  guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> it puts restrictions on the exercise of right conferred under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> State could have acted within the parameter of <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 19(4)</a> and none of the grounds envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 19(4)</a> is available; law enacted by the State is saved by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_49\">Article  19(4)</a> and considering the ambit and sweep of fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_50\">Article  19(1)(c)</a>, right to carry on objectives is part and parcel to right to form association, which has been taken away by the Act of 2005; Act of  2005 constitutes restrictions on exercise of right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> and these restrictions could not have been imposed within <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19(4)</a> and could not be said to be reasonable restrictions. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\tIt was further submitted on behalf of the petitioner that as per <a href=\"/doc/104639124/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 3</a> of the Act of  2005, every Sports Association other than a Primary Sports Body is required to be registered under the provisions of the  Act of 2005. <a href=\"/doc/131415174/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5</a> provides  that all State Level Associations enlisted in Schedule B and their affiliated District Level Sports Associations shall apply for registration of the Association under the Act of 2005 with the  documents specified in Schedule A.  Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/163511816/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 25(2)</a> of the Act of 2005 provides that no sports association shall be entitled to use the description &#x27;Rajasthan&#x27; or use the name of a District as part of its name or undertake any Sports activity which results in representing the State of Rajasthan or a District, as an affiliated unit of any National Federation, Board or Association purporting to represent India, or in any other manner whatsoever, unless such Sports Association is registered as a State Level Sports&#x27; Association or a District Level Sports Association under the Act of 2005. <a href=\"/doc/27657508/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 26(1)</a> provides that an Association undertaking games or sports activities at State or District level and is already registered under the Act of 1958 shall be entitled to opt to be registered and recognized under the Act of 2005 and to receive a certificate thereof on application to the Registrar and within 30 days from the date of commencement of the Act of 2005 shall amend its bye-laws to bring it in conformity with the Act of 2005 &amp; sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/155202031/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 26</a> further provides that  if no such application is made within thirty days of the commencement of the Act of 2005 or if the bye-laws of the Sports Association covered under sub-section (1) are not brought in conformity with the provisions of the Act of 2005 at the expiry of thirty days from the commencement of the Act, the Executive Body of the Sports Association shall be superseded by the Registrar and an Ad hoc Executive Committee shall be appointed to manage the affairs of the Sports Association. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\tIt is further submitted on behalf of the petitioner that there is obligation under the Act of 2005 read with Rule 3(3) of the Rules of 2004 framed under the Ordinance of 2004 substituted by the Act of 2005, which provides that Sports Associations and District Associations can be named only in the manner set out in Rule 3(1) and 3(2); all  Sports Associations operating at the level of State or District have to  necessarily use as part of the name, the description &#x27;Rajasthan&#x27; or that of the concerned District and by virtue of  Rule 3(3) they were prohibited from adopting any name which did not carry the description Rajasthan/concerned District, and <a href=\"/doc/163511816/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 25 (2)</a> in turn states that whichever association uses such name shall have to necessarily register itself under the Act of 2005. Thus, any Sports Association undertaking the sports activities is under obligation to apply for registration dependent upon such activity resulting and representing the State of Rajasthan, compulsory coverage becomes absolute; every Sports Association operating at the level of District of State Headquarters is bound to  organize tournaments between players of different Districts; it is impossible to conceive of an activity of a Sports Association which will not fall within <a href=\"/doc/163511816/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 25(2)</a> of the Act of 2005; the RCA was mentioned at item no.13 of the Schedule B and thus, it was statutorily obliged  to apply for registration; the petitioner has also challenged <a href=\"/doc/104639124/\" id=\"a_60\">section 3</a> of the Act of 2005 which provides that  Sports Association shall have to be registered under the Act of 2005.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\tIt is further submitted by counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that <a href=\"/doc/56569309/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 26(2)</a> provides for consequences of not applying for registration or amending the bye laws in terms of the Act of 2005 by providing the punitive consequences  of compulsory supersession of the management committee and re-election according to the provisions of the Act of 2005; <a href=\"/doc/74831933/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 9</a> of the Act of 2005 also statutorily limits the right of membership in relation to  State Level Sports Association, District Level Sports Association and the Primary Sports Bodies respectively; it thereby destroyed the associational rights of all the other six categories of members of RCA to remain as members of RCA; RCA being State Level Sports Association was covered by <a href=\"/doc/102788780/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act of 2005  and thus, all individual members stood divested of the right to membership by operation of <a href=\"/doc/102788780/\" id=\"a_64\">section 9(1)</a> of the Act of 2005; even in relation to existing District Level Sports Association, <a href=\"/doc/102788780/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act of 2005 states that only those District Level Sports Association which are registered under the Act of 2005 shall be member of the State level Sports Association; the effect of the Act of 2005 is that it divests all existing members of the right of membership and it allows the State to select the primary bodies that are to become members of the District Bodies and the District Bodies that are to become members of the State bodies;

Sports and participation in sports activities help individual develop character, discipline, confidence, self esteem, positive self-image, sense of well-being and also offers important health benefits. Sports also teach how to work as a part of a team, how to manage success and disappointments, how to respect others and develop social skill and competence. Sports are also emerging as a profession and a sports event has its economics in sports tourism.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\tFor the development of sports in the State of Rajasthan the existing Sports Associations and sports bodies play a significant role. However, the State&#x27;s  performance in the national and international events has not been upto the mark. The sports bodies are either not registered or are registered under the <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_79\">Rajasthan Societies Registration Act, 1958</a> ( Act No.28 of 1958) which does not provide for effective regulatory mechanism. Even though Rajasthan State Sports Council is the premier body of the State, its role is limited. In the absence of detailed date of activities of the associations or bodies, no accountability can be fixed for performance nor could they be effectively encouraged for the growth of sports and games in the State.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\tThe Bill is aimed at advancing, encouraging and promoting sports and games activities in the State, at State, District and lower level. By regulating the State seeks to creating democratic structure, which would encourage development of sports persons, development of athletic fitness and help bring young talent in sports and create model behaviour to meet National and International challenges and standards. It would also create a healthy environment of functioning for the Sports Associations by defining their roles, obligations and relationships with  a degree of precision, thus helping the Sports Associations, nurture, develop and prepare young talent for National and International competitions in their quest for winning laurels and medals for Rajasthan.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\tLarge number of Sports Associations are using the expression Rajasthan and are holding out to be representing Rajasthan, its Districts or a part of Rajasthan without factually acting in representative capacity which is in violation of the Olympic Charter and the National Sports Policy, 2001, which, inter alia, provides for making the functioning of the Federations and Associations transparent, professional and accountable. This has necessitated the regulation of such bodies to ensure that they are operating in a representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels, so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\tThe Bill confers on Sports Associations legal right to represent Rajasthan and meet the aspirations of the public, discourage nepotism, create a deeper and wider network for selection process, develop a scientific procedure for identifying and promoting natural sports persons. The Bill also seeks to amicably resolve disputes arising within and between various Sports Associations relating to affiliation and elections which end up in litigation in courts and divert the attention of Sports persons from achieving excellence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\tSince the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly was not in session and the circumstances existed which rendered it necessary for the Governor of Rajsthan to take immediate action, he, therefore, promulgated the Rajasthan Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Ordinance, 2004 (Ordinance No.6 of 2004) on 18th August, 2003 which was published in Rajasthan Gazette, Part IV (B) Extraordinary, dated 18th August, 2004.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\tSince then it was felt that certain provisions needed modifications.

There were inadequate regulatory laws pertaining to the overall sports activities and therefore, to ensure accountability for the associations which are responsible for representing the State of Rajasthan at the national and international level; to facilitate democratic structure, to foster sports persons, athletic fitness and young talent in sports, the Act of 2005 has been enacted. The associations representing State of Rajasthan in various national level sports bodies lacked transparency and professionalism, and to hold them accountable besides having more democratic method of running associations which represent Rajasthan; to effectuate the purposes mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/221712/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 51-A(j)</a> of the Constitution of India; to resolve the disputes between various  sports associations with regard to affiliations and elections, the Act of 2005 has been enacted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">The sports activities had been controlled and had become personal foredooms of certain persons and vested interests by virtue of certain associations coming to represent the State and in order to have a regulated mechanism of running the sports affairs in the State of Rajasthan particularly for the purpose of representing State of Rajasthan at national and international level,  the Act of 2005 has been enacted. The same appears to be democratic in nature; it ensures democracy at every level and representation by elected members from each district; there is no provision for nomination by the State Government; there is encouragement of sports activities both in public sphere as well as at the behest of private initiate. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_186\">The Act</a> seeks to regulate the activities which are prominently in the public sphere and  which affects the entire State even the nation. The State is within its legislative competence to decide as to how association of State level should be formed to represent the State of Rajasthan officially in the national and international sporting events. If the sports body seeks to represent the State of Rajasthan itself in the national and international sports events, such body must conform to certain regulatory mechanisms and must be representative one; State has not appointed anyone of its nominees but has created a legal structure in which the elected persons from the grass-root level till the State level could be effectively represented by a democratically elected method in consonance with the principles of federalism i.e. all the district representatives are at the State level, which in turn would represent the State at the national and international level. The statements made in the objects and reasons  of the Act of 2005 can be considered by the Court while judging the reasonableness of restriction, as <a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_187\">laid down in</a> Sardar Inder Singh V/s State of Rajasthan (1957 SCR 605= AIR 1957 SC 510)), which has been approved in State of Gujarat V/s Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat and ors. ((2005) 8 SCC 534). \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">\tA close scrutiny of various provisions of the Act of 2005 makes it clear that the State Government has provided infrastructure subject to which Primary Sports Body, District Level Sports Association and State Level Sports Association have to carry out their objectives. The State Government has        nowhere reserved with it power to make nomination and it has not made any provision that it shall tamper with the membership by particular persons of its choice or  independence of functioning of Sports Association.  The provisions ensure for election of executive body of the Sports Association in a democratic manner; they encourage sports activities; there is no restriction on number of Primary Sports Body; the State Government has not taken away the power of Sports Associations to grant membership; prescription of minimum requirement of constituting a Sports Association is aimed at to promote sports activities; by prescribing minimum and maximum number of members of Executive Body, no right of any Sports Association has been taken  away;  the Act of 2005 ensures fair election and that no sports body should camouflage itself with state or district level body under the Act. As per the transitional Section 26, it was optional for the sports association existing on the date of the commencement of the Act, to seek  registration and recognition under the Act of 2005 and it was only on exercise of option that the terms and conditions contained in various provisions of the Act of 2005 were required to be complied with by a Sports Association and on failure to compliance and if bye-laws were not brought in conformity with the provisions of the Act of 2005 at the expiry of 30 days from the date of commencement of the Act,  the Executive Body of the Sports Association was to be superseded by  the Registrar and Ad-hoc Executive Committee was to be appointed to manage the affairs of the Sports Association from amongst members entitled to be elected. Sections 26 and  27 falling under the transitional Chapter, incorporating provisions for the sports association existing at the time of commencement of the Act, have no relevance now when almost seven years have already passed to the enactment. For the other sports associations, which came into existence after the commencement of the Act or which shall come into existence in future, there is no compulsion to get themselves registered under the Act. They can function as Sports Association to promote sports activities, but without using the expression Rajasthan or the name of the concerned District, as the case may be, as provided under section 25(2). \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">\tIt is also noted in the aims and objectives of the Act of 2005 by the State Government that  large number of Sports Associations are using the expression Rajasthan and are holding out to be representing Rajasthan, its Districts or a part of Rajasthan without factually acting in representative capacity which is in violation of the Olympic Charter and the National Sports Policy, 2001. This has necessitated the regulation of such bodies to ensure that they are operating in a  representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports. The object of the Act is also to confer on Sports Associations legal right to represent Rajasthan and meet the aspirations of the public, discourage favourtism, create a deeper and wider network for selection process, develop a broad based procedure for identifying and promoting persons having sports talent. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">\tAs provided in the Statement of objects and reasons of the Act of 2005, sports are emerging as a profession and a sports event has its economics in sports tourism. It is apparent that now sports activities have become industry resulting into multifarious activities, contracts and money making including tourism aspect. Sports are being taken as career prospects. There has to be regulation for undertaking the sports activities and to make them broad based. There are instances in which it has been seen that various bodies claim themselves to be State Level Bodies and claim for representing the State and having the name of the concerned State such as  Rajasthan, but virtually they are not acting in representative capacity; there had been various litigation as to which team should represent State/District and which team to participate in the National/State level games etc. Considering the aforesaid aspects and the facts that the States performance in the national and international events had not been upto mark and the Sports bodies were either not registered or were registered under the Act of 1958, which did not provide for effective regulatory mechanism, and that the role of Rajasthan State Sports Council was limited and there was no system of fixing accountability for performance and no system for effective encouragement for the growth of the sports and games in the State, it was considered appropriate to enact the Act of 2005. The Bill was aimed at advancing, encouraging and promoting sports and games activities in the State, at State, District and lower level. By regulating,  the State has sought to create a facilitating democratic structure, which would encourage development of sports persons, development of athletic fitness and help brining young talent in sports and create model behavior to meet National and International challenges and standards.   \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">VII- Registration and recognition, whether compulsory or optional:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\"><a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 3</a> of the Act of 2005 provides that every Sports Association defined under the Act of 2005 other than a Primary Sports Body is required to be registered under the provisions of the Act of 2005. The District Level Sports Association as defined in <a href=\"/doc/188821970/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 2(f)</a> and State Level Sports Association as defined in <a href=\"/doc/188821970/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 2(v)</a> are required to be compulsorily registered. It is also apparent that 40 Sports Association, such as, Rajasthan Cricket Association, Archery Association,  Athletics Association, Badminton Association, Ball Badminton Association, Basketball Association, Billiards Association, Body building Association, Boxing Association, Bridge Association, Carrom Association,  Chess Association, Corf Ball Association, Cycling Association, Disabled Cricket Association, Equestrian Association, Football Association, Golf Association, Gymnastic Association, Handball Association, Hockey Association, Kabaddi Association, Kho-Kho Association, Net Ball Association, Power Lifting Association,  Rifle Shooting Association,  Shooting Ball Association, Soft ball Association, Swimming Association, Table Tennis Association, Taekwondo Association, Tennis Association, Tennis Ball Cricket Association; Volleyball Association, Weight Lifting Association, Wresting (Free Style) Association, Wrestling (Indian Style) Association,  Womens Cricket Association and Womens Hockey Association,  being State Level Association enlisted in Schedule B, were eligible for registration at the commencement of the Act, in view of <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_191\">Sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_192\">26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_193\">34</a> of the Act. Though it was imperative for them to apply under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 5</a> of the Act of 2005 for registration,  <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 26</a> of the Act of 2005 has to be read together with <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_196\">Sections 3</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_197\">5</a> of the Act of 2005. Section 26 provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act of 2005, an Association undertaking games or sports activities at State or District level and is already registered under the Act of 1958, shall be entitled to opt to be registered and recognized under the Act of 2005 and to receive a certificate thereof  on application to the Registrar and within thirty days from the date of commencement of the Act of 2005 shall amend its bye-laws to bring it in conformity with the provisions of the Act of 2005 to the satisfaction of the Registrar. The provisions have overriding effect over other provisions of the Act of 2005. The provision of Section 26 prevails over <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_198\">Sections 3</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_199\">5</a> of the Act. Section 26(1) contains non-obstante clause; an Association undertaking games or sports activities at State or District Level and already registered under the Act of 1958 shall be entitled to opt to be registered and recognized under this Act has to be given full effect to. This provision makes it optional for the Associations undertaking games or sports activities at State or District level and are registered under the Act of 1958 to seek registration or recognition under the Act of 2005 and at their volition, they may choose to apply for registration or recognition under the provisions of the Act of 2005. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">\tFurther, as discussed hereinabove, Section 26 falls under the Chapter-VII, which deals with the transitional provisions. The said section appears to have been incorporated giving right to the Associations already undertaking games or sports activities at State or District Level and registered under the <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_200\">Rajasthan Societies Registration Act, 1958</a>, on the date of commencement of the Act, to get themselves registered and recognized under the Act, by exercising option within thirty days from the date of commencement of the Act. As per Section 26(1), such Associations on exercising option to get themselves registered and recognized under the Act, had to amend their bye-laws and to submit documents as specified in <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_201\">Schedule A of the Act</a> within thirty days from the date of commencement of the Act. Section 26(2) would have come into play only if the Association having opted to be registered and recognized under the Act had not made such application or amended the bye-laws within thirty days from the date of commencement of the Act. There is nothing in the said Section 26 which would require all the Sports Associations existing on the date of commencement of the Act, to get themselves compulsorily registered under the Act. The legislature has used the words shall be entitled to opt to be registered and recognized, meaning thereby, there was clear option given to the Sports Associations existing on the date of commencement of the Act to get themselves registered and recognized under the Act. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">\tAs such, the Section 26 contains non-obstante clause and therefore has the effect of overriding the other provisions of the Act. Hence, though <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 5</a> required the State level associations enlisted in Schedule-B, which were eligible for registration at the commencement of the Act, to make application for registration, such associations had the option not to apply for registration in view of the overriding effect of Section 26. From the conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_203\">Sections 5</a>, 26 and 27, it clearly transpires that the Associations existing and registered under the <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_204\">Rajasthan Societies Registration Act, 1958</a>, on the date of commencement of the Act, and the State level associations enlisted in <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_205\">Schedule-B of the Act</a>, were entitled to exercise their option of getting themselves registered and recognized under the Act within the time limit prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act. If they exercised such option, they had to amend their bye-laws to bring them in conformity with the provisions of the Act, within the said time limit, failing which the provisions contained in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) would have come into play. Again, Section 27 also being a transitional provision was applicable to the associations which had exercised their option under <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 26</a> of the Act. The purpose of incorporating the transitional provisions of Section 26 and 27 contained in <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_208\">Chapter-VII of the Act</a>, was to enable the sports associations existing on the date of commencement of the Act of 2005, to get themselves registered and recognized under the Act and avail the benefits enshrined in the Act. If such associations had opted not to get themselves registered and recognized under the Act within the prescribed time limit, they would not have got the benefits under the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">\tIn any case, as stated hereinabove, Sections 26 and 27 being transitional provisions, have no application to the sports associations which came into existence after the commencement of the Act. So far as the registration of such associations which came into existence subsequently is concerned, the provisions contained in Chapter-II (<a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_209\">Sections 3</a> to <a href=\"/doc/197369135/\" id=\"a_210\">12</a>) would be applicable. Though from the heading compulsory registration of <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 3</a>, one may gather the impression that the registration of every Sports Association is compulsory under the Act, from the conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_212\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_213\">5</a>, 25 and 28, it clearly emerges that it is optional, and not compulsory. The only restriction or prohibition, that has been put on the Association, if not registered under the Act, is contained in Section 25, namely, non-permissibility of representing the State of Rajasthan in any games or sports without being authorized by the State Level Sports Association or using the name of the concerned district as part of its name or undertake any sports activity which results in representing the State of Rajasthan or a district. Again, if the association is registered under the Act, it would get the right as conferred under <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 28</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">The provision of <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 3</a> with respect to compulsory registration of the Sports Association under the Act of 2005 is confined to the Association of District Level Sports Association as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/188821970/\" id=\"a_216\">section 2(f)</a> which means that such Association is affiliated to the State Level Sports Association, which has applied for registration to the Registrar.  In case State Level Sports Association has not applied for registration to the Registrar, obviously, such District Level Sports Association would not be covered within the meaning of such association in the Act of 2005. Similar is the provision in <a href=\"/doc/188821970/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 2(v)</a> of the Act of 2005 with respect to State Level Sports Association, which means elected body of District Level Sports Association for particular game or sports in the State which is duly affiliated to the Rajasthan State Sports Council and affiliated to Rajasthan Olympic Association, and being eligible under Schedule B has applied for registration under the Act of 2005 to the Registrar. In case no such application has been filed, it cannot be treated as State Level Sports Association for the purpose of Act of 2005. When we consider <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_218\">Schedule-B of the Act</a> of 2005 also, names of eligible Associations as State Level Sports Associations have been mentioned  and when read with non-obstante clause contained in Section 26(1), such associations enlisted in Schedule B and any other future State Level Sports Association for a game or sports not presently covered by Schedule B and added to schedule B under the Act of 2005 are required to apply for registration alongwith documents mentioned in Schedule A  otherwise they will have to face the consequences of Section 25(1)  which provides that no person or group of persons either individually or  collectively shall represent or  be allowed to represent the State of Rajasthan in any game or sports without being authorized by the State Level Sports Association and consequently, as per Section 25(2),  no Sports Association shall be entitled to use the description Rajasthan or use the name of a District as part of its name or undertake any Sports activity which results in representing the State of Rajasthan or a District, as an affiliated unit of any National Federation, Board or Association purporting to represent India, or in any other manner whatsoever, unless such Sports Association is registered as a State Level Sports Association or a District Level Sports Association under the Act of 2005.  Thus, it is clear that if the sports association does not get itself registered under the Act of 2005, then the description Rajasthan cannot be used by such Sports Association and name of  District also cannot be used  as part of its name  and representation on behalf of the State or District cannot be made. However, it would be open to such Association to carry on its activities of sports and to promote the sports as per its bye-laws and manage its affairs as they recognize. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_219\">The Act</a> of 2005 provides for the broad base structure for purpose of registration and recognition under the Act of 2005, which is optional.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"301137\" id=\"span_5\">Section 27 like <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 26</a> of the Act of 2005 is also transitional provision, which provides that once Sports Associations existing on the date of the commencement of the Act have &#x27;opted&#x27; for registration and recognition  under <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_221\">section 26</a> of the Act of 2005, registration under the Act of 1958 shall cease to exist from the date of such option.  Section 27 also used the word option that also fortifies our conclusion that  it was optional and not mandatory for the existing sports associations to apply for registration and recognition.  Only for furtherance of the objectives of representation at State/District level, State Level Sports Association or District Level Sports Association may apply for registration and recognition and <a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_222\">in that case</a>, they are bound to make the provisions in their constitution for  democratic and fair election bye laws to provide for tenure, and ensure the independent and representative capacity of the membership.

Section 18A of the said Act gives power to the Registrar to refuse or to cancel the registration of certain Societies. As per Section 18A(2), if the name of a Society registered before the commencement of the Act of 2005 contains as part of its name the expression Rajasthan or the name of any District of the State or such Society shall amend its  name to remove Rajasthan or, as the case may be, the name of the district  from the registered name of the Society within thirty days from such commencement and as per Section 18A(3), if any society fails to comply with the provisions of Section 18A(2) the Registrar shall, after giving an opportunity of hearing to such Society, cancel the registration of such society. Thus, society cannot use the expression Rajasthan or the name of District of the State and it has to amend its name to remove Rajasthan or name of  District, as the case may be, from the  registered name of the Society within 30 days.  There is no vested right in the name and since the objectives of the Act of 2005 indicate that there are several bodies which were existing without registration and were not  having effective regulatory method and large number of sports Associations were using the expression Rajasthan and were holding out to be representing Rajasthan, its Districts or a part of Rajasthan without factually acting in representative capacity. It was in violation of the Olympic Charter and the National Sports Policy, 2001, which provide for making the functioning of the Federation and Associations transparent, professional and accountable. This necessitated the regulation of such bodies to ensure that they are operating in a representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels, so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports, for which the Act of 2005 has been enacted.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"301137\" id=\"span_6\">In case the Sports Association opts out, it can have its governance as per constitutional bye-laws etc. and only in case benefit of the Act of 2005 has to be obtained by registration and recognition and to represent on behalf of the State and District level<a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_226\">, <a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_227\">in that case</a></a> the provisions of the Act of 2005 are applicable and not otherwise.

The movement continued through the repeated conformations of Magna Carta and the Petition of rights (1628) and culminated in the Bill of rights (1689) with its concluding words as . it may be declared and enacted that all an singular the rights and liberties asserted and claimed in the said declaration are the true, ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of people of this kingdom. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_231\">The Act</a> of Settlement (1701) which followed, had for its title <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_232\">An Act</a> declaring the Rights and Liberties of the subjects which were asserted as the birth-right of the people of England.  The doctrine of natural rights received further impetus at the hands of the great protagonists of the Theory of Social Contract- Johan Locke (1690) and Rousseau (1762). Blackstone (1765) who, for the first time, gave the concept of binding natural rights on any political authority and thus imported the doctrine of natural rights from the real of political philosophy into the realm of jurisprudence. He made the distinction between absolute rights i.e. those which are primary and belong to an individual by merely being in a state of Nature and which everyman is entitled to enjoy, whether out of society or in it and relative rights i.e. those which are incidental to individual only as members of society.  Virginia Bill of Rights (1776) adopted in the State Constitution of Virginia was the first declaration of rights in a written constitution as the basic and foundation of government. The theory of natural rights entered into the realm of constitutional realism with two revolutionary documents American Declaration of Independence (1776) and the French Declaration of Rights of Man (1789) which asserted that there were certain  inalienable rights and it was the duty of the state to maintain these rights.  With the introduction of the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution in 1789, the natural right eventually transformed into fundamental rights operating as a constitutional limitation on the powers of each of the organs set up by the Constitution and enforceable by the courts. The first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution deal with the Bill of  Rights.  First amendment relates to right to religion and free expression and the fourteenth amendment relates to due process. The urge for embodying guarantees of individual rights in Constitutions has been further accentuated by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) by the United Nationals, as also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">Principle of Interpretation of Fundamental  Rights:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"301137\" id=\"span_8\">Shri Paras Kuhad, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has submitted that the principle for interpretation of fundamental rights is generous and purposive construction as <a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_233\">laid down in</a> A.G.V/s Jobe ((1985) LRC (Const.) 556). He has also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in M.Nagaraj V/s Union of India ((2006) 8SCC 212) in which it has been held that the Constitution is not ephemeral legal document; purposive rather  than a strict literal approach to the interpretation should be adopted. He has contended that constitutional provision should be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner and <a href=\"/doc/301137/\" id=\"a_234\">in that case</a>, while making liberal interpretation, it was observed that right to know is implicate in the right of free speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_235\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> He has also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in I.R.Coelho V/s  State of Tamil Nadu  ((2007) 2 SCC 1) in which while considering the essence of principle behind <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_236\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution,   the Apex Court  has held that essence or principle of the right or nature of violation is more important than the equality in the abstract or formal sense.  The principle behind fundamental rights are part of the basic structure of the Constitution. He has also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in Sakal Newspaper (P)( Ltd. And ors. V/s Union of India ((1962) 3 SCR 842)  where the Apex Court laid down that the Constitution does not expressly provide for the freedom of press but  this freedom is included in freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by clause (1)(a) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_237\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India.  He has further relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) V/s Union of India ((2003) 4 SCC 399) in which it has been laid down that attempt of the court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental right by process of judicial interpretation.</span> Relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in Sakal Newspaper (P) Ltd. (supra), he has submitted that certain rights have been enshrined in the Constitution as fundamental and thus, the Court must not be too astute to interpret the language of the Constitution in so literal sense as to whittle them down. Fundamental rights are not limited rights. As held in Mrs.Menaka Gandhi V/s Union of India ((1978) 1 SCC 248), the attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of fundamental rights. He has also relied upon the said decision wherein right to have a passport was held to be a part of personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Reliance has been placed on the  following observations made in the case of Mrs.Maneka Gandhi (supra):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">Now, it may be pointed out at the outset that it is not our view that a right which is not specifically mentioned by name can never be a fundamental right within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 19(1).</a> It is possible that a right does not find express mention in any clause of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 19(1)</a> and yet it may be covered by some clause of that Article..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">He has  also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in Union of India V/s Naveen Jindal ((2004) 2 SCC 510) wherein it was held that This Court times without number has extended the scope and extent of the provisions of the fundamental rights, having regard to several factors including the intent and purport of the Constitution makers as reflected in parts IV and IVA-A of the Constitution of India.   He has also relied upon the  decision of the Apex Court in Waman Rao &amp; ors. V/s Union of India &amp; Ors. ((1981) 2 SCC 362) in which it has been laid down that mere abridgment that is to say curtailment and not necessarily abrogation that is to say total deprivation, is enough to produce the consequences provided by <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 13(2).</a> In any given case, what is decisive is whether, in so far as the impugned law is concerned, the rights available to persons affected by law under any of the articles in Part II are totally or substantially withdrawn and not whether the articles, the application of which stands withdrawn in regard to a defined category of laws, continue to be on statute books so as to be available in respect of laws of other categories.  Relying upon the decision of the Apex Court in Minerva Mills V/s Union of India ((1980) 3 SCC 625), he has submitted that even abridgement of fundamental right may involve violation of basic structure. Again referring to the decision in the case of M.Nagaraj (supra), he has submitted that there are beyond the words of particular provisions,  systematic principles underlying the provisions of the Constitution and instance is the principle  of reasonableness which connects <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_242\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_243\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_244\">21</a> of the Constitution and some of these principles may be so important and fundamental, as to quality as essential features or part of the basic structure of the Constitution that is to say, they are not open to amendment. He further submitted that certain unarticulated rights are implicated enumerated guarantees. He has also referred to the decision of the Apex Court in Gobind V/s State of M.P. ((1975) 2 SCC 148) with reference to the right to privacy in which the Apex Court has relied upon the decision of Douglas, J in Griswold V/s Connecticut  (381 U.S. 479) wherein it was observed:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">..the right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print but also the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read and that without those peripheral rights the specific right would be less secure and that likewise, the other specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance, that the various guarantees create zones of privacy and that protection against all governmental invasion of the sanctity of a mans home and the privacies of life was fundamental. He further said that the inquiry is whether a right involved  if of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions and that privacy is a fundamental personal right, emanating from the totality of the Constitutional scheme under which we (Americans) live.\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">\tHe has  again referred to decision of the Apex Court in  M.Nagaraj (supra) especially para 20 wherein it was observed that  content of a right is defined by the courts and the final word on the content of the right is of the court and therefore, constitutional adjudication plays a very important role in this exercise. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">\tThere is no dispute with the aforesaid propositions laid down by the Apex Court, but the question to be pondered is what is the right enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>  of the Constitution and to what extent it is saved.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">\tThe learned Senior Counsel has also submitted that this Court should interpret the provision of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> considering direct or inevitable consequences of the measures enacted in the impugned Act and for that, he has relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in Express News Papers (P) Ltd. And anr. V/s Union of India (AIR 1958 SC 578)  in which the  Apex Court has observed that unless there were the direct or inevitable consequences of the measures enacted in the impugned Act, it would not be possible to strike down the legislation as having that effect and operation. If the intention or the proximate effect and operation of the Act was such as to bring it within the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_247\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, it would certainly be liable to be struck down. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">\tOur attention was drawn to the following observations made by the Apex Court in R.C.Cooper V/s Union of India ((1970) 1 SCC 248):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">.it is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right of a citizen, nor the form of action that determines the protection he can claim; it is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the Court to grant relief. If this be the true view, and we think it is, in determining the impact of State action upon constitutional guarantees which are fundamental, it follows that the extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined not by the object of the Legislature nor by the form of the action, but by its direct operation upon the individuals right. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">We are of the view that the theory that the object and form of the State action determine the extent of protection which the aggrieved party may claim is not consistent with the constitutional scheme..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"723750\" id=\"span_9\">The Apex Court in R.C.Cooper  laid down that impairment of the fundamental right is to be considered by direct operation upon individual right.

He has referred to the decision in National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) V/s Alabama ex Rel.Patterson, Attorney General (357 U.S. 449(1958)) wherein it was observed that production order in question must be regarded as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by the petitioners members of their right to freedom of association; revelation of the identity of  its rank and file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion and other manifestations of public hostility; compelled disclosure of petitioners Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate,  in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade other from joining it.  Learned Senior Counsel has relied upon the following observations made in the case of NAACPO V/s Alabama (supra):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">This Court has recognized the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in ones associations. ....Inviolabiity of privacy in group association may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs\n\tWe think that the production order, in the respects here drawn in question, must be regarded as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioners members of their right to freedom of association. Petitioner has made an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation  of the identity of its rank-and-file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility. Under these circumstances, we think it apparent that compelled disclosure of petitioners Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and  (357 U.S.449, 463) its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">\tWe turn to the final question whether Alabama has demonstrated an interest in obtaining the disclosures it seeks from petitioner which is sufficient to justify the deterrent effect which we have concluded these disclosures may well have on the free exercise by petitioners members of their constitutionally protected right of association.\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">In NAACP V/s Alabama (supra), it was observed that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the liberty assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment. The learned Senior Counsel has also relied upon the following observations made in the case of NAACP V/s Alabama (supra):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedom of speech and assembly. De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364; Thomas v. Collins 323 U.S. 516, 530.  It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the liberty assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speechOf course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters and state action which may have the (357 U.S. 449, 461) effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">\t..In the domain of these indispensable liberties, whether of speech, press or association, the decisions of this Court recognize that abridgment of such rights, even though unintended, may inevitably follow from varied forms of governmental action. Thus in Douds, the Court stressed that the legislation there challenged, which on its face sought to regulate labor unions and to secure stability in interstate commerce, would have the practical effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutionally protected political rights. 399 U.S. at 393, and it upheld the statute only after concluding that the reasons advanced for its enactment were constitutionally sufficient to justify its possible deterrent effect upon such freedoms. Similar recognition of possible unconstitutional intimidation of the free exercise of the right to advocate underlay this Courts narrow construction of the authority of a congressional committee investigating lobbying and of an Act regulating lobbying, although in neither case was there an effort to suppress speech. United States V. Rumely, 345 u.S. 41, 46-47; United States v. Harriss 347 U.S. 612, 625-626. The governmental action challenged may appear to be totally unrelated to protected liberties. Statutes imposing taxes upon rather than prohibiting particular activity have been struck down when perceived to have the consequence of unduly curtailing the liberty of freedom of press assured under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Reliance was placed on the following observations made in Boy Scouts of America V/s Dale (supra):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">In Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984), we observed that implicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the first Amendment is a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious and cultural ends. This right is crucial in preventing the majority from imposing its views on groups that would rather express other, perhaps unpopular, ideas. See ibid. (stating that protection of the right to expressive  association is especially important in preserving political and cultural diversity and in shielding dissident expression from suppression by the majority). Government actions that may unconstitutionally burden this freedom may take many forms, one of which is intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association like a regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire. Id., at 623, Forcing a group to accept certain members may impair the ability of the group to express those views and only those views, that it intends to express. Thus, freedom of association plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">\tThe forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the groups freedom of expressive  association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the groups ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\"> Thus, relying upon the decision, the learned Senior Counsel has submitted that certain members are foisted upon the State Level Sports Association in the shape of District  representing various districts, it is violative of  the right to form association.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">\tWe are not impressed by the aforesaid submissions of the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner as it is optional to apply for registration and recognition as per the provisions of the Act of 2005. It is the discretion available to the Sports Association either to  opt or not to opt.  In case it opts, legal infrastructure has been provided under the Act of 2005. As such, in the case of Societies etc., once a Society is formed and it wanted to take the benefit of the Act of 2005, it has to act within the structural framework provided under the Act. Thus, it cannot be said that any member is being foisted upon the State Level Sports Association or District Level Sports Association, as the case may be, rather once option is exercised to have registration or recognition to avail the benefit and privileges under the Act of 2005, in that case, they are bound by the provisions of the Act of 2005. As already discussed above, democratic set up has been provided in order to broad base the sports activities; regulatory measures have been provided; there is no restriction imposed upon carrying on the activities by the State Level Sports Association or District Level Sports Association by the Act of 2005; there is no States interference in the functioning and independence of the State Level or District Level Sports Association.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">\tReliance has also been placed by the learned Senior Counsel on the decision in Griswold V/s Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 (1965)) in which the US Supreme Court recognized the constitutional right to freedom of intimate associate, the fundamental human right to create and maintain intimate human relationship. He has relied upon the following observations made in the case of Griswold (supra):-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">By Pierce V. Society of Sisters, supra, the right to educate ones children as once chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the first and Fourteenth Amendments. By Meyer V. Nebraska, supra, the same dignity is given the  right  to study the German language in a private school. In other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the first Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge. The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read (Martin v. Struthers 319 U.S. 141, 143) and freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought and freedom to teach(see wieman v. Updegraff 344 U.S. 183, 185)- indeed the freedom of the entire university community. Sweezyv. New Hamsphire 354 U.S. 234, 249-250, 261-263; Barenblatt v. United States,360 U.S. 109, 112; Baggett v. Bullitt 377 U.S. 360, 369. Without (381 U.S. 479, 483) those peripheral rights the specific rights would be less secure. And  so we reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the Meyer cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">\tIn Griswold V/s Connecticut (supra), it has been laid down that right of association includes the right to express ones attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means. The expression of opinion is not expressly included in the First Amendment, but  its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful.

He has further submitted that essence is the ability to freely exercise the rights; again the fact that government action appears to be totally unrelated to protected liberties, is not enough, it is enough if it perceived to have the consequence of unduly constraining the liberty; due deference must be given to the Associations view as to what would impair its expression.

See, e.g., La Follettee, supra,at 123-124 (considering whether a Wisconsin law burdened the National Partys associational rights and stating that a State, or a court, may not constitutionally substitute its own judgment for that of the Party). That is not to say that an expressive association can erect a shield against anti discrimination laws simply by asserting that mere acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair its message Dales presence in the Boy Scouts would, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the  world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">. the presence of Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would just as surely interfere with the Boy Scouts choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">\tIn Boy Scouts of America V/s Dale (supra), relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel, it was further observed that impediments to the exercise of ones right to choose ones association can violate the right of association protected by the First Amendment; State requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the organizations right to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct.

We have already concluded that a State requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would significantly burden the organizations right to opposite or disfavor homosexual  conduct. The state interests embodied in New Jerseys public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts right to freedom of expressive association.

The aforesaid decision is of no avail as there is no compulsion to have registration or recognition under the Act of 2005; it is optional to opt the Act of 2005; none of the restrictions as mentioned in the aforesaid decision curtailing the right of any member or association is attracted in the instant case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">\tReliance has also been placed by the learned Senior Counsel on the decision in  Sorensen and  Rasmussen V/s Denmark (Applications nos.52562/99 and 52620/99) STRASBOURG, 11th January 2006,  in which the European Court of Human Rights in 2006 declared the closed shop collective agreement provisions illegal.  It has been laid down thus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">.The right to form and to join trade unions is a special aspect of freedom of associations, and the notion of a freedom implies some measure of freedom of choice as to its exercise (see Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, $ 52 cited above) . Accordingly, <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 11</a> must also be viewed as encompassing a negative right of association or, put in other words, a right not to be forced to join an association (see Sigurdur Sigurjonsson v. Iceland judgment of 30 June 1993, Series A no.264, $ 35). Though compulsion to join a particular trade union may not always be contrary to the Convention, a form of such compulsion which, in the circumstances of the case, strikes at the very substance of the freedom of association guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 11</a> will constitute an interference with that freedom.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">\tFurthermore, regard must also be had in this context to the fact that the protection of personal opinions guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_254\">Articles 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_255\">10</a> is one of the purposes of the guarantee of freedom of association, and that such protection can only be effectively secured through the guarantee of both a positive and a negative right to freedom of association (see Chassagnou and Others v.France (GC), nos. 25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95 $ 103 ECHR 1999-III: Young, James and Webster, $ 57 and Sigurdur Sigurjonsson, $ 37, both cited above.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">\tIn this connection the notion of personal autonomy is an important principle underlying the interpretation of the Convention guarantees. This notion must therefore be seen as an essential corollary of the individuals freedom of choice implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_256\">Article 11</a> and confirmation of the importance of the negative aspect of that provision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">\tThe Court does not in principle exclude that the negative and the positive aspects of the <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_257\">Article 11</a> right should be afforded the same level of protection in the area under consideration. However, it is difficult to decide this issue in the abstract since it is a matter that can only be properly addressed in the circumstances of a given case. At the same time, an individual cannot be considered to have renounced its negative right to freedom of association in situations where, in the knowledge that trade-union membership is a pre-condition of securing a job, he accepts an offer of employment notwithstanding his opposition to the condition imposed. Accordingly, the distinction made between pre-entry closed-shop agreements and post-entry closed shop agreements in terms of the scope of the protection guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_258\">Article 11</a> is not tenable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">\tIt has been laid down in Sorensen and Rasmussen V/s Denkmark (supra) that notion of personal autonomy is important principle underlying the interpretation of the Convention guarantees and this notion must be seen as an essential corollary of the individuals freedom of choice implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 11</a> and confirmation of the importance of the negative aspect of that provision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">\tReliance has also been placed on the decision in Buckley V/s Valeo (424 U.<a href=\"/doc/26966304/\" id=\"a_260\">S. 1 (1976)</a> wherein the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act requiring the reporting and disclosure of contributions and expenditures to and by political organizations including the maintenance by such organizations of records of every one contributing more than $ 10 and reporting by individuals and groups that are not candidates or political committees who contribute or expend more than $ 100 a year for the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of an identified candidate, came up for consideration; challenge was upheld partially holding that compelled disclosure in itself can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment; significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest. It was laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">But we have repeatedly found that compelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on privacy of association and belief guaranteed by the first Amendment. E.g., Gibson v. Florida Legislative Commn., 372 U.S. 539 (1963); NAACP v Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963), Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479 (1960); Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516 (1960); NAACP v. Alabama, 357U.S. 449 (1958).,\nWe long have recognized that significant encroachments on First Amendment rights of the sort that compelled disclosure imposes cannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest. Since NAACP v. Alabama we have required that the subordinating interests of the State must survive exacting scrutiny. We also have insisted that there be a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the governmental interest and the information required tobe disclosed. See Pollard v. Roberts 283 F. Suppl.248, 257 (ED Ark) (three judge court) affd, 393 U.<a href=\"/doc/189627210/\" id=\"a_261\">S. 14(1968)</a> (424 U.<a href=\"/doc/26966304/\" id=\"a_262\">S. 1</a> 65) (per curiam). This type of scrutiny is necessary even if any deterrent effect on the exercise of First Amendment rights arises, not through direct government action, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the governments conduct in requiring disclosure.

Pontikes,414 U.S. at 57-58.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">\tIn the case of Boy Scouts of America V/s Dale (supra) relied upon by the petitioner, it has been laid down that it is not the role of the courts to reject a groups expressed values because they disagree with those values or find them internally inconsistent; the courts may not interfere on the ground that they view a particular expression  as unwise or irrational; we must not be guided by our views.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">\tReliance has also been placed on the decision in  Glen A.Williams V/s James A.Rhodes (393 U.S.  23,  30-31 (1968)) in which the US Supreme Court has held that the validity of governmental regulation must be determined by assessing the degree of infringement of the right of association against the legitimacy, strength and necessity of the governmental interests  and the  means of implementing those interests.  The right of association is one form of orderly group activity, protected by the first  Amendment. Cumbersome election machinery can effectively suffocate the right of association, the promotion of political ideals and programmes of political action, and the right to vote.  The totality of Ohios requirements has those effects. The same was reiterated in Bullock V/s Carter (405 U.S. 134m 142-143 (1972); Storer V/s Brown (415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974); Illinois State Bd.

J.Hurley and South Boston Allied War Vetrans Council V/s Irish- American Gay Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston (515 U.S. 557 (1995)), the Supreme  Judicial Court of Massachusetts observed that private citizens organizing a public demonstration cannot be compelled by the State to include groups who impart a message the organizers do not want to include in their demonstration, even if such a law had been written with the intent of preventing discrimination. In that case, the State of Massachusetts could not require the private organizers of Bostons St.Patricks Day parade to allow a group of gays and lesbians to march as a unit proclaiming its members gay and lesbian identity, the Court held that to do so would require parade organizers to promote a message they did not wish to promote. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">\tThe learned Senior Counsel has also referred to Oxford dictionary of politics in which it has been defined  that freedom of Association is the freedom of individuals to associate as an end in itself or with a view to pursuing common projects including sporting clubs. The Supreme Court of US has determined that the United States Constitution asserts two fundamental rights of free association; (1) right of intimate association; and (2) right to associate for expressive (essentially, religious or political) purposes. Where associations fail to meet the Courts demanding criteria of intimacy, the Court has ruled that government may require associations to satisfy equal opportunity norms in their membership policies unless departure from these norms will clearly undermine the associations specific expressive purposes as held in Roberts, Acting Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Human Rights, et al. V/s United States Jaycees (468 U.S. 609(1984)).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">\tIn case we follow the aforesaid decisions of the Supreme Court of US, as mentioned in Oxford Dictionary, the government may require associations to follow equal opportunity norms of their membership, that means to further the objectives of the Association of the State Level or District Level Sports Association by providing representative membership right to form association, which will not be jeopardized even after option is exercised for registration and recognition under the Act of 2005. Inspite of membership being representative one, they can carry on their activities. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">\tIt has also been mentioned in Oxford Dictionary of Politics relied upon by the petitioner that major point of controversy concerns the extent to which individuals should have the right to refuse membership of association that others would like them to join. Enforced membership in such cases may violate liberty of conscience, though complete voluntarism may also result in situations where some individuals unfairly free ride on the associational activism of others. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">\tWhen we consider the provisions of the Act of 2005 in the light of aforesaid decisions, it is open to the registered and recognized Association to give membership as per bye-laws, the State Government has not taken away the power of the Sports Association to grant membership; the Act has also made it necessary at the same time that there should be representative association at the level of District or State. Such a regulatory provision cannot be said to be violative of right to form association and carry on objectives. The provision ensures democratic set up in order to provide fair and equal opportunity of participation in entire State.  When it comes to question of representation at State level, since there is no governmental/political interference which should not be made in the field of sports, we find by providing broad base structure that no right envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_263\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> can be said to have been infringed by the Act of 2005. It ensures that nepotism from field of sports is weeded out.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">\tThe learned Senior Counsel has also referred to  Wests Encyclopedia of American Law where it has been observed that Court has balanced the individuals associational interests against the States interests. It has also been observed that in twentieth century, the Supreme Court has observed that a Ku Klux Klan membership list had to be disclosed because the members freedom of association was subordinate to the states interest in controlling the Klans illegal activities (New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman 278 US. 63, 49 S. Ct. 61, 73 L. Ed. 184 (1928). Similarly, in 1961, the Court upheld a forced disclosure of the Communist partys membership  because of the perceived dangers posted by the partys activities (Communist Party of the United States V/s Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.<a href=\"/doc/26966304/\" id=\"a_264\">S. 1</a>, 81 S. Ct.1357), 6 L. Ed. 2d 625(1961)).  In the late twentieth century, the Court moved away from the balancing approach toward a strict scrutiny  standard that made it more difficult for the government to impinge indirectly on freedom of association. In Roberts V/s Uninted States Jaycees (468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed. 2d 462 (1984)) wherein bye-laws limited full membership to men aged eighteen to thirty five and when group of women challenged their exclusion, the policy was held unconstitutional and the Court found that the states interest in eliminating gender discrimination outweighed the male Jaycees interest in freedom from compelled association.  Although the Court reiterated its position that freedom of association is fundamental, it also stated that such freedom is not absolute. Infringements on that right may be justified by regulations adopted to serve compelling state interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms. It was laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\"> The Jaycees is a national organization whose bye-laws limited full membership to men aged eighteen to thirty five.

If Sports Association opts registration and recognition under the Act of 2005, it has to comply with the law relating to registration; formation of an association/union and so far as the activities of the association/union and as regards the steps which the association/union might take to achieve its object, they are subject to such laws as may be framed and validity of such laws cannot be tested on the touchstone of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 19(4).</a> The right to freedom of association does not comprehend the fulfillment of the objects or purpose for which the association has been formed. The freedom of association guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>  does not imply that apart from non-interference with the formation of association, the State must further ensure the achievement of the desire or objectives for which the association has been formed. The doctrine of  concomitant rights i.e. the right claimed by the petitioner to represent the State of Rajasthan has been decisively rejected by the court in several decisions.  The right to form  association and to achieve the desired results for forming the associations has been the subject matter of discussion in various decisions of the Apex Court.  In  Ex.Capt. Harish Uppal V/s Union of India ((2003) 2 SCC 45), the Apex Court held that  the lawyers do not have any right to go on strike or to give a call for boycott. In  All India Bank Employees Association V/s National Industrial Tribunal ((1962) 3 SCR 269)  the Apex Court held that even a liberal interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>  of the Constitution cannot lead to a conclusion that the trade unions have a guaranteed right to an effective collective bargaining or to strike as a part of effective collective bargaining or otherwise.  \t\t\tIn Dharam Dutt and ors. V/s Union of India &amp; ors. (2004(1) SCC 712), the Apex Court  upheld the merger of society and made distinction in the right of a person to form association and right of association to carry on its activity.  The Apex Court held that a restriction on activity of association is not a restriction of activity of individual forming membership of Association. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"723750\" id=\"span_10\">In the case of  Dharam Dutt (supra) referring to the decisions in the case of <a href=\"/doc/723750/\" id=\"a_271\">Smt.Maneka Gandhi</a> (supra) and  All India  Bank Employees Association (supra), the Apex Court observed that  right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular, object or running a particular institution, the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a fundamental right, but not the fundamental right itself.</span>  The decision in  Raghubar Dayal Jail Prakash V/s the Union of India (supra) has also been taken into consideration  in which it has been laid down that the restriction imposed by <a href=\"/doc/30111198/\" id=\"a_272\">section 6</a> is for the purpose of recognition and no association is compelled to apply to the government for recognition under the Act. An application for the recognition of the association for the purpose of functioning under the enactment is a voluntary act on the part of the association and if the statute imposes conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued, it is difficult to  see how the freedom to form the association is affected unless of-course that freedom implies or involved a guaranteed right to recognition also. The decision in the case of Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co.Ltd. (supra) has also been taken into consideration in  which it has been laid down that the fundamental right to form an association cannot be coupled with the fundamental right to carry on any trade or business. The Apex Court laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"723750\" id=\"span_11\">24. From a reading of the two decisions, namely, <a href=\"/doc/723750/\" id=\"a_273\">Smt. Maneka Gandhi</a>&#x27;s case (supra), (seven-Judges Bench) and All India Bank Employees Association&#x27;s case (supra), (five-Judges Bench), the following principles emerge : (i) a right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular, object or running a particular institution , the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a fundamental right, but not the fundamental right itself. The associations or unions of citizens cannot further claim as a fundamental right that it must also be able to achieve the purpose for which it has come into existence so that any interference with such achievement by law shall be unconstitutional, unless the same could be justified under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_274\">Article 19(4)</a> as being a restriction imposed in the interest of public order or morality; (ii) A right to form associations guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_275\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> does not imply the fulfillment of every object of an association as it would be contradictory to the scheme underlying the text and the frame of the several fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III and particularly by the scheme of the guarantees conferred by Sub-clauses (a) to (g) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_276\">Article 19(iii)</a> While right to form an association is to be tested by reference to <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 19(i)(c)</a> and the validity of restriction thereon by reference to <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 19(4)</a>, once the individual citizens have formed an association and carry on some activity, the validity of legislation restricting the activities of the association shall have to be judged by reference to <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> read with 19(6). A restriction on the activities of the association is not a restriction on the activities of the individual citizens forming membership of the association; and (iv) A perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 19</a> with certain other Articles like 26, 29 and 30 shows that while <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 19</a> grants rights to the citizens as such, the associations can lay claim to the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_282\">Article 19</a> solely on the basis of there being an aggregation of citizens, i.e., the rights of the citizens composing the body. As the stream can rise no higher than the source, associations of citizens cannot lay claim to rights not open to citizens or claim freedom from restrictions to which the citizens composing it are subject.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">25. The Constitution Bench in All India Bank Employees&#x27; Association&#x27;s case (supra) gave a precise illustration thus - &quot;If an association were formed for the purpose of carrying on business, the right to form it would be guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 19</a>, subject to any law restricting that right conforming to Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_284\">Article 19.</a> As regards its business activities, however, and the achievement of the objects for which it was brought into existence, its rights would be those guaranteed by Sub-clause (g) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_285\">Article 19</a>, subject to any relevant law on the matter conforming to Clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_286\">Article 19;</a> while the property which the association acquires or possesses would be protected by Sub-clause (f) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 19</a> subject to legislation within the limits laid down by Clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_288\">Article 19.&quot;</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">26. Giving exposition to the law by reference to the labour union, the Constitution Bench held - &quot;While the right to form a union is guaranteed by Sub-clause (c), the right of the members of the association to meet would be guaranteed by Sub-clause (b), their right to move from place to place within India by Sub-clause (d), their right to discuss their problems and to propagate their views by Sub-clause (a), their right to hold property would be that guaranteed by sub- Clause (f) and so on - each of these freedoms being subject to such restrictions as might properly be imposed by Clauses (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 19</a> as might be appropriate in the context. It is one thing to interpret each of the freedoms guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III in a fair and liberal sense; it is quite another to read each guaranteed right as involving or including concomitant rights necessary to achieve the object which might be supposed to underlie the grant of each of those rights.&quot; \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">27. The Constitution Bench further held that the framing and structure of part III of the Constitution by the founding fathers calls for the guarantees embodied in it to be interpreted in a liberal way, so as to subserve the purpose for which the constitution-makers intended them, and not in any pedantic or narrow sense. This, however, does not imply that the Court is at liberty to give an unnatural and artificial meaning to the expressions used based on ideological considerations. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">28. A right to form unions guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> does not carry with it a fundamental right in the union so formed to achieve every object for which it was formed with the legal consequence that any legislation not falling within Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_291\">Article 19</a> which might in any way hamper the fulfillment of those objects, should be declared unconstitutional and void. Even a very liberal interpretation cannot lead to the conclusion that the trade unions have a guaranteed right to an effective collective bargaining or to strike, either as part of collective bargaining or otherwise. The right to strike or the right to declare a lock-out may be controlled or restricted by appropriate industrial legislation, and the validity of such legislation would have to be tested not with reference to the criteria laid down in Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 19</a> but by totally different considerations. A right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_293\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> on a literal reading thereof can be subjected to those restrictions which satisfy the test of Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_294\">Article 19.</a> The rights not included in the literal meaning of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> but which are sought to be included therein as flowing therefrom i.e. every right which is necessary in order that the association, brought into existence, fulfills every object for which it is formed, the qualifications therefore would not merely be those in Clause (45 of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 19</a> but would be more numerous and very different. Restrictions which bore upon and took into account the several fields in which associations or unions of citizens might legitimately engage themselves, would also become relevant. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">29. The law so settled, as has been stated hereinabove, has not changed its course in the flow of subsequent judicial pronouncements. We may selectively refer to a few of them. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1933483\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_297\">Raghubar Dayal Jai Parkash and Anr. v.  The Union of India and Anr.</a>, [1962]3SCR547 , the issue related to the <a href=\"/doc/148970782/\" id=\"a_298\">Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952</a>, which imposed restrictions on the recognition of associations by the Government. Provisions were made for certain enquiries to be held and for the satisfaction of certain criteria whereupon the association could be recognized. The challenge to the constitutional validity of the provision was founded on the submission that the provisions infringed upon the freedom to form associations under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_299\">Article 19(1)(c).</a> It was urged that the constitutional guarantee to every citizen to the right to form an association could be limited only by an imposition on the right which might legally fail within Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_300\">Article 19</a> viz. bye laws which place restrictions based on either public order or morality. It was further urged that where the object of the association is lawful, the citizens, through that association, and the association itself, are entitled by virtue of the guaranteed right to freedom from legislative interference in the achievement of its object, except on grounds germane to public order or morality. In other words, the freedom guaranteed should be read as extending not merely to the formation of the association as such, but to the effective functioning of the association so as to enable it to achieve its lawful objectives. Unless <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_301\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> were so read, the freedom guaranteed would be illusory and the Court should, in construing a freedom guaranteed to the citizen, give him an effective, right. In short/ the submission was that the right guaranteed under Sub-clause (c) of Clause (i) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 19</a> was not merely, as its text would indicate, the right to form an association, but would include the functioning of the association without any restraints not dictated by the need for preserving order or the Interests of morality, The Constitution Bench discarded the argument as without force and held -&quot;the restriction imposed by <a href=\"/doc/30111198/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 6</a> of the Act is for the purpose of recognition and no association is compelled to apply to the Government for recognition under that Act. An application for the recognition of the association for the purpose of functioning under the enactment is a voluntary act on the part of the association and if the statute imposes conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued. It is a little difficult to see how the freedom to form the association is affected unless, of course, that freedom implies or involves a guaranteed right to recognition also.&quot;</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"938664\" id=\"span_13\">30.

The effect of confining <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_311\">Article 19</a> to citizens as distinguished from persons, is that protection under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_312\">Article 19</a> can be claimed only by citizens and not by corporations or companies. The attempt of the petitioners to claim the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_313\">Article 19</a> by placing reliance on the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil and submitting that the corporation or the company consists of its members and what is adversely affected is their fundamental right, was rejected by the Court. The Constitution Bench held that the fundamental right to form an association cannot be coupled with the fundamental right to carry on any trade or business. As soon as citizens form a company, the right guaranteed to them by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_314\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> has been exercised and no restraint has been placed on that right and no infringement of that right is made. Ones a company or a corporation is formed, the business which is carried of by the said company or corporation is the business of the company or corporation, and is not the business of the citizens who get the company or corporation formed or incorporated, and the rights of the incorporated body must be judged on that footing alone and cannot be judged on the assumption that they are the rights attributable to the business of individual citizens. In our opinion, the same principle as has been applied to companies and corporations would apply to a society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_315\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a>.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">31. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_316\">Azeez Basha v.

The statutory provision impugned therein was one which provided for merger, amalgamation or liquidation of co-operative societies. The non-viable societies could be merged or amalgamated with the viable societies. It was urged that the forcible dumping of the members of the non-viable societies where such societies are merged with viable societies, violates the rights of the members of the viable societies, it was submitted that a viable society is one voluntarily formed by the members of that society and it is for them to decide whether they would admit other members of non-viable societies or not. The members of a non-viable society cannot be forced upon them against their will. It was also submitted that when a non-viable society is merged with a viable society, the share value in a viable society would drop down and this would adversely affect their fundamental rights under Sub-clauses (f) and (g) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_322\">Article 31</a> of the Constitution. The Full Bench rejected the argument as one of absolutely no merit and held that merger does not affect the right to form an association. The effect of merger is regulating the business activity of the society and not the right of the members to form an association. The merger or liquidation is a reasonable restriction imposed on the business activity of the co-operative society by regulating its trade or business activity which would be protected by Clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_323\">Article 19.</a> The High Court drew a distinction between the right of a person to form an association and the right of such association to carry a business activity.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">\tIn the  case of Dharam Dutt (supra), it has been further laid down that if the right sought to be canvassed does not fall within the sweep of the fundamental rights but is a mere concomitant or adjunct or expansion or incidence of that right, then the validity thereof is not to be tested by reference to clauses (2) to (6)  and the test which it would be required to satisfy for its constitutional validity is one of  reasonableness, as propounded in the case of V.G.

If the right canvassed fails within the sweep and expanse of any of the sub-clauses of Clause (1), then the next question to be asked would be, whether the impugned law imposes a reasonable restriction falling with the scope of Clauses (2) to (6) respectively. However, if the right sought to be canvassed does not fail within the sweep of the fundamental rights but is a mere concomitant or adjunct or expansion or incidence of that right, then the validity thereof is not to be tested by reference to Clauses (2) to (6).

The society is still free to carry on its other activities. No membership of the old society has been dropped. No new member has been forced or thrust upon the society.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">The Apex Court in the case of Dharam Dutt (supra) on consideration of various decisions, has laid down that right to form associations or unions does not include within its ken as a fundamental right a right to form associations or unions for achieving a particular object or running a particular institution, the same being a concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of a fundamental right, but not the fundamental right itself. The associations or the unions of citizens cannot further  claim as a fundamental right that it must also be able to achieve the purpose for which it has come into existence so that any interference with such achievement by law shall be unconstitutional, unless the same could be justified under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 19(4)</a> as being a restriction imposed on the interest of public order of morality.  The right to form associations guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> does not imply the fulfillment of every object of an association as it would be contradictory to the scheme underlying the text and the frame of the several fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III and particularly by the scheme of the guarantees conferred by Sub-clauses (a) to (g) of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 19(iii).</a> While right to form an association is to be tested by reference to <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> and the validity of restriction thereon by reference to <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 19(4)</a>, once the individual citizens have formed an association and carry on some activity, the validity of legislation restricting the activities of the association shall have to be judged by reference to <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> read with 19(6). A restriction on the activities of the association is not a restriction on the activities of the individual citizens forming membership of the association. The right to form unions guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_331\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> does not carry with it a fundamental  right in the union so  formed to achieve every object for which it was formed with the legal consequence that any legislation not  falling within clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 19</a> which might in any way hamper the fulfillment of those objects, should be declared unconstitutional and void.

Mr. Palkhivala sought to draw a distinction between the right of a citizen to carry on trade or business which is contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_335\">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> from his right to form associations or unions contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_336\">Art. 19(1)(c).</a> He argued that <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_337\">Art. 19(1)(c)</a> enables the citizens to choose their instruments or agents for carrying on the business which it is their fundamental right to carry on. If citizens decide to set up a corporation or a company as their agent for the purpose of carrying on trade or business, that is a right which is guaranteed to them under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_338\">Art. 19(1)(c).</a> Basing himself on this distinction between the two rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_339\">Art. 19(1)(g)</a> and (c) respectively, Mr. Palkhivala somewhat ingeniously contended that we should not hesitate to lift the veil, because by looking at the substance of the matter, we would really be giving effect to the two fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_340\">Art. 19(1).</a> We are not impressed by this argument either. The fundamental right to form an association cannot in this manner be coupled with the fundamental right to carry on any trade or business. As has been held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1781810/\" id=\"a_341\">All India Bank Employees&#x27; Association v. National Industrial Tribunal and Others</a> : (1961)IILLJ385SC, the argument which is thus attractively presented before us overlooks the fact that <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_342\">Art. 19</a>, as contrasted with certain other articles like Arts. 26, 29 and 30, guarantees rights to the citizens as such, and associations cannot lay claim to the fundamental rights guaranteed by that Article solely on the basis of their being an aggregation of citizens, that is to say, the right of the citizens composing the body. The respective rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_343\">Art. 19(1)</a> cannot be combined as suggested by Mr. Palkhivala, but must be asserted each in its own way and within its own limits; the sweep of the several rights is no doubt wide, but the combination of any of those two rights would not justify a claim such as is made by Mr. Palkhivala in the present petitions. As soon as citizens form a company, the right guaranteed to them by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_344\">Art. 19(1)(c)</a> has been exercised and no restraint has been placed on that right and no infringement of that right is made. Once a company or a corporation is formed, the business which is carried on by the said company or corporation is the business of the company or corporation and is not the business of the citizens who get the company or corporation formed or incorporated, and the rights of the incorporated body must be judged on that footing and cannot be judged on the assumption that they are the rights attributable to the business of individual citizens. Therefore, we are satisfied that the argument based on the distinction between the two rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_345\">Art. 19(1)(c)</a> and (g) and the effect of their combination cannot take the petitioners&#x27; case very far when they seek to invoke the doctrine that the veil of the corporation should be lifted. That is why we have come to the conclusion that the petitions filed by the petitioners are incompetent under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_346\">Art. 32</a>, even though in each of these petitions one or two of the shareholders of the petitioning companies or corporation have joined.</span> \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">It is, therefore, clear that right to form association would not lead to a concomitant right to represent the State of Rajasthan in all the sporting events at the national and international level.

It is also urged that since the words &quot;associated with and admitted to any privileges&quot; or used in <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_351\">Section 5</a> of the Act, it would mean that Petitioners are compulsorily formed into an Association with the University. This contention however is countered by the Respondents who point out that the freedom of Association under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_352\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> implies Association between citizens while in the case of the Petitioners what is sought to be affected is an affiliation with the University which is a corporate body.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">32.

Writ Petition No. 91 of 1964, decided on 23-2-71. 45-1, that a compulsory affiliation by statute would interfere with the right of Association. This argument in our view is untenable because in that case Parliament passed a law under entry 63 of List II of Schedule VII to the Constitution under which a Hindi Sammelan was to be constituted which was to consist of the first members of the Hindi Sammelan registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_353\">Societies Registration Act</a> and all persons who become members thereof in accordance with the rules in that behalf. This statutory Sammelan was constituted as a body corporate the first members of which were to consist of persons who immediately before the appointed day were life members of the Society had been President&#x27;s of the Society or were awarded the Mangla Prasad Paritoshik by the Society. There were also other provisions by which the Hindi Sammelan Society, its Constitution as well as its property was affected. In those circumstances it was held that the Act in so far as it interferes with the composition of the Society in constituting the Sammelan violated the rights of the original members of the Society to form an Association guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_354\">Article 19(1)(c).</a> No such thing was intended or effected by <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 5</a> of the Act. At any rate the D.A.V. College Trust and Management Society is not being interfered with, by any attempt to form an Association with the University.

They are controlled by the statute and so, there can be no objection to statutory interference with their composition on the ground of contravention of the individual right to freedom to form association.  The Apex Court further held that once a person becomes a member of a Co-operative Society, he loses his individuality qua the Society and he has no independent rights except those given to him by the statute and the bye- laws. He must act and speak through the Society or rather, the Society alone can act and speak for him qua rights or duties of the Society as a body. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">The aforesaid view has also been approved in State of U.P.V/s C.O.D.

The stream cannot rise higher than the source. The Apex Court laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">Thus, it is settled law that no citizen has an fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_357\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> to become a member of a Co-operative Society. His right is governed by the provisions of the statute. So, the right to become or to continue being a member of the society is a statutory right. On fulfilment of the qualifications prescribed to become a member and for being a member of the society and on admission, he becomes a member. His being a member of the society is subject to the operation of the Act, rules and bye-laws applicable from time to time. A member of the Society has no independent right qua the Society and it is the society that is entitled to represent as the corporate aggregate.

Membership in a co-operative society only brings about a contractual relationship among the members forming it subject of course to the Act and the Rules. One becomes a member in a co-operative society either at the time of its formation or acquires membership in it on possessing the requisite qualification under the bye-laws of the society and on being accepted as a member. It is not as if one has a fundamental right to become a member of a co-operative society. But certainly, if the application of one for membership, who is otherwise qualified to be a member under the Act, Rules and the bye-laws of the society, is rejected unreasonably or for frivolous reasons, the person may be entitled to enforce his claim to become a member in an appropriate forum or court of law. This is the effect of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1885403/\" id=\"a_359\">Jain Merchants Co-operative Housing Society v. HUF of Manubhai</a> relied on by the High Court. The said decision does not lay down a proposition, nor can it lay down a proposition, that even a person who does not qualify to be a member in terms of the bye-laws of a society can enforce a right to become a member of that society. It is one thing to say that it is not desirable to restrict membership in a society based solely on religion or sex but it is quite different thing to say that any such voluntary approved bye-law containing such a restriction could be ignored or declared unconstitutional by an authority or a tribunal created under the Act itself.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"924801\" id=\"span_19\">Normally, the bye-laws of a society do not have the status of a statute and as held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/924801/\" id=\"a_360\">Co-operative Central Credit Bank Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, Hyderabad</a> (1969)IILLJ698SC bye-laws are only the rules which governs the internal management or administration of a society and they are of the nature of articles of association of a company incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_361\">Companies Act</a>. They may be binding between the persons affected by them but they do not have the force of a statute.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">22. The validity of a bye-law, that too an approved bye-law, has to be tested in the light of the provisions of the Act and the rules governing co-operative societies. In so testing, the search should be to see whether a particular bye-law violates the mandate of any of the provisions of the Act or runs counter to any of its provisions or to any of the rules. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 24(1)</a> of the Act only provides for open membership subject to a person, aspiring to be a member, possessing the qualification prescribed by the bye-laws. It is not an open membership dehors the qualification prescribed by the bye-laws. When in Daman Singh this Court held that when a co-operative society is governed by the appropriate legislation it will be subject to the intervention made by the concerned legislation, it only meant that a legislative provision in the Act can be introduced for the purpose of eliminating a qualification for membership based on sex, religion or a persuasion or mode of life. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"398541\" id=\"span_20\">But so long as there is no legislative intervention of that nature, it is not open to the court to coin a theory that a particular bye-law is not desirable and would be opposed to public policy as indicated by the Constitution. The Constitution no doubt provides that in any State action there shall be no discrimination based either on religion or on sex. But Part III of the Constitution has not interfered with the right of a citizen to enter into a contract for his own benefit and at the same time incurring a certain liability arising out of the contract. As observed by the High Court of Bombay in <a href=\"/doc/398541/\" id=\"a_363\">Karvanagar Sahakari Griha Rachana Sanstha Maryadit and Ors. v. State</a>  : AIR1989Bom392 the members have joined the society in accordance with the bye-laws and the members join a housing society by ascertaining what would be the environment in which they will reside. It is not permissible for the State Government to compel the society to amend its bye-laws as it would defeat the object of formation of the society. In that case, the society was constituted with the object of providing peaceful accommodation to its members. Though there may be circumstances justifying the State taking steps to meet shortage of accommodation, it was not open to the State Government to issue a direction to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies to direct a co- operative society to make requisite amendments to their bye-laws and grant permission to its members to raise multistoried constructions.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"925036\" id=\"span_21\">In appeal from that decision reported as <a href=\"/doc/925036/\" id=\"a_364\">State of Maharashtra and Ors. v. Karvanagar Sahakari Griya Rachana Sanstha Maryadit and Ors.</a> : 2000 (9) SCC 295 this Court while dismissing the appeal stated that it was clear that though a power was conferred on the Registrar to direct amendment of the bye-laws of a society, yet the paramount consideration is the interest of the society. So also, the power of the State Government to issue directions in public interest, could not be exercised so as to be prejudicial to the interest of the society. In the view of this Court, what was in the interest of the society was primarily for the society alone to decide and it was not for an outside agency to say. Where, however, the government or the Registrar exercised statutory powers to issue directions to amend the bye-laws, such directions should satisfy the requirement of the interest of the society. This makes it clear that the interest of the society is paramount and that interest would prevail so long as there is nothing in the Act or the Rules prohibiting the promotion of such interest.</span> Going by Chheoki Employees&#x27; Cooperative Society Ltd.,&#x27;s case, neither the member, respondent No. 2, nor the aspirant to membership, respondent No. 3 had the competence to challenge the validity of the bye-laws of the Society or to claim a right to membership in the Society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">36. The above conclusion would lead us to the question whether there is anything in <a href=\"/doc/158641032/\" id=\"a_365\">The Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act</a> and the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Rules restricting the rights of the citizens to form a voluntary association and get it registered under <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_366\">The Co-operative Societies Act</a> confining its membership to a particular set of people recognized by their profession, their sex, their work or the position they hold or with reference to their beliefs, either religious or otherwise. It is not contended that there is any provision in the <a href=\"/doc/158641032/\" id=\"a_367\">Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act</a> prohibiting the registration of such a co-operative society. We have already referred to the history of the legislation and the concept of confinement of membership based on residence, belief or community. The concept of open membership, as envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_368\">Section 24</a> of the Act is not absolute on the very wording of that Section. The availability of membership is subject to the qualification prescribed under the provisions of the Act, the Rules and the bye-laws of such society. In other words, if the relevant bye-law of a society places any restriction on a person getting admitted to a co-operative society, that bye-law would be operative against him and no person, or aspiring member, can be heard to say that he will not be bound by that law which prescribes a qualification for his membership.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">\tThe Apex Court in State of Gujarat V/s Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kasab Jamat and ors.

The provision as to which should be representative union of workers was upheld. The Apex Court held thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">It is argued that the right of the appellants to freedom of speech and expression and to form associations or unions under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_373\">article 19(I) (a)</a> and (c), read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_374\">article 14</a>, conferring the right of equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws is infringed by the Act, inasmuch as it gives preference to a trade union upon the artificial test of having the greater percentage of membership, namely, not less than 15per cent. We see little merit in this contention. It is obvious that the Act imposes no restriction either upon the freedom of speech and expression of the textile workers or their right to form associations or unions indeed it is not denied that the workers have already formed as many as three unions, though they do not exhaust the number of workers in Bombay, for it leaves as many as 65 per cent. of workers unorganized who do not belong to any trade union. The statute lays down the minimum qualification of 15 per cent of membership to enable the Union to be called a &quot;representative union&quot; so as to represent the interests of the entire body of workers in their relations with the employers. After laying down the test of not less than 15 per cent. it was perfectly reasonable not to allow any other union such as the appellants to interpose in a dispute on behalf of the textile workers when they did not command the minimum percentage or when their membership fell below the prescribed percentage. It is perfectly open to the appellants to enlist that percentage or even a higher one and claim precedence over the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh so as to be able to represent the interests of all the workers. The right to freedom of speech and expression is not denied to the appellants, nor are they prohibited from forming associations or unions. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_375\">The Act</a> makes no discrimination between textile workers as a class but lays down a reasonable&#x27; classification to the effect that a certain percentage of membership possessed by a union will be allowed to represent the workers as a class to the exclusion of others, but there is nothing  to prevent the other unions or other workers from forming a fresh union and enrolling a higher percent-age so as to acquire the sole right of representation. The appellants challenge the validity of the Act as infringing their fundamental rights and yet they base their case of discrimination on the provisions of the same Act. This position is not in accord with reason or principle.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">\tWhen we consider on anvil of aforesaid decision the provisions of the Act of 2005, the State can lay down which body should be representative body to represent State/District in the games at National/International/State/District level and lay down parameters for the same.

The contentions were not accepted by the Apex Court. It was held that  application for the recognition of the association for the purpose of functioning under the enactment is a voluntary act on the part of the association and if the statute imposes conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued, it is  little difficult to see how the freedom to form the association is affected nor it could be contended that there is a right in the association guaranteed by the constitution to obtain recognition. Restrictions which are impugned as unconstitutional are imposed only on recognized associations. Parliament could well have chosen to affect the regulation directly through an official agency instead of through the  medium of a voluntary association. In such an event, neither the trades nor their associations could complain of any violation of law.   The Apex Court laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">10. Briefly stated, the argument regarding these provisions infringing the freedom to &quot;form associations&quot; was as follows : The Constitution guarantees to every citizen the right to form an association. The only limitation which might legally be imposed on this right to form an association is that set out in clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_381\">Article 19</a>, viz., bye-laws which place restrictions based on public order or morality. Where the object of the association is lawful, the citizen, through that association, and the association itself are entitled, by virtue of the guaranteed right, to freedom from legislative interference in the achievement of its object except on grounds germane to public order or morality. In other words, the freedom guaranteed should be read as extending not merely to the formation of the association as such, but to the effective functioning of the association so as to enable it to achieve its lawful objects. Unless sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_382\">Article 19</a> were so read the freedom guaranteed would be illusory and the Court should, in construing a freedom guaranteed to the citizen, so read it, as to give him an effective right which could be used for the purpose for which the Constitution-framers intended. The further submission, which was in the nature of a corollary from the above was that the freedom guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_383\">Article 19</a> carried with it a right in the association to determine its internal arrangements in the matter of selecting the personnel who shall manage it, the framing of the bye-laws and regulations which shall govern the relationship between the association and its members as also between it members without any interference by the State unless the law providing for such interference were grounded on morality or public order. In effect the submission was that the right guaranteed under sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_384\">Article 19</a> was not merely, as its text would indicate, the right to form an association but would include the functioning of the association without any restraints not dictated by the need for preserving order or the interests of morality. On these premises it was urged that while the Constitution had guaranteed the freedom to form an association - including inter alia one for fostering or regulating forward trading, still the Central Government had taken upon themselves the right to determine the rules and bye-laws under which the association could function and had, by the provisions in Ch. III of the Act, in every way interfered in the matter of internal management and it was urged that this was violative of the right guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_385\">Article 19</a> since the restrictions in Ch. III of the Act could not be held to have been dictated on grounds of public order or morality. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">11. We consider this argument is without force. In the first place, the restriction imposed by <a href=\"/doc/30111198/\" id=\"a_386\">section 6</a> of the Act is for the purpose of recognition and no association is compelled to apply to the Government for recognition under that Act. An application for the recognition of the association for the purpose of functioning under the enactment is a voluntary act on the part of the association and if the statute imposes conditions subject to which alone recognition could be accorded or continued, it is a little difficult to see how the freedom to form the association is affected unless, of course, that freedom implies or involves a guaranteed right to recognition also. Could it be contended that there is a right in the association guaranteed by the Constitution to obtain recognition ? It was not disputed before us that forward trading might sometimes assume undesirable forms and become akin to gambling which might have deleterious consequences on lawful trade and on the general public by causing violent fluctuations in prices. It would follow that the control of forward trading is a legitimate subject of legislative interference and regulation and we might add that this was not disputed before us. The manner in which this regulation is effected and the machinery employed for achieving it are matters of legislative policy which could be determined only by taking into account the organisation of the market, the manner of trading and other relevant factors. The impugned enactment in its Ch. III proceeds on the basis that organisations of tradesmen might be entrusted with the task of regulating these transactions, so that while legitimate trade would be furthered, the evil consequences of undesirable speculation might be avoided. It was, therefore, necessary that the instrument chosen should be subject to control so as effectively to further the policy of the scheme of regulation and that is the ratio underlying the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/30111198/\" id=\"a_387\">section 6</a> of the Act and those which follow it in Ch. III. In this connection it is necessary to add that the restrictions which are impugned as unconstitutional are imposed only on &quot;recognised&quot; associations, Parliament could well have chosen to effect the regulation directly through an official agency instead of through the medium of a voluntary association. In such an event, neither the traders nor their associations could complain of any violation of the law. The mere fact therefore that Parliament chose to utilise the machinery of voluntary trades associations for the purpose of enforcing regulatory control could not invalidate the provision of laws which are designed to ensure effective control over the mechanism of forward trading. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">13. We have no hesitation in rejecting the argument that the provisions in Ch. III of the impugned Act, and in particular those which we have set out above, infringe, in any manner, the freedom guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_388\">Article 19.</a> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">14. The next provision of the Act whose validity was challenged was <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_389\">section 15</a> but before stating the grounds upon which this challenge was made it would be convenient to dispose of a contention raised by Mr. Chatterjee -learned Counsel for the petitioners in Writ Petitions 24 and 25 turning on the construction of the section. His submission was that <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_390\">section 15</a> proceeded on the basis of there being &quot;a recognised association&quot; through which trading in the notified commodity could be conducted before the ban under <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_391\">section 15(1)</a> could be imposed. The argument was based upon the words &quot;otherwise than between members of a recognised association or through or with any such member&quot; occurring towards the last portion of <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_392\">section 15(1)</a>. It was urged that under the scheme of the Act the Central Government had first to recognise an association of traders in the commodity, forward trading in which was to be regulated, and that it was only after the recognition of such an association under <a href=\"/doc/30111198/\" id=\"a_393\">section 6</a> that they could under <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_394\">section 15(1)</a> prohibit trading otherwise than through such an association or its members. It was pointed out that the expert committee on gur had itself indicated that such a procedure should be followed and that in the case of certain other commodities like pepper and castor seed which were notified under <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_395\">section 15</a> the recognition of associations through which forward trading was permitted to be conducted either preceded or was simultaneous with the notification. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">\tOn the basis of the aforesaid decision, the Act of 2005 cannot be said to be ultra vires; the application for recognition is voluntary act as per option available under the Act of 2005 and only thereafter, recognition of Association is subject to  the regulations envisaged under the Act of 2005. None of the rights of the Association including right to form association has been taken away  by providing measures. In any view of the matter, measures do not infringe the right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_396\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution; there is no applicability of <a href=\"/doc/93281559/\" id=\"a_397\">Section 19(4)</a> as the measures are not restrictive, but they are regulatory one.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">XIV- Non-applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_398\">Article 19(4)</a> to concomitant right:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1781810\" id=\"span_22\">In  All India  Bank Employees Association V/s <a href=\"/doc/1781810/\" id=\"a_399\">National Industries Tribunal</a> (supra), the Apex Court has held that it is one thing to interpret each of the freedoms guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III in a fair and liberal sense, it is quite another to read each guaranteed right as involving or including concomitant rights necessary to achieve the object which might be supposed to under lie the grant of each of the rights, for that construction would, by a series of ever expanding concentric circles in the shape of rights concomitant to concomitant rights and so on, lead to an  almost grotesque result.   The Apex Court laid down thus:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">20. We consider it unnecessary to multiply examples to further illustrate the point. Applying what we have stated earlier to the case of a labour union the position would be this : while the right to form an union is guaranteed by sub-clause (c), the right of the members of the association to meet would be guaranteed by sub-clause (b), their right to move from place to place within India by sub-clause (d), their right to discuss their problems and to propagate their views by sub-clause (a), their right to hold property would be that guaranteed by sub-clause (f) and so on each of these freedoms being subject to such restrictions as might properly be imposed by clauses (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_400\">Article 19</a> as might be appropriate in the context. It is one thing to interpret each of the freedoms guaranteed by the several Articles in Part III in a fair and liberal sense, it is quite another to read each guaranteed right as involving or including concomitant rights necessary to achieve the object which might be supposed to under lie the grant of each of those rights, for that construction would, by a series of ever expanding concentric circles in the shape of rights concomitant to concomitant rights and so on, lead to an almost grotesque result.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1781810\" id=\"span_23\">22. Besides the qualification subject to which the right under sub-clause (c) is guaranteed, viz., the contents of clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_401\">Article 19</a> throw considerable light upon the scope of the freedom, for the significance and contents of the grants of the Constitution are best understood and read in the light of the restrictions imposed. If the right guaranteed included not merely that which would flow on a literal reading of the Article, but every right which is necessary in order that the association brought into existence fulfils every object for which it is formed, the qualifications therefore would be not merely those in clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_402\">Article 19</a>, but would be more numerous and very different, restrictions which bore upon and took into account the several fields in which associations or unions of citizens might legitimately engage themselves. Merely by way of illustration we might point out that learned Counsel admitted that though the freedom guaranteed to workmen to form labour unions carried with it the concomitant right to collective bargaining together with the right to strike, still the provision in the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_403\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> forbidding strikes in the protected industries as well as in the event of a reference of the dispute to adjudication under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_404\">section 10</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act was conceded to be a reasonable restriction on the right guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_405\">Article 19.</a> It would be seen that if the right to strike were by implication a right guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_406\">Article 19</a>, then the restriction on that right in the interests of the general public, viz., of national economy while perfectly legitimate if tested by the criteria in clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_407\">Article 19</a>, might not be capable of being sustained as a reasonable restriction imposed for reasons of morality or public order. On the construction of the Article, therefore, apart from the authorities to which we shall refer presently, we have reached the conclusion that even a very liberal interpretation of sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_408\">Article 19</a> cannot lead to the conclusion that the trade unions have a guaranteed right to an effective collective bargaining or to strike, either as part of collective bargaining or otherwise. The right to strike or the right to declare a lock-out may be controlled or restricted by appropriate industrial legislation, and the validity of such legislation would have to be tested not with reference to the criteria <a href=\"/doc/1781810/\" id=\"a_409\">laid down in</a> clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_410\">Article 19</a> but by totally different considerations.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">28. Learned Counsel also referred us two other decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the right of employees to self-organization, to form, join and assist labour organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choice and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid has been referred to as &quot;a fundamental right&quot; (vide National Labour Ralations Board v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation and ors., 81 Law. Ed. 893 and Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Company of New York) (84 Law. Ed. 738, 741). We do not consider the inference sought to be drawn well-founded. What the learned Judges of the Supreme Court were referring to as a fundamental right was not with reference to a fundamental right as recognized or guaranteed by the Constitution, but in the sense of a right of the unions which enacted law recognized or respected, and as other decisions of the United States&#x27; Supreme Court show, was subject to regulation by the legislature (Vide Weaver Constitutional Law and its Administration (1946) p. 505, referring to Dorchy v. Kansas 272 U. S. 306 : 71 L. Ed. 248 &quot;Neither the common law nor the 14th Amendment confers the absolute right to strike.&quot;). We have, therefore, reached the conclusion that the right guaranteed by sub-clause (c) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_411\">Article 19</a> does not carry with it a concomitant right that the unions formed for protecting the interests of labour shall achieve the purpose for which they were brought into existence, such that any interference, to such achievement by the law of the land would be unconstitutional unless the same could be justified as in the interests of public order or morality.

Once a company or a corporation is formed, the business which is carried on by the said company or corporation is the business of the company or corporation, and is not the business of the citizens who get the company or corporation formed or incorporated, and the rights of the incorporated body must be judged on that footing alone and cannot be judged on the assumption that they are the rights attributable to the business of the individual citizen.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">28.\tIn view of the above, it becomes evident that the right of citizens to form an association is different from running the business by that association. Therefore, the right of individuals to form a society has to be understood in a completely different context. Once a cooperative society is formed and registered, for the reason that cooperative society itself is a creature of statute, the rights of the society and that of its members stand abridged by the provisions of the Act.

The constitutional right to freely associate with others encompasses associational ties designed to further the social, legal and economic benefits of the members of the association.

The significant encroachment upon associational freedom cannot be justified on the basis of any interest of the Government.

Legislature passed an Act known as the <a href=\"/doc/1649399/\" id=\"a_440\">U.P. Hindi Sahitya Sammelan Act</a> No. 36 of 1956 and that Act was declared void by the Allahabad High Court on the ground that the said Act had made the original Sammelan cease to exist and had provided for the Constitution of a new Sammelan under its terms in which the members of the original Sammelan had no say, so that that Act infringed the right of the members of the original Sammelan of forming an association guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_441\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution. It was further held that that Act was not saved under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_442\">Article 19(4)</a> of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_443\">Under the Act</a>, Governing Body was to be constituted; one member to represent Central Government dealing with education; one member to represent the Central Government dealing with finance; not more than three members from amongst the former presidents of the society and the remaining members were to be nominated by the Central Government.  The Apex Court  held that there was direct interference with the right to form association; there was induction of members without consent of the pre-existing members; the Society may not have liked to admit such members in their Society;  the number of such new members could even be so large as to leave the original members in a small minority with the result that those members could become totally ineffective in the society;  Sammelan, which has come into existence under the Act, is not identical with the Sammelan which was registered as a Society under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_444\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a>. The Apex Court  further laid down that after association has been formed and the right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_445\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> has been exercised by the members  forming it, they have no right to claim that its activities must also be permitted to be carried on in the manner they desire.  <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_446\">The Act</a> does not merely regulate the administration of the affairs of the society, what it does is to alter the composition of the society itself. Any law by which members are introduced in the voluntary association without any option being given to the members to keep them out or any law which takes away the membership of those, who have voluntarily joined it, will have a law violating the right to form an association. \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">\tThe Apex Court in Smt.Damyanti Naranga V/s The Union of India and the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan  V/s Jagdish Swarup (supra) has laid down thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">6. It was argued that the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_447\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> is only to form an association and, consequently, any regulation of the affairs of the Association, after it has been formed, will not amount to a breach of that right. It is true that it has been held by this Court that, after an Association has been formed and the right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_448\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> has been exercised by the members forming it, they have no right to claim that its activities must also be permitted to be carried on in the manner they desire. Those cases are, however, inapplicable to the present case. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_449\">The Act</a> does not merely regulate the administration of the affairs of the Society, what it does is to alter the composition of the Society itself as we have indicated above. The result of this change in composition is that the members, who voluntarily formed the Association, are now compelled to act in that Association with; other members who have been imposed as members by the Act; and in whose admission to membership they had no say. Such alteration in the composition of the Association itself clearly interferes with the right to continue to function as members of the Association which was voluntarily formed by the, original founders. The right to form an association, in our opinion, necessarily implies that the persons forming the Association have also the right to continue to be associated with only those whom they voluntarily admit in the Association. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1681994\" id=\"span_29\">Any law, by which members are introduced in the voluntary Association without any option being given to the members to keep them out, or any law which takes away the membership of those who have voluntarily joined it, will be a law violating the right to form an association. If we were to accept the submission that the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_450\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> is confined to the initial stage of forming an Association and does not protect the right to continue the Association with the membership either chosen by the founders or regulated by rules made by the Association itself, the right would be meaningless because, as soon as an Association is formed, a law may be passed interfering with its composition, so that the Association formed may not be able to function at all. The right can be effective only if it is held to include within it the right to continue the Association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the Association. This aspect was recognised by this Court though not in plain words, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_451\">O.K. Ghosh and Anr. v. E.X. Joseph</a> [1963] Su 3 S.C.R. 789. The Court<a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_452\">, <a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_453\">in that case</a></a>, was considering the validity of Rule 4(B) of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955, which laid down that:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">No Government servant shall join or continue to be a member of any Service Association of Government servants:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">(a) which has not, within a period of six months from its formation, obtained the recognition of the Government under the Rules prescribed in that behalf; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">(b) recognition in respect of which has been refused or withdrawn by the Government under the said Rules.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">This Court held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">It is not disputed that the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_454\">Article 19</a> can be claimed by Government servants. <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_455\">Article 33</a> which confers power on the Parliament to modify the rights in their application to the Armed Forces, clearly brings out the fact that all citizens, including Government servants, are entitled to claim the rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_456\">Article 19.</a> Thus, the validity of the impugned rule has to be judged on the basis that the respondent and his co-employees are entitled to form Associations or Unions. It is clear that Rule 4-B imposes a restriction on this right. It virtually compels a Government servant to withdraw his membership of the Service Association of Government Servants as soon as recognition accorded to the said Association is withdrawn or if, after the Association is formed, no recognition is accorded to it within six months. In other words, the right to form an Association is conditioned by the existence of the recognition of the said Association by the Government. If the Association obtains the recognition and continues to enjoy it, Government servants can become members of the said Association; if the Association does not secure recognition from the Government or recognition granted to it is withdrawn, Government servants must cease to be the members of the said Association. That is the plain effect of the impugned rule.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1681994\" id=\"span_30\">7.\tThe Court in the above passage, thus, accepted the principle that the Government servants, who may have formed an Association, could not be compelled to resign from it by imposition of a condition of recognition of this Association by the Government and that if the Government servants are required to cease to be members that would be a violation of the right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_457\">Article 19(1)(c).</a> The Court, of course<a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_458\">, <a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_459\">in that case</a></a>, further proceeded to examine whether such a restriction on the right could be justified under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_460\">Article 19(4)</a> or not. That case, thus, supports our view that the right to form an Association includes the right to its continuance and any law altering the composition of the Association compulsorily will be a breach of the right to form the Association.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">\tWhen we apply the ratio of the aforesaid case to the present case, it is apparent that the decision is against the submissions raised by the petitioner with respect to questioning the validity of the Act of 2005 as the Apex Court has emphasized about the option; it is option exercised to have membership of various districts to represent at District or State level; once option is exercised to obtain the benefit under the Act of 2005, it cannot be said that there is violation of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_461\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution; after exercising option with open eyes and  obtaining benefit under the provisions of the Act of 2005,  such Association is bound to comply with the terms and conditions under the Act of 2005 and  it is not open to turn around and say that provisions of the Act of 2005 are invalid or ultra vires, after availing benefits and advantages under the Act of 2005. The Rajasthan Cricket Association has opted for registration and recognition under the Act of 2005 and the petitioner has fought election under the provisions of the Act of 2005 and even represented the District Sports Association and thus availed the benefits under the  provisions of the Act of 2005. The Apex Court in the aforesaid decision has also reiterated that after association has been formed and right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_462\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> has been exercised by the members forming it, they have no right to claim that its activities must also be permitted to be carried on in the manner they desire. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\tIn  Asom Rashtra Bhasha Prachar Samit and anr.V/s State of Assamand ors.   (1989(4) SCC 456), the Apex Court has laid down while considering the provisions of the Assam Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti (Taking Over Management and Control) Act, 1984 that the Government has taken the power under <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_463\">section 3</a> to appoint a Board and the Government  can appoint any one not connected with the society at all to be in the Board; it is left to the discretion of the Government to appoint the whole of the Board which will take place of not only the Managing Committee i.e. the Karyapalika but also the place of Byabasthapika Sabha which normally used to be an elected body.  The Apex Court held that in the case virtually right of association has been taken away; right  guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_464\">Article 19(1</a>(c) is not confined to  forming of association, it protects its composition also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\tThere is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition.

Under the second test, the Constitution Bench, called upon to deal with the legislation impugned before it by reference to <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_470\">Articles 19(1)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_471\">19(4)</a> of the Constitution, held the impugned legislation to be unconstitutional and void because it curtailed the fundamental right to form associations or unions and fell outside the limits of authorized restrictions under Clause (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_472\">Article 19.</a></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">\tWhen we examine the Act of 2005 on the touchstone of the aforesaid test,  considering the nature of right to carry on sports activities, it is open to the Government to  impose riders while registering or recognizing the association/society under the Act of 2005; even there are several riders under the Act of 1958 under which the Society has been registered; similarly when any Society/Body wanted to attain the status and register under the Act of 2005, it is bound by the conditions and it cannot be said that there is violation of the right to form association; under the Act of 2005, the Government has not interfered with the membership or independence of functioning of the Sports Association etc. but  made provisions to promote sports activities at State, District and lower level and to ensure equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and international levels so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports;  there is no restriction imposed; provisions are regulatory; the Act of 2005 seeks to  create a facilitating democratic structure  which would encourage development of sports person, health to promote sports and to develop talent to compete at national and international level; it helps the Sports Associations to nurture, develop and prepare young talent for national or international competitions  for winning laurels and medals for Rajasthan; it  confers right on the Sports Association to represent Rajasthan and meet the aspirations of the public, discourage nepotism, create a deeper and wider network for selection process, develop and scientific procedure for identifying and promoting natural sports persons. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">\tWhen registration is sought certain regulatory mechanism is provided under every such Act. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_473\">The Act</a> of 1958, under which the RCA and other Societies were registered,  also provide for terms and conditions to be followed by the Societies registered under the Act of 1958 which was akin to the Act of 2005.  <a href=\"/doc/197932095/\" id=\"a_474\">Section 1B</a> deals with societies formed by memorandum of association and registration; <a href=\"/doc/188821970/\" id=\"a_475\">Section 2</a> mentions the contents of memorandum of association;  <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_476\">Section 3</a>  deals  with  registration\nand fee and provides that upon memorandum and certified copy being filed, the Registrar shall certify under his hand that  the Society is registered under the Act of 1958. <a href=\"/doc/159838110/\" id=\"a_477\">Section 4</a> provides for filing of annual list; <a href=\"/doc/181576953/\" id=\"a_478\">Section 4A</a> provides for filing of changes in governing body and rules; <a href=\"/doc/128826241/\" id=\"a_479\">Section 4B</a>  provides for penalty for non-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/159838110/\" id=\"a_480\">section 4</a> or 4A or for making a false entry; <a href=\"/doc/152623426/\" id=\"a_481\">Section 4C</a> provides for cognizance of offences under <a href=\"/doc/128826241/\" id=\"a_482\">section 4-B</a>. <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_483\">Section 5</a> deals with vesting of property of society; <a href=\"/doc/135444357/\" id=\"a_484\">Section 5A</a> provides for appointment of new trustees; <a href=\"/doc/74123386/\" id=\"a_485\">Section 9</a> provides for recovery of penalty accruing under bye-law; <a href=\"/doc/197369135/\" id=\"a_486\">Section 12</a> enables societies to alter, extent or abridge purposes or to amalgamate;  <a href=\"/doc/190844355/\" id=\"a_487\">Section 12A</a> deals with change of name of societies and 12C provides effect of change of name;  <a href=\"/doc/76747593/\" id=\"a_488\">Section 13</a> makes provision for dissolution of societies and adjustment of their affairs.

And ors. V/s <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_499\">Union of India</a> (supra) where the question arose whether the impugned enactment directly impinges on the guarantee of freedom of speech and expression, the Apex Court held that it directly impinges on the freedom either by placing restraint upon it or by placing restraint upon something which is an essential part of that freedom. The freedom of a newspaper to publish any number of pages or to circulated it to any number of persons is each an integral part of the freedom of speech and expression. A restraint placed upon either of them would be a direct infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression.  Since circulation of a newspaper is a part of the right of freedom of speech the Act must be regarded as one directed against the freedom of speech.  The Apex Court laid down thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">The only question that would then remain would be whether the impugned enactment directly impinges on the guarantee of freedom of speech and expression. It would directly impinge on this freedom either by placing restraint upon it or by placing restraint upon something which is an essential part of that freedom. The freedom of a newspaper to publish any number of pages or to circulated it to any number of persons is each an integral part of the freedom of speech and expression. A restraint placed upon either of them would be a direct infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression. Perhaps an illustration would make the point clear. Let us suppose that the enactment had said that newspaper &#x27;A&#x27; or newspaper &#x27;B&#x27; (ignoring for the moment the objection to the illustration based upon <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_500\">Article 14</a> shall not have more than a specified number of subscribers. Could such a law be valid in the face of the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_501\">Article 19(1)(a) ?</a> The answer must unhesitatingly be no, because such a law would be recognized as directly impinging upon the freedom of expression which encompasses freedom of circulation and to restrain the citizen from propagating his views to any other beyond the limit or number prescribed by the statute. If this were so, the fact that the legislation achieves the same result by means of the schedule of rates makes no difference and the impact on the freedom would still be direct notwithstanding that it does not appear so on its face.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">Its object thus is to regulate something which, as already stated, is directly related to the circulation of a newspaper. Since circulation of a newspaper is a part of the right of freedom of speech the Act must be regarded as one directed against the freedom of speech. It has selected the fact or thing which is an essential and basic attribute of the conception of the freedom of speech viz., the right to circulate one&#x27;s views to all whom one can reach or care to reach for the imposition of a restriction. It seeks to achieve its object of enabling what are termed the smaller newspapers to secure larger circulation by provisions which without disguise are aimed at restricting the circulation of what are termed the larger papers with better financial strength. The impugned law far from being one, which merely interferes with the right of freedom of speech incidentally, does so directly though it seeks to achieve the and by purporting to regulate the business aspect of a newspaper. Such a course is not permissible and the courts must be ever vigilant in guarding perhaps the most precious of all the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1933483\" id=\"span_34\">The legitimacy of the result intended to be achieved does not necessarily imply that every means to achieve it is permissible; for even if the end is desirable and permissible, the means employed must not transgress the limits <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_502\">laid down by</a> the Constitution, if they directly impinge on any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution it is no answer when the constitutionality of the measure is challenged the apart from the fundamental right infringed the provision is otherwise legal.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">Finally it was said that one of its objects is to give some kind of protection to small or newly started newspapers and, therefore, the Act is good. Such an object may be desirable but for attaining it the State cannot make inroads on the right of other newspapers which <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_503\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> guarantees to them. There may be other ways of help in them and it is for the State to search for them but the one they have chosen falls foul of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">In L.I.C. V/s Professor Manubhai D.Shah ((1992) 3 SCC 637) relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, the Apex Court observed that  constitutional provision is never static, it   is   ever evolving and ever changing and there-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">fore, does not admit of a narrow, pedantic or syllogistic approach.  The Apex Court referred to the decision in Dennis V/s United States (341 US 494: 951 Ed 1137 (1951) wherein justice Frankfurter observed that American Supreme Court has always placed a broad interpretation on the constitutional provision for the obvious reason that the constitution has to serve the needs of an ever changing society. The same trend is discernible from the decisions of the Indian Courts also. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">When we apply the ratio of the aforesaid decisions, we find that the provisions of the Act of 2005 cannot be said to be ultra vires the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1933483\" id=\"span_35\">In M.Nagaraj V/s <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_504\">Union of India</a> (supra), it has been observed by the Apex Court that the Constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that constitutional provision does not get fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">When we apply the aforesaid ratio to the present case,  the Act of 2005 precisely takes care of all emerging associations in the field of sports; it encourages and promotes sports and games activities; it creates facilitating democratic structure and ensures that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels; it takes care of changing situations and keep flexibility as envisaged in the aforesaid decisions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"938664\" id=\"span_36\">In I.R.

The decision in State of Madras V/s <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_507\">V.G.Row</a> (supra) has also been taken into consideration and the principle of proportionality  has been applied while dealing with the validity of legislation infringing fundamental freedoms enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_508\">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution.

The prohibition  of the use of the description Rajasthan or the use of the name of a District as provided by <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_513\">Section 25(2)</a> of the Act of 2005 cannot be said to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_514\">Article 19(1)(g);</a> it cannot be said that there is no rational relationship  between the objects stated in the preamble of the Act of 2005 and the prohibition  of the use of Rajasthan and the name of district by Sports Association. Prohibition has been rightly carved out as there were several Sports Bodies, which   were either not registered or registered under the Act of 1958 which does not provide for effective regulatory mechanism and large number of associations were using the expression Rajasthan and were holding out to be representing Rajasthan, its Districts or a part of Rajasthan without factually acting in representative capacity and  with a view to  meet the aspirations of the public, discourage nepotism, create deeper and wider network for selection process, develop a scientific procedure for identifying and promoting natural sports persons, the Act of 2005 has been enacted. Thus, prohibition of the use of the expression Rajasthan or name of District as provided under section 25(2) cannot be said to be disproportionate or excessive to the professed aims and objects of the Act of 2005. Hence, the decisions in Chintaman Rao V/s State of MP (1956 SCR 579-764), State of Madras V/s <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_515\">V.G.Row</a> (supra), Om Kumar V/s <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_516\">Union of India</a> (supra) and Teri Oat Estates V/s <a href=\"/doc/1933483/\" id=\"a_517\">Union Territory Chandigarh</a> (supra) are of no help to the petitioner.</span></span></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_252\">Similarly, for  the reasons mentioned above, Rule 3 of the Rules of 2004 which provided for naming of Sports Association, could not be said to be illegal or arbitrary or disproportionate to the aims and objects of the Ordinance of 2004 replaced by the Act of 2005.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\"><a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_518\">Section 24</a> of the Act of 2005 empowers the Registrar to appoint an Ad hoc Executive Committee and cause to hold fresh elections of the Executive Body  and in case of misappropriation of funds, take action in accordance with law, and sub-section (2) of Section 24 provides that no existing Office Bearer of a Sports Association which is disqualified under sub-section (1) shall be permitted to contest elections of any Sports Association for a period of six years from the date of such disqualification.  Before taking above action, the Registrar is required to hold enquiry and also to afford opportunity of being heard to the affected Sports Association.  Such provision thus cannot in any manner be regarded as illegal or arbitrary. It does not violate any of the right of the Association. As per  Rule 9 of the Rules of 2004 framed at the relevant time when the consequences fell, adhoc executive committee was to be constituted from amongst those persons who were found eligible to be elected to executive body of the association, subject to the provisions of Section 24(2) of the Ordinance of 2004.  It is apparent from Rule 9 of the said Rules of 2004 that the Government had not taken upon itself power even to have person of its own choice while constituting adhoc executive committee for a short duration for interregnum period as envisaged under section 24 of the Ordinance of 2004. Even after the replacement of the said Ordinance of 2004 by the Act of 2005, there is no interference by the State in the functioning of the registered association. Submission to the contrary that State has usurped the power, is not tenable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">XVII- Sectionwise consideration of provisions of the Act of 2005:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_255\">It was submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that the provisions of the Act affect the composition of association. In our opinion, the provision of <a href=\"/doc/74123386/\" id=\"a_519\">Section 9(2)</a> of the Act of 2005, which provides that Primary Sports Body shall be member of the  concerned District Level Sports Association, cannot be said to be restrictive, rather it is regulatory measure and the same is condition of recognition and registration, and it cannot be regarded as arbitrary or unreasonable or violative of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_520\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution. When option is exercised to avail the benefit under the Act of 2005, such Sports Association  is bound by the structure and regulations under the Act of 2005. There is no interference of the State with membership or the independence of functioning of the Sports Association. By making the provision of <a href=\"/doc/74123386/\" id=\"a_521\">Section 9</a>, the petitioners autonomy remains even after registration and recognition under the Act of 2005. It is not the question of having no choice; on option being exercised to avail the benefits under the Act of 2005,  there is no violation of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_522\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> and such body is bound to comply with the terms and conditions under the Act of 2005, which are of regulatory nature; the Act of 2005 takes care of the emerging associations in the sports activities and ensures operation of bodies in a representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports; it does not in any manner infringe the rights of the Association including under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_523\">Article 19(1)(c).</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_256\"> The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/35352406/\" id=\"a_524\">Sections 10</a> providing minimum requirement of constituting a sports Association and <a href=\"/doc/125894599/\" id=\"a_525\">Section 11</a> providing composition of the Executive Body also cannot be said to be infringing the right to form association for the reasons mentioned above.  The conditions are reasonable and regulatory and applicable only on exercise of option to seek registration and recognition to avail the benefits under the Act of 2005. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_257\">The right to  continue the association cannot also be said to have been infringed by virtue of Section 27, which provides cessation of registration under the Act of 1958 on exercise of option for registration and recognition under <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_526\">section 26</a> of the Act of 2005. It is only the  registration under the Act of 1958 ceases to exist from the date of registration and recognition under the Act of 2005; there is no cessation of the association.  The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_527\">Sections 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_528\">27</a> of the Act of 2005 are transitory and are applicable to the Associations existing of the date of commencement of the Act of 2005. The provisions cannot be said to be interfering with the right to continue the association under the Act of 1958. By not exercising option,  it was open to the Association/Society to continue in existence by merely barring the use of the name of Rajasthan or in the case of District Level Association, the name of District as provided in <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 25</a> of the Act of 2005. The right to continue the Association is not interfered with by the Act of 2005. Mere barring of the use of name of Rajasthan or concerned District cannot be said to be taking away of right to form the association;  even name of the Association cannot be said to be the substance of the right envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_530\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">The submission attacking the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_531\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_532\">5</a> and 26 is also liable to be rejected for the reasons mentioned above. <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_533\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_534\">5</a> cannot prevail over section 26 as Section 26 has to prevail which makes the registration optional and contains a non-obstante clause over the other provisions and would prevail over other provisions contained in the Act of 2005. <a href=\"/doc/96916808/\" id=\"a_535\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/10406321/\" id=\"a_536\">5</a> have to be read in consonance with the spirit of Section 26. Sections are intended to apply where Association seeks to represent State of Rajasthan; right of representation  cannot be said to be a fundamental right as it is concomitant or concomitant to a concomitant of fundamental right; provisions cannot in any manner be said to be arbitrary or illegal; provisions are regulatory to ensure democratic function of the Association which opts for the benefit of the Act of 2005 to represent the State or   district concerned.  Merely because the  RCA was affiliated to BCCI, it does not impinge upon the validity of the Act of 2005; it is open to the legislature to enact the provisions and affiliation with the BCCI cannot be said to be a fundamental right; it is trite law that affiliation and  recognition are governed by the relevant statute under which they are  sought.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_259\">The submission attacking <a href=\"/doc/76747593/\" id=\"a_537\">sections 13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/189627210/\" id=\"a_538\">14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/116652300/\" id=\"a_539\">15</a> relating to election, voting right and eligibility for contesting elections is also wholly untenable for the reasons mentioned above; these provisions do not affect the right to form association or continue the association; there are wholesome provisions for election, voting right, eligibility for contesting elections, minimum requirement  of constituting Sports Association etc. and they are applicable when option is exercised for registration and recognition to avail benefits under the Act of 2005 and otherwise also they are not unreasonable nor they take away the right of the association under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_540\">Article 19(1)(c).</a>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1933483\" id=\"span_42\">In Azeez Basha and anr.

Bank V/s State of Maharashtra ((1993) Supp 3 SCC 259) it has been held that <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_548\">Section 145</a> of the Cooperative Societies Act laying down that an unrecognized society cannot use the word cooperative does not violate <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_549\">Article 19(1)(c).</a> Thus, provision contained in  <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_550\">Section 25</a> of the Act of 2005 inasmuch as it restricts use of the description  Rajasthan as well as name of district  with the name of the Association of the State Level or District Level, cannot be said to be violative of  <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_551\">Article 19(1)(c).</a> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_260\">In  State of UP V/s  COD Cheoki Employees Cooperative Society (supra), it has been held that there is no fundamental right to be a member of Cooperative Society being created by the statute. Law can provide for reservation in cooperative societies of weaker sections. \t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_261\">The Cooperative Societies exist in a particular set up provided by the Act. Similarly, there are several professional associations like BCI/DCI/MCI and they are created by statutes having right to recognize, lay down standards etc. for violation and also provide the management, discipline, control etc. of such bodies; under the guise of right to form association and further objectives under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_552\">Article 19(1)(c)</a>, the functions of the aforesaid bodies cannot be usurp by a particular association. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_553\">Under the Act</a> of 2005, option is available to the Sports Association and on exercise of option for registration and recognition, the provisions of the Act of 2005 are applicable; there may be certain conditions for registration and recognition contained under the Act of 2005, but they are not restrictive or unreasonable, but regulatory and reasonable one; they do not  infringe any of the  rights of the Sports Association including  to form association under Article19(1)(c); the provisions take care of all sports associations emerging in the present scenario and confer right on the Sports Associations to represent Rajasthan and meet the aspirations of the public;  the State created democratic structure in which the elected persons from the grass-root level till the State level could be effectively represented by a democratically elected method in consonance with the principles of federalism i.e. all the district representatives are at the State level, which in turn would represent the State at the national and international level; the State has provided framework and has not made any interference in independent functioning of the Sports Body; State has legislative competence under Entry 33 of List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution to make the Act of 2005; legislative competence of the State has not been questioned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_262\">XVIII- Conclusion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_263\">In view of the discussion made above, we are of the opinion that none of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/31868921/\" id=\"a_554\">Rajasthan Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005</a> infringes any of the rights of the petitioner including the right to form association under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_555\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> it is within the legislative competence of the  State to enact the Act of 2005; the State has not made any nomination or  interference  with the independence of the functioning of the Sports Body; the Registrar has been empowered to ensure compliance of the Act of 2005; the provisions of the Act of 2005 are not restrictive, but regulatory;  option is given for registration and recognition and on exercise of such option to avail the benefits under the Act of 2005, such Sports Association is bound by the terms and conditions contained in the Act of 2005, which are regulatory in nature; it is the volition of the Sports Association to opt and in case it does not opt registration and recognition under the Act of 2005, it can continue without using the expression Rajasthan or District, as the case may be, as part of its name and it is only after exercise of option for registration and recognition under the Act of 2005, such Sports Association is bound to comply with the terms and conditions contained in the Act of 2005 which cannot be said be unreasonable and violative of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_556\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Act of 2005;  violation of so called rights as alleged by the petitioner cannot be said to be right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_557\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> right of the Sports Association of  State or District Level to carry on objectives cannot be said to be part of fundamental right to form association under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_558\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> it is concomitant right or concomitant to a concomitant of  fundamental right; restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/1801956/\" id=\"a_559\">Article 19(4)</a> of the Constitution are not applicable even tested on the strength of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_560\">Article 19(1)(g);</a> the Act of 2005 ensures election of executive body of the Sports Association in a democratic, transparent and fair manner; it encourages sports activities without any restriction; there is no restriction on number of Primary Sports Body; the State Government has not taken away the power of the Sports Association to grant membership; prescription of minimum requirement of constituting a Sports Association is aimed at to promote sports activities; by prescribing minimum and maximum members of Executive Body, no right of the Sports Association including RCA has been taken  away;  the Act of 2005 ensures fair election and that no sports body should camouflage itself representing the State or District level association under the provisions of Act of 2005, thus it cannot be regarded as unreasonable or arbitrary in any manner whatsoever. <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_561\">The Act</a> of 2005 has been enacted to encourage and promote sports and games activities at various levels; it creates broad based structure to give equal opportunity to all to participate and to develop sports and help bring young talent in sports; it takes care of large number of emerging sports associations in the present scenario and to broad base the activities;  it  makes the functioning of the Federations/Associations transparent, professional and accountable; it ensures operation of Sports Bodies in a representative character and that sports units at all levels get equal opportunity of representation at District, State, National and International levels, so as to achieve excellence in the field of sports; it confers on Sports Associations legal right to represent Rajasthan and meet the aspirations of the public, discourage nepotism, create a deeper and wider network for selection process, develop a scientific procedure for identifying and promoting natural sports persons. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_264\">It is seen that persons, who are not connected with the sports or sports bodies, are at the helm of affairs of such bodies as if such bodies are for their private gains; the concept of private association working for private gains is not being jeopardized by the Act of 2005; ideal situation would be  that such bodies are manned by persons of skill, expertise and specialization in such field so that they can manage these bodies fairly and effectively without being influenced by persons, who are not having any expertise or knowledge of the field.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_265\">Time has now come that it becomes imminent that sports bodies should have broad base at the grass-root level as has been sought to be achieved under the Act of 2005 and they should function in a democratic manner within a particular framework so that individual is not deprived of duties under <a href=\"/doc/221712/\" id=\"a_562\">Article 51A(j)</a> of the Constitution which leads to the fulfillment of the rights in part III. The State Government is to ensure under <a href=\"/doc/1139107/\" id=\"a_563\">Article 39(f)</a>  that children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment. It is also the duty of the State under <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_564\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health. Health improvement takes place by sports activities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_266\">In view of the balancing of rights,  directive principles and duties,  it cannot be said by giving widest amplitude to the right under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_565\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> that the provisions of the Act of 2005 are repugnant or violative of <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_566\">Article 19(1)(c);</a> the provisions of the  Act of 2005 are not restrictive, rather  they contain  regulatory measures to promote sports activities in a fair and transparent manner, which cannot in any manner be termed as  illegal or arbitrary or unreasonable or violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_567\">Articles 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_568\">&amp; 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_267\">For the reasons mentioned above, we find the challenge to the <a href=\"/doc/31868921/\" id=\"a_569\">Rajasthan Sports (Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005</a> to be meritless. <a href=\"/doc/119074011/\" id=\"a_570\">Framing of the Act</a> of 2005 is within the legislative competence of the State. The provisions of the Act of 2005 cannot be said to be violative  of any of the provisions of the Constitution and do not in any way infringe any of the rights under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_571\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution of India, as alleged by the petitioner.  Thus, we hold the provisions of the Act of 2005 to be intra-vires.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_268\">Resultantly, the writ petition being bereft of merits, deserves dismissal. Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. We leave the parties to bear their respective costs.\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">(BELA M.TRIVEDI), J.                 \t\t (ARUN MISHRA), C.J.\n\n\nParmar\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_269\">\t\tAll the corrections made in the judgment/order have been incorporated in the judgment/order being emailed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_270\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShashi Kant Gaur, P\n</blockquote>","numcites":113,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Rajasthan High Court - Jaipur","citetid":43130041,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"article 19(1)(c)","formInput":"article%2019%281%29%28c%29"},{"value":"right to form association","formInput":"right%20to%20form%20association"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"non obstante clause","formInput":"non%20obstante%20clause"},{"value":"sport law","formInput":"sport%20law"},{"value":"EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING","formInput":"EXTRAORDINARY%20GENERAL%20MEETING"},{"value":"transitional provision","formInput":"transitional%20provision"},{"value":"The rajasthan societies registration act,1958","formInput":"The%20rajasthan%20societies%20registration%20act%2C1958"},{"value":" discrimination ","formInput":"%20discrimination%20"},{"value":"ad hoc ","formInput":"ad%20hoc%20"},{"value":"article 19(4)","formInput":"article%2019%284%29"},{"value":"article 19 1 c","formInput":"article%2019%201%20c"},{"value":"ultra vires ","formInput":"ultra%20vires%20"},{"value":"election  filter:  the societies registration act,1860 voters list publication","formInput":"election%20%20filter%3A%20%20the%20societies%20registration%20act%2C1860%20voters%20list%20publication"},{"value":"\"Paras Kuhad\"","formInput":"%22Paras%20Kuhad%22"},{"value":"right to association","formInput":"right%20to%20association"},{"value":"SPORTS ASSOCIATION","formInput":"SPORTS%20ASSOCIATION"},{"value":"article 19 c","formInput":"article%2019%20c"},{"value":"registration act","formInput":"registration%20act"},{"value":"disqualification","formInput":"disqualification"}],"cats":[{"value":"freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions","formInput":"tag:freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
