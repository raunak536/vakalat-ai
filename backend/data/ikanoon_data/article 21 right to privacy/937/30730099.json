Talukdar, J.: The employees of certain Public Sector Enterprises filed several\n\nwrit petitions with regard to pay revision of the Central Public Sector Employees following\n\nCentral Dearness Allowance (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;CDA&#x27;) pattern in 69 Public Sector\n\nEnterprises of the Government of India. In pursuance of the directives given by the\n Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court on 14th March, 1986 in connection with those writ petitions, the\n\nGovernment of India appointed a High Power Pay Committee on 7th April, 1986 under the\n\nChairmanship of the Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice R. B. Misra (as His Lordship then was), which\n\ngave its final report to the Government of India on 24th November, 1988 recommending\n\nCentral Government pay structure for all the 69 Public Sector Enterprises including\n\nNational Instruments Limited, being respondent No. 1 herein. By judgment dated 3rd May,\n\n1990, the Apex Court directed implementation of the recommendation of the High Power\n\nPay Committee Report. Ministry of Programme Implementation, Department of Public\n\nEnterprises, Government of India issued an office Memorandum No. 2(43)/90-DPE(WC)\n\ndated 12th June, 1990 regarding implementation of the recommendations of the said High\n\nPower Pay Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">      Para 3(iii) of the office Memorandum dated 12th June, 1990 provides that all\n\nemployees following 3rd Central Pay Commission Dearness Allowance pattern appointed on\n\nor after 1st January, 1986 but before 31st December, 1988 would be deemed to have been\n\nappointed in the revised scales. In para 11 of the Memorandum dated 12th June, 1990\n\nwhich dealt with &#x27;next pay revision&#x27;, it was stated that &#x27;the employees in respect of whom\n\nthe recommendations of the HPPC are now being implemented under orders of the Supreme\n\nCourt dated 3.5.1990 would get pay revision only as and when similar changes are effected\n\nfor the Central Government employees (Supreme Court judgment dated 3.5.1990).&#x27;\n\n      The National Instruments Limited was, however, declared a Sick Industrial\n\nCompany on a reference to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction\n\n(hereinafter referred to as &#x27;BIFR&#x27;) under Section XV of the Sick Industrial Companies\n (Special Provisions) Act, 1985.        The Government of India, Ministry of Industry,\n\nDepartment of Public Enterprises issued one office memo No. 2(42)/97-DPE(WC) dated\n\n24th October, 1997 in the matter of pay revision of the Central Public Sector employees\n\nfollowing CDA pattern in 69 Public Sector Enterprises including the NIL. It was stated that\n\nthe pay scales in respect of all the Public Sector Enterprises would be revised w.e.f. 1st\n\nJanuary, 1996 as per judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court dated 3rd May, 1990 on the\n\nrecommendations of the High Power Pay Committee.           There was a Memorandum of\n\nSettlement arrived at 6th October, 1997 after protracted negotiation between the\n\nmanagement of NIL and the Unions for rehabilitation. The employees in the best interest of\n\nrevival of the NIL agreed that the status quo in respect of existing pay scales would be\n\nmaintained for a period of at least three years. On expiry of the stipulated period of three\n\nyears, the rights and privileges, so far sacrificed may revive, as if the same have never\n\nhappened.     It was further agreed that the arrears accruing out of the arrangement as\n\nmentioned in clause 7.5.2 would be sacrificed by the employees. The management was to\n\nrevive the position at the end of each financial year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">       Regarding treatment of Sick Enterprises, the Pay Revision Committee made the\n\nfollowing observation :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot; 6.11.1 - A basic question, which concerns the working of public sector\n\nundertakings and emoluments of their employees, is the manner in which sick and loss\n\nmaking undertakings are treated. Today, these public sector undertakings fall under three\n\ncategories.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        6.11.2 - The first category is public sector enterprises that follow the Central\n\nDearness Allowance pattern. Irrespective of their financial position these companies have\n\ngot the benefit of the recommendations of the 5th Central Pay Commission. This is as per\n\nthe orders of the Supreme Court.         In respect of these companies, the Committee\n\nrecommends that, so long as the Court decision remains, emoluments have to be paid as per\n\nthe Court orders.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">       Respondent No. 1/NIL following the said CDA pattern for the petitioners comes\n\nwithin the first category of Public Sector Enterprises. According to the report dated 30th\n\nOctober, 1998 and so long as the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court subsists, emoluments\n\nhave to be paid to the petitioners following the recommendation of the 5th Central Pay\n\nCommission irrespective of the financial position of the NIL. The NIL has been issuing\n\nsalary bills showing the payment of emoluments according to the 4th Pay Commission\n\nRecommendations and accrual of emoluments according to the 5th Pay Commission\n\nRecommendations. On 12th November, 2002, the BIFR by an order concluded that the NIL\n\nwas not likely to become viable on a long term basis and it be wound up.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">       In such changed circumstances, arising out of the order of the BIFR dated 12th\n\nNovember, 2002, the bipartite settlement dated 6th October, 1997 had lost its force. The\n\nappeal was, however, preferred against the order of the BIFR before the Appellate\n\nAuthority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, in short &#x27;AAIFR&#x27; and the same is\n\nstill pending. The two leading Universities of West Bengal, namely, Calcutta University\n\nand Jadavpur University, submitted their individual proposals to the Department of Heavy\n\nIndustry expressing their desire to take over the assets and liabilities of NIL along with the\n responsibilities of the existing man power. Meeting was convened on 24th June, 2005\n\nregarding such taking over the assets and liabilities by either of the said two Universities.\n\nIn the said meeting, Department of Heavy Industries, Government of India had agreed to\n\ntake the responsibilities of all the dues pertaining to the employees of NIL up to the last\n\ndate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">        The petitioners along with others submitted a representation dated 6th July, 2006 to\n\nthe Chairman and Managing Director of NIL requesting the said authority to disburse the\n\nsalaries of the CDA pattern employees as per High Power Pay Committee\n\nRecommendations (5th Pay Commission) w.e.f. 1st January, 1996. This was done by the\n\nNIL in respect of the CDA pattern employees as per officer Memorandum dated 24th\n\nOctober, 1997. But such revised pay scales as per 5th Pay Commission Recommendation\n\ncould not be implemented to the existing employees due to non-availability of financial\n\nresources and considering the pendency of the revival package of the NIL. But the amount\n\nwas accumulated as arrear in the name of each individual employee. The extent of financial\n\ninvolvement of the arrears was communicated to the Ministry for release of fund from time\n\nto time. In the representation dated 6th July, 2006, it was pointed out that those employees\n\nof NIL who had retired/resigned/separated under Voluntary Retirement Scheme had been\n\ngiven their dues in the revised pay scales as per 5th Pay Commission Recommendations\n\nalong with arrear salaries. 11 employees of NIL who retired between 31st January, 1996\n\nand 28th February, 2006 had been given the benefits of 5th Pay Commission (High Power\n\nPay Committee Scales of Pay) w.e.f. 1st January, 1996. Two employees who retired on 19th\n\nJuly, 1996 and 23rd June, 1999 had been given similar benefits. One Edward Lapcha, since\n deceased, who was upper division clerk of NIL, was also given such benefits w.e.f. 1st\n\nJanuary, 1996 after his death on 17th October, 1998.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      A list of 79 employees who were released under Voluntary Retirement Scheme on\n\n28th August, 2002 and a list of 102 employees released under Voluntary Retirement Scheme\n\nas on 4th February, 2003 as also a list of 212 employees released under the Voluntary\n\nRetirement Scheme on 31st March, 2003 circulated under inter office memoranda dated 28th\n\nMay, 2001 and 3rd February, 2003 show that in case of employees under CDA Scale,\n\ncalculations of the service benefits were made as per High Power Pay Committee Pay\n\nScales according to 5th Pay Commission Recommendations. The Department of Heavy\n\nIndustries, Government of India, issued a D.O. No. 11/36/2004-PE.I dated 25th October,\n\n2006 stating, inter alia, that the proposal regarding transfer of assets, liabilities and man\n\npower of NIL to Jadavpur University was concurred by most of the Ministries/Departments\n\nof the Government of India subject to certain pre-conditions. One of the pre-conditions was\n\nthat the Government of India would not provide any budgetary support for payment of\n\narrears of wages/VRS dues. The University may take over the liabilities on &#x27;as is where is&#x27;\n\nbasis, as on the date of transfer. The Government of West Bengal did not agree to take the\n\nliabilities of the arrear dues of the employees. On 22nd November, 2006, AAIFR passed an\n\norder wherein the stand of the Government of India is that some minor reconciliations, if\n\nrequired, were to be done for payment of dues of the employees and workers in consultation\n\nwith the Department of Public Enterprises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">      Thus, the legitimacy of the petitioners&#x27; demand cannot be any longer in dispute.\n\nThey are being given interim relief as per recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission.\n The recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission vis-à-vis the High Power Pay Committee\n\nhave been implemented w.e.f. 1st January, 1996 in respect of all other employees under\n\nCDA scale excepting the existing employees including the petitioners. In the pay bills\n\nissued in favour of the petitioners, their entitlements to the benefits as per recommendation\n\nof the 5th Pay Commission have been duly reflected. In the 48th Annual Report for 2004-06\n\nof NIL there was a provision for payment of arrear salary and wages to the existing\n\nemployees as per 5th Pay Scale, which was considered adequate as on 31st March, 2005.\n\nSuch provision was, however, withdrawn and not reflected in the 49th Annual Report for\n\n2005-06 of NIL. The authorities were repeatedly approached by the petitioners but without\n\nany result. The respondent authorities, thus, acted in an arbitrary manner and the writ\n\npetitioners had been discriminated against.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">       Being left with no choice, the petitioners approached this Court for redressal of their\n\ngrievances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">       In the Affidavit-in-Opposition filed on behalf of the respondent Nos. 3 and 4, it had\n\nbeen alleged that the salary/wages of the employees of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)\n\ngoverned by CDA pattern are monitored by the Pay Commission report. Ministry of\n\nFinance constitutes such Pay Commission, which makes recommendations.                      After\n\nexamining such recommendations, the Ministry of Finance circulates the same for\n\nimplementation of Pay Commission report to the PSUs and it is for the administrative\n\ndepartment to take necessary action on the basis of the guidelines and the financial position\n\nof the PSUs under its control. It is for the PSUs to satisfy all the pre-conditions set forth for\n\nthe implementation of such Pay Commission report. Implementation is subject to the\n financial condition of the PSUs and the Government of India does not provide any financial\n\nassistance for implementation of such revision. The office Memorandum dated 12.6.1990\n\nis applicable to the PSUs in which 4th Pay Commission report has been implemented with\n\nthe due procedural approval of the concerned administrative ministry. Since the present\n\ncase relates to the arrear of 5th Pay Commission Recommendation, it is necessary to refer to\n\nthe fact that National Instruments Limited was referred to BIFR in 1992 and it could never\n\nmake any profits thereafter. As such, question of revising the pay scales w.e.f. 1st January,\n\n1996 could just not arise. It had been further claimed that the mention of 5th Pay benefits on\n\nthe pay slip cannot be construed as an approval of the Government to grant the employees\n\nof the NIL such pay revision.        There has been no explicit order granting 5th Pay\n\nCommission revision to NIL. After the winding up orders had been passed, there could be\n\nno reason for the company to revise the Pay Scales in light of the poor financial condition\n\nof the company.     Failure of any bipartite settlement for not revising pay scale dated\n\n6.10.1997 because of BIFR does not amount to an approval for revising the pay scales.\n\nThere is no provision for revising the pay scales to the 5th Pay Commission&#x27;s scales in the\n\nproposal for transfer and hence there are no outstanding salary/wages dues on account of 5th\n\nPay revision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">       The arrangement with Jadavpur University and Calcutta University was just a step\n\ntaken for protection of the jobs of the employees of the company when BIFR had ordered\n\nclosure and winding up of the company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">       The said respondents further claimed that the representation submitted by the\n\npetitioners was taken up with the Departmental of Public Enterprises which in turn replied\n that the decision on payment of arrears of CDA scale of pay may be taken by administrative\n\ndepartment keeping in view DPE guidelines on pay revision, financial position of the\n\ncompany and on the basis of prevailing scale of pay. It had been further stated that any\n\npayment to some employees, as alleged, if had been done in a wrong manner will not\n\namount to an approval of revision of pay scales. An order of revision of pay scales has to\n\nbe an explicit order clearly mentioning the conditions and on the basis of the financial\n\ncondition of the company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      Such respondents, thus, sought for dismissal of the writ application.\n\n      Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 also contested the case by filing a separate Affidavit-in-\n\nOpposition. They claimed that respondent No. 1 is a Central Government Undertaking\n\nunder the management and control of Department of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Heavy\n\nIndustries &amp; Public Enterprises being incorporated in 1956. In 19992, the respondent No. 1\n\nwas referred to BIFR and on 21st November, 2002, it was declared a Sick Industrial Unit\n\nand the BIFR was pleased to recommend for winding up of respondent No. 1.                The\n\nDepartment of Heavy Industries decided that since respondent No. 1 was making loss for\n\nthe last 15 years and since it had been referred for winding up, there could be no obligation\n\nto pay arrear in terms of 5th Pay Commission to the employees under CDA scale of pay. On\n\n17th July, 2007, a meeting was held in the BIFR to consider the recommendation of the\n\nAAIFR when the scheme of transferring the assets, liabilities and man power of the\n\nrespondent No. 1 to Jadavpur University submitted by the State Bank of India, the\n\nOperating Agent was found viable. A notice inviting objection regarding such transfer was\n\nproposed to be published in the leading newspapers and date was fixed for further hearing\n on 29th October, 2007. It was further stated that the decision of taking over of respondent\n\nNo. 1 by the Jadavpur University Authority although approved by the concerned Ministry,\n\nthe same is yet to be implemented and the Government&#x27;s decision about taking\n\nresponsibilities has not taken effect as yet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">       It was also claimed that no order had been issued by the Government for payment of\n\narrear of pay revision to the retiring officers/VRS employees/other employees of the\n\nrespondent No. 1.       No decision had been taken by the concerned authority about\n\nimplementation of 5th Pay Commission. Since the company had been recommended for\n\nwinding up, the question of revising the pay scale w.e.f. 1st January, 1996 could not arise.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">       On behalf of the petitioners it was contended that some of the employees standing on\n\nan identical footing were given revised pay scale at the time of their VRS. Learned Senior\n\nCounsel, Mr. Saktinath Mukherjee expressed his wonder as to how, in such circumstances,\n\nthe writ petitioners could be discriminated against. According to him, the plea that such\n\npayment, if at all made, was unintentional and had been a mistake, is far from convincing.\n\nIt was further submitted by Mr. Dutta while assisting learned Senior Counsel Mr.\n\nMukherjee, that the NIL is essentially a research institution which cannot be expected to\n\nmake material profit. He submitted that since inception, this respondent No. 1 takes loan\n\nfrom the Government for payment of salaries etc.\n\n       It was submitted on behalf of the writ petitioners that the CDA employees who have\n\nretired/resigned and/or died have been given all benefits based upon the recommendation of\n\nthe 5th Pay Commission. The petitioners who continued to be in service have been denied\n\nsuch benefits. This, according to the learned Counsel for the writ petitioners, is arbitrary\n and illegal and it violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It was then\n\nsubmitted that National Instruments Limited being a Research based Organization, the\n\nquestion of its making profit and loss does not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">       Inviting attention of the Court to Annexure-&#x27;P-13&#x27; of the Affidavit-in-Reply, it was\n\nsubmitted that para 11.1 of the Report of the Pay Revision Committee for Public Sector\n\nExecutives states :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;The first category is public sector enterprises that follow the Central Dearness\n\nAllowance pattern. Irrespective of their financial position these companies have got the\n\nbenefit of the recommendations of the 5th Central Pay Commission. This is as per the\n\norders of the Supreme Court. In respect of these companies, the Committee recommends\n\nthat, so long as the Court decision remains, emoluments have to be paid as per the Court\n\norders.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">       It was further submitted on behalf of the writ petitioners that the Government of\n\nIndia has approved the &#x27;write off&#x27; its loan and decided to bear any financial implication that\n\nmay arise for payment of outstanding decided of the petitioners by way of grant of\n\nequivalent amount of additional budgetary support. The decision of the Government of\n\nIndia to pay salaries and allowances of the petitioners till the date of transfer of NIL to\n\nJadavpur University has also been clearly spelt out. Initially the cut off date was 1.4.2007\n\nwhich, however, was extended till 15th January, 2009. Learned Counsel for the petitioners\n\ncould not find any sufficient justification for raising the issue that the writ petitioners are\n\njust few in number and the application has not been filed in a representative capacity. It\n\nwas submitted that the reliefs have been sought for in respect of such writ petitioners only\n and the same can very well be extended to the added respondents. This stand can not be\n\nsaid to be without farce.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">       On behalf of the writ petitioners, it was then contended that the respondent/Union of\n\nIndia is not justified in taking the stand that the writ petitioners being employees of Public\n\nSector Enterprises could not demand to be treated equally as the Central Government\n\nemployees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">       On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent No. 3/Union of India\n\ncategorically mentioned that such respondent No. 1 has been consistently over a protracted\n\nperiod of time running in huge loss. It became a Sick Public Sector Enterprise in 1992 and\n\nreference to the BIFR was made accordingly. Since 1991-92, such respondent No. 2 could\n\nnever, in fact, make any profit. BIFR recommended for winding up of such PSE unit.\n\nAccording to learned Counsel for such respondent No.3 the office Memorandum dated 24th\n\nOctober, 1997 will be applicable to the sick unit, which run consistently with losses for\n\nmore than 15 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">       Annexure-&#x27;P-9&#x27; at page 76 to the writ petition is a communication dated 6th July,\n\n1996. By such representation addressed to the Chairman &amp; Managing Director, NIL, the\n\nsignatories brought to the notice to the concerned authority that there had been\n\ndiscrimination against the writ petitioners who had been denied the benefits, which were\n\nextended to the employees who retired/resigned/separated under the VRS. Such assertion\n\non the part of the writ petitioners raises certain intricate points of law. Even assuming that\n\ncertain benefits were extended to the employees who retired/resigned/expired/separated can\n\nthat by itself just be a sufficient justification for extending the same benefit to others.\n Significantly enough, learned Counsel for the respondent/Union of India sought to wash his\n\nhands of while submitting that it could be a calculated internal arrangement. The fact of\n\nextending certain benefits in the matter of pay scale was, thus, sought to be described as an\n\nintra family arrangement for mutual benefit at the cost of public exchequer.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1455798\" id=\"span_1\">Mr. Saktinath Mukherjee while discussing about the role of State referred to the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in the case between <a href=\"/doc/1455798/\" id=\"a_3\">Kapila Hingorani Vs. State of Bihar</a>, as\n\nreported in (2003) 6 SCC 1. The Apex Court in the said case observed that &#x27;the corporate\n\nveil indisputably can be pierced when the corporate personality is found to be opposed to\n\njustice, convenience and interest of the revenue or workmen or against public interest.&#x27;\n\n       It was submitted that the State may not be liable in relation to day-to-day functioning\n\nof the companies, but its liability would arise on its failure to perform the constitutional\n\nduties and functions by the public sector undertakings, as in relation thereto lie the State&#x27;s\n\nconstitutional obligations. The State cannot be so insensitive to the plight of its citizens,\n\nparticularly the employees of the public undertakings. The Apex Court in the said case\n\nobserved that &#x27;financial stringency may not be a ground for not issuing requisite directions\n\nwhen a question of violation of the fundamental right arises&#x27;. According to Mr. Mukherjee\n\nthe State is liable to mitigate the sufferings of the employees of the public sector\n\nundertakings or the Government companies.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">       It is true that the term &#x27;life&#x27; used in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has a wide and far-\n\nreaching concept. It includes livelihood and so many other facets thereof. &#x27;Life&#x27;, as\n\nobserved by Field, J. in Munn v.

Jute Corporation of India</a>, as reported in 1990(3) SCC 437,\n\nnever distinguished the categories of PSE, namely, (1) who are generating profits and (2)\n\nwho are running with losses several years consecutively.           It was observed that the\n\nrecommendation of Pay Commission will also be applicable for 69 PSEs in general. In\n\npursuant to <a href=\"/doc/755265/\" id=\"a_23\">the said judgment</a>, the Central Government prepared its guideline for Public\n\nSector Enterprise (PSE) to implement Pay Commission Recommendation in compare to\n\nCentral Government employees. In the said guideline it was categorically held that there\n\nare three kinds of PSEs (1) profit making PSUs (2) Loss making PSUs (3) PSU before\n\nBIFR.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">        Attention of the Court was invited to the guideline, which refers to the\n\nimplementation of the Pay Commission Recommendation. It suggests that the PSUs which\n\ndo not make profit during the preceding three years viz., 1991-92, 1992-93 and 1993-94 or\n had incurred loss during any of these financial years would also be allowed to adopt the\n\nscales of pay of the executives holding posts below the Board Level and non-unionized\n\nsupervisors with the approval of the Government i.e. the Administrative Ministry acting in\n\nconsultation with the DPE, provided they give an estimate as to how resources would be\n\ngenerated by them to meet the extra expenditure. It was submitted on behalf of the\n\nrespondent No. 3 that in the instant case, no such document had been relied upon by the\n\nwrit petitioners to that effect and to show that they had taken measures to mobilize\n\nresources to meet the extra burden. It was further submitted that after amendment of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/438563/\" id=\"a_24\">Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985</a>, the PSEs have been brought\n\nwithin its purview. So far 50 PSEs have been registered with the BIFR. It was suggested\n\nthat the PSEs, which have been referred to BIFR would not be allowed the benefit of\n\nrevised scale of pay - for their Board Level executives, executives holding posts below the\n\nBoard Level and non-unionized supervisors - unless and until the verdict of the BIFR is\n\navailable. Wherever revival plan for a PSE has been approved by the BIFR, proposals for\n\nadopting revised scales of pay w.e.f. 1.1.1992 would be required to be submitted by the\n\nconcerned PSEs to the Government for appropriate approval by the Administrative Ministry\n\nacting in consultation with the DPE provided they give an estimate of their wage bill and\n\nalso spell out measures for mobilizing of resources to meet the extra burden.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">      It seems to be the consistent and categorical stand of the respondent/Union of India\n\nthat until and unless the necessary funds are generated by the respondent Public Sector\n\nEnterprise, the implementation of revised report of the 5th Pay Commission could not be\n\ngiven effect to. Learned Counsel, in this context, submitted that unequals cannot be treated\n with equals as part of economical status. It was then submitted that the company never\n\nraised any fund for making payment/implementation of the recommendation of the 5th Pay\n\nCommission. On the other hand, on 6th October, 1997, the employees&#x27; union entered into a\n\nsettlement with the management of the company for maintenance of &#x27;status quo&#x27; in respect\n\nof the pay scale. Such a settlement formed a part of the rehabilitation scheme. Learned\n\nCounsel for the respondent No. 3 contended that when Jadavpur University came forward\n\nas a promoter to revive in the NIL, the writ petitioners got anxious to extract some benefit.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">       It was further submitted that for implementation of &#x27;taking over&#x27;, the Central\n\nGovernment had written off huge amount of outstanding dues of Rs. 232 crores and had\n\nfurther provided additional amount of Rs. 1.58 crores for payment of arrear of salary and\n\nwages in order to give effect. On the basis of such sacrifice of huge liquid cash amounting\n\nto Rs. 248.58 crores, an order was passed by the AAIFR on 4th August, 2008.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">       On behalf of the respondent No. 3, reference was made to the said order dated 4th\n\nAugust, 2008 passed by the AAIFR. While setting aside the order of the BIFR dated 30th\n\nSeptember, 2002 for the purposed winding up of the company, the AAIFR directed\n\npreparation of a draft revival scheme. The Board, based on the draft scheme received from\n\nthe OA (SBI) and other materials on record, prepared a scheme for revival of the sick\n\ncompany M/s. NIL, which envisaged transfer of assets and liabilities of the sick company\n\nM/s. NIL along with the transfer of existing employees w.e.f. 1.4.2007 in favour of\n\nJadavpur University (JU), Kolkata for utilization of the company&#x27;s infrastructure for R&amp;D\n\npurpose of JU and the Board approved the said scheme in terms of provision under <a href=\"/doc/262489/\" id=\"a_25\">section\n\n18(2b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/262489/\" id=\"a_26\">18(6A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/100106/\" id=\"a_27\">18(4)</a> read with 19(3) of the Act. The said order of the AAIFR was\n never challenged before any competent Court. It was categorically mentioned that it would\n\nbe the responsibility of the management to arrange for necessary fund for additional\n\npayments, is situation so arises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">       Based on the aforesaid order dated 4th August, 2008, a scheme for revival of sick\n\ncompany was sanctioned. The Government of India has written off Rs. 23,274.91 lakhs and\n\nalso paid Rs. 203.48 lakhs towards employees related dues which was much higher than the\n\nemployees dues at the relevant point of time as on 31st March, 2007. The writ petitioners,\n\nbeing 14 in number, could not be entitled to get the benefit of the recommendations of the\n\n5th Pay Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1184378\" id=\"span_19\">In this context, learned Counsel, Mr. Roy, appearing for the respondent No.3/Union\n\nof India, referred to the decision of the Apex Court in the case between <a href=\"/doc/1184378/\" id=\"a_28\">A.K. Bindal &amp;\n\nOrs. Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a>, as reported in 2003(5) SCC 163. The Apex Court in the\n\nsaid case dealt with the legal position of a Government company while dealing with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/747578/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 619</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1168040/\" id=\"a_30\">620</a> of the Companies Act, 1956. It was held that a Government company\n\ncannot be identified with the Government itself.       Its employees are not Government\n\nservants and not entitled to protection under <a href=\"/doc/47623/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 311</a> of the Constitution. The Apex\n\nCourt in the said case further dealt with the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution and that was in reference to the expanded scope and meaning of &#x27;right to life&#x27;.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1184378\" id=\"span_20\">It is, perhaps, needless to mention that concept of &#x27;life with human dignity&#x27; cannot\n\nbe placed in a straight jacket formula. It is not always desirable to link it with the income\n\nof an independent. But it should be a life without begging, borrowing and stealing. The\n\nApex Court, however, in the said case of <a href=\"/doc/1184378/\" id=\"a_33\">A.K. Bindal</a> (Supra) observed that the scope and\n content of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> has been expanded by judicial decisions. Right to life enshrined in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> means something more than survival or animal existence. It would certainly\n\ninclude the right to life with human dignity. But to hold that mere non-revision of pay scale\n\nwould also amount to a violation of fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> would\n\nbe stretching it too far. The economic viability of the financial capacity of the employer is\n\nalso an important factor and it cannot be ignored while fixing the wage structure, otherwise\n\nthe unit itself may not be able to function.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"228596\" id=\"span_21\">In <a href=\"/doc/228596/\" id=\"a_37\">Tamil Nadu Electricity Board &amp; Ors. Vs. N. Raju Reddiar &amp; Anr.</a>, as\n\nreported in 1996 (4) SCC 551, the Apex Court took into consideration as to whether the\n\nconduct of some of the Superintending Engineers in passing some of the bills on multi-slab\n\nbasis can be pleaded as an estoppel against the defendants and can form the basis of\n\nplaintiffs&#x27; case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">         In the present case, it had been strongly contended on behalf of the writ petitioners\n\nthat some of the retired employees were given pay scale, which have not been extended to\n\nthe present writ petitioners.     The Apex Court in the said case observed that such a\n\nrecommendation or passing of the bills on one count or multi-slab basis cannot be construed\n\nto have conferred a right on the plaintiffs to get the payments on multi-slab basis, until and\n\nunless it is proved that the defendants agreed under the written contract to pay on multi-slab\n\nbasis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">         The facts and circumstances of the present case, however, are significantly different.\n\nHere the petitioners sought to highlight the fact that the benefits, which were given to some\n\nof the retiring employees who virtually stood on the same footing with the present writ\n petitioners cannot be denied. This has been sought to be assailed by learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondent/Union of India on the ground that grant of such pay scale or benefits was a\n\ncalculated, conscious and designed act and it was an intra-family arrangement made with an\n\nulterior motive. According to respondent No.3, the Union of India could have had no role\n\nto play in that regard and as such, the claim of discrimination cannot be said to have any\n\nrational basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"561347\" id=\"span_22\">In course of submission, reference was further made by the learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondent/Union of India that any direction to give benefits to the employees may cause\n\nfinancial burden and it can become so heavy that the undertaking itself may collapse under\n\nits own weight. The Apex Court observed in the case between <a href=\"/doc/561347/\" id=\"a_38\">State of Karnataka Vs.\n\nUma Devi &amp; Ors.</a>, as reported in 2006 (4) SCC 1 that the Court ought not to impose a\n\nfinancial burden on the State by such directions, as such directions may turn\n\ncounterproductive.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">       So far the controversy raised in the present writ application is concerned, the\n\nchallenge on the ground of maintainability cannot be said to have any justification\n\nwhatsoever since the grievance relating to inordinate delay in approaching the Court was\n\nnever raised earlier. Moreover, this by itself, in the factual backdrop of the present case,\n\ncannot be considered to be a sufficient reason for showing the exit door to the writ\n\npetitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">       The fact that the application was not filed in representative capacity cannot also\n\nchange the legal complexion of the case. The benefits, which have been claimed by the writ\n petitioners, if granted, could very well be extended to others standing on the identical\n\nfooting and particularly, the supporting respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">       After hearing learned Counsel for both parties and having regard to the factual\n\nbackdrop of the present case, it may be mentioned that the main objection as raised on\n\nbehalf of the respondent No. 3 is that the writ petitioners cannot be entitled to the benefits\n\nas sought for since the organization, National Instruments Limited, has been running at a\n\nloss for years. There is no scope for any dispute in that regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">       But on behalf of the writ petitioners, Mr. Saktinath Mukherjee, sought to explain the\n\nposition by pointing out that this was never intended to be a profit-making organization and\n\nits job was essentially directed towards research.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">       This Court finds it difficult, if not impossible, to brush aside the grievances as\n\nventilated on behalf of the writ petitioners regarding alleged discrimination. It is true that\n\nthere cannot be any equality amongst unequals. But so far the present case is concerned, I\n\nfind it difficult to hold that the present writ petitioners stand on a footing different from\n\nthose who had been given the benefits, which are now being claimed by the writ petitioners.\n\nAnother very significant aspect is that the concerned organization has always been\n\nconsistent in keeping provision for such benefits in the budget assessment.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">       Much has been said regarding lack of rationality in involving the State in a dispute of\n\nthe present nature. But who can dispute the changing role of the State in a fast changing\n\nsociety.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">        The renowned jurist, W. Friedmann, in his book, &#x27;Law in a Changing Society&#x27;\n\nobserved that &#x27;the ideal of social welfare, i.e. of the responsibility of the community for\n\nminimum standards of living and protection against the major vicissitudes that would leave\n\nthe individual - except the fortunate few - destitute and degraded, provided only with the\n\ntheoretical freedoms of contract, property and trade, is now almost universally accepted&#x27;. It\n\nis well settled that a democratic ideal of justice must rest on the three foundations of\n\nequality, liberty and ultimate control of Government by the people.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">       The plea of absence of any direct role cannot be raised in order to permit the\n\nrespondent to wash its hands of when there is clear discrimination. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution does not, perhaps, allow the State to raise that plea and having regard to the\n\nfact that a good number of employees standing on the identical footing have been given the\n\nbenefits of the recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission, it would not be just and proper\n\non the part of the State respondents to deny the same to the present writ petitioners.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">       But there remains more things to be taken care of. While the State cannot certainly\n\nscream and say &#x27;who am I to take up arms against the sea of troubles&#x27;, the Court also need\n\nto take a cautious approach - when there is huge financial involvement. Our laws do not\n\npermit the authority to act arbitrarily and extend benefits to a section of employees while\n\ndenying the same to others. It cannot derive inspiration from George Orwell and say that\n\nall are equals but some are more equal than others.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">        Considering all these aspects and in view of the fact that the contradictions are\n\nessentially non-antagonistic in nature, the respondent authorities must re-evaluate the entire\n\ngrievances, as ventilated in the application under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and\n\nreappreciate the same in the light of observations made hereinbefore.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">       In order to enable it to do so, the writ petitioners must send a copy of the application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution along with its annexures and of course, a copy of the\n\njudgment to the respondent authorities. The said authorities must take necessary action\n\nwithin a period of three months from the date of receipt of the same and of course, after\n\ngiving the writ petitioners or their representatives an opportunity of hearing.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">       Action to be so taken or order to be so passed must also be duly communicated to the\n\nwrit petitioners within a further period of three weeks.
