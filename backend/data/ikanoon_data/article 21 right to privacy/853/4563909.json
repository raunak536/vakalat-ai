The Counsels for the Appellant Banks has referred the reply provided by\nCPIO and order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO, RBI and FAA\nhad violated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions in the matter. No\nreasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The\ncounsel for the appellant banks prayed before the Commission that the FAA\norder should be set-aside for want of reasons. The FAA in its order has\nmentioned that the interim order passed in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_1\">Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal\nMistry &amp; Ors.</a> would apply only to those banks which are parties to the petition,\nnamely, HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank Limited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank\nLimited and State Bank of India. As the Kotak Mahindra Bank and Induslnd\nBank was not a party <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_2\">in that case</a>, it would not be possible for the appellant to\ntake benefit of that order.He further submitted that the information sought by\nthe RTI applicants were completely exempted as the information sought\nincludes commercial information received in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of\ninformation sought is specifically prohibited under various legislations and is\nspecifically exempted under Section 8 (1) (a), 8 (1)(d), Section 8 (l) (e) and\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. The disclosure of personal/ commercial\ninformation of the banks and its customers violated the right to privacy as\nguaranteed under the Right to life as enshrined under the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India. Such disclosure would cause serious prejudice to the\nmarket value and reputation of the Appellant Banks and its customers. The\nCounsels has further referred the Full Bench judgment of this Hon&#x27;ble\nCommission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide order\ndated 05.05.2022 wherein an identical issue of disclosure of Inspection Report,\nhas remanded the matters to the CPIO for fresh adjudication by keeping in mind\nprinciples of natural justice. Moreover, considering the fact that several banks\nhave filed inter alia Writ Petition No. 1159 of 2019&amp; Ors tagged with it before\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court inter-alia impugning the disclosure of their\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                        Page 4 of 9</span>\n Inspection Reports or parts thereof by the RBI under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a>, this Hon&#x27;ble\nCommission has also held that any decision by the CPIO in respect of\ndisclosure of Inspection Report would amount to pre-judging the issues pending\nthe admitted Writ Petition (s) before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.     The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicants vide above RTI applications inter\nalia, sought, copy of Inspection Reports from year 2011-2019. They further\nsubmitted that the then CPIO issued the notice under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11(1)</a> read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">(RTI Act</a>) to the third party\ni.e. appellant banks informing that RBI was required to disclose the information\nsought by the above applicants, enabling appellant banks to make written\nsubmission as to whether the information sought by the applicants might be\ndisclosed or not along with reasons for the same. After considering the response\nfrom Appellant Banks, the CPIO decided to disclose the detail of Inspection\nReports from year 2011-2019to the applicants. He further submitted that the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors (2016) 3 SCC\n525 observed that :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI\n      ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might\n      embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a> and disclose the information sought by the\n      applicant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The FAA observed that the interim order would apply only to those banks\nwhich are parties to the Petition, namely HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank\nLimited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank Limited and State Bank of India. The Kotak\nMahindra Bank and Induslnd Bank were not a party in the aforementioned\nmatters. Accordingly, it would not be possible for them to take advantage of the\ninterim order dated 18.12.2019 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Decision:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">10. The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original applicants has sought detail of\nAnnual Inspection Reports made by Reserve Bank post completing the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          Page 5 of 9</span>\n inspection, inter alia, pertaining to Kotak Mahindra Bank i.e. appellant herein\nand 5 other banks(as mentioned in RTI Application) from the year 2011-2019.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">The CPIO, Reserve Bank of India issued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_11\">11(3)</a>\nto the respecting banks mentioned above intending to disclose the information.\nAggrieved by the decision of the CPIO, the said banks had filed first appeals\nwith the First Appellate Authority. The FAA had also dismissed the first\nappeals of the banks summarily. Being aggrieved with the order of the FAA,\nbanks had filed second appeals before this Commission.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">11. The Commission observes that the RTI applicants had insisted for\ndisclosure of information as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The Appellant\nBanks contested that the information sought as a whole is exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8 (1) (a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_13\">8(1)(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_14\">8(1)(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_15\">8(1) (j)</a>of the RTI Act\nand that the CPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their\nobjections nor gave any opportunity of hearing to them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">12. The Commission further observes that the CPIO while issuing notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Banks to file\ntheir objections, if any, against disclosure of Inspection Reports/Audit Reports,\netc. but has not found it necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While\nnot doing so, the CPIO has not passed any reasoned order covering his\ndeliberations on their objections, his understanding of law or jurisprudence in\ndeciding specific objections, in favor of disclosure or redaction etc. Orders\npassed by the CPIO in all the cases are cryptic, almost identical without any\nreference to objections raised by the Banks which are definitely not identical.\nSimilarly, the FAA instead of passing a speaking order has also given cryptic,\nalmost identical orders to the appellant banks. The CPIO and the FAA are\nexpected to apply their mind before issuing the order of intent of disclosing the\ninformation. Further, no opportunity of personal hearing was given to the\nappellant nor speaking order have been passed by FAA for not giving\nopportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for accepting /not accepting their\nobjections in his decisions in these appeals. The Commission is of the view that\nevery objection should be dealt and rejected/accepted with a reason and reasons\nfor not giving opportunity of personal hearing should be well reasoned too in\nview of wider implications.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                       Page 6 of 9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\"> 13. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicants has\nto be adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution,\nvarious judicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts\nproviding guidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should generally be\nprovided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise if denied or not\ngivenbe reasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, order by CPIO should\nenumerate the principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of inspection reports\nor part thereof which may include personal information, commercially sensitive\ninformation of clients or institution and hence specifically excluded disclosures\nunder various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">14. In light of the above observations and considering all the facts and\ncircumstances of the above mentioned cases, the Commission is of the view that\ncontour of the arguments are identical as held in the Full Bench judgment of this\nHon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide\norder dated 05.05.2022. It has been observed that there are minor variations in\nthe matters in hand when compared with the matters already decided by the\nCommission as above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_7\">15. It has already been stated supra that detailed view in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022 wherein issues of\nredaction, ratio of <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_17\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other related issues are discussed\nin detail. Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks may be allowed taking into account the\ncircumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a blanket manner.\nThe Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the relevant references\nfrom the said order while deciding the above mentioned cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_8\">16. Further, the Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the\nconduct of the CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the\nopinion that due care has to be taken by according opportunity of personal\nhearing and making reasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                        Page 7 of 9</span>\n of the CPIO and later in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the\nCPIO will be required to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the\nobservations of the Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the\nCPIO will take view on various objections filed by the Appellant and\nsubmissions made by applicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case\nto case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_19\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case, Commission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other\nrelevant judgments. Hence, with these observations the order passed by the\nCPIO and FAA in these matters is set aside and the case is being remanded to\nthe CPIO for adjudication afresh in line with the Commission full bench\ndecision passed in file nos. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated\n05.05.2022. In case, the appellant/applicant is aggrieved with the order of the\nCPIO, they are at the liberty to file first appeal before the First Appellate\nAuthority and afterwards second appeal before the Commission.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">17. Furthermore, since the original applicants has sought the requested\ninformation regarding various banks, however few of them have approached the\nCommission through present second appeals and second appeals, if filed, by the\nother banks are not known to the Commission. Therefore, if other banks\nregarding whom the information is being sought would approach the\nCommission, the decision passed in the above matters would be applicable to\nthem as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">18.
