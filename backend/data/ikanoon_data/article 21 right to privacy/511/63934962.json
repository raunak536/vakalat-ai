The petitioner herein is the respondent in Crl.M.P.No.2467 of\n\n2013 and as well as in M.C.No.46 of 2011 on the file of the II\n\nAdditional Judicial Magistrate of I Class, Tanuku and the 1st\n\nrespondent herein is the petitioner in Crl.M.P.No.2467 of 2013 and\n\nthe 1st petitioner in M.C.No.46 of 2011 on the file of the II Additional\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class, Tanuku.       The 1st respondent herein\n\nalong with her daughter filed M.C.No.46 of 2011 against her husband\n\narraying him as the sole respondent under <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 125</a> of Cr.P.C\n\nseeking to pay an amount of Rs.8,000/- per month to the petitioners\n\ntowards maintenance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.      The 1st respondent herein who is the petitioner in M.C.No.46 of\n\n2011 contends that she has got acquaintance with the respondent\n\ntherein/the petitioner herein since 2007 and at that time, he used to\n\ntease her with a demand to satisfy his lust by promising that he\n\nwould marry her, treated her as his wife and enjoyed her sexually.\n\nWhile so, due to sickness, when she went to medical check-up, the\n\ndoctor informed her that she was carrying and the same was informed\n\nto him/the respondent therein with a request to marry her. In turn,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\nhe advised her to undergo for abortion which was denied by her and\n\nhe also denied to marry her. Accordingly disputes arose between\n\nthem. She submits that having no other alternative, she lodged a\n\nreport before the concerned police on 23.08.2009 and a crime was\n\nregistered against the respondent therein. Then, she gave birth to the\n\n2nd petitioner therein on 26.01.2010. For the above said reasons, she\n\nclaimed maintenance for herself and her child from the respondent\n\ntherein   under   <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_3\">Section    125</a>   of   Cr.P.C   which   is   pending   for\n\nconsideration. After enquiry, when it was posted for arguments, she\n\nalso filed Crl.M.P No.2467 of 2013 in M.C.No.46 of 2011 before the\n\ntrial Court under <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 45</a> of the Indian Evidence Act seeking to\n\nrefer the 2nd petitioner    therein and as well as the sole respondent\n\ntherein for DNA test to determine the paternity of the respondent\n\ntherein with respect to the 2nd petitioner who is a child born to them\n\nallegedly, as the respondent therein denied the relationship with her\n\nintoto and denied the paternity of the child also. Then the respondent\n\ntherein filed a counter opposing the prayer sought for to refer the\n\nparties to DNA test contending that he was tried for the offences\n\npunishable under Sections 417 and 376 of Indian penal Code basing\n\nupon a complaint filed by the petitioner therein in S.C.No.87 of 2011\n\non the file of the Assistant Sessions Judge, Tanuku which was ended\n\nin acquittal on merits and the said Crl.M.P No.2467 of 2013 in\n\nM.C.No. 46 of 2011 on the file of the II Additional Judicial Magistrate\n\nof I Class, Tanuku was filed only to harass and blackmail the\n\nrespondent therein for extraction of money.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4.    After hearing both the sides, the trial court considered the point\n\n&#x27;whether the 2nd petitioner therein is entitled for DNA test as prayed\n\nfor&#x27; by referring the respondent therein for medical examination. The\n\ntrial court observed that as per <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 125</a> of Cr.P.C., the legitimate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          3</span>\n\n\n\n\nand illegitimate child are entitled for maintenance from the father,\n\nbut in this case, the respondent is denying with the acquaintance of\n\nthe 1st petitioner and not agreeing the 2nd petitioner as either\n\nlegitimate or illegitimate child of the 1st petitioner and the respondent\n\ntherein. So that, the trial court felt it necessary to prove the paternity\n\nof the 2nd petitioner to claim maintenance from the respondent and\n\naccordingly allowed the said petition for DNA test to take the blood\n\nsamples of the 2nd petitioner to APFSL, Hyderabad along with the\n\nrespondent, vide order, dated 25.02.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.    Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner herein filed the present\n\nCriminal Petition before this Court seeking to quash the same on the\n\nground that it infringes his right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India and the trial court has no power to compel\n\nhim to undergo for DNA test or any other medical examination to\n\ndetermine the paternity against his will. It is further contended by\n\nthe   petitioner   herein   that   the       1st   respondent   herein   filed   a\n\ncomplaint/report against him under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 376</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1359568/\" id=\"a_8\">418</a> of Indian\n\nPenal Code and the same was charge sheeted and tried in S.C.No.87\n\nof 2011 on the file of the Assistant Sessions Judge, Tanuku which\n\nwas ended in acquittal. Consequent upon dismissal of the said case,\n\nshe again filed M.C.No.46 of 2011 on the file of the II Additional\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class, Tanuku to extract money from him.\n\nSince there is an acquittal of S.C.No.87 of 2011 on the file of the\n\nAssistant Sessions Judge, Tanuku, the trial court ought to have\n\ndrawn a presumption that there is no sexual intercourse between the\n\nparties and dismissed the claim of the 1st respondent herein in\n\nCrl.M.P.No.2467 of 2013 in M.C.46 of 2011 on the file of the\n\nII Additional Judicial Magistrate of I Class, Tanuku.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.

The appellant herein was married to second respondent\n           on 16th January, 1990 according to Hindu Rites and\n           Customs. They lived together for sometime until second\n           respondent left the matrimonial home to reside with her\n           parents in order to prepare for Higher Secondary Examination\n           which commenced on 5.4.90 and continued upto 10.5.90. In\n           the month of April, 1990 she conceived, on coming to know\n           that she was pregnant, the appellant and the family members\n           did not want her to beget a child. Therefore she was forced to\n           undergo abortion which was refused by the second\n           respondent. During the stay She was meted out cruel\n           treatment both physically and mentally. She came back to the\n           matrimonial home during Durga Pooja in the month of\n           October, 1990. A female child was born on 3.1.91. She filed a\n           petition under <a href=\"/doc/94809/\" id=\"a_15\">section 125</a> Cr.

Case No. 143 of 1991 for blood group test of the second\nrespondent and the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">3.    In that proceeding the petitioner herein disputed the\npaternity of the child and prayed for blood group test of the\nchild to prove that he was not the father of the child.\nAccording to him if that could be established he would not be\nliable to pay maintenance. That application was dismissed on\ntwo grounds: (i) there were other methods in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_16\">Evidence Act</a>\nto disprove the paternity; (ii) moreover it is settled law that\nmedical test cannot be conclusive of paternity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">4.    Aggrieved by this order, a revision was preferred before\nthe High Court. Dismissing the revision it was held that\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_17\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act says where during the\ncontinuance of valid marriage if a child is born that is a\nconclusive proof about the legitimacy. This section would\nconstitute a stumbling block in the way of the petitioner\ngetting his paternity disproved by blood group test.\n\n.....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">20. In Bhartiraj v. Sumesh Sachdeo, AIR 1986 Allahabad 259\nheld as (Paras 28 and 32):-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     &quot;Discussing the evidentiary value of blood tests for\ndetermining paternity, Rayden on Divorce, (1983) Vol. 1) p.\n1054 has this to say:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       &quot;Medical Science is able to analyse the blood of\nindividuals into definite groups: and by examining the blood of\na given man and a child to determine whether the man could\nor could not be the father. Blood tests cannot show positively\nthat any man is father, but they can show positively that a\ngiven man could or could not be the father. It is obviously the\nlatter aspect the proves most valuable in determining\npaternity, that is, the exclusion aspect, for once it is\ndetermined that a man could not be the father, he is thereby\nautomatically excluded from considerations of paternity. When\na man is not the father of a child, it has been said that there is\nat least a 70 per cent chance that if blood tests are taken they\nwill show positively he is not the father, and in some cases the\nchance is even higher: between two given men who have had\nsexual intercourse with the mother at the time of conception,\nboth of whom undergo blood tests, it has likewise been said\nthat there is a 80 per cent chance that the tests will show that\none of them is not the father with the irresistible inference that\nthe other is the father.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     The position which emerges on reference to these\nauthoritative texts is that depending on the type of litigation,\nsamples of blood, when subjected to skilled scientific\nexamination, can sometimes supply helpful evidence on\nvarious issues, to exclude a particular parentage set up in the\ncase. But the consideration remains that the party asserting\nthe claim to have a child and the rival set of parents put to\nblood test must establish his right so to do. The court\nexercises protective jurisdiction on behalf of an infant. In my\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                        7</span>\n\n\n\n\n       considered opinion it would be unjust and not fair either to\n       direct a test for a collateral reason to assist a litigant in his or\n       her claim. The child cannot be allowed to suffer because of his\n       incapacity; the aim is to ensure that he gets his rights. If in a\n       case the court has reason to believe that the application for\n       blood test is of a fishing nature or designed for some ulterior\n       motive, it would be justified in not acceding to such a prayer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">       21. The above is the dicta laid down by the various High\n       Courts. In matters of this kind the court must have regard to\n       <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_18\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. This section is based on the\n       well known maxim pater est quem nuptioe demonstrant (he is\n       the father whom the marriage indicates). The presumption of\n       legitimacy is this, that a child born of a married woman is\n       deemed to be legitimate, it throws on the person who is\n       interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole burden of\n       proving it. The law presumes both that a marriage ceremony is\n       valid and that every person is legitimate. Marriage or affiliation\n       (parentage) may be presumed, the law in general presuming\n       against vice and immorality.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">       22. It is a rebuttable presumption of law that a child born.\n       during the lawful wedlock is legitimate, and that access\n       occurred between the parents. This presumption can only be\n       displaced by a strong preponderance of evidence, and not by a\n       mere balance of probabilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">       ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">       26. From the above discussion it emerges:- (1) that courts in\n       India cannot order blood test as matter of course;\n\n       (2) wherever applications are made for such prayers in order\n       to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot be\n       entertained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">       (3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the\n       husband must establish non-access in order to dispel the\n       presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_19\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n        (4) The Court must carefully examine as to what would be\n       the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have\n       the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as\n       an unchaste woman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">       (5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for\n       analysis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">       27. Examined in the light of the above, we find no difficulty\n       in upholding the impugned order of the High Court, confirming\n       the order of the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore in\n       rejecting the application for blood test. We find the purpose of\n       the application is nothing more than to avoid payment of\n       maintenance, without making any ground whatever to have\n       recourse to the test. Accordingly the Special Leave Petition will\n       stand dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">8.    Per contra, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent\n\nherein submits that the impugned order of the trial Court, dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                           8</span>\n\n\n\n\n25.02.2015 is justified and sustainable, as the lis between the\n\npetitioner herein and the 1st respondent herein is a matrimonial\n\ndispute and it is a case of total denial of the petitioner herein\n\nabout his relationship with the 1st respondent herein, denial of\n\nsexual relationship between them, denial of moving together as\n\nhusband and wife and denial of the paternity of the child of the\n\n1st respondent herein. In view of the same, the trial Court was\n\nconstrained to pass such an order in the maintenance case by\n\nreferring to the medical examination/DNA test for the child of\n\nthe 1st respondent herein with that of the petitioner herein.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">9.        In support of the impugned order of the court below, dated\n\n25.02.2015, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent relied\n\nupon a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Sharda v.\n\nDharm Pal2, wherein it was considered and held that:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_10\">&quot;39. <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_20\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) is, therefore, not an\n            authority for the proposition that under no circumstances the\n            Court can direct that blood tests be conducted. It, having\n            regard to the future of the child, has, of course, sounded a\n            note of caution as regard mechanical passing of such order.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">            76. The matter may be considered from another angle. In all\n            such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the\n            ground of impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally without\n            there being medical examination, it would be difficult to arrive\n            at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made by his\n            spouse against the other spouses seeking divorce on such a\n            ground, is correct or not. In order to substantiate such\n            allegation, the petitioner would always insist on medical\n            examination. If respondent avoids such medical examination\n            on the ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or for a\n            matter right to personal liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>\n            of the Constitution of India, then it may in most of such cases\n            become impossible to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the\n            very grounds on which divorce is permissible nugatory.\n            Therefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically\n            conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and with\n            the extensive interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">            this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as\n            absolute right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on\n            this right have to be imposed and particularly where two\n            competing interests clash. In mattes of aforesaid nature where\n            the legislature has conferred a right upon his spouse to seek\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">2</span>\n    (2003) 4 Supreme Court Cases 493\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                            9</span>\n\n\n\n\n            divorce on such grounds, it would be the right of that spouse\n            which comes in conflict with the so-called right to privacy of\n            the respondent. Thus the Court has to reconcile these\n            competing interests by balancing the interests involved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">            77. If for arriving at the satisfaction of the Court and to\n            protect the right of a party to the lis who may otherwise be\n            found to be incapable of protecting his own interest, the Court\n            passes an appropriate order, the question of such action being\n            violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India would not\n            arise. The Court having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n            of India must also see to it that the right of a person to defend\n            himself must be adequately protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">            79. If despite an order passed by the Court, a person refuses\n            to submit himself to such medical examination, a strong case\n            for drawing an adverse inference would be made out <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n            114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act also enables a Court to draw an\n            adverse inference if the party does not produce the relevant\n            evidences in his power an possession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">            80. So viewed, the implicit power of a court to direct medical\n            examination of a party to a matrimonial litigation in a case of\n            this nature cannot be held to be violative of one&#x27;s right of\n            privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">            81.

However, the Court should exercise such a power\n               if the applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is\n               sufficient material before the Court. If despite the order of\n               the court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to\n               medical examination, the court will be entitled to draw an\n               adverse inference against him.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">10.

We direct the petitioner to remain himself present at\nhis residence i.e., Anant Van, FRI Campus, Dehradun,\nUttarakhand, on Tuesday, 29-5-2012, positively.

The Apex Court undoubtedly in Sharda (SCC p.523,\npara 79) has held that &quot;if despite an order passed by the\ncourt, a person refuses to submit himself to such medical\nexamination, a strong case for drawing an adverse\ninference&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 114</a> of the\nEvidence Act would be made out. However, what we are\nconcerned with here is, whether the order of the Court\ndirecting such DNA testing is an unenforceable and\nunimplementable order, the only consequence of voluntary\nnon-compliance whereof is to enable the court to draw\nadverse     inference.   We      find   the     aspect   of\nenforceability/implementability of the order for medical\nexamination to have not been the subject matter of Sharda\nor the other judgments, cited by the counsel for Respondent\n1 before us also.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                11</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">40. Though in the light of what we have held, it is not\nstrictly relevant, but we are unable to restrain ourselves\nfrom recording what the Court of Appeal (Civil Division)\nobserved in H.and A.(Children) (Paternity: Blood Tests), In\nre:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133524703\" id=\"span_16\">&quot;Over thirty years ago in his speech in <a href=\"/doc/133524703/\" id=\"a_29\">S. v. McC\n     Lord Hodson</a> said (AC pp.57 F-58 A)\n\n      &#x27;     ...The only disadvantage to the child which is\nput forward as an argument against the use of a blood test,\nnot for therapeutic purposes but to ascertain paternity, is\nthat the child is exposed to the risk that he may lose the\nprotection of the presumption of legitimacy.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       Without seeking to depreciate the value of this\npresumption it is, I think, fair to say that whatever may\nhave been the position in the past the general attitude\ntowards illegitimacy has changed and the legal incidents of\nbeing born a bastard are now almost non-existent. I need\nnot dilate upon this, for I recognise that it is impossible to\nsay that there is no stigma of bastardy even though it be no\nmore than the indirect stigma of the imputation of\nunchastity to the mother of the child so described. On the\nother hand, it is difficult to conceive of cases where,\nassuming illegitimacy in fact, it is to the advantage of the\nchild that this legal status of         legitimacy should be\npreserved only perhaps to be displaced by firm evidence of\nillegitimacy decided later in his or her life from a blood test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      The interests of justice in the abstract are best served\nby the ascertainment of the truth and there must be few\ncases where the interests of children can be shown to be\nbest served by the suppression of truth. Scientific evidence\nof blood groups has been available since the early part of\nthis century and the progress of serology has been so rapid\nthat in many cases certainty or near certainty can be\nreached in the ascertainment of paternity. Why should the\nrisk be taken of a judicial decision being made which is\nfactually wrong and may later be demonstrated to be\nwrong?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      Those principles have been consistently applied in\nsubsequent cases, including H.(A Minor) (Blood Tests:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">Parental Rights), In re and T.(A Child)(DNA Tests: Paternity),\nIn re.     The Judge sought to distinguish those two\nauthorities in his concluding paragraph, which I have cited\nabove. It draws the distinction that in those two cases there\nwere serious doubts as to the husband&#x27;s procreative\ncapacities. I do not consider that the factual distinction\nbegins to displace the points of principle to be drawn from\nthe cases, first that the interests of justice are best served by\nthe ascertainment of the truth and second that the court\nshould be furnished with the best available science and not\nconfined to such unsatisfactory alternatives as the\npresumptions and inferences. It seems to me obvious that\nall the Lord Hoson expressed in the passage that I have\ncited applies with even greater force and logic in a later era.\nFirst there have been huge scientific advances with the\narrival of DNA testing. Scientists no longer require blood,\nthus removing what for some is the unbearable process of its\nextraction. Of even greater importance is the abandonment of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                           12</span>\n\n\n\n\n            the legal concept of legitimacy achieved by the Family Law\n            Act, 1987&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">            It was further observed that paternity of any child is to be\n            established by science and not by legal presumption or\n            inference or by a long and acrimonious trial. ...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100486606\" id=\"span_18\">56. Recently in <a href=\"/doc/100486606/\" id=\"a_30\">Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes v.\n           Erasmo Jack</a> de Sequeira, it was reiterated that the truth is\n           the guiding star and the quest in the judicial process and\n           the voyage of trial. The trend world over of full disclosure\n           by the parties and deployment of powers to ensure that the\n           scope of factual controversy is minimised was noticed. We\n           are therefore of the opinion that adverse inference from non-\n           compliance cannot be a substitute to the enforceability of a\n           direction for DNA testing. The valuable right of the appellant\n           under the said direction, to prove his paternity through\n           such DNA testing cannot be taken away by asking the\n           appellant to be satisfied with the comparatively weak\n           &quot;adverse inference&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">            57. The impugned judgment refers extensively to the law\n            in this regard in other countries. We are however of the\n            opinion that once the Supreme Court in the judgments\n            supra has held the civil court entitled to issue such a\n            direction, the law in other jurisdictions pales into\n            insignificance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">            58. We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order\n            dated    23-9-2011.    We    further   clarify   that    the\n            observations/findings therein on any of the aspects which\n            we find to be unnecessary and for which reason we have not\n            gone into the challenge thereto shall not be binding at a\n            subsequent stage of the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">            59. We further deem it necessary to now clarify the\n            procedure to be followed for compliance with the direction\n            contained in the order dated 23-12-2010. Upon Respondent\n            1 continuing to defy the order, the Single Judge shall be\n            entitled to take police assistance and use of reasonable\n            force for compliance therewith.

For the purpose of persuasive value, the learned counsel for the\n\n1st respondent also relied upon another decision of the High Court of\n\nChattisgarh in the matter of Rameshwari Bai; Prakash Kumar;\n\nHarendra Kumar v. Ishwar Lal Sahu4, wherein it was considered\n\nand held:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                 &quot;In the context of the aforesaid principle, in the instant\n            case, when the prayer made by the minor children are\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">4</span>\n    2017(4) CgLJ 258\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       13</span>\n\n\n\n\n       examined, it would show that an application was made\n       initially but the same was not allowed as the non-applicant\n       did not agree for same. In the second application, it was\n       stated that earlier application for rejection of DNA test was\n       not informed by the then amicus curie. The Court can not\n       ignore the fact that the claimants herein are minors who\n       claims their paternity to the non-applicant as father. If the\n       wishes of the non-applicant are upheld then in such case\n       the Court would be helpless to answer to the question of\n       minors. The claim for maintenance is presently pending on\n       behalf of minors. The non-applicant appears to avoid the\n       claim has disowned the relations. In Indian social back\n       ground, when a lady has claimed that she begotten the\n       children out of the relations with that of non- applicant, the\n       same cannot be shelved on a mere denial. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_22\">In the facts of the\n       case if the application for DNA test if is refused then it can\n       be very well assumed that the paternity of the child cannot\n       be established at any point of time in near future. It is also\n       the right of the minor child to know about his parents\n       specially when where specific averments made against a\n       person that he is the father. Therefore, simply by making a\n       submission that non-applicant do not wish to get himself\n       examined for DNA test cannot be appreciated. The Supreme\n       Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_31\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a> also held that the final\n       wish of the father cannot be the end point as the\n       proposition of case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_32\">Goutam Kundu v. State of W.B</a> is not\n       an authority. Under the circumstances, the Court can direct\n       that blood test to be conducted. It is having regard to the\n       future of the child, if it is in the interest of the child certain\n       prayer can always be allowed. Further, as has been held in\n       case of Narayan Dutt Tiwari &amp; Dipanwita Roy, the Supreme\n       Court has observed that in case of eminent need, the Court\n       can always direct for test for DNA.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       14. Taking into such principles and after translating them\n       into the present circumstances of this case, considering the\n       future of the child, the question of paternity cannot be left\n       in infinity and uncertainty can be allowed to loom large for\n       all the time to come for the children. Considering the facts\n       and circumstances of the case, the Court is of the opinion\n       that the DNA test of the respondent cannot be refused when\n       it is claimed by the minor children as under the facts it\n       would be of eminent need.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       15. In view of the above, the order dated 06.08.2014 is set\n       aside and accordingly, the application to conduct DNA test\n       of non-applicant is allowed. Consequently, the criminal\n       revision stands allowed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">12.
