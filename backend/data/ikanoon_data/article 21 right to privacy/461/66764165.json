According to the plain language of <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 19</a> of\nthe Act, 2005, any person who, does not receive a decision\nwithin the time specified in sub-section (1) or clause (a) of\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/71945405/\" id=\"a_22\">section 7</a>, or is aggrieved by a decision of\nthe Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\nInformation Officer, as the case may be, may within thirty\ndays from the expiry of such period or from the receipt of\nsuch a decision file an appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">20.

It is thus, evident by harmonizing <a href=\"/doc/159469090/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 19(1)</a>\nand (3) that a person who does not receive a decision within\nthe time specified in sub-section (1) or clause (a) of sub-\nsection (3) of <a href=\"/doc/71945405/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 7</a>, or is aggrieved by a decision of the\nCentral Public Information Officer or the State Public\nInformation Officer can file the first appeal and if he is not\nsatisfied with the decision can file second appeal under\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 19</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">22.

There is another flaw in the order passed by the\nfirst    appellate     authority.    Respondent     no.2     has   only\nmentioned Appeal No.1 of 2014. Only one appeal was\nmaintainable against the rejection of one application. The\nfirst    appellate     authority     could    not   decide    multiple\napplications in a single appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">24.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2120073\" id=\"span_5\">In 2011 (15) SCC 1, in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/2120073/\" id=\"a_29\">Chief\nInformation Commissioner &amp; another vs. State of Manipur &amp;\nanother</a>&quot;, their Lordships of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nhave held that the nature of the power under <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 18</a> is\nsupervisory in character whereas the procedure under\n<a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 19</a> is an appellate procedure and a person who is\naggrieved by refusal in receiving the information which he\nhas sought for can only seek redress in the manner\nprovided in the statute, namely, by following the procedure\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 19</a>. <a href=\"/doc/71945405/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 19</a> provides a\ncomplete statutory mechanism to a person who is aggrieved\nby refusal to receive information. Their Lordships have\nfurther held that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_35\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>\nstrengthens democracy through informed citizenry but at\nthe same time balancing this ideal with overall State\ninterest of preserving where confidentiality is required.\nTheir Lordships have held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               &quot;6. As its Preamble shows, the Act was enacted to\n        promote transparency and accountability in the working of\n        every public authority in order to strengthen the core\n        constitutional values of a democratic republic. It is clear that\n        Parliament enacted the said Act keeping in mind the rights of\n        an informed citizenry in which transparency of information is\n        vital in curbing corruption and making the Government and its\n        instrumentalities accountable. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_36\">The Act</a> is meant to harmonise\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              6</span>\n\n\nthe conflicting interests of the Government to preserve the\nconfidentiality of sensitive information with the right of citizens\nto know the functioning of the governmental process in such a\nway as to preserve the paramountcy of the democratic ideal.\nThe Preamble would obviously show that the Act is based on\nthe concept of an open society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_7\">7. On the emerging concept of an &quot;open Government&quot;, about\nmore than three decades ago, the Constitution Bench of this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/438670/\" id=\"a_37\">State of U.P. v. Raj Narain1</a> speaking through Mathew,\nJ. held: (SCC p. 453, para 74)\n        &quot;74. ... The people of this country have a right to know\n        every public act, everything that is done in a public way,\n        by their public functionaries. They are entitled to know\n        the particulars of every public transaction in all its\n        bearing. The right to know, which is derived from the\n        concept of freedom of speech, though not absolute, is a\n        factor which should make one wary, when secrecy is\n        claimed for transactions which can, at any rate, have no\n        repercussion on public security.* To cover with veil of\n        secrecy, the common routine business, is not in the\n        interest of the public. Such secrecy can seldom be\n        legitimately desired.&quot; (AIR p. 884, para 74)\n                                               (emphasis supplied)</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112850760\" id=\"span_8\">8. Another Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_38\">S.P. Gupta v. Union of India2</a>\nrelying on the ratio in Raj Narain1 held: (S.P. Gupta case2,\nSCC p. 275, para 67)\n        &quot;67. ... The concept of an open Government is the direct\n        emanation from the right to know which seems to be\n        implicit in the right of free speech and expression\n        guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Therefore, disclosure\n        of information in regard to the functioning of Government\n        must be the rule and secrecy an exception justified only\n        where the strictest requirement of public interest so\n        demands. The approach of the court must be to\n        attenuate the area of secrecy as much as possible\n        consistently with the requirement of public interest,\n        bearing in mind all the time that disclosure also serves\n        an important aspect of public interest.&quot; (AIR p. 234, para</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        66)\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">9. It is, therefore, clear from the ratio in the above decisions of\nthe Constitution Bench of this Court that the right to\ninformation, which is basically founded on the right to know, is\nan intrinsic part of the fundamental right to free speech and\nexpression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution. The said Act was, thus, enacted to consolidate\nthe fundamental right of free speech.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">17. However, while considering the width and sweep of this\nright as well as its fundamental importance in a democratic\nrepublic, this Court is also conscious that such a right is\nsubject to reasonable restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\nConstitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">39. The nature of the power under <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 18</a> is supervisory in\ncharacter whereas the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 19</a> is an\nappellate procedure and a person who is aggrieved by refusal in\nreceiving the information which he has sought for can only\nseek redress in the manner provided in the statute, namely, by\nfollowing the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 19</a>. This Court is,\ntherefore, of the opinion that <a href=\"/doc/71945405/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 19</a>\nprovides a complete statutory mechanism to a person who is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    7</span>\n\n\n      aggrieved by refusal to receive information. Such person has to\n      get the information by following the aforesaid statutory\n      provisions. The contention of the appellant that information\n      can be accessed through <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 18</a> is contrary to the express\n      provision of <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 19</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      48. Apart from that the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 19</a> of the Act,\n      when compared to <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 18</a>, has several safeguards for\n      protecting the interest of the person who has been refused the\n      information he has sought. <a href=\"/doc/31350714/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 19(5)</a>, in this connection,\n      may be referred to. <a href=\"/doc/31350714/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 19(5)</a> puts the onus to justify the\n      denial of request on the Information Officer. Therefore, it is for\n      the officer to justify the denial. There is no such safeguard in\n      <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 18</a>. Apart from that the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 19</a> is\n      a time-bound one but no limit is prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 18</a>.\n      So out of the two procedures, between <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_57\">Section\n      19</a>, the one under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 19</a> is more beneficial to a person\n      who has been denied access to information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      49. There is another aspect also. The procedure under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_59\">Section\n      19</a> is an appellate procedure. A right of appeal is always a\n      creature of statute. A right of appeal is a right of entering a\n      superior forum for invoking its aid and interposition to correct\n      errors of the inferior forum. It is a very valuable right.\n      Therefore, when the statute confers such a right of appeal that\n      must be exercised by a person who is aggrieved by reason of\n      refusal to be furnished with the information.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">25.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19607639\" id=\"span_10\">In 2013 (1) SCC 745, in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/19607639/\" id=\"a_60\">Namit\nSharma vs. Union of India</a>&quot;, their Lordships of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court have held that commissions have trappings\nof tribunals functioning on court pattern, as opposed to\nbeing administrative bodied.

Neither the Act of 2002 nor the Act of 2005, under their\n      repeal provision, repeals the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_63\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_64\">The Act</a>\n      of 2005 only repeals the <a href=\"/doc/411331/\" id=\"a_65\">Freedom of Information Act, 2002</a> in\n      terms of <a href=\"/doc/106875435/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 31</a>. It was felt that under the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_67\">Official Secrets\n      Act, 1923</a>, the entire development process had been shrouded\n      in secrecy and practically the public had no legal right to know\n      as to what process had been followed in designing the policies\n      affecting them and how the programmes and schemes were\n      being implemented. Lack of openness in the functioning of the\n      Government provided a fertile ground for growth of inefficiency\n      and corruption in the working of the public authorities. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_68\">The Act</a>\n      of 2005 was intended to remedy this widespread evil and\n      provide appropriate links to the Government. It was also\n      expected to bring reforms in the environmental, economic and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                              8</span>\n\n\nhealth sectors, which were primarily being controlled by the\nGovernment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">41. The Central and State Information Commissions have\nplayed a critical role in enforcing the provisions of the Act of\n2005, as well as in educating the information seekers and\nproviders about their statutory rights and obligations. Some\nsection of experts opined that the Act of 2005 has been a useful\nstatutory instrument in achieving the goal of providing free and\neffective information to the citizens as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_69\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. It is true that democratisation of\ninformation and knowledge resources is critical for people&#x27;s\nempowerment especially to realise the entitlements as well as\nto augment opportunities for enhancing the options for\nimproving the quality of life. Still of greater significance is the\ninclusion of privacy or certain protection in the process of\ndisclosure, under the right to information under the Act.\nSometimes, information ought not to be disclosed in the larger\npublic interest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">52. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 12(5)</a> do not discuss the basic\nqualification needed, but refer to two components: (a) persons\nof eminence in public life; and (b) with wide knowledge and\nexperience in the fields stated in the provision. The provision,\nthus, does not suffer from the infirmity of providing no criteria\nresulting in the introduction of the element of arbitrariness or\ndiscrimination. The provisions require the persons to be of\neminence and with knowledge in the stated fields. Knowledge\nand experience in these fields normally shall be preceded by a\nminimum requisite qualification prescribed in that field. For\nexample, knowledge and experience in the field of law would\npresuppose a person to be a law graduate. Similarly, a person\nwith wide knowledge and experience in the field of science and\ntechnology would invariably be expected to be at least a\ngraduate or possess basic qualification in science and\ntechnology. The vagueness in the expression &quot;social service&quot;,\n&quot;mass media&quot; or &quot;administration and governance&quot; does create\nsome doubt. But certainly, this vagueness or doubt does not\nintroduce the element of discrimination in the provision. The\npersons from these various walks of life are considered eligible\nfor appointment to the post of Chief Information Commissioner\nand Information Commissioners in the respective Information\nCommissions. This gives a wide zone of consideration and this\nalleged vagueness can always be clarified by the appropriate\nGovernment in exercise of its powers under <a href=\"/doc/83364027/\" id=\"a_71\">Sections 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/199593775/\" id=\"a_72\">28</a>\nof the Act, respectively.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">Constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 12(6)</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">53. Similarly, as stated above, sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 12</a>\ncreates in a way a disqualification in terms thereof. This\nprovision does have an element of uncertainty and\nindefiniteness. Upon its proper construction, an issue as to\nwhat class of persons are eligible to be appointed to these\nposts, would unexceptionally arise. According to this provision,\na person to be appointed to these posts ought not to have been\ncarrying on any business or pursuing any profession. It is\ndifficult to say what the person eligible under the provision\nshould be doing and for what period. The section does not\nspecify any such period. Normally, the persons would fall\nunder one or the other unacceptable categories. To put it\ndifferently, by necessary implication, it excludes practically all\nclasses while not specifying as to which class of persons is\neligible to be appointed to that post. The exclusion is too vague,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                              9</span>\n\n\nwhile inclusion is uncertain. It creates a situation of confusion\nwhich could not have been the intent of law. It is also not clear\nas to what classification the framers of the Act intended to lay\ndown. The classification does not appear to have any nexus\nwith the object of the Act. There is no intelligible differentia to\nsupport such classification. Which class is intended to be\nprotected and is to be made exclusively eligible for appointment\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_75\">Sections 12(5)</a> and (6) is something that is not\nunderstandable. Wherever the legislature wishes to exercise its\npower of classification, there it has to be a reasonable\nclassification, satisfying the tests discussed above. No rules\nhave been brought to our notice which even intend to explain\nthe vagueness and inequality explicit in the language of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_76\">Section\n12(6)</a>. According to the petitioner, it tantamounts to an\nabsolute bar because the legislature cannot be stated to have\nintended that only the persons who are ideal within the terms\nof sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 12</a>, would be eligible to be\nappointed to the post. If we read the language of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_78\">Sections 12(5)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_79\">12(6)</a> together, the provisions under sub-section (6) appear\nto be in conflict with those under sub-section (5). Sub-section\n(5) requires the person to have eminence in public life and wide\nknowledge and experience in the specified field. On the\ncontrary, sub-section (6) requires that the person should not\nhold any office of profit, be connected with any political party\nor carry on any business or pursue any profession. The object\nof sub-section (5) stands partly frustrated by the language of\nsub-section (6). In other words, sub-section (6) lacks clarity,\nreasonable classification and has no nexus to the object of the\nAct of 2005 and if construed on its plain language, it would\nresult in defeating the provisions of sub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_80\">Section\n12</a> to some extent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">54. The legislature is required to exercise its power in\nconformity with the constitutional mandate, particularly\ncontained in Part III of the Constitution. If the impugned\nprovision denies equality and the right of equal consideration,\nwithout reasonable classification, the courts would be bound to\ndeclare it invalid. <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 12(6)</a> does not speak of the class of\neligible persons, but practically debars all persons from being\nappointed to the post of Chief Information Commissioner or\nInformation Commissioners at the Centre and State levels,\nrespectively. It will be difficult for the Court to comprehend as\nto which class of persons is intended to be covered under this\nclause. The rule of disqualification has to be construed strictly.\nIf anyone, who is an elected representative, in government\nservice, or one who is holding an office of profit, carrying on\nany business or profession, is ineligible in terms of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_82\">Section\n12(6)</a>, then the question arises as to what class of persons\nwould be eligible? The section is silent on that behalf.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">55. The element of arbitrariness and discrimination is\nevidenced by the language of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 12(6)</a> itself, which can be\nexamined from another point of view. No period has been\nstated for which the person is expected to not have carried on\nany business or pursued any profession. It could be one day or\neven years prior to his nomination. It is not clear as to how the\npersons falling in either of these classes can be stated to be\ndifferently placed. This uncertainty is bound to bring in the\nelement of discrimination and arbitrariness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">56. Having noticed the presence of the element of\ndiscrimination and arbitrariness in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_84\">Section\n12(6)</a> of the Act, we now have to examine whether this Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                             10</span>\n\n\nshould declare this provision ultra vires the Constitution or\nread it down to give it its possible effect, despite the drawbacks\nnoted above. We have already noticed that the Court will\nnormally adopt an approach which is tilted in favour of\nconstitutionality and would prefer reading down the provision,\nif necessary, by adding some words rather than declaring it\nunconstitutional. Thus, we would prefer to interpret the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 12(6)</a> as applicable post-appointment\nrather than pre-appointment of the Chief Information\nCommissioner and Information Commissioners. In other words,\nthese disqualifications will only come into play once a person is\nappointed as Chief Information Commissioner/Information\nCommissioner at any level and he will cease to hold any office\nof profit or carry on any business or pursue any profession that\nhe did prior to such appointment. It is thus implicit in this\nprovision that a person cannot hold any of the posts specified\nin sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 12</a> simultaneous to his\nappointment       as   Chief   Information      Commissioner    or\nInformation Commissioner. In fact, cessation of his previous\nappointment, business or profession is a condition precedent to\nthe commencement of his appointment as Chief Information\nCommissioner or Information Commissioner.\nConstitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 12(5)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">57. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_88\">The Act</a> of 2005 was enacted to harmonise the conflicting\ninterests while preserving the paramountcy of the democratic\nideal and provide for furnishing of certain information to the\ncitizens who desire to have it. The basic purpose of the Act is to\nset up a practical regime of right to information for the citizens\nto secure and access information under the control of the\npublic authorities. The intention is to provide and promote\ntransparency and accountability in the functioning of the\nauthorities. This right of the public to be informed of the\nvarious aspects of governance by the State is a prerequisite of\nthe democratic value. The right to privacy too, is to be\nprotected as both these rival interests find their origin under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. This brings in the need for\nan effective adjudicatory process. The authority or tribunals are\nassigned the responsibility of determining the rival contentions\nand drawing a balance between the two conflicting interests.\nThat is where the scheme, purpose and the object of the Act of\n2005 attain greater significance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">58. In order to examine whether <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act suffers\nfrom the vice of discrimination or inequality, we may discuss\nthe adjudicatory functions of the authorities under the Act in\nthe backdrop of the scheme of the Act of 2005, as discussed\nabove. The authorities who have to perform adjudicatory\nfunctions of quasi-judicial content are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">              1. The Central/State Public Information Officer;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">              2. Officers senior in rank to the Central/State\n              Public Information Officer to whom an appeal\n              would lie under Section 19(1) of the Act; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              3. The Information Commission (Central/State)\n              consisting of Chief Information Commissioner and\n              Information Commissioners.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">59. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 12(5)</a>, the Chief Information\nCommissioner and Information Commissioners should be the\npersons of eminence in public life with wide knowledge in the\nprescribed fields. We have already indicated that the\nterminology used by the legislature, such as &quot;mass media&quot; or\n&quot;administration and governance&quot;, are terms of uncertain tenor\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                              11</span>\n\n\nand amplitude. It is somewhat difficult to state with exactitude\nas to what class of persons would be eligible under these\ncategories.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">60. The legislature in its wisdom has chosen not to provide any\nspecific qualification, but has primarily prescribed &quot;wide\nknowledge and experience&quot; in the cited subjects as the criteria\nfor selection. It is not for the courts to spell out what ought to\nbe the qualifications or experience for appointment to a\nparticular post. Suffice it to say, that if the legislature itself\nprovides &quot;knowledge and experience&quot; as the basic criteria of\neligibility for appointment, this per se, would not attract the\nrigours of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. On a reasonable and\npurposive interpretation, it will be appropriate to interpret and\nread into <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 12(5)</a> that the &quot;knowledge and experience&quot; in\na particular subject would be deemed to include the basic\nqualification in that subject. We would prefer such an\napproach than to hold it to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution. <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 12(5)</a> has inbuilt guidelines to the effect\nthat knowledge and experience, being two distinct concepts,\nshould be construed in their correct perspective. This would\ninclude the basic qualification as well as an experience in the\nrespective field, both being the prerequisites for this section.\nAmbiguity, if any, resulting from the language of the provision\nis insignificant, being merely linguistic in nature and, as\nalready noticed, the same is capable of being clarified by\nframing appropriate rules in exercise of powers of the Central\nGovernment under <a href=\"/doc/83364027/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 27</a> of the Act of 2005. We are\nunable to find that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 12(5)</a> suffer from\nthe vice of arbitrariness or discrimination. However, without\nhesitation, we would hasten to add that certain requirements of\nlaw and procedure would have to be read into this provision to\nsustain its constitutionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">61. It is a settled principle of law, as stated earlier, that courts\nwould generally adopt an interpretation which is favourable to\nand tilts towards the constitutionality of a statute, with the aid\nof the principles like &quot;reading into&quot; and/or &quot;reading down&quot; the\nrelevant provisions, as opposed to declaring a provision\nunconstitutional. The courts can also bridge the gaps that have\nbeen left by the legislature inadvertently. We are of the\nconsidered view that both these principles have to be applied\nwhile interpreting <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 12(5)</a>. It is the application of these\nprinciples that would render the provision constitutional and\nnot opposed to the doctrine of equality. Rather the application\nof the provision would become more effective.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">62. Certainty to vague expressions, like &quot;social service&quot; and\n&quot;mass media&quot;, can be provided under the provisions which are\ncapable of being explained by framing of proper rules or even\nby way of judicial pronouncements. In order to examine the\nscope of this provision and its ramifications on the other parts\nof the Act of 2005, it is important to refer back to the scheme of\nthe Act. Under the provisions of the Act, particularly <a href=\"/doc/26746716/\" id=\"a_99\">Sections\n4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/161704022/\" id=\"a_100\">12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_101\">18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_102\">19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/63569722/\" id=\"a_103\">20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/24051230/\" id=\"a_104\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/113662804/\" id=\"a_105\">23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/144451093/\" id=\"a_106\">25</a>, it is clear that the Central or\nState Information Commission, as the case may be, not only\nexercises adjudicatory powers of a nature no different than a\njudicial tribunal, but is vested with the powers of a civil court\nas well. Therefore, it is required to decide a lis, where\ninformation is required by a person and its furnishing is\ncontested by the other. The Commission exercises two kinds of\npenal powers: firstly, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/95274179/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 20(1)</a>, it can impose\npenalty upon the defaulters or violators of the provisions of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                              12</span>\n\n\nAct and, secondly, <a href=\"/doc/162284238/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 20(2)</a> empowers the Central and the\nState Information Commission to conduct an enquiry and\ndirect the disciplinary authority concerned to take appropriate\naction against the erring officer in accordance with law. Hence,\nthe Commission has powers to pass orders having civil as well\nas penal consequences. Besides this, the Commission has been\ngiven monitoring and recommendatory powers. In terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/113662804/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 23</a>, the jurisdiction of the civil courts has been\nexpressly barred.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">72. The Information Commission, as a body, performs\nfunctions of wide magnitude, through its members, including\nadjudicatory, supervisory as well as penal functions. Access to\ninformation is a statutory right. This right, as indicated above,\nis subject to certain constitutional and statutory limitations.\n<a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_110\">The Act</a> of 2005 itself spells out exempted information as well\nas the areas where the Act would be inoperative. The Central\nand State Information Commissioners have been vested with\nthe power to decline furnishing of an information under certain\ncircumstances and in the specified situations. For disclosure of\ninformation, which involves the question of prejudice to a third\nparty, the authority concerned is required to issue notice to the\nthird party who can make a representation and such\nrepresentation is to be dealt with in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Act of 2005. This position of law in India is in\nclear contrast to the law prevailing in some other countries\nwhere information involving a third party cannot be disclosed\nwithout consent of that party. However, the authority can\ndirect such disclosure, for reasons to be recorded, stating that\nthe public interest outweighs the private interest. Thus, it\ninvolves an adjudicatory process where parties are required to\nbe heard, appropriate directions are to be issued, the orders\nare required to be passed upon due application of mind and for\nvalid reasons. The exercise of powers and passing of the orders\nby the authorities concerned under the provisions of the Act of\n2005 cannot be arbitrary. It has to be in consonance with the\nprinciples of natural justice and the procedure evolved by such\nauthority. Natural justice has three indispensable facets i.e.\ngrant of notice, grant of hearing and passing of reasoned\norders. It cannot be disputed that the authorities under the Act\nof 2005 and the tribunals are discharging quasi-judicial\nfunctions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">73. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1158072\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/1158072/\" id=\"a_111\">Indian National Congress (I) v. Institute of Social\nWelfare32</a> the Court explained that where there are two or\nmore parties contesting each other&#x27;s claim and the statutory\nauthority is required to adjudicate the rival claims between the\nparties, such a statutory authority can be held to be quasi-\njudicial and the decision rendered by it as a quasi-judicial\norder. Thus, where there is a lis between the two contesting\nparties and the statutory authority is required to decide such a\ndispute, in absence of any other attributes of a quasi-judicial\nauthority, such a statutory authority is a quasi-judicial\nauthority. The legal principles which emerge from the various\njudgments laying down when an act of a statutory authority\nwould be a quasi-judicial act are that where (a) a statutory\nauthority empowered under a statute to do any act (b) which\nwould prejudicially affect the subject (c) although there is no lis\nor two contending parties and the contest is between the\nauthority and the subject, and (d) the statutory authority is\nrequired to act judicially under the statute, the decision of the\nsaid authority is quasi-judicial.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                 13</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">   74. In other words, an authority is described as quasi-judicial\n   when it has some attributes or trappings of judicial provisions\n   but not all. In the matter before us, there is a lis. The request\n   of a party seeking information is allowed or disallowed by the\n   authorities below and is contested by both parties before the\n   Commission. There may also be cases where a third party is\n   prejudicially affected by disclosure of the information requested\n   for. It is clear that the authorities concerned, particularly the\n   Information Commission, possess the essential attributes and\n   trappings of a court. Its powers and functions, as defined\n   under the Act of 2005 also sufficiently indicate that it has\n   adjudicatory powers quite akin to the court system. They\n   adjudicate matters of serious consequences. The Commission\n   may be called upon to decide how far the right to information is\n   affected where information sought for is denied or whether the\n   information asked for is &quot;exempted&quot; or impinges upon the\n   &quot;right to privacy&quot; or where it falls in the &quot;no-go area&quot; of\n   applicability of the Act. It is not mandatory for the authorities\n   to allow all requests for information in a routine manner. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_112\">The\n   Act</a> of 2005 imposes an obligation upon the authorities to\n   examine each matter seriously being fully cautious of its\n   consequences and effects on the rights of others. It may be a\n   simple query for information but can have far-reaching\n   consequences upon the right of a third party or an individual\n   with regard to whom such information is sought. Undue inroad\n   into the right to privacy of an individual which is protected\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India or any other law in\n   force would not be permissible. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_114\">Gobind v.

An authority which exercises\n   judicial functions or functions analogous to the judicial\n   authorities would normally be termed as &quot;quasi-judicial&quot;. In\n   Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn., 2005) by P. Ramanatha\n   Aiyar, the expression &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; is explained as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">   &quot;Quasi-judicial.--Of, relating to, or involving an executive or\nadministrative official&#x27;s adjudicative acts. Quasi-judicial acts,\nwhich are valid if there is no abuse of discretion, often determine\nthe fundamental rights of citizens. They are subject to review by\ncourts. (Black&#x27;s, 7th Edn., 1999)\n          &#x27;Quasi-judicial is a term that is ... not easily definable. In\n          the United States, the phrase often covers judicial\n          decisions taken by an administrative agency--the test is\n          the nature of the tribunal rather than what it is doing. In\n          England quasi-judicial belongs to the administrative\n          category and is used to cover situations where the\n          administrator is bound by the law to observe certain\n          forms and possibly hold a public hearing but where he is\n          a free agent in reaching the final decision.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/906698/\" id=\"a_117\">State of H.P. v. Mahendra Pal35</a> held that the\n          expression &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; has been termed to be one which\n          stands midway a judicial and an administrative function. If the\n          authority has any express statutory duty to act judicially in\n          arriving at the decision in question, it would be deemed to be\n          quasi-judicial. Where the function to determine a dispute is\n          exercised by virtue of an executive discretion rather than the\n          application of law, it is a quasi-judicial function. A quasi-\n          judicial act requires that a decision is to be given not arbitrarily\n          or in mere discretion of the authority but according to the facts\n          and circumstances of the case as determined upon an enquiry\n          held by the authority after giving an opportunity to the affected\n          parties of being heard or wherever necessary of leading\n          evidence in support of their contention. The authority and the\n          tribunal constituted under the provisions of the Act of 2005 are\n          certainly quasi-judicial authority/tribunal performing judicial\n          functions.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">26.
