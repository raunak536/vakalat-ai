the\n\nFundamental Right of the Minority Community guaranteed\n\nu/a 30 of the Constitution is interpreted by the Apex Court\n\nas having widest amplitude; petitioners&#x27; right to have the\n\nservices   of    the    candidates      (passing   out    from   its\n\ninstitutions) exploited for the benefit of the Community is a\n\npart of its Fundamental Right to establish and administer\n\nthe institution;

may not be\n   difficult in many cases but the problem arises acutely\n   in certain types of situations. The important ones are\n   where a law is not a direct restriction or the right but\n   is designed to accomplish another objective and the\n   impact upon the right is secondary or indirect.\n   Measure- which are directed other forms of activities\n   but which have a secondary or indirect or incidental\n   effect upon the right do not generally abridge a right\n   unless the content of the right is regulated. As we\n   have already said, such measures would include\n   various types of taxes, economic regulations, laws\n   regulating tile wages, measures to promote health\n   and to preserve hygiene and other laws of general\n   application. By hypothesis, the law, taken by itself,\n   is a legitimate one, aimed directly at the control of\n   some other activity. The question is about its\n   secondary impact upon the admitted area of\n   administration of educational institutions. This is\n   especially a problem of determining when the\n   regulation in issue has an effect which constitutes an\n   abridgement of the constitutional right within the\n   meaning of <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 13(2).</a> In other words, in every\n   case, the court must undertake to define and give\n   content to the word &#x27;bridge&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 13(2)(1).</a> The\n   question to be asked and answered is whether the\n   particular measure is regulatory or whether it crosses\n   the zone of permissible regulation and enters the\n   forbidden territory of restrictions or abridgement. So,\n   even if an educational institution established\n   by a religious or linguistic minority does not\n   seek recognition, affiliation or aid, its activity\n   can be regulated in various ways provided the\n   regulations do not take away or abridge the\n   guaranteed right.

It cannot be disputed that the\n\ndefinition of &#x27;University&#x27; given<a href=\"/doc/185772257/\" id=\"a_188\"> u/s.2(g)</a> of the impugned Act\n\nfalls in this category and therefore suffice it to say, that the\n\nNIMHANS        was a society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/154328389/\" id=\"a_189\">Karnataka\n\nSocieties Registration Act, 1960</a> on 27.12.1974; now it is a\n\nbody corporate constituted under Sec.4 of The National\n\nInstitute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences, Bengaluru\n\nAct, 2012. There is nothing either in the impugned Act or\n\nunder the NIMHANS Act to suggest that the said body\n\ncorporate answers the definition of University<a href=\"/doc/185772257/\" id=\"a_190\"> u/s.2(g)</a> of\n\nthe impugned Act.
