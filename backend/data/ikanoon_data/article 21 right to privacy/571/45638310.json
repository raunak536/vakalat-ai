These two writ petitions have been filed\n\n                 with regard to an incident which is alleged to be\n\n                 occurred in the premises of the High Court on\n\n                 07.02.2017.\n\n                 2</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">.         The first writ petition is filed by the High\n\n                 Court Bar Association, Odisha, on behalf of the\n\n                 lawyers of Orissa High Court praying that a Judicial\n\n                 Commission be constituted to enquire into the alleged\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                        3</span>\n\n\n\n\nincident which had occurred on 07.02.2017 and also\n\nfor issue of a direction to the Press as well as\n\nElectronic   Media    not   to   publish   or   telecast\n\ncolourable, exaggerated, unverified and unnecessary\n\nnews on the issue involved in the matter, as it will\n\nnot only worsen the situation, but completely tarnish\n\nand damage the reputation of the institution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">3.           The second writ petition has been filed by\n\na practicing advocate of Orissa High Court with\n\nsimilar prayers. For the present, the prayer which is\n\npressed by the petitioners is for an interim direction\n\nto the Print and Electronic Media not to publish any\n\nnews with regard to the alleged incident, as the same\n\nis tarnishing the image of the High Court as an\n\ninstitution, and lawyers in general.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">4.           We shall treat the writ petition No. 2711\n\nof 2017 as the leading petition. In the said writ\n\npetition, the State of Odisha; Director General and\n\nInspector General of Police; and the informant of the\n\nincident; are arrayed as opposite parties 1, 2 and 3\n\nrespectively. Various Print and Electronic Media\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                         4</span>\n\n\n\n\nPublishers/Channels have also been arrayed as\n\nopposite parties no. 4 to 16. The Registrar General of\n\nOrissa High Court has been arrayed as proforma\n\nopposite party no.17.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">5.            We have heard Sri Ashok Mohanty and\n\nSri Ashok Parija, learned Senior Counsel along with\n\nSri Asim Amitav Das, Sri K.P.Mishra and Sri\n\nKarunakar Das, learned counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the petitioner in the first writ petition; as well as\n\nSri Shivshankar Mohanty- petitioner, a practicing\n\nadvocate, in the second writ petition. We have also\n\nheard   Sri    R.K.Mohapatra,     learned    Government\n\nAdvocate appearing on behalf of the State-opposite\n\nparties. Sri S.P.Mishra, learned Advocate General,\n\nwas also requested to address the Court on the\n\nissues involved in these writ petitions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">6.            The case of the petitioner in the first writ\n\npetition is that the petitioner is a Registered Society\n\nconsisting of practicing lawyers of the High Court of\n\nOrissa, which has filed this writ petition on behalf of\n\nthe lawyers&#x27; community as a whole. The facts, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                         5</span>\n\n\n\n\nborne out from the record, are that on 7.2.2017,\n\nopposite   party   no.3     (hereinafter   referred   to   as\n\n&#x27;informant&#x27;) who is an Inspector of Police, working in\n\nCID, Crime Branch, had visited the High Court for\n\nsome official work and that while she was coming\n\ndown from the Lift No.5 in the premises of the High\n\nCourt, it is alleged by the informant that certain\n\nadvocates had misbehaved with her by leaning\n\nagainst her body. It is stated that the said incident\n\nwas reported by the informant to the Superintendent\n\nof Police, CID, Crime Branch, who in turn vide letter\n\ndated      08.02.2017        intimated      the       Deputy\n\nCommissioner of Police, Cuttack to take necessary\n\nlegal action on the grievance petition of opposite party\n\nno.3, on the basis of which First Information Report\n\nwas registered on 9.2.2017, a copy of which has been\n\nfiled as Annexure-1 to the writ petition. In the\n\npetition, it is stated that even before the First\n\nInformation Report could be registered, there was a\n\npress report in the daily Oriya newspaper &quot;Sambad&quot;\n\non 8.2.2017 with the headline (as translated in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                         6</span>\n\n\n\n\nEnglish) as &quot;Even the Lady Police Inspector was not\n\nspared&quot;. In the body of the said article, it was\n\nmentioned that certain persons in the Lift No.5 of the\n\nHigh Court premises had misbehaved with the\n\ninformant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">7.            Learned   Senior    Counsel   Sri   Ashok\n\nMohanty has submitted that not only the above\n\nreport had been published in the newspaper on\n\n08.02.2017 even prior to any case being registered,\n\non 9.2.2017 in the same newspaper, there was\n\nanother article with the heading (as translated in\n\nEnglish) as    &quot;Alleged misbehavior to Lady Inspector-\n\nDirection for investigation&quot;.    Learned Senior Counsel\n\nhas pointed out that then on 10.2.2017, the English\n\ndaily &quot;Times of India&quot; carried an article with the\n\nheading &quot;Lady Inspector harassed&quot; in which it was\n\nreported that two Government lawyers had allegedly\n\nmisbehaved and harassed the Lady Inspector in the\n\npremises of the Orissa High Court. It has been\n\npointed that another Odiya newspaper &quot;Pramaya&quot;\n\nalso carried an article with the heading (as translated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                        7</span>\n\n\n\n\nin English) as &quot;Misbehaviour to the Lady Police\n\nEmployee- FIR against three Government advocates&quot;.\n\nOn the same day, the English daily newspaper\n\n&quot;Indian Express&quot; carried an article with the heading\n\n&quot;Case against the lawyers for outraging the modesty of\n\nlady cop&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">8.           It is contended by the learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the petitioner that in the said articles, the\n\nversion of the police and the informant has been\n\ngiven,   without    verifying   the    authenticity   or\n\ncorrectness of such version, which could have been\n\ndone so by viewing the CCTV footage of the entire\n\nincident, a copy of which had already been handed\n\nover by the High Court Registry to the Police\n\nDepartment, which is a matter of record. It is further\n\ncontended that the Electronic Media also carried\n\nsimilar news, because of which the reputation of the\n\nlawyers community as a whole, as well as the\n\nJudiciary in particular, has been tarnished as the\n\nentire incident is said to be have been projected as if\n\nthe lawyer community is in the habit of misbehaving\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                           8</span>\n\n\n\n\nand scandalizing with the female visitors in the\n\ncampus of the High Court. The contention is that\n\nwithout verifying the correctness and truthfulness of\n\nthe incident published in the daily newspapers in an\n\nirresponsible manner amounts to defamation. By\n\npublishing such libelous statement, which has been\n\ncirculated widely, it affects the reputation of the\n\ntemple of justice, i.e., High Court, as well as lawyers\n\nas a class. Such publication imputing an association\n\nor collection of person jointly may amount to\n\ndefamation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">9.               Sri Ashok Mohanty and Sri Ashok Parija,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nHigh Court Bar Association, have submitted that by\n\nsuch reporting of the incident in the Print as well as\n\nElectronic Media, the reputation of the lawyers\n\ncommunity as a whole, and the High Court as an\n\nInstitution, has been brought down and tarnished\n\nbecause it is projected by the Media as if lawyers\n\ncannot be controlled and they harass the female\n\nvisitors.   It    is   contended   that   by   giving   such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                       9</span>\n\n\n\n\nunauthenticated news items/reporting, the entire\n\nincident has been scandalized to the detriment of the\n\nreputation of the lawyers community and in case\n\nsuch reporting is not stopped by an interim direction\n\nof this Court, the reporting by the Print and\n\nElectronic Media would bring down the reputation of\n\nthe institution as a whole and the public at large will\n\nlose faith in the High Court, which is the highest\n\nbody of the State Judiciary and regarded as temple of\n\njustice. Learned counsel have also contended that\n\nRight to Privacy and Right to Fair Trial is a\n\nfundamental right, flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and such reckless and the\n\nirresponsible reporting by the Media would prejudice\n\nthe mind of the public, as well as the authorities\n\nconcerned, against the lawyers, and would thus, also\n\namount to interference with the administration of\n\njustice and the right of the concerned lawyers for fair\n\ntrial. Thus, it is urged that this Court may restrain\n\nthe Print and Electronic Media from reporting the\n\ninvolvement of the lawyers of this Court in the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                         10</span>\n\n\n\n\nincident, till the truth finally comes out after\n\ninvestigation and trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">10.           Sri R.K.Mohapatra, learned Government\n\nAdvocate appearing for the State-opposite parties, on\n\nhaving      received   instructions   from   the    State-\n\nauthorities for which time was granted on 14.02.2017\n\nand 15.02.2017, has submitted that the Government\n\ndoes not propose to impose any restriction on the\n\nreporting the incident by the Press, but leaves it to\n\nthe Court to pass suitable orders, after considering\n\nthe facts of the case. He has however stated that with\n\nregard to appointment of any Judicial Commission,\n\nthe State-opposite parties would require time to file\n\ncounter affidavit. He has produced the case diary for\n\nperusal of the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">11.           Sri R.K. Mohapatra then proceeded to\n\nsubmit as an officer of the Court and not as a counsel\n\nfor   the   Government. In     this   capacity,    he   has\n\ncontended that though freedom of press is very dear\n\nand precious to him, but the same cannot be\n\nconsidered as an absolute right of the press, which is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                         11</span>\n\n\n\n\nalways   subject   to    reasonable   restrictions.   Sri\n\nMohapatra states that, as an officer of the Court, he\n\nwould support truthful reporting by the Print and\n\nElectronic Media but not colourable reporting to\n\ncreate sensation. He has however contended that in\n\nthe present case, reporting of the incident in\n\nquestion, as has been made by the Print and\n\nElectronic Media, tarnishes the image of the lawyers\n\ncommunity as a whole, and such reporting has been\n\ndone without verifying the correctness of the facts\n\nand merely on the basis of the version given by the\n\npolice authorities or the informant. He has submitted\n\nthat he is deeply concerned with the reputation of the\n\nlawyers in general and the institution in particular\n\nand if such kind of reporting is permitted, then (as\n\nthe incident had occurred in the premises of the High\n\nCourt) the reputation of the institution would also be\n\nbrought down and damaged. His submission is that if\n\nthe Press exceeds its jurisdiction and puts the\n\nInstitutional reputation in jeopardy, then it is the\n\nduty of the Court to intervene and issue necessary\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                          12</span>\n\n\n\n\ndirections to restrain such kind of reporting. As\n\nregards maintainability of these writ petitions, Sri\n\nMohapatra has submitted that these writ petitions,\n\nfiled by the High Court Bar Association and by a\n\npracticing    advocate        of   this        Court,   would    be\n\nmaintainable because the incident is said to have\n\ntaken place within the premises of the Court, and the\n\nBar Association being a registered body of the\n\nlawyers, would have every right to raise such an issue\n\nbefore this Court when the reputation of the lawyers,\n\nand the High Court as an institution, is at stake.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">12.          Sri S.P. Mishra, learned Advocate General\n\nsubmitted that the Court has the power to restrain\n\nthe Press in certain matters where the Press is not\n\nreporting the matter correctly because of which the\n\nreputation of the lawyers and Judiciary is brought\n\ndown,   and    is   also      likely      to    interfere   in   the\n\nadministration of justice, as the matter is still\n\npending investigation, as well as consideration by the\n\ntrial court. He has contended that by such reporting\n\nof the Press and Electronic Media (as has been done\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                      13</span>\n\n\n\n\nin the present case), the public at large gets a biased\n\nopinion of the incident as in the present times, the\n\nPrint and Electronic Media plays a very vital role in\n\nbuilding an opinion regarding any case or incident,\n\nwhich can influence the investigation, as well as the\n\ntrial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">13.        Sri Shivsankar Mohanty-petitioner, who\n\nis also a practicing advocate of this Court,       has\n\nadopted the submission of Sri Ashok Mohanty and\n\nSri Ashok Parija, learned Senior Counsel appearing\n\nfor the petitioner in the connected writ petition. He\n\nhas further submitted that the reporting by the Print\n\nand Electronic Media, as has been done with regard\n\nto the incident relating the present case, has been\n\nirresponsible, which tarnishes the image of the\n\nlawyers in general, as also the High Court as an\n\ninstitution. He contends that being associated with\n\nthe lawyers body and the institution, he is deeply\n\nconcerned with the reputation of all lawyers, which is\n\nbrought down because of incorrect reporting in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                       14</span>\n\n\n\n\nPress, which affects each and every advocate of this\n\nHigh Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">14.         Learned counsel for the parties have\n\nrelied on certain decisions of the apex Court as well\n\nas High Court, which shall be dealt with while\n\nconsidering their submission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">15.         From the record, what we find is that the\n\ninformant has alleged that an incident had taken\n\nplace on 7.2.2017 between 11.00 and 11.30 A.M. in\n\nLift No.5 in the High Court premises. It is alleged that\n\ncertain lawyers had misbehaved with her. It is a\n\nmatter of record that the CCTV footage of the entire\n\nincident is with the High Court and copy of such\n\nrecording has also been handed over to the police\n\nafter the lodging of the FIR dated 09.02.2017. It has\n\nalso been brought on record that the CCTV footage\n\nwas   viewed   by   the    learned   Advocate   General,\n\nPresident of the Bar Association, Senior Police\n\nOfficials and Investigating Officer. Although there are\n\naverments made in the petition that a Senior Police\n\nOfficial had, after viewing the CCTV footage, opined\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                         15</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat there was nothing incriminating found in the\n\nsaid CCTV footage, but we would not like to comment\n\non the same, as the same was contradicted by the\n\nPolice Officers Association immediately thereafter,\n\nand also because the matter is under investigation\n\nand      subjudice   before    the    appropriate   Court.\n\nCommenting on a matter which is subjudice at this\n\nstage would be neither justified for us nor for the\n\nPress, as the same would amount to pre-judging the\n\nissue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">16.          It cannot be denied that lawyers are as\n\nmuch part of the Judiciary as an institution, as the\n\nJudges are. If the reputation of lawyers is affected,\n\nthen, the reputation of the Judiciary also gets\n\naffected. It cannot be said that the reputation of the\n\njudiciary would be tarnished only when some adverse\n\nopinion or charges are leveled against the Judges\n\nalone. As such, if the allegations, without being\n\nverified, are made against the lawyers, it would\n\ndefinitely   bringing   down    the   reputation    of   the\n\nInstitution as a whole and also of the lawyers, as a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                           16</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommunity. We say so as lawyers are officers of the\n\nCourt and the Court cannot function without the\n\nassistance of the lawyers. Thus, we are of the firm\n\nopinion     that    if   the   reputation    of     the   lawyers\n\ncommunity is at stake, it would definitely amount to\n\nthe reputation of the Judiciary as a whole being at\n\nstake.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">17.             Lord Denning, M.R. in his book &#x27;Road to\n\nJustice&#x27; states:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">         &quot;The    Press   plays   a   vital   role   in    the\n         administration of justice. It is the watchdog to\n         see that every trial is conducted fairly, openly\n         and above board. But the watchdog may\n         sometimes break loose and have to be\n         punished for misbehaviour&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">                     Press occupies a          vital place      in\n\n modern society. Any institution when misused is\n\n bound to do more harm than good. Judiciary is the\n\n bed rock and handmaid of democracy. If people\n\n would lose faith in justice imparted by a Court of\n\n law, the entire democratic set up would crumble\n\n down.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                      17</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18.        The stream of administration of justice\n\nhas to remain unpolluted so that purity of court&#x27;s\n\natmosphere may give vitality to all the organs of the\n\nState. Polluters of judicial firmament are, therefore,\n\nrequired to be well taken care of to maintain the\n\nsublimity of court&#x27;s environment; so also to enable it\n\nto administer justice fairly and to the satisfaction of\n\nall concerned. The press does not have the right,\n\nwhich is its professional function, to criticise and to\n\nadvocate. The whole gamut of public affairs is the\n\ndomain for fearless and critical comment, and not\n\nleast the administration of justice.

In a\n      democratic set-up, there has to be an active\n      and intelligent participation of the people in all\n      spheres and affairs of their community as well\n      as the State. It is their right to be kept\n      informed        about      current     political,   social,\n      economic and cultural life as well as the\n      burning topics and important issues of the\n      day, in order to enable them to consider and\n      form broad opinion about the same and the\n      way in which they are being managed,\n      tackled and administered by the Government\n      and its functionaries. The primary function of\n      the press is to provide comprehensive and\n      objective information of all aspects of the\n      country&#x27;s       political,   social,     economic     and\n      cultural    life.    It    has   an     educative     and\n      mobilising role to play. It plays an important\n      role in moulding public opinion and can be an\n      instrument of social change. The press should\n      have the right to present anything which it\n      thinks fit for publication. But freedom of press\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                            20</span>\n\n\n\n\n      is not absolute, unlimited and unfettered at all\n      times and in all circumstances as giving an\n      unrestricted     freedom      of    the    speech       and\n      expression would amount to an uncontrolled\n      licence. If it were wholly free even from\n      reasonable      restraints,    it    would       lead     to\n      disorder and anarchy. The freedom is not to\n      be mis-understood as to be a press free to\n      disregard its duty to be responsible. In an\n      organized society, the rights of the press free\n      to disregard its duty to be responsible. In an\n      organized society, the rights of the press have\n      to   be    recognized      with      its    duties      and\n      responsibilities towards the society. Public\n      order, decency, morality and such other things\n      must      be   safeguarded.         The    editor    of   a\n      newspaper       or   a    journal     has    a      greater\n      responsibility to guard against untruthful\n      news and publications for the simple reason\n      that his utterance has a far greater circulation\n      and impact than utterance of an individual\n      and by reason of their appearing in print, they\n      are likely to be believed by the ignorant. It is\n      the duty of a true and responsible journalist to\n      strive to inform the people with accurate and\n      impartial presentation of news and their\n      views.
