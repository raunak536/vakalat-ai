At the time of marriage, the\n\n                    petitioner was adorned with 20 sovereigns of gold jewelry and Rs.50,000/-\n\n                    (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) worth home appliances including cot and\n\n                    almirah. Immediately, after marriage, the petitioner and the respondent\n\n                    commenced their matrimonial life in the shared matrimonial home at\n\n                    Sitharevu. After a span of time, the respondent voluntarily proposed to lead\n\n                    a separate independent life, as a result of which, they together left their\n\n                    family house and started to live separately at Sitharevu in another house.\n\n                    Very often, the respondent&#x27;s maternal aunt visited the petitioner and the\n\n                    respondent.

Whenever the\n\n                    petitioner complained to the respondent about his aunt, the respondent /\n\n                    husband never bothered about the attitude of his aunt and he told the\n\n                    petitioner that it was her duty to adjust with her or she has to leave the\n\n                    house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                            3/15</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                               C.M.S.A.(MD)No.55 of 2016</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                              (ii) Every month atleast 25 days, the said aunt stayed with them and\n\n                    created a lot of rugs in the matrimony between the petitioner and the\n\n                    respondent. While so, on the guise of his employment, very often the\n\n                    respondent left the house and returned home after staying in outstations for\n\n                    several days. In the meanwhile, the petitioner got pregnant and was sent to\n\n                    her maternal home for delivery. Till her delivery, the respondent did not\n\n                    visit her maternal home even once. On 17.10.1997, a male child was born\n\n                    to the petitioner. Despite giving information to the respondent, he never\n\n                    turned up to visit the child even once. That apart, he did not even take any\n\n                    steps to take back his wife and son to their matrimonial home. Left with no\n\n                    other option, the petitioner&#x27;s mother called for the interference of the elders\n\n                    and well wishers and she requested the respondent to take back the\n\n                    petitioner and her son to their matrimonial home. However, the respondent\n\n                    stated that 5 sovereigns would be provided for the child, thereafter, the\n\n                    respondent shall take the petitioner with him. The respondent deserted the\n\n                    petitioner for 9 years from 10.07.1997. All the efforts taken by the friends,\n\n                    relatives and elders in both the families for reconciliation between the\n\n                    petitioner and the respondent proved futile. Hence, the petitioner has filed\n\n                    this H.M.O.P seeking divorce by dissolving the marriage held on\n\n                    05.03.1995 at Dindigul Narayana Iyer Marriage Hall, at Dindigul.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                            4/15</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                               C.M.S.A.(MD)No.55 of 2016</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">                              5.

The respondent admitted\n\n                    that the petitioner&#x27;s mother and the respondent is the brother and sister. The\n\n                    respondent further submitted that the petitioner&#x27;s father served as a\n\n                    Foreman in the Tamilnadu Electricity Board. The respondent admitted that\n\n                    the marriage with the petitioner was held on 05.03.1995 at Dindigul\n\n                    Narayana Iyer Marriage Hall, at Dindigul. At the time of marriage, it was\n\n                    told that the parents of the petitioner owned a house at Chinnalapatti and\n\n                    the house which belonged to the petitioner&#x27;s father was sold to the\n\n                    respondent, even before their marriage and only in that house, the\n\n                    petitioner and the respondent commenced their matrimonial life. The\n\n                    respondent denied that the petitioner was adorned with 20 sovereigns gold\n\n                    jewelry and Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) worth home\n\n                    appliances were provided her, at the time of marriage. He further submitted\n\n                    that only 10 sovereigns gold jewelry was given as Sridhana and there was\n\n                    no demand of any money from the side of the respondent. Considering the\n\n                    fact that the respondent sister&#x27;s and her husband were heart patients, the\n\n                    respondent never troubled them in the name of dowry at any point of time.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                            5/15</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                               C.M.S.A.(MD)No.55 of 2016</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                              (ii) The respondent categorically submitted that the matrimonial life\n\n                    between the petitioner and the respondent was peaceful and happy and the\n\n                    same was cherished by the birth of the beautiful male child. The\n\n                    respondent was running a business of car brokerage business by\n\n                    purchasing and selling of old cars. For the purpose of his business, he had\n\n                    to travel to outstation often, therefore, the allegation that the respondent\n\n                    frequently stayed several days far away from home was not true. The\n\n                    allegation that the respondent&#x27;s aunt stayed in their matrimonial home at\n\n                    least 25 days was also denied by the respondent. The allegation that the\n\n                    respondent never ever visited the petitioner and her son is a blatant lie. In\n\n                    fact, the respondent and his relatives visited the petitioner at the time of her\n\n                    delivery in the hospital. The allegation that the respondent have demanded\n\n                    5 sovereigns gold to the new born child was also denied by the respondent.\n\n                    That apart, only on the request of the petitioner that she was inclined to\n\n                    take care of her ailing parents, the petitioner left from her matrimonial\n\n                    home. While so, the petitioner&#x27;s father passed away on 09.04.2001, even\n\n                    after the death of the petitioner&#x27;s father, the petitioner lived with her mother\n\n                    at Chinnalapatti for about 1 ½ years. Despite, several requests made by the\n\n                    respondent to come back to their matrimonial home, the same was not\n\n                    appreciated by the petitioner.

The learned Trial Court recorded the fact that the admission made\n\n                    by the petitioner is that she is involved deeply in spirituality and on that\n\n                    basis, she is not interested in family life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                            7/15</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                              C.M.S.A.(MD)No.55 of 2016</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                              7.

Referring all those admissions\n\n                    made by the petitioner, the learned Trial Court proceeded to conclude that\n\n                    the allegations of the petitioner that the respondent never ever took any\n\n                    steps for reconciliation was not correct.

The learned First Appellate Court proceeded to observe that during\n\n                    the chief examination, the petitioner contented that she was provided with\n\n                    20 sovereigns gold and Rs,15,000/- cash along with cot, almirah and other\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                            8/15</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                                                C.M.S.A.(MD)No.55 of 2016</span>\n\n\n                    utensils. She further deposed that the maternal aunt of the respondent used\n\n                    to demand dowry, however, the same was not interfered by the respondent.\n\n                    But, during cross examination, she admitted that at the time of marriage,\n\n                    she was adorned with 10 sovereigns gold jewelry only. She further\n\n                    admitted that no cash was given and the respondent purchased the property\n\n                    belonging to her father even before their marriage. She categorically\n\n                    admitted that there was no conciliation for reunion. She also admitted that\n\n                    the respondent has not demanded 5 sovereigns of gold for the child and she\n\n                    further admitted that the respondent never demanded any dowry at any\n\n                    point of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                              9.

However, during cross examination, she clearly admitted that\n\n                    her mother has not taken any efforts for reunion.

The learned First Appellate Court further\n\n                    recorded that she was fully interested in spirituality and therefore, she was\n\n                    not interested to lead a family life. Hence, the allegations made by\n\n                    petitioner on the respondent were not properly proved.
