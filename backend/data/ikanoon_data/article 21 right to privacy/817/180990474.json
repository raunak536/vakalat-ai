It is stated that on 22.03.2012 at\n\n  about 12.30 pm, when the stage carriage reached Thrissur,\n\n  the same was inspected by the 1st respondent, leading to the\n\n  discovery of 57 bottles of foreign liquor in four hardboard\n\n  boxes, and the vehicle, along with the conductor, were taken\n\n  into custody. The conductor pointed out that the four boxes\n\n  as above were loaded by a passenger from the Thenhipalam\n\n  University stop, stating that the same were containing\n\n  perfumes. A crime was registered on the above basis under\n\n  the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/27952771/\" id=\"a_1\">Kerala Abkari Act, 1077</a>\n\n  (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;).     The vehicle was\n\n  released on the petitioner furnishing a bank guarantee for\n\n  Rs.2 lakhs pursuant to directions issued by this Court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 3</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                            2025:KER:42703\n\n\n  W.A.No.786 of 2012. The proceedings were adjudicated in\n\n  connection with the confiscation of the vehicle, which led to\n\n  the issue of Ext.P6 order of confiscation. In an appeal filed\n\n  by the petitioner, Ext.P8 order was issued by the appellate\n\n  authority allowing the appeal and setting aside the order of\n\n  confiscation. However, suo motu steps were taken by the 4th\n\n  respondent, leading to the issue of Ext.P10 order cancelling\n\n  the findings contained in the appellate order referred to\n\n  above. The order at Ext.P10 was challenged before this Court\n\n  by filing W.P(C) No.9196 of 2013, leading to the issuance of\n\n  Ext.P11   judgment,     setting   aside   the   order   impugned.\n\n  However, the State filed an appeal and by judgment dated\n\n  12.03.2018 in W.A.No.2608 of 2015, a Division Bench of this\n\n  Court found that insofar as Ext.P10 order was issued by an\n\n  authority not competent to do so, directed the matter to be\n\n  considered afresh by the 4th respondent himself and the\n\n  findings on merit by the learned Single Judge were vacated\n\n  so as to facilitate reconsideration, leaving open all the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   4</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                              2025:KER:42703\n\n\n  contentions of the respondent (petitioner herein). The\n\n  petitioner, thereafter, submitted a detailed written submission\n\n  at Ext.P13 and the 4th respondent issued Ext.P14 order dated\n\n  24.07.2018, ordering confiscation of the afore bus under the\n\n  provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 67B</a> of the Act. It is in such\n\n  circumstances that the captioned writ petition is filed seeking\n\n  to challenge Ext.P14 order issued by the 4th respondent.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_2\">        2. I have heard Sri. Harikumar, the learned counsel for\n\n  the petitioner, as well as Sri. E.G.Gorden, the learned Senior\n\n  Government Pleader for the respondents herein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">       3. Sri. Harikumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\n  would contend that: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        i.    The very initiation of the proceedings against the\n              petitioner was without any justification and arbitrary\n              with reference to <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 67B</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        ii.   He would contend that it is only when it is satisfied that\n              &quot;an offence under the Act&quot; has been committed, the\n              question of invoking the confiscation proceedings\n              arises. He would rely on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19202778/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 64</a>\n              regarding the commission of an offence to contend\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   5</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                            2025:KER:42703\n\n\n               that the presumption thereunder would apply only\n               when there is &quot;commission of an offence under the\n               Act&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        iii.   He relies on the order issued by the Sessions Court on\n               31.10.2022 in Sessions Case No.747 of 2016 to\n               contend that insofar as the prosecution under the Act\n               has resulted in the acquittal of the accused - the\n               petitioner not being one among them- the very basis\n               for the confiscation steps goes and the impugned\n               proceedings requires to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">        iv.    He would also rely on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 67C</a> of\n               the Act to contend that under no circumstances the\n               bus can be confiscated insofar as the vehicle was a\n               stage carriage- used as a public utility service. In\n               support of the afore, he relies on the judgment of the\n               learned Single Judge in C.M. Vijayan v. Assistant\n               Excise Commissioner and Ors. [ILR 1980 (1)\n               Kerala 491] as confirmed by the Division Bench of\n               this Court in Asst. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95274968\" id=\"span_4\"><a href=\"/doc/95274968/\" id=\"a_6\">Excise Commr. and Ors. v.\n               Vijayan</a> [1981 KLT 366].</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">       4.

State\n               of Kerala</a> [2024 (4) KLT 98] in this regard.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168116834\" id=\"span_7\">ii.

He would rely on the afore judgment of the Division\n               Bench, also with reference to the benefit available to\n               the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 67C</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">        5. I have considered the rival contentions as well as the\n\n  connected records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">        6. The first issue arising for consideration is the\n\n  contention raised by Sri.Harikumar, the learned counsel for\n\n  the petitioner with reference to <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 67B</a> read with Section\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">  64.   He contends that insofar as the confiscation is ordered\n\n  as per Ext.P14 regarding the transportation and the criminal\n\n  case, the proceedings have to be set aside in the light of the\n\n  findings rendered by the Sessions Court as <a href=\"/doc/168116834/\" id=\"a_13\">referred to above</a>.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 7</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9051228\" id=\"span_9\">W.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                          2025:KER:42703\n\n\n  However, I notice that a learned Single Judge of this Court in\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/9051228/\" id=\"a_14\">Manoj v. State of Kerala</a> (supra) has categorically found\n\n  that the results in the criminal case have no bearing on the\n\n  confiscation proceeding, and the acquittal of the accused in\n\n  the criminal case by itself will not render the confiscation\n\n  illegal. Therefore, I hold that the petitioner is not entitled to\n\n  succeed merely on the basis of the acquittal of the accused in\n\n  the criminal case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168116834\" id=\"span_10\">7. As regards the second contention- the requirement\n\n  on the part of the authority under the statute to first of all\n\n  establish a prima facie case only upon which the burden would\n\n  shift to the petitioner, I notice that the Division Bench of this\n\n  Court in <a href=\"/doc/168116834/\" id=\"a_15\">Sub Inspector of Police v. Rajesh</a> (supra) has\n\n  found that the provisions of the statute being deterrent in\n\n  nature, the burden is always on the accused. When that be\n\n  so, I am of the opinion that the second contention raised by\n\n  the petitioner is also to be rejected.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    8</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">W.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                                2025:KER:42703\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">       8. The last contention raised by Sri.Harikumar is with\n\n  reference to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 67C</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n\n  67C</a> provides for the issuance of a show cause notice and the\n\n  adjudication thereunder with reference to confiscation under\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 67B</a>. Sub-section (2) thereto reads as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       &quot;(2) Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section\n       (1), no order confiscating any animal, cart, vessel or other\n       conveyance shall be made under <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_19\">section 67B</a> if the owner\n       of the animal, cart, vessel or other conveyance proves to\n       the satisfaction of the authorised officer that it was used\n       in carrying the liquor or intoxicating drug or the material,\n       still, utensil, implement or apparatus or the receptacle,\n       package or covering without the knowledge or connivance\n       of the owner himself, his agent, if any, and the person in\n       charge of the animal, cart, vessel or other conveyance and\n       that each of them had taken all reasonable and necessary\n       precautions against such use.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">  Thus, it is clear that if the owner of the vehicle is able to prove\n\n  the requirements under the afore sub-section, no confiscation\n\n  can be effected. The petitioner herein has specifically raised a\n\n  contention that the vehicle in question was admittedly a stage\n\n  carriage and that he was having very limited control over the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                    9</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                               2025:KER:42703\n\n\n  passengers and the luggage brought by them and therefore\n\n  the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 67C</a> of the Act were to be extended,\n\n  since it is without his or his agent&#x27;s knowledge that the 57\n\n  bottles of foreign liquor happened to be transported in the\n\n  bus. In Ext.P13 written submission submitted before the 4th\n\n  respondent herein the petitioner has specifically pointed out\n\n  the essential difference in the nature and operation of a stage\n\n  carriage and a goods vehicle/contract carriage/taxi. However,\n\n  while passing the impugned order at Ext.P14, it is found by\n\n  the 4th respondent that the petitioner or his agent has not\n\n  taken any precautions as required by the law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        9. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1022766\" id=\"span_13\">In this connection, I notice the judgment of the\n\n  learned Single Judge in <a href=\"/doc/1022766/\" id=\"a_21\">C.M.Vijayan v. Assistant Excise\n\n  Commissioner and Ors.</a> (supra) wherein, after referring to\n\n  the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 67B</a> read along with <a href=\"/doc/127151256/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 67C</a>,\n\n  this Court has found as under: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        &quot;6. The Respondents have proceeded in this case as if in\n        the absence of any rule or law prohibiting the Conductor\n        from verifying the contents of the suitcase and the packet,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    10</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                                  2025:KER:42703\n\n\n        he ought to have checked and verified the contents\n        thereof. It appears to me that law is just the opposite,\n        namely, that in the absence of a law empowering and\n        enabling a search of a person, and his personal effects, no\n        one can make a search of the body of a person and his\n        goods. Unauthorised interference with a citizen&#x27;s right to\n        carry his personal effects by searching them will amount\n        to an intrusion into his privacy and an invasion of his\n        personal   liberty   guaranteed   by   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article   21</a>   of   the\n        Constitution. It would also be an invasion of one&#x27;s right to\n        travel about, which again is a matter of personal liberty-a\n        compendious expression used in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> to include\n        within itself all kinds and varieties of rights which go to\n        make up the personal liberties of a man other than those\n        dealt with in the several clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19(1)</a> of the\n        Constitution. See Kharak Singh v. State of U.P.        A.I.R.\n        1963 S.C. 1295. Therefore, unless there is a procedure\n        established by law, and except in accordance with such\n        procedure, one cannot be deprived of the aforesaid\n        personal liberties. This means, so far as the case on hand\n        is concerned that unless the Conductor of the bus and/or\n        the other employees thereof have power conferred on\n        them by law to search the passengers and their goods,\n        they cannot do so. The Petitioner has a case that not only\n        no such power is conferred on any one of them, but under\n        the Motor Vehicles Rules, and, at any rate from a\n        commercial point of view, they have to behave properly\n        and in a good mannerly way towards the passengers,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                     11</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                                 2025:KER:42703\n\n\n        causing no annoyance and harassment to the travelling\n        public.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95274968\" id=\"span_16\">In an appeal filed by the State against the afore judgment,\n\n  the Division Bench of this Court in Asst. <a href=\"/doc/95274968/\" id=\"a_27\">Excise Commr. and\n\n  Ors. v.

The scheme of the Act, as disclosed by the provisions,\n        is that a seizure of the conveyance is contemplated and\n        authorised only if the competent officer finds that the\n        conveyance has been &#x27;used&#x27; in carrying liquor, intoxicating\n        drug etc. in contravention of the provisions of the Act. It,\n        therefore, becomes necessary for us to consider when a\n        vehicle can be said to be &#x27;used&#x27; in carrying contraband\n        liquor, intoxicating drug etc? In our opinion, a conveyance\n        can be said to be &#x27;used&#x27; for carrying the contraband article\n        only   if   the   person,   who    actually   effects   such\n        transportation, has at least some degree of minimal\n        control over the operation of the vehicle which may be\n        either by his having obtained it on loan from its owner or\n        on hire (as in the case of a taxi car or contract carriage or\n        vehicles taken on hire for private use including buses,\n        vans and private carrier vehicles or other similar\n        arrangement. In all such cases the person effecting the\n        conveyance will be in a position to exercise at least a\n        limited control as to the destination to which the vehicle\n        should be taken or the route along which it should ply etc.\n        In cases of this kind the vehicle will be liable for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                    12</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                                  2025:KER:42703\n\n\n        confiscation under<a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_28\"> S.67B</a> of the Act on its being found to\n        carry contraband liquor, intoxicating drugs etc. unless the\n        owner, his agent or the person in charge of the\n        conveyance is able to show that he had taken all\n        reasonable and necessary precautions against such use.\n        It was submitted by the learned Advocate General\n        appearing on behalf of the appellants that in such cases it\n        is not correct to say that proof of mens rea on the part of\n        the owner / agent / person in charge of the conveyance is\n        a prerequisite for attracting liability to confiscation. There\n        is force in the above contention advanced by the learned\n        Advocate General.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        9. The position is, however, entirely different in regard to\n        public passenger vehicles like stage carriages and vans\n        which are authorised to operate scheduled services on the\n        concerned routes on the strength of permits issued by the\n        road transport authorities. These vehicles are used only\n        for conveyance of passengers in general on the specified\n        routes. It would not be correct to say that the vehicle is\n        &quot;used&quot; for carrying any particular item of personal luggage\n        belonging to one of the passengers. The purpose for which\n        the vehicle is used is the operation of a passenger\n        transport service between the two termini specified in the\n        permit. The mere fact that any of the passengers\n        travelling in the bus or the van is found to have in his\n        possession some contraband article either concealed on\n        his person or kept in a suit case, package etc. carried by\n        him will not entitle the excise authorities to regard the bus\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                    13</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                                 2025:KER:42703\n\n\n        or the van as a conveyance &quot;used for carrying&quot; such\n        contraband article. Hence confiscation of a bus or van\n        operating a scheduled passenger transport service on the\n        strength of a permit issued under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_29\">Motor Vehicles Act</a>\n        is not contemplated or warranted by<a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_30\"> S.67B</a> and it must\n        ipso facto follow that seizure of such bus or van is not also\n        warranted under<a href=\"/doc/156561759/\" id=\"a_31\"> S.34</a> of the Act even if it be found that\n        any of the passengers was carrying any contraband liquor\n        etc. Seizure of such a public transport vehicle while\n        operating a Scheduled service on the concerned route and\n        any order confiscating it would necessarily visit the public\n        with very serious inconvenience and we consider that it is\n        not reasonable to think that the legislature would have\n        intended to cause such dislocation of public transport\n        arrangements and serious inconvenience to the public by\n        empowering the seizure and confiscation of public\n        transport vehicles on the mere ground that contraband\n        article was found to be in possession of any of the\n        passengers travelling in such vehicles. We are also in\n        agreement with the view expressed by the learned single\n        Judge that there is neither authority nor any duty cast by\n        law on the conductor of a stage carriage vehicle to search\n        the articles of luggage belonging to the passengers with a\n        view to find out whether any contraband goods are being\n        carried by them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        10. In the light of the conclusion that we have reached\n        that powers under<a href=\"/doc/94614587/\" id=\"a_32\"> S.55</a> and <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_33\">67B</a> cannot be legally invoked\n        by the excise authorities against stage carriage buses and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                   14</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                               2025:KER:42703\n\n\n        vans operating public passenger service on the strength\n        of permits granted by the road transport department it\n        automatically follows that the learned single Judge was\n        perfectly justified in quashing the orders impugned in the\n        two writ petitions. The writ appeals are accordingly\n        dismissed. While doing so we direct that in taking further\n        proceedings against the writ petitioner in OP No. 2258 of\n        1978 in pursuance of the directions contained in the\n        judgment of the learned single Judge the Assistant Excise\n        Commissioner, Cannanore shall have due regard to the\n        legal position explained in this judgment regarding the\n        non applicability of<a href=\"/doc/94614587/\" id=\"a_34\"> S.55</a> and <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_35\">67B</a> of the Act in relation to\n        the stage carriage bus operating a schedule service on a\n        route covered by a permit.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">  Thus, the Division Bench of this Court has categorically found\n\n  that the provision of <a href=\"/doc/160428791/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 67B</a> cannot be invoked as against\n\n  stage carriages insofar as they are public utility services.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">        10. It is the afore principles <a href=\"/doc/95274968/\" id=\"a_37\">laid down by</a> this Court that\n\n  are sought to be relied on by Sri.Harikumar, on behalf of the\n\n  petitioner. However, I notice that in the afore judgment, the\n\n  contraband article has been seized from the &quot;passenger&quot; in\n\n  the vehicle. It is in that context that this Court found that the\n\n  contraband article was recovered from the passenger while it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                15</span>\n\nW.P(C) No.13181 of 2019                         2025:KER:42703\n\n\n  was being &quot;carried by him&quot;. Applying the afore to the facts\n\n  and circumstances of the case at hand, this Court notices that\n\n  the liquor was seen transported in the luggage compartment\n\n  of the bus. The orders issued do not show that the owner or\n\n  the person who is alleged to be the owner of the liquor was\n\n  travelling in the bus. In the statement of the conductor, he\n\n  admits that the articles were transported at the instance of a\n\n  3rd party that he was not aware of it and had been made to\n\n  believe that the articles were perfumes. Therefore, the fact\n\n  that the luggage was handed over to the person in charge of\n\n  the bus for transportation is admitted by the conductor. Once\n\n  the same is handed over, he is responsible for such\n\n  transportation, especially when he further admits that some\n\n  amounts were also handed over for such transportation.\n\n  Therefore, I am of the opinion that the conductor ought to\n\n  have exercised due diligence in the matter and he cannot seek\n\n  the benefit available under <a href=\"/doc/33693084/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 67</a> C(2) of the Act.
