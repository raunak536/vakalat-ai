The present petition has been filed under Articles 226/227 of the\n\nConstitution of India seeking a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the\n\nrespondents to release/grant the benefit of family pension and other retiral benefits\n\nincluding DCRG etc. under the provisions of the Punjab Civil Services Rules.\n\nFactual Matrix\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"145553\" id=\"span_2\">2.          The brief facts of the present case are that the petitioner is a widow of\n\none Shri Gulzar Singh who was appointed in the State of Punjab in the Department\n\nof Irrigation in the year 1984. Thereafter, on 19.08.2009 vide Annexure P-1 his\n\nservices were regularized by the State of Punjab. Thereafter, he was posted with\n\nrespondents No.4 and 5 i.e. the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) on\n\n01.06.2010. While he was working in the aforesaid organization, the husband of\n\nthe petitioner unfortunately died on 21.08.2011. As per learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, the son of the petitioner was called by the BBMB to hand over the\n\ncharge and possession of the quarter in which the husband of the petitioner was\n\nresiding and the possession of the quarter was immediately handed over to the\n\nBBMB on 13.10.2012 vide Annexure A-2. After the death of the husband of the\n\npetitioner, the petitioner being widow was therefore entitled for grant of family\n\npension by the Punjab Government but the same was not paid to her. The husband\n\nof the petitioner was regularized after 01.01.2004 and a Division Bench judgment\n\nof this Court had already decided the issue with regard to the grant of old pension\n\nscheme to those employees who were recruited prior to 01.01.2004 but\n\nregularrised thereafter vide judgment <a href=\"/doc/145553/\" id=\"a_1\">Harbans Lal versus The State of Punjab\n\nand others</a> (CWP-2371 of 2010, date of decision 31.08.2010) Annexure P-8.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145553\" id=\"span_3\">The\n\n\n\n\n                                     2 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                             Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                     -3-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nhusband of the petitioner was also asked to deposit CPF so that the benefit of old\n\npension scheme can be conferred upon him and consequently vide Annexure P-7,\n\nthe petitioner deposited the CPF on 14.03.2014 so that the benefit of the old\n\npension scheme can be given in accordance with the judgment of Division Bench\n\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/145553/\" id=\"a_2\">Harbans Lal</a>&#x27;s case (supra). However, still the family pension and\n\nall the retiral benefits were not paid to the petitioner.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.           When the petitioner visited a number of times to the offices of the\n\nState of Punjab and to the BBMB for release of family pension and pensionary\n\nbenefits, the BBMB vide Annexure A-3 dated 26.08.2019 after eight years wrote a\n\nletter to the petitioner that there are certain objections from the office of the\n\nAccountant General, Punjab and apart from the above, it was also stated in the\n\nletter that the possession of the quarter which was allotted to her husband has still\n\nnot been handed over to the department and No Dues Certificate has not been\n\nissued by the Estate Sub-Division and therefore it was required that the vacant\n\npossession of the house was handed over so that No Dues Certificate may be\n\nisused and further action can be taken for family pension case. Thereafter, vide\n\nAnnexure A-4 on 29.11.2019 another letter was written to the petitioner by the\n\nBBMB by stating that the penalty of the quarter which was allotted to her husband\n\ncomes out to Rs.3,22,505/- for the unauthorised period from 22.08.2011 to\n\n05.09.2019 and the petitioner was asked to deposit the aforesaid amount so that No\n\nDues Certificate be issued. This letter was based upon an earlier letter written by\n\nthe Additional Superintending Engineer, Municipal Board, BBMB, Sundernagar to\n\nthe Senior Executive Engineer dated 22.11.2019 (Annexure A-5) that an amount of\n\nRs.3,22,505/- be deducted from the arrears of the husband of the petitioner.</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n\n\n\n\n                                       3 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                    -4-                        2023:PHHC:061682\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">Thereafter, the petitioner wrote a letter to the Senior Executive Engineer, BBMB,\n\nSundernagar vide Annexure A-7 dated 11.12.2019 by specifically stating that soon\n\nafter the death of her husband, they had locked the house, cut off the power and\n\nthe keys were submitted in the concerned office and therefore the penalty which is\n\nsought to be so imposed should be waived off and pension case be forwarded to\n\nthe Irrigation Department, Punjab. However, the State of Punjab still insisted upon\n\nthe no objection to be received from the BBMB with regard to the objection raised\n\nby the BBMB pertaining to the arrears and they did not grant any family pension to\n\nthe petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner deposited the aforesaid amount with the\n\nBBMB and thereafter the process of family pension started and learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner submitted today that the family pension with arrears and retiral\n\nbenefits have now been paid to the petitioner on 01.03.2023 during the pendency\n\nof the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">Submission of learned counsel for the petitioner\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">4.           The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the actions of\n\nboth the State of Punjab and that of BBMB were totally illegal, arbitrary and\n\nviolative of not only rules governing the family pension but was also violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 300-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. He submitted that\n\nimmediately after the death of the husband of the petitioner who was residing at\n\nSundarnagar alone whereas the entire family including the petitioner was residing\n\nin Punjab were called at Sundarnagar for vacation of the quarter and on 13.10.2012\n\nthe entire quarter was vacated and keys were handed over to the department and\n\nregarding which he has referred to Annexure A-2 in which even a certificate had\n\nbeen issued under the signatures of the Electrician and Junior Engineers by\n\n\n\n\n                                      4 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                    -5-                        2023:PHHC:061682\n\npreparing an inventory. He submitted that once the quarter itself was vacated by\n\nthe petitioner and her family especially when they were not even residing there,\n\nthen there was no occasion for the BBMB to have not sent the No Dues Certificate\n\nto the State of Punjab so that the further family pension case may be processed. He\n\nspecifically submitted that neither any notice was issued to the petitioner thereafter\n\nnor any proceedings for eviction were initiated under any provisions of law\n\nincluding the Public Premises Act nor any other kind of intimation was sent to the\n\npetitioner that the house has not been vacated because in fact the house already\n\nstood vacated vide Annexure A-2. He submitted that when the petitioner was\n\nrunning from pillar to post then suddenly after a period of eight years, letters were\n\nwritten to the petitioner vide Annexure A-3 and Annexure A-4 for the first time in\n\nwhich it was stated that No Dues Certificate could not be isused because of\n\nunauthorised possession and a penalty of Rs.3,22,505/- was imposed without\n\nmaking any assessment of the same in accordance with law. He submitted that\n\nwhenever there is any unauthorised possession of a Government house then\n\nassessment has to be done by following a specific procedure and no officer of any\n\norganization on its own, can straightway fix the amount of penalty. In the present\n\ncase no assessment procedure was carried out nor any notice in this was issued to\n\nthe petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">5.           He further submitted that the family pension and all the retiral benefits\n\nwere not paid to the petitioner even after a long period of time and the BBMB had\n\ntold the petitioner that it can be done only when she deposites the aforesaid\n\namount and therefore the petitioner had no option but to deposit the aforesaid\n\namount of Rs.3,22,505/- with the BBMB so that at least she could get her family\n\n\n\n\n                                      5 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                    -6-                        2023:PHHC:061682\n\npension and other retiral benefits to meet her requirements and that also after a\n\nlapse of long time and therefore she was forced to deposit the aforesaid amount\n\nwhich she deposited under protest. He submitted that after the same was deposited\n\non 18.07.2022, the matter was sent to the State of Punjab and thereafter, the State\n\nof Punjab granted the family pension and pensionary benefits to the petitioner after\n\nsanctioning the same on 17.10.2022 and the actual payment was made to the\n\npetitioner on 01.03.2023.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">6.           Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the action of both the\n\nState of Punjab and that of the BBMB was arbitrary and illegal. He submitted that\n\nthe action of the BBMB was without the authority of law because after a period of\n\neight years for the first time they wrote a letter to the petitioner for deposit of an\n\namount regarding which not even an assessment was made in accordance with law\n\nand it was only a cover up operation and so far as the State of Punjab is concerned,\n\nthe husband of the petitioner was an employee of the State of Punjab and it was\n\nthe bounden duty of the State of Punjab to have released the family pension and\n\nthe retiral benefits to the petitioner immediately after the death of the husband of\n\nthe petitioner and so far as the objection taken by the State of Punjab that no dues\n\nwere not received from the BBMB, the same cannot be to the detriment to the\n\npetitioner because it is only an inter-departmental communication which was\n\notherwise also without any basis and even otherwise also assumingly for the sake\n\nof arguments, an amount of Rs.3,22,505/- was to be paid, then the entire family\n\npension and the pensionary benefits could not have been stopped with the result\n\nthat the petitioner being a widow had to face acute hardship especially during the\n\nworse period of Covid-19 pandemic which she has seen without any money.

Randhawa verus State of Punjab and others 1997(3) SCT 468\n\nand also for the refund of the amount of Rs.3,22,505/- alongwith interest from the\n\nBBMB since the BBMB was not authorised to charge the same as there was no\n\norder by any competent authority under the law after making due assessment by\n\nfollowing due procedure for recovering the same and there is nothing in the reply\n\nfiled by the BBMB or on the record to suggest that as to how the assessment was\n\ncarried on. Even otherwise also, as per Annexure A-2, the petitioner had already\n\nsurrendered the house way back in the year 2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">Submission by learned counsel for BBMB\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.           On the other hand, Mr. Sarthak Gupta, learned counsel for\n\nrespondents No.4 and 5-BBMB has submitted that so far as the retiral benefits of\n\nthe husband of the petitioner pertaining to the grant of leave encashment and\n\ngratuity for the period spent by the husband of the petitioner in the BBMB is\n\nconcerned, the same has already been paid to the petitioner in time and therefore\n\nthe BBMB was not liable for any delayed payments. He submitted that however so\n\nfar as the grant of No Objection to the State of Punjab for further family pension\n\nand other benefits to be given by the State of Punjab is concerned, the husband of\n\nthe petitioner was residing in a quarter which was not vacated after the death of the\n\nhusband of the petitioner till the year 2019 and that was the reason as to why a\n\nletter was written to the petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs.3,22,505/- for the\n\nunauthorised occupancy of the house. He submitted that he has sought instructions\n\n\n\n\n                                      7 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                    -8-                        2023:PHHC:061682\n\nfrom Sunny Bharti, Sr. XEN/Township, BBMB, Sundernagar who is present in the\n\nCourt, to state that it is correct that after the death of the husband of the petitioner,\n\nno notice or any communication was sent to the petitioner or any other family\n\nmembers for seeking vacation of the house and it is also correct that no\n\nproceedings under the Public Premises Act or under any other process under the\n\nlaw was initiated against the petitioner for making any assessment for unauthorised\n\npossession. He however submitted that a calculation was made by a senior officer\n\nof the BBMB on the basis of the average rent for the period from 22.08.2011 to\n\n05.09.2019 and on the basis of the calculation the letters Annexure A-4 and A-5\n\nwere sent to the petitioner in the form of penalty rent. He further submitted that\n\none communication was sent to the State of Punjab vide Annexure R-4/3 dated\n\n27.05.2019 which rather stated that the pension case is pending in their own office\n\nand there was some clarification with regard to as to whether the pensionary\n\nbenefits should be granted to the employees who were regularised after 01.01.2004\n\nor not. Learned counsel submitted that in view of the above, the BBMB cannot be\n\nput at any fault for the delayed release of pensionary benefits by the State of\n\nPunjab.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">Submission by learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"145553\" id=\"span_10\">8.           On the other hand, Ms. Ishma Randhawa, learned Addl. AG, Punjab\n\nwhile referring to the reply filed by the State of Punjab submitted that the\n\npetitioner was posted at BBMB where he served and died and after his death a No\n\nObjection Certificate was required to be taken from the BBMB and the BBMB did\n\nnot send the No Dues Certificate to the State and that was one of the reasons as to\n\nwhy there was a delay in the grant of family pension and the other retiral benefits\n\n\n\n\n                                      8 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                    -9-                        2023:PHHC:061682\n\nto the petitioner by the State. She submitted that another reason for the delayed\n\namount is that the services of the petitioner were initially not pensionable because\n\nhe was earlier not on regular basis but he was regularised in the year 2009 vide\n\nAnnexure P-1. Thereafter, there is a judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/145553/\" id=\"a_6\">Harbans Lal</a>&#x27;s case (supra) Annexure P-8 that those employees who were working\n\non temporary/work charge/ad hoc basis prior to the cut of date of 01.01.2004 but\n\nthey have been regularlized thereafter were entitled for the benefit of old pension\n\nscheme on the deposit of the CPF. In compliance of the aforesaid judgment, the\n\nCPF was deposited on 14.03.2014 vide Annexure P-7 and therefore to some extent\n\nthere was a delay on the part of the petitioner as well. She further submitted that\n\nunless all the formalities including the No Objection Certificate from the BBMB\n\nwere cleared, the State could not have sanctioned the family pension or other\n\nretiral benefits of the petitioner after 14.03.2014 and now when the petitioner had\n\ndeposited the aforesaid amount of Rs.3,22,505/- to the BBMB and the BBMB had\n\nthereafter sent No Objection to the State of Punjab, the process was expedited and\n\nthe petitioner has been paid entire family pension alongwith arrears and all the\n\nretiral benefits on 01.03.2023 and therefore no delay is attributable to the State of\n\nPunjab.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">Analysis of submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">9.

The husband of the\n\npetitioner was otherwise an employee of the State of Punjab in the Department of\n\nIrrigation. After the death of the husband of the petitioner, the statutory benefits of\n\n\n\n\n                                      9 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                   -10-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nfamily pension and the other retiral benefits were to be considered and paid by the\n\nState of Punjab in accordance with law immediately. As per learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents, delay has been caused because of two reasons. Firstly, initially the\n\nhusband of the petitioner was not entitled for the grant of any pension because he\n\nwas not a regular employee but it was only after the passing of the judgment of a\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/145553/\" id=\"a_7\">Harbans Lal</a>&#x27;s case (supra) that he became entitled\n\nsubject to deposit of the CPF, but soon thereafter he died and therefore the CPF\n\nwas not deposited. However, the petitioner deposited the aforesaid CPF on\n\n14.03.2014 vide Annexure P-7 and therefore on the face of it from the date of the\n\ndeath of the husband of the petitioner till at least 14.03.2014 when the CPF was\n\ndeposited by the petitioner, she was not entitled for grant of pension.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">11.         The second reason for delay was that the BBMB did not give any No\n\nObjection Certificate to the State of Punjab on the ground that when the husband\n\nof the petitioner died, the quarter which he was having at Sundernagar was not\n\nvacated by the petitioner and her family. However, a perusal of Annexure A-2\n\nwould show that rather a certificate in which there are signatures of the Electrician,\n\nCommerical Sub-Division and Junior Engineer, Commercial Sub-Division,\n\nBBMB, Sundernagar wherein an inventory Annexure A-2 has been prepared and it\n\nis also stated therein that the follwing electrical goods existed in the house vacated\n\nby Shri Gulzar Singh on 13.10.2012. In the reply filed by the BBMB, no mention\n\nhas been made with regard to the authenticity of the aforesaid certificate pertaining\n\nto the record of electrical fitting. Although the aforesaid Annexure A-2 has been\n\nappended alongwith the civil miscellaneous application, but no counter affidavit\n\nhas been filed by BBMB with regard to the same, although notice was issued with\n\n\n\n\n                                     10 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                   -11-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nregard to the present application, but no reply to the application has been filed by\n\nthe BBMB. In addition to the above, it was for the first time after a period of eight\n\nyears from the death of the husband of the petitioner that the BBMB wrote letters\n\nto the petitioner vide Annexures A-3 and A-4 dated 26.08.2019 and 29.11.2019,\n\nrespectively, by which it was stated that there was an unauthorised possession of\n\nthe house which has not been handed over to the department and due to which No\n\nDues Certificate has not been isused and the petitioner was asked to deposit\n\nRs.3,22,505/- on account of penalty rent. During the course of arguments, learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents No.4 and 5-BBMB has submitted on instructions from\n\nthe officer present in the Court that after 2012, no notice nor any kind of\n\nproceedings were initiated against anybody including the petitioner or her family\n\nmembers pertaining to the aforesaid quarter nor any kind of action was taken. It\n\nwas only for the first time after eight years from the death of the husband of the\n\npetitioner that one letter was issued stating that the petitioner was liable to deposit\n\nof the aforesaid amount. Even no assessment was made with regard to the penanl\n\nrent or the ordinary rent, if any permissible under any provision of law but the\n\ncalculation appears to be made by an officer of the BBMB regarding which\n\nnothing has been so stated either in the application or any other document or\n\naffidavit filed by the BBMB. Therefore, the aforesaid two factors, firstly, that after\n\nthe year 2012 till 2019 there was no action taken by the BBMB. No notice or letter\n\nwas ever sent to the petitioner or to anybody else. Secondly, there has been no\n\nassessment made by any lawful authority pertaining to the penalty rent. The action\n\nof the BBMB was not justified to have asked the petitioner to deposit the aforesaid\n\namount of Rs.3.22,505/- which appears to be a condition for issuance of No Dues\n\n\n\n\n                                     11 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                   -12-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nCertificate to the petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner during the course of\n\narugments submitted that the petitioner was compelled to deposit the aforesaid\n\namount under protest so that at least the family pension and the other retiral\n\nbenefits can be released by the State on the basis of No Dues Certificate to be\n\nisused by the BBMB.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">12.          This Court is therefore of the view that the action of the BBMB in\n\nwithholding the No Dues Certificate of the petitioner for a long period of time was\n\nabsolutely arbitrary and illegal and without any authority of law. Furthermore,\n\naction of the BBMB for asking the petitioner to deposit the aforesaid amount\n\nwithout following any procedure or any assessment under any law and that too\n\nafter elapse of eight years was also not justified. The petitioner would therefore be\n\nentitled for the refund of the aforesaid amount alongwith interest.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">13.          So far as the role of the State of Punjab is concerned, the husband of\n\nthe petitioner was an employee of the State of Punjab and was only posted at\n\nBBMB and it is not in dispute that the family pension and the other retiral benefits\n\nwere to be paid by the State of Punjab and in fact they have now been paid by the\n\nState of Punjab on 01.03.2023.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"145553\" id=\"span_16\">14.          The first argument which raised by learned Addl. AG, Punjab was that\n\ninitially the husband of the petitioner was not entitled for the grant of family\n\npension because he was not a regular employee and thereafter in view of the\n\njudgment of a Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/145553/\" id=\"a_8\">Harbans Lal</a>&#x27;s case (supra), he was\n\nentitled but subject to the condition that the CPF was to be deposited which was\n\nultimately deposited by the petitioner on 14.03.2014 becuase her husband died on\n\n21.08.2011. Therefore, so far as this aspect is concerned, delay upto 14.03.2014\n\n\n\n\n                                     12 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                   -13-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nfor grant of family pension only is justified. However, so far as the grant of\n\ngratuity, leave encashment and other retiral benefits are concerned, the same were\n\nrequired to be paid to the petitioner who is a widow of Gulzar Singh immediately\n\non the death of Gulzar Singh which was also not paid to the petitioner and\n\ntherefore so far as the component of gratuity, leave encashment and other retiral\n\nbenefits except pension are concerned, there was a delay right from the time when\n\nthe death of the husband of the petitioner had occurred till the date of payment.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">15.          So far as the second argument of learned Addl. AG, Punjab that\n\nbecause of non-supplying of No Dues Certificate by the BBMB, the family\n\npension and the other retiral benefits could not have been granted is concerned, the\n\nsame is also not sustainable and it is totally unjustified in view of the fact that the\n\nhusband of the petitioner was an employee of the State of Punjab and it was the\n\nbounden duty of the State of Punjab to have processed the case of family pension\n\nand the other pensionary benefits promptly in accordance with law for which inter-\n\ndepartmental communication cannot become a ground for delay in the pension and\n\nthe pensionary benefits. Even if assuming for the sake of arguments that some\n\namount of Rs.3,22,505/- was assumingly to be recovered from the petitioner, still\n\nthe entire amount of gratuity, leave encashment and family pension could not have\n\nbeen withheld. Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show that any order has\n\nbeen passed by any officer of the State of Punjab for withholding of the entire\n\namount. Apart from the above, even the action of the BBMB was totally unjustifed\n\nfor not granting the No Dues Certificate. In the result, it was only because of lack\n\nof coordination or synchronization between the State of Punjab and the BBMB\n\nwhich caused delay. Furthermore, there is nothing on the record or the reply filed\n\n\n\n\n                                     13 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                           Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                   -14-                         2023:PHHC:061682\n\nby the State to show that any letter or communication was sent by the State of\n\nPunjab to the petitioner for the removal of any objection but in fact the State of\n\nPunjab chose to keep silent depending upon the outcome of the No Dues\n\nCertificate of the BBMB.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">16.          India is a welfare State and its instrumentalities are required to take\n\neffective steps in finalizing the pension matters and especially the family pension\n\nas expeditiously as possible and it cannot be expected from the State or an\n\ninstrumentality of a State to keep silent and not even inform the person who is\n\nentitled for the benefit of pension or family pension as to why it has not been paid.\n\nFurthermore, it is a settled law that pension and pensionary benefits are not the\n\nbounty of the State and duty is cast upon the State and its instrumentalities to pay\n\nthe same in accordance with law and in case there is any reason for withholding or\n\nforfeiting the same, then a proper procedure has to be followed in accordance with\n\nthe domain of the statutory provisions contained under the Rules. Under the\n\nPunjab Civil Services Rules, there is a specific provision for withholding or\n\nforfeiting of pension or a part of pension under Rule 2.2 of Vol.II of the Punjab\n\nCivil Services Rules. In the present case, the aforesaid provision has not been\n\ninvoked nor any order has been passed by any authority for withholding or\n\nforfieting any family pension and retiral benefits of the petitioner and therefore the\n\naction of the State of Punjab is ex facie illegal and oppressive in nature.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1566\" id=\"span_19\">17.

The High Court had to consider\n             the nature of the right of an officer to get pension. The majority\n             quoted with approval the principles laid down in the two earlier\n             decisions of the same High Court, referred to above, and held that the\n             pension is not to be treated as a bounty payable on the sweet-will and\n             pleasure of the Government and the right to superannuation pension\n             including its amount is a valuable right vesting in a Government\n             servant. It was further held by the majority that even though an\n             opportunity had already been afforded to the officer on an earlier\n             occasion for showing cause against the imposition of penalty for\n             lapse or misconduct on his part and he has been found guilty,\n             nevertheless, when a cut is sought to be imposed in the quantum of\n             pension payable to an officer on the basis of misconduct already\n             proved against him, a further opportunity to show cause in that\n             regard must be given to the officer. This view regarding the giving of\n             further opportunity was expressed by the learned Judges on the basis\n             of the relevant Punjab Civil Service Rules. But the learned Chief\n             Justice in his dissenting judgment was not prepared to agree with the\n             majority that under such circumstances a further opportunity should\n             be given to an officer when a reduction in the amount of pension\n             payable is made by the State.

It is only for the\n               purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to service\n               and other allied maters that it may be necessary for the\n               authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive\n               pension flows to the officer not because of any such order but\n               by virtue of the rules.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1881298\" id=\"span_27\">This view was reaffirmed in State of\n\n\n\n\n                                17 of 21\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">              ::: Downloaded on - 04-05-2023 23:16:13 :::</span>\n                                                             Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:061682\n\n\n\n\nCWP-12383 of 2019 (O&amp;M)                     -18-                         2023:<a href=\"/doc/1881298/\" id=\"a_17\">PHHC:061682\n\n                     Punjab and Another Vs.

This right to property cannot be\n                taken away without the due process of law as per the provisions of\n                <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 300-A</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">                     16.

A\n             person cannot be deprived of this pension without the authority of\n             law, which is the Constitutional mandate enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 300-A</a>\n             of the Constitution. It follows that attempt of the appellant to take\n             away a part of pension or gratuity or even leave encashment without\n             any statutory provision and under the umbrage of administrative\n             instruction cannot be countenanced.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"709776\" id=\"span_29\">19.

In the present case, the State has kept silent and did not even inform the\n\npetitioner with regard to the delay which was caused and because of the\n\ndepartmental communication for want of No Objection Certificate, the delay has\n\nbeen caused. Even the State of Punjab did not care to ask from the BBMB as to\n\nwhether the penalty if any was authorised by some law or not. The net result of the\n\nsame was that the petitioner being a widow had to wait for a long period of 12\n\nyears to enforce her rights so guranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_26\">300-A</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and under the Punjab Civil Services Rules which are\n\nstatutory in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">21.

The right to property is now considered to be not only a\n             constitutional or a statutory right but also a human right. Though, it\n             is not a basic feature of the Constitution or a fundamental right.\n             Human rights are considered to be in realm of individual rights, such\n             as the right to health, the right to livelihood, the right to shelter and\n             employment etc. Now however, human rights are gaining an even\n             greater multi faceted dimension.
