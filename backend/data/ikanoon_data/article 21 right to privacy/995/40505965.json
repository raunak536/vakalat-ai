This writ petition has been filed by the Petitioner, Rachita Francis\n                          Xavier - a young girl who was born, raised and educated in India. She is now\n                          17 years of age and has never held a passport. She was born to Indian parents\n                          who had acquired US citizenship. Her parents were in India when she was\n                          born, however, as neither of her parents were Indian citizens at the time of her\n                          birth, her application for issuance of a passport was rejected by Respondent\n                          No.3- Regional Passport Officer, Bengaluru, vide order dated 6th November\n                          2019. The Petitioner seeks issuance of a passport and also seeks quashing of\n                          the office memorandum dated 25th October, 2018 issued by the Ministry of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                    Page 1 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">19:28:10</span>\n                           External Affairs, which was the basis for the rejection of her passport.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                          3.     The Petitioner - Ms. Rachita Francis Xavier, who is a minor, was born\n                          on 7th November, 2006 to Mr. Joseph Francis Xavier - father and Ms. Leela\n                          Francis Xavier- mother in Andhra Pradesh, India. Both her parents were\n                          earlier Indian citizens. However, her father acquired citizenship of the United\n                          States of America (USA) on 28th September, 2001. Similarly, her mother\n                          acquired citizenship of the USA on 28th July, 2005. Thus, on the date she was\n                          born in India, both her parents were not Indian citizens. However, they had\n                          been granted the status of Overseas Citizens of India in June, 2006 and were\n                          OCI card holders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">                          4.     The Petitioner pursued her education at St. Michaels&#x27; High School,\n                          Bengaluru under the ICSE Board. However, she has currently discontinued\n                          her schooling after 9th Standard. She is stated to be taking courses with Kenpro\n                          Learning and submitted before the Court that she is interested in taking up\n                          web designing and web development courses as also some advanced\n                          computer courses abroad. For the said purposes, she requires a passport as the\n                          minimum travel document. She does not possess any travel documents and\n                          has therefore, remained in India since birth.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                          5.     In this background, on 30th September, 2019, the Petitioner submitted\n                          her application for issuance of a passport to enable her to travel abroad. The\n                          parents of the Petitioner also submitted all the necessary forms for the said\n                          purpose. The Petitioner also has an Aadhaar card which was issued to her.\n                          The Regional Passport Office, Bengaluru on 6th November, 2019, refused to\n                          issue her passport by citing Section 6(2)(a) read with <a href=\"/doc/1817805/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 5(2)(c)</a> of the\n                          Passports Act, 1967.

In light of the factual matrix of the case, the issue\n                                      that now arises in this matter is as to whether the\n                                      Petitioner, who is a minor, can give a declaration prior\n                                      to attaining the &#x27;full age&#x27; that she intends to obtain\n                                      Indian Citizenship and her application can then be\n                                      considered for obtaining an Indian passport and what is\n                                      the meaning of &#x27;full age&#x27; in the impugned office\n                                      memorandum.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                      5. In the opinion of the Court, the impugned office\n                                      memorandum does not take care of various scenarios\n                                      which could arise when a minor may wish to obtain\n                                      Indian Citizenship and an Indian Passport, though,\n                                      both the parents are foreign nationals.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                                      6.

The Union of India had, however, reverted and stated on 26th April,\n                          2023 that unless and until the Petitioner attains majority and gives a\n                          declaration, a passport cannot be issued to her. In fact, on the said date, the\n                          Petitioner and her father had joined the proceedings virtually. The father\n                          stated that he is working in a U.S. based company, but he has an option for\n                          work from home and is thus residing in Bengaluru with his daughter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                          10.    Vide order dated 30th October, 2023, the Court recorded that the\n                          following two issues arise for consideration.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                                      &quot;i) Whether the Petitioner ought to be directed to apply\n                                      for citizenship in India under <a href=\"/doc/211006/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5(1)(a)</a> of the\n                                      Citizenship Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                      ii) Whether the Petitioner would be considered as an\n                                      illegal migrant.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                          11.    Submissions have been thereafter heard on behalf of the Petitioner and\n                          the Respondent. The stand of the Respondent in its affidavit dated 20th July,\n                          2021 is that impugned order is an appealable order under <a href=\"/doc/1526429/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the\n                          Passport Act, 1967. Further, the Office Memorandum dated 25th October,\n                          2018 is relied upon that a child of two parents who have both acquired foreign\n                          citizenship, would not be entitled to an Indian passport. Further to order dated\n                          30th October, 2023, when the two issues were crystalized, an affidavit dated\n                          3rd January, 2024 has been filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), as\n                          per which since the details of the place and date of birth of the father were not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                        Page 6 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">19:28:10</span>\n                           available, the Petitioner cannot be considered as a person of Indian origin. The\n                          MHA also took the position that she would be considered an illegal migrant\n                          under <a href=\"/doc/88155362/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2(1)(b)</a> of the Act as she does not have any valid travel\n                          document, or a visa under which she can stay in India.\n                          Contentions of the Petitioner\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          12.    In response to the denial of a passport as per the Refusal Order dated\n                          6th November, 2019, which references the impugned Office Memorandum, ld.\n                          Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that the memorandum is\n                          discriminatory and arbitrary. According to ld. Counsel, the impugned\n                          memorandum prevents the Petitioner, who is a minor born in India and not an\n                          illegal migrant, from obtaining citizenship and a passport solely because of\n                          her age. He submits that the Memorandum discriminates against minors by\n                          excluding them from immediate citizenship eligibility, even though they may\n                          otherwise be eligible to get citizenship. It is asserted by the ld. Counsel for\n                          the Petitioner that the consequence of the impugned memorandum is that the\n                          Petitioner is rendered stateless, and her Fundamental Right to life, personal\n                          liberty, and travel, are impinged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">                          13.    According to the learned counsel for the Petitioner, the action of the\n                          Passport Authorities is not only arbitrary but also overlooks legal provisions\n                          that permit a minor to exercise their rights through a legal guardian. He\n                          emphasizes that such a restrictive interpretation ought not to be applied for\n                          the grant of citizenship to the Petitioner, solely based on her minor status.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                          14.    In response to the contention surrounding the status of the Petitioner as\n                          an illegal migrant, ld. Counsel for the Petitioner refers to the Amendment of\n                          2004 to the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_9\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a>, which revised <a href=\"/doc/88155362/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2(1)(b)</a> of the\n                          Citizenship Act, 1955, to define an &quot;illegal migrant&quot; as a foreigner who either\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                     Page 7 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">19:28:10</span>\n                           entered India without a valid passport or other valid travel document, or one\n                          who overstays despite entering with a valid passport. It is his submission that\n                          the Petitioner does not fall within the scope of definition of &quot;illegal migrant,&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                          especially considering the fact that the Petitioner has never gone out of India.\n                          Ld. Counsel also emphasizes that the legislative framework is clear in\n                          distinguishing between illegal migrants and other classes of persons\n                          associated with India.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">                          15.    Ld. Counsel also highlights that while OCI cardholders are restricted\n                          from public employment, running for certain elected offices, and\n                          appointments within higher judicial positions, they retain all other civil rights\n                          accorded to Indian citizens. Consequently, he submits that given that the\n                          Petitioner was born to parents who are registered OCIs, she cannot be treated\n                          as an illegal migrant. He also contends that the amendments to the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_11\">Citizenship\n                          Act, 1955</a> were primarily enacted to prevent illegal migrants from\n                          neighbouring countries from obtaining Indian citizenship by birth for their\n                          children. Since the Petitioner or her parents, do not fall into the category of\n                          illegal migrants, she is, therefore, entitled to pursue citizenship under the\n                          Constitution as also the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_12\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          16.    Accordingly, ld. Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that, Central\n                          Government has the clear authority under <a href=\"/doc/1548631/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 5(4)</a> of the Citizenship Act,\n                          1955, to register a minor as an Indian citizen. Further, he contends that since\n                          the Petitioner is not an illegal migrant and is otherwise eligible for citizenship\n                          and a passport, she cannot be denied these rights solely because she is a minor.\n                          According to ld. Counsel, such denial would violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">21</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                      Page 8 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">19:28:10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">                           Contentions of the Respondents\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">                          17.    Initially, the Respondents had filed a counter affidavit dated 20th July,\n                          2021 and raised a preliminary objection, challenging the maintainability of\n                          the present writ petition. It was the averment of the Respondents that the\n                          present petition ought to be dismissed on the ground that an alternate\n                          efficacious remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1526429/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a> of the Passports Act, 1967 was available\n                          to the Petitioner. The Respondents also contended that the existence of this\n                          remedy had been communicated to the Petitioner along with the refusal order\n                          dated 6th November, 2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                          18.    Without prejudice to the above contention, the Respondents have\n                          submitted that as per <a href=\"/doc/572647/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 6(2)(a)</a> of the Passport Act, 1967, the Regional\n                          Passport Office, Bengaluru was obligated to refuse the issuance of a passport\n                          or travel document to the Petitioner. It is their contention that as per the said\n                          provision, the Petitioner was not a citizen of India and consequently, no\n                          Passport or Travel Document could be issued to the Petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">                          19.    In the counter affidavit, the Respondents have highlighted that both the\n                          parents of the Petitioner have acquired citizenship of the USA, (the father on\n                          September 28, 2001, and the mother on July 28, 2005) as acknowledged by\n                          the Petitioner in the petition. Therefore, as per the Respondents under <a href=\"/doc/316640/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n                          8(2)</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955, the Petitioner, as a minor child of\n                          individuals who have renounced their Indian citizenship, ceases to be an\n                          Indian citizen. Consequently, the Petitioner is not eligible to obtain an Indian\n                          passport, in accordance with Paragraph 3.1(c) of the impugned office\n                          memorandum. Finally, the Respondents have also averred that in view of the\n                          fact that both the parents of the Petitioner were foreign citizens at the time of\n                          her birth, the Petitioner does not qualify to be an Indian Citizen under Section\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                     Page 9 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">19:28:10</span>\n                           3(1)(c) of the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_19\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">                          20.    Mr. Ahluwalia, ld.

As per the said affidavit, it is stated that the Petitioner would\n                          not even fall in the category of a person of Indian origin in terms of\n                          Explanation 2 of <a href=\"/doc/1860219/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955 as there are no\n                          details of the birthplace of the father of the Petitioner available with the\n                          Respondents. Further through the affidavit, it is submitted that if the father of\n                          the Petitioner was born in Undivided India or such territory which became\n                          part of the India after 15th August, 1947, the Petitioner may be eligible to be\n                          considered as a &quot;person of Indian origin.&quot; Secondly, he submits that insofar\n                          as the question as to whether the Petitioner is an illegal migrant is concerned,\n                          in terms of <a href=\"/doc/88155362/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 2(1)(b)</a> of the Citizenship Act, 1955, since the Petitioner\n                          does not have a valid travel document, she would be construed as an illegal\n                          migrant. The parents being foreigners had an obligation to register her with\n                          the FRRO immediately within 90 days after her birth which has not been done\n                          in this case and, therefore, she is staying in India without a valid permission.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">                          21.

Thus, if a person born abroad but to either parents, grandparents or\n                          great grandparents who were Indian citizens can be given an OCI card, the\n                          Petitioner who was born in Bengaluru to parents who were both Indian\n                          citizens and had obtained US passports just two years before birth, would be\n                          entitled to an Indian citizenship.

The Court has heard the ld. Counsels for parties at length and perused\n                          the records. The present writ petition presents the Court with a vexata\n                          quaestio. Central to the deliberation of this petition is the status of the minor\n                          petitioner- Ms. Rachita Francis Xavier, who presents a unique case of being\n                          born and raised in India to parents who were originally Indian citizens, but at\n                          the time of birth of the Petitioner, were American citizens.

The term &#x27;migrant&#x27; itself contemplates movement from one country to\n                          another that too of a foreigner. The Petitioner is not a migrant, as she was born\n                          in India and has not moved to India from any other country. In addition, both\n                          her parents were OCI card holders who were legally residing in India. They\n                          had not come to India illegally. Therefore, the definition of the term &#x27;illegal\n                          migrant&#x27; by itself would not apply to the Petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">                          30.      A perusal of the recent amendment to the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/322862/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 2(b)</a> of the\n                          Citizenship Act, 1955 would show that the spirit of the said amendment is to\n                          give recognition even to those persons who have migrated to India prior to\n                          31st December, 2014 from specified countries. Even if, as argued by the MHA,\n                          the definition of illegal migrant is considered, she is a person who could be\n                          covered under <a href=\"/doc/322862/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2(b)</a> proviso as she was born in India prior to 31st\n                          December, 2014 - however, the Petitioner is not from any of the identified\n                          countries and hence unable to obtain any benefit under the said Proviso.\n                          &#x27;OCI card holders&#x27;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">                          31.

In light of the submissions made by both parties, and the far-reaching\n                          implications to the life and liberty of the Petitioner, in the present case, it is\n                          necessary to examine the interaction of the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_67\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a> and the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_68\">Passport Act, 1967</a> with international legal obligations which India has\n                          ratified, especially in the context where issues of human rights and citizenship\n                          converge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">                          43.    The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which captures\n                          the basic human rights to which humans are entitled, outlines a set of rights\n                          seen as universal and inalienable entitlements. Further the UDHR has\n                          immense significance for India as not only did India adopt the UDHR at its\n                          inception during the UN General Assembly in 1948, but India also was played\n                          a leading role in its drafting, notably advocating the adoption of gender-\n                          neutral language in the UDHR.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">                          44.    In this backdrop, it is indispensable to note the UDHR underscores the\n                          significance of nationality as a fundamental human right in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 15</a> of the\n                          UDHR. <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 15</a> of the UDHR is extracted as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">                                      &quot;<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 15</a>\n                                      Everyone has the right to a nationality.\n                                      No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality\n                                      nor denied the right to change his nationality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                       Page 23 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">19:28:10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">                           45.    This above extracted portion of the UDHR is relevant to the present\n                          case, where the Petitioner finds herself effectively stateless within her country\n                          of birth, i.e., India, despite having substantial ties through birth, upbringing,\n                          and continuous residence. The UDHR presents an international legal\n                          framework that supports the contention that being denied the basic right to a\n                          nationality, and by extension - a passport, constitutes an infringement of her\n                          human rights. The UDHR serves as a globally recognised standard which\n                          serves as a foundational backdrop against which the contentions concerning\n                          citizenship, statelessness, and the right to have rights, as articulated by both\n                          parties, must be evaluated. However, it is also clear that as per the second part\n                          of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 15</a>, the question which the Court would have to evaluate at this\n                          stage, is if the decision of the Respondent to deny the Petitioner citizenship of\n                          India and by extension Indian nationality is arbitrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\">                          46.    Accordingly, the Court would have to consider the rationale of the\n                          Respondents to deny a passport to the Petitioner, and if the said refusal of the\n                          passport and the implied denial of nationality, as experienced by the\n                          Petitioner, constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of nationality under the\n                          Citizenship Act, the Passports Act as also general principles of law recognised\n                          by international law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_116\">47.

Therefore, in view of the above provisions mandating the protection\n                          and acknowledgment of every Child&#x27;s right to nationality and identity, it is\n                          fundamentally evident that Citizenship and Nationality is fundamental for the\n                          enjoyment of all rights. This perspective is crucial for comprehending the\n                          challenges faced by the Petitioner, who has effectively been rendered\n                          stateless, thereby facing significant limitations on her fundamental rights as\n                          also universal human rights in the absence of citizenship and political\n                          belonging.

Given these considerations, this Court is tasked with ensuring that\n                          the denial of the Petitioner&#x27;s rights does not reflect an arbitrary deprivation of\n                          the foundational rights associated with citizenship.\n                          Special circumstances of the Petitioner\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">                          51.    The Petitioner&#x27;s position is unique. The case of the Petitioner is not\n                          expressly covered by any specific provision of the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_92\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a> or\n                          the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_93\">Passports Act, 1967</a>. A passport can only be issued to a person who is a\n                          citizen of India and satisfy the eligibility conditions as prescribed. The\n                          rejection of the Petitioner&#x27;s passport is under <a href=\"/doc/690391/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 6(2)(a)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1817805/\" id=\"a_95\">Section\n                          5(2)(c)</a> of the Passport Act, 1967. <a href=\"/doc/690391/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 6(2)(a)</a> provides that if the applicant\n                          is not a citizen of India, a passport cannot be issued.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">                          52.    Accordingly, the question that arises is whether the Petitioner can be\n                          treated as a citizen for issuance of a passport. If the Petitioner is not treated as\n                          an illegal migrant, she would have been clearly entitled to citizenship. In the\n                          opinion of this Court, the Petitioner is not an illegal migrant. The Petitioner\n                          also qualifies as a person of Indian origin. The Petitioner would thus, be\n                          entitled to citizenship by registration under <a href=\"/doc/211006/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 5(1)(a)</a> of the Act under\n                          the category of `person of Indian origin&#x27;. The case would be covered under\n                          Explanation 2, as both parents of the Petitioner were Indian citizens who had\n                          thereafter obtained US citizenship. In addition, the Petitioner was born in\n                          India when her parents were legally residing in India as OCI card holders.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1754/2020                                                       Page 29 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">Signing Date:16.05.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">19:28:10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">                           53.    It is of enormous significance to note that <a href=\"/doc/1548631/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 5(4)</a> of the\n                          Citizenship Act, 1955 vests powers in the Central Government under special\n                          circumstances for granting citizenship by registration. The said provision\n                          reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">                                      &quot;(4) The Central Government may, if satisfied that there\n                                      are special circumstances justifying such registrations,\n                                      cause any minor to be registered as a citizen of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">                          The above provision is one which recognizes the need to give citizenship\n                          under unusual circumstances, to minors. Usually, this provision may not\n                          required to be put to use. However, the existence of such a provision in the\n                          statute shows the vision of law makers to enact an enabling provision for grant\n                          of citizenship to minors who may be placed in special circumstances. In a\n                          country like India, there could be instances where grant of citizenship could\n                          be justified, especially to minors who may be placed in extraordinary\n                          circumstances. Minors such as the Petitioner cannot be rendered stateless and\n                          left to struggle for basic human rights such as freedom of movement, freedom\n                          to have an identity, freedom to be educated as per their will even in a foreign\n                          country etc., The non-grant of citizenship and the consequent non-grant of a\n                          passport can have a deleterious impact on the Petitioner and her family. There\n                          is no reason why the Petitioner, a young girl ought to be made to struggle due\n                          to an unusually uncomfortable position she has been placed in - may be due\n                          to decisions made by her parents/family.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">                          54.
