The\n\nHigh Court upheld Clause 2(iii) of the Revised Guidelines on Merchanting Trade\n\nTransactions1 dated 23 January 20202 issued by the first respondent, Reserve Bank\n\nof India3, in the exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/20756/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 10(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1469477/\" id=\"a_2\">11(1)</a> of the Foreign\n\nExchange Management Act 19994.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\n2       The appellant is the managing director of a firm that manufactures and trades\n\nin pharmaceuticals; herbal and skincare products; and personnel protection\n\nequipment products such as masks, gloves, sanitisers, PPE overalls, and\n\nventilators5. The genesis of the case lies in an international MTT contract which the\n\nappellant obtained to serve as an intermediary between the sale of PPE products by\n\na supplier in China to a buyer in the United States. In accordance with the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines, the appellant wrote to his authorised bank on 1 May 2020 requesting\n\ndocuments (such as a letter of credit) that were required to execute the MTT\n\ncontract. The bank informed the appellant on 4 May 2020 that RBI had denied\n\npermission for his MTT contract, on the basis of Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines. Clause 2(iii) is reproduced below:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  “MTT”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">2</span>\n  “2020 MTT Guidelines” - RBI/2019-20/152: A.P.

The appellant\n\nclaimed that he was only serving as an intermediary in a trade between two other\n\nnations. Hence, he requested the Ministry of Commerce and DGFT to issue a\n\nnotification/clarification/circular exempting MTT contracts in relation to PPE products\n\nfrom the requirements of Clause 2(iii). However, the appellant received no response.\n\nThe appellant then filed a writ petition7 under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> before the Madhya Pradesh\n\nHigh Court. The writ petition set up a case that Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines is unconstitutional since it violates the appellant’s right to carry on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">6</span>\n    “Ministry of Commerce and DGFT”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">7</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">    Writ Petition No 7902/2020</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                    4</span>\n\f                                                                                PART A\n\nbusiness under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and the right to life and livelihood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\n4       In its reply before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, the RBI stated that the\n\nUnion of India8 had prohibited the export of PPE products from India by issuing\n\nmultiple notifications under <a href=\"/doc/798519/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3</a> of the Foreign Trade (Development &amp;\n\nRegulation) Act 19929, through which it amended the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-\n\n202010. Hence, in accordance with Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT Guidelines, MTT\n\ntransactions concerning PPE products were also prohibited since they allowed\n\nIndian individuals to assist others in diverting PPE products away from India in the\n\nglobal market. Further, it was clarified that Clause 2(iii) was of a general nature, and\n\nthe RBI had no jurisdiction to exempt products from its application, since only the\n\nUOI determined the nation’s FTP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n5       By its judgment dated 8 October 2020, the High Court dismissed the writ\n\npetition. In upholding the constitutionality of Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines, the High Court held that: (i) Clause 2(iii) only prohibits MTTs for goods\n\nthat cannot be imported/exported into India. The provision is general in its\n\napplication and does not specifically prohibit MTT in PPE products; (ii) the decision\n\nto modify the FTP to prohibit import/export of goods is a policy decision of the\n\nMinistry of Commerce and DGFT under the Foreign Trade Act; (iii) the Ministry of\n\nCommerce and DGFT prohibited the export of PPE products due to the COVID-19\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">8</span>\n  “UOI”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">9</span>\n  “Foreign Trade Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">10</span>\n   “FTP”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                           5</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART B\n\npandemic, and consequently, MTTs are also prohibited under Clause 2(iii); and (iv)\n\napart from the fact that the goods do not physically enter Indian territory, an MTT\n\nhas all the trappings of an import/export transaction.

This is true in the present case,\n\n               where the export of PPE products was banned to preserve stocks in India\n\n               during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, MTTs in PPE products do not\n\n               affect domestic stocks because the goods traded are from outside of India.\n\n               Therefore, Clause 2(iii) is manifestly arbitrary and violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14;</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">    (iii)      There is no entry into or exit of goods from the borders of India in an MTT\n\n               and the Indian entity only serves as an intermediary in a transaction\n\n               between two foreign countries. Hence, the appellant’s MTT in relation to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                 6</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n       PPE products would not affect the quantity of PPE products in India during\n\n       the pandemic, and is not a reasonable restriction. Pertinently, courts\n\n       should consider the reasonableness of a policy more carefully when it\n\n       results in an absolute prohibition;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">(iv)   Further, lesser intrusive policies are possible, such as the following:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       a. The RBI can independently decide whether to prohibit an MTT for each\n\n          product whose import/export has been banned under the FTP. This can\n\n          be done by delinking the prohibition on MTT with the prohibition under\n\n          the FTP;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       b. The RBI can prohibit MTTs only for goods whose import has been\n\n          prohibited since the lack of import into India highlights a policy concern\n\n          in relation to that product. However, for goods whose export is\n\n          prohibited, the MTT can be allowed because it does not reduce the\n\n          stock of that product in India. It is submitted that this was also the intent\n\n          of RBI’s circular dated 24 August 2000 in relation to MTTs; and\n\n       c. Individuals should be allowed to approach the RBI to seek an\n\n          exemption for conducting MTTs in relation to products whose\n\n          import/export is prohibited under the FTP. The RBI can then consider\n\n          each individual product and decide whether its MTT should be\n\n          permitted, keeping in mind the reasons for its prohibition under the\n\n          FTP.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                        7</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n7           Opposing the above submissions, Mr Ramesh Babu M R, learned Counsel for\n\nthe RBI submitted that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">    (i)       The appellant cannot challenge Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT Guidelines\n\n              without challenging the notifications amending the FTP to prohibit the\n\n              export of PPE products. Clause 2(iii) is general in its application and was\n\n              introduced on 23 January 2020, while the first notification prohibiting the\n\n              export of PPE products was issued by the UOI on 8 February 2020;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">    (ii)      Clauses similar to Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT Guidelines have existed in\n\n              all previous circulars issued by the RBI to regulate MTTs. These clauses\n\n              substantially stipulate that MTTs would only be allowed in respect of\n\n              products whose import/export is allowed in India;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">    (iii)     MTTs are analogous to import/export transactions, except for the fact that\n\n              the goods never physically enter India. There is an outflow of foreign\n\n              exchange during the import leg of the MTT and an inflow of foreign\n\n              exchange during the export leg. Hence, MTTs affect India’s foreign\n\n              reserves, which the RBI has to manage and harmonise with the UOI’s\n\n              FTP. Therefore, the RBI cannot permit MTTs in respect of goods whose\n\n              import/export has been prohibited by the UOI under the Foreign Trade Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">    (iv)      Export of PPE products was prohibited by the UOI in order to ensure that\n\n              adequate stocks are present in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">              Hence, a prohibition of MTTs in respect of PPE products is also important\n\n              because when an Indian entity facilitates the trade of these products to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                              8</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART B\n\n               another nation, it takes away from India’s possible stock in the global\n\n               market; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"85788\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178640246\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"682224\" id=\"span_28\">(v)       Courts should be wary of interfering in the economic policies of the State,\n\n               which should be left to expert bodies.

Since the appellant is engaged in MTTs which\n\nfacilitate import and export between two different countries, he urges that a complete\n\nprohibition on MTTs in relation to PPE products, without a rational distinction of\n\nprohibiting their exports alone, is a constitutionally suspect infringement of his\n\nfreedom to conduct his business. In order to test this claim, we will begin by\n\nanalysing the precedents of this Court on the ambit of the freedom envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> The relevant freedoms and restrictions with respect to trade under\n\nthe Indian Constitution are as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                “19.

This Court has propounded several tests for determining “reasonableness”\n\nfor the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> These have ranged from testing restrictions for\n\narbitrariness17, excessiveness18 and discerning their objective of compliance with the\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy19. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1217564\" id=\"span_39\">In <a href=\"/doc/1217564/\" id=\"a_21\">Chintaman Rao v.

The judicial evolution of a four-pronged analysis of proportionality\n\ndisplaces the varying standards that were prescribed to determine “reasonableness”\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 19(6).</a> The qualitative nature of a right and the corresponding scrutiny\n\nof its violation cannot be a sole function of the degree of restriction. Every violation\n\nof rights, irrespective of the degree of the infraction, must be evaluated through a\n\nuniform principle that promotes a culture of justification. The decision of a nine-judge\n\nBench of this Court in K S Puttaswamy v. Union of India25 (“K S Puttaswamy\n\n(9J)”) prescribed a proportionality analysis for determining violations of fundamental\n\nrights under Part III. A proportionality analysis can adequately consider the\n\nconstitutionality of prohibitive measures on commercial activities. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"12397485\" id=\"span_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116404795\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1849054\" id=\"span_61\">Therefore, we will\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">24</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/1849054/\" id=\"a_42\">Mohd.

It is important to note that this was based on a suggestion made by\n\nthe Technical Committee on Services/Facilities to Exporters, which stated as\n\nfollows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">                    “Issues Associated with Merchanting Trade\n\n                    […]\n\n                    4.9 Goods covered under Merchanting trade should be\n                    allowed to be exported/imported into the country as per the\n                    prevailing Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) at the time of entering\n                    into the contract with the overseas suppliers, in order to avoid\n                    entering into trading contracts that are not permitted to be\n                    imported/exported under the FTP. To safeguard the interest\n                    of the exporter, the export leg of the transaction can be\n                    recommended to be covered by Letter of Credit (or) through\n                    insurance from ECGC.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">44</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">     A.P.

However, there was no material change to the requirement that MTTs cannot\n\nbe conducted in respect of goods whose import/export is prohibited under the FTP.\n\nThe relevant clause of the circular is extracted as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">                    “ii) Goods involved in the merchanting trade transactions\n                    would be the ones that are permitted for exports/imports\n                    under the prevailing Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) of India, as\n                    on the date of shipment and all the rules, regulations and\n                    directions applicable to exports (except Export Declaration\n                    Form) and imports (except Bill of Entry), are complied with for\n                    the export leg and import leg respectively;”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">35         Subsequently, this circular was modified by the 2020 MTT Guidelines which\n\nintroduced the impugned Clause 2(iii). On an analysis of the above circulars, it is\n\nclear that the RBI has never attempted to permit/prohibit MTTs into specific goods.\n\nRather, from the very first circular, it has relied upon the goods’ position under\n\nIndia’s FTP to regulate MTTs. Till 2013, MTTs were prohibited in relation to goods\n\nwhose import was not allowed under the FTP. Since 2013, they have also been\n\nprohibited in relation to goods whose export is not allowed under the FTP.\n\n\n36         The RBI is responsible for issuing guidelines to authorized persons under\n\nFEMA. FEMA was introduced as an “Act to consolidate and amend the law relating\n\nto foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments\n\nand for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">45</span>\n     A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.115\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                      32</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART C\n\nmarket in India”. Hence, the role of the RBI under FEMA is directed towards\n\nensuring that India’s foreign exchange market is regulated, with a view to preserving\n\nIndia’s foreign exchange reserves. On a review of the guidelines which have been\n\nissued by the RBI in respect of MTTs since 2000, it is clear that most of them are\n\ntechnical in nature and seek to regulate the manner in which India’s foreign reserves\n\nare traded. Consequently, the RBI has not made the policy decision to classify\n\nproducts for which MTTs are impermissible but has opted to rely on the decision\n\nmade by the UOI under the FTP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">\n37    Such a decision, regarding the products in which import or export is prohibited\n\nin India, is made by the UOI under Section 3(2) of the Foreign Trade Act. <a href=\"/doc/165125/\" id=\"a_105\">Section\n\n3(2)</a> provides as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">             “3.

Mr Vikramjeet Banerjee, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the Ministry\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                33</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART C\n\nof Commerce and DGFT, has pointed out that the notification46 dated 25 August\n\n2020 now categorizes the export of PPE Masks and N-95/FFP 2 Masks as\n\n“Restricted” (instead of “Prohibited”) and limits their export to 50 lakh units per\n\nmonth, while medical coveralls of all classes/categories (including PPE overalls) are\n\ncategorized under the “Free” category, i.e., they are freely exportable.\n\n\n39         The appellant has challenged the suitability of the RBI’s decision to link the\n\nMTT of goods with their prohibition under India’s FTP by arguing that the objectives\n\nbehind the two are entirely different. To support their argument, the appellant has\n\nrelied on the nature of an MTT, where the goods do not enter or leave Indian\n\nterritory and the Indian entity acts as an intermediary in an exchange between two\n\nforeign countries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n40         In its affidavit, the RBI has explained the genesis of MTTs in the following\n\nterms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                    “7. It is submitted that under the Merchanting Trade\n                    Transactions (hereinafter referred to as &quot;MTT”) an Indian\n                    Citizen facilitates the export of good or material from a\n                    Company or individual of an exporting country (other than\n                    India) and then import/supply the said good or material to a\n                    Company or individual in another country, which is also other\n                    than India. In short, by MTT the Indian citizen while acting as\n                    intermediary, facilitates an international trade between two\n                    different countries. It is submitted that the MTTs are very\n                    closely analogous to, and have all the elements of, export as\n                    well as import except the fact that the goods are physically\n                    not located in India. The first leg of the transaction, known as\n                    import leg, requires outlay of foreign exchange by the entity\n                    located in India carrying on the transaction, for the purpose of\n                    making payment for the goods being purchased overseas.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">46</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">     Notification No 29/2015-2020\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                      34</span>\n\f                                                                                PART C\n\n             The payment is made by the Indian Entity by drawing foreign\n             exchange or obtaining a letter of credit in India from its\n             banker, authorised dealer of foreign exchange (i.e. authorised\n             dealer bank) also located in India. Thus, there is a clear\n             nexus of the first leg of the transaction to India and the\n             involvement of its foreign exchange reserves. It is further\n             submitted that in a successful trade, the Indian entity so\n             purchasing the goods overseas recovers its money in the\n             second leg of transaction, known as export leg, by selling the\n             goods to its buyer, also located overseas, but the money is\n             under the law to be repatriated to India to the credit of Indian\n             entity, which is located in India, within a strict time frame.”\n\n\n\nFrom the above extract, the following salient features of MTTs emerge: (i) the\n\noriginal supplier and ultimate buyer of the goods are foreign entities, with the Indian\n\nentity acting as an intermediary between them; (ii) the goods do not enter the\n\nterritory of India while shifting hands between the supplier and the buyer; (iii) Indian\n\nforeign reserves are implicated when payment is remitted outside India when the\n\nIndian entity initially pays the supplier for the goods; and (iv) foreign exchange is\n\nremitted to India when the Indian entity receives the payment from the buyer of the\n\ngoods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n41    The respondents have argued that the above features make MTTs analogous\n\nto imports/exports, while the appellant has attempted to differentiate them by noting\n\nthat the goods never enter India’s territory during an MTT. To resolve this, we must\n\nunderstand how MTTs are considered internationally.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                               35</span>\n\f                                                                                                PART C\n\n42      The International Monetary Fund47 in its sixth edition of the Balance of\n\nPayments and International Investment Position Manual48 defines MTT in the\n\nfollowing terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">                “10.41 Merchanting is defined as the purchase of goods by a\n                resident (of the compiling economy) from a nonresident\n                combined with the subsequent resale of the same goods to\n                another nonresident without the goods being present in the\n                compiling economy.

However, this has now evolved, where the intermediary is\n\nconsidered to be the owner of the goods during their transit from the supplier to the\n\nbuyer. Hence, goods under MTTs are recorded as negative and positive exports\n\nfrom the intermediary’s resident country, even when they never physically enter their\n\nterritory.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">44     Therefore, the international opinion favours the position taken by the\n\nrespondents that MTTs are analogous to traditional imports and exports. Therefore,\n\nit was suitable for the RBI to link the permissibility of MTT in goods to the\n\npermissibility of their import/export under the FTP. As noted earlier, the appellant\n\nhas not challenged notifications prohibiting the export of PPE products under the\n\nFTP. Hence, the prohibition of their MTT under Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines is also considered suitable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_6\">C.3    The necessity of the measure\n\n\n45     The prong evaluating necessity is often conflated with the prong evaluating\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">the suitability of a measure.

Further, it is argued that the appellant facilitating\n\nan MTT of PPE products between two countries does not impact their stock in India.\n\nIn any event, the appellant has argued that a less-intrusive alternative would be to\n\nban MTTs only for goods whose imports have been prohibited under the FTP or\n\nallow individuals to seek exemptions from the RBI in relation to goods whose\n\nimport/export has been prohibited by the FTP where the RBI can assess, on a case-\n\nby-case basis, whether their MTT should also be prohibited. While these measures\n\nhave been suggested on a general basis, the appellant has limited his challenge in\n\nthe present case only to the prohibition of PPE products. Hence, we shall be limiting\n\nour analysis in relation to that.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">\n47         Having considered the nature of MTTs in Section C.2, we reject the\n\nappellant’s arguments for two reasons. First, while MTTs in PPE products may not\n\ndirectly reduce the stock of these products in India, it still does contribute to their\n\ntrade between two foreign nations. In doing so, it directly reduces the available\n\nquantity of PPE products in the international market, which may have been bought\n\nby India, if so required. As such, MTTs contribute to reducing the available stock of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">50</span>\n     Aadhar (5J) (supra), paras 420 and 424\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                              39</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART C\n\nPPE products in the international market that India could have acquired. Second, the\n\nUOI’s policy to ban the export of PPE products reflects their stance on the product’s\n\nnon-tradability during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights a clear policy choice\n\nunder which Indian entities shall not be allowed to export these products outside of\n\nIndia, in all probability to the highest buyers across the globe who may end up\n\nhoarding the global supply. Hence, banning MTTs in PPE products was critical in\n\nensuring that Indian foreign exchange reserves are not utilized to facilitate the\n\nhoarding of PPE products with wealthier nations. A mere ban on exports would not\n\nregulate the utilisation of Indian foreign exchange. Hence, in order to keep India’s\n\npolicy position consistent across the board, the prohibition of MTTs in respect of\n\nPPE products was necessary and the only alternative of ensuring the realisation of\n\nlegitimate State interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n\nC.4        Balancing fundamental rights with State aims\n\n\n48         The fourth and final prong of the proportionality analysis involves the crucial\n\ntask of conducting a balancing exercise. The Court is called upon to legitimise the\n\n“social importance of the limitation on a constitutional right”51.

Before we consider the arguments of the two sides in\ndetail, we wish to say a few words about the position of the\nReserve Bank in the financial affairs of India and also about\nits place in the scheme of the law. The Reserve Bank of India\nwas established on April 1, 1935 by the <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_115\">Reserve Bank of\nIndia Act, 1934</a>. Even before the establishment of the\nReserve Bank, suggestions were made that there should be a\ncentral bank in India, and the Royal Commission on Indian\nCurrency and Finance had recommended in 1926 that the\ncurrency and credit of the country could only be put on a firm\nfoundation, if a central bank was established. The first Bill\nintroduced in 1927 by Sir Basil Blackett was dropped. The\nIndian Central Banking Inquiry Committee, however, reported\nin 1931 that there was a need for a central banking institution\nin India “for securing the development of the Indian banking\nand credit system on a sound and proper basis”. The\nCommittee pointed out that some of the Provincial\nCommittees had also suggested the establishment of the\nReserve Bank. The Committee ended by saying:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">  “We accordingly consider it to be a matter of\n  supreme importance from the point of view of the\n  development of banking facilities in India, and of her\n  economic advancement generally, that a Central or\n  Reserve Bank should be created at the earliest\n  possible date. The establishment of such a bank\n  would by mobilization of the banking and\n  currency reserves of India in one hand tend to\n  increase the Vol. of credit available for trade,\n  industry and agriculture and to mitigate the evils\n  of fluctuating and high charges for the use of\n  such credit caused by seasonal stringency.” (Vol.\n  I, Part I. Chap. XXII, para 605)\n\nThe White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms also\nrecommended the establishment of a Reserve Bank “free\nfrom political influence”. As a result of these findings, when\na fresh Bill was introduced by Sir George Schuster on\nSeptember 8, 1933 it was accepted and received the assent\nof the Governor-General on March 6, 1934.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">17. The functions of the Reserve Bank were generally\nindicated in the preamble as the regulation of the issue of\nthe Bank notes and the keeping of the reserves with a\nview to securing monetary stability in India and generally\nto operate the currency and credit system of the country\nto its advantage. But to enable the Reserve Bank to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                  42</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART C\n\n                  function in this manner, it had to be given other powers,\n                  so that it may function effectively as a central bank. To\n                  this end, the Reserve Bank was given the right to hold the\n                  cash balances of important commercial banks, a right to\n                  transact Government business in India which was also its\n                  obligation, and to enter into agreements with State\n                  Governments to transact their business.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">                  [……]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"928859\" id=\"span_133\">18. But the most important function of the Reserve Bank\n                  is to regulate the banking system generally. The Reserve\n                  Bank has been described as a Bankers&#x27; Bank. <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_116\">Under the\n                  Reserve Bank of India Act</a>, the scheduled banks maintain\n                  certain balances and the Reserve Bank can lend\n                  assistance to those banks “as a lender of the last resort”.\n                  The Reserve Bank has also been given certain advisory\n                  and regulatory functions. By its position as a central bank, it\n                  acts as an agency for collecting financial information and\n                  statistics. It advises Government and other banks on financial\n                  and banking matters, and for this purpose, it keeps itself\n                  informed of the activities and monetary position of scheduled\n                  and other banks, and inspects the books and accounts of\n                  scheduled banks and advises Government after inspection\n                  whether a particular bank should be included in the Second\n                  Schedule or not.

Its decisions are reflective of its expertise and guide the\n\nmonetary policy of the country. Hence, a policy decision of the RBI warrants\n\ndeference from this Court. The Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">            “84. A careful scan of the <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_122\">RBI Act, 1934</a> in its entirety would\n            show that the operation/regulation of the credit/financial\n            system of the country to its advantage, is a thread that\n            connects all the provisions which confer powers upon RBI,\n            both to determine policy and to issue directions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">            […]\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">            189.

If, a legislation relating to economic matters is placed at\n            the highest pedestal, an executive decision with regard to\n            similar matters will be placed only at a lower pedestal and the\n            decision taken by a statutory body may not even be entitled to\n            any such deference or reverence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">            190.

RBI is not just like\n            any other statutory body created by an Act of legislature.\n            It is a creature, created with a mandate to get liberated\n            even from its creator. This is why it is given a mandate — (i)\n            under the Preamble of the RBI Act, 1934, to operate the\n            currency and credit system of the country to its advantage\n            and to operate the monetary policy framework in the country;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">            (ii) under <a href=\"/doc/839983/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 3(1)</a>, to take over the management of the\n            currency from the Central Government; (iii) under <a href=\"/doc/972587/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 20</a>,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                              <a href=\"/doc/1801707/\" id=\"a_127\">47</a></span>\n\f                                                                   PART C\n\nto undertake to accept monies for account of the Central\nGovernment, to make payments up to the amount standing to\nthe credit of its account and to carry out its exchange,\nremittance and other banking operations, including the\nmanagement of the public debt of the Union; (iv) under\n<a href=\"/doc/1122746/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 21(1)</a>, to have all the money, remittance, exchange\nand banking transactions in India of the Central Government\nentrusted with it; (v) under <a href=\"/doc/1184305/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 22(1)</a>, to have the sole\nright to issue bank notes in India and (vi) under <a href=\"/doc/1373034/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 38</a>, to\nget rupees into circulation only through it, to the exclusion of\nthe Central Government. Therefore, RBI cannot be equated\nto any other statutory body that merely serves its master.\nIt is specifically empowered to do certain things to the\nexclusion of even the Central Government. Therefore, to\nplace its decisions at a pedestal lower than that of even\nan executive decision, would do violence to the scheme\nof the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">[….]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">192. But as we have pointed out above, RBI is not just any\nother statutory authority. It is not like a stream which cannot\nbe greater than the source. <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_131\">The RBI Act, 1934</a> is a pre-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">constitutional legislation, which survived the Constitution by\nvirtue of <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 372(1)</a> of the Constitution. The difference\nbetween other statutory creatures and RBI is that what the\nstatutory creatures can do, could as well be done by the\nexecutive. The power conferred upon the delegate in other\nstatutes can be tinkered with, amended or even withdrawn.\nBut the power conferred upon RBI under <a href=\"/doc/839983/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 3(1)</a> of the\nRBI Act, 1934 to take over the management of the currency\nfrom the Central Government, cannot be taken away. The\nsole right to issue bank notes in India, conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1184305/\" id=\"a_134\">Section\n22(1)</a> cannot also be taken away and conferred upon any\nother bank or authority. RBI by virtue of its authority, is a\nmember of the Bank of International Settlements, which\nposition cannot be taken over by the Central Government and\nconferred upon any other authority. Therefore, to say that it\nis just like any other statutory authority whose decisions\ncannot invite due deference, is to do violence to the\nscheme of the Act. In fact, all countries have Central\nbanks/authorities, which, technically have independence from\nthe Government of the country. To ensure such\nindependence, a fixed tenure is granted to the Board of\nGovernors, so that they are not bogged down by political\nexpediencies.

It is no doubt true that RBI has very wide powers\n             not only in view of the statutory scheme of the three\n             enactments indicated earlier, but also in view of the\n             special place and role that it has in the economy of the\n             country. These powers can be exercised both in the form\n             of preventive as well as curative measures. But the\n             availability of power is different from the manner and\n             extent to which it can be exercised. While we have\n             recognised elsewhere in this order, the power of RBI to\n             take a pre-emptive action, we are testing in this part of\n             the order the proportionality of such measure, for the\n             determination of which RBI needs to show at least some\n             semblance of any damage suffered by its regulated entities.\n             But there is none. When the consistent stand of RBI is that\n             they have not banned VCs and when the Government of India\n             is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up\n             with several proposals including two draft Bills, both of which\n             advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us\n             to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate.”\n\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n54    Thus, it is settled that the RBI is a special, expert regulatory body that is\n\ninsulated from the political arena.

[ Ministry of Home Affairs, Order No. 40-3/2020-DM-\n                  I(A) dated 24-3-2020.] However, it has not affected the\n                  security of India, or of a part of its territory in a manner that\n                  disturbs the peace and integrity of the country. The economic\n                  hardships caused by Covid-19 certainly pose unprecedented\n                  challenges to governance. However, such challenges are to\n                  be resolved by the State Governments within the domain of\n                  their functioning under the law, in coordination with the\n                  Central Government.

The need for protecting labour welfare on one hand and\n             combating a public health crisis occasioned by the pandemic\n             on the other may require careful balances. But these\n             balances must accord with the rule of law. A statutory\n             provision which conditions the grant of an exemption on\n             stipulated conditions must be scrupulously observed. It\n             cannot be interpreted to provide a free reign for the State to\n             eliminate provisions promoting dignity and equity in the\n             workplace in the face of novel challenges to the State\n             administration, unless they bear an immediate nexus to\n             ensuring the security of the State against the gravest of\n             threats.”\n\n\nThus, it is not this Court’s stance that judicial review is stowed in cold storage until a\n\npublic health crisis tides over. This Court retains its role as the constitutional\n\nwatchdog to protect against State excesses. It continues to exercise its role in\n\ndetermining the proportionality of a State measure, with adequate consideration of\n\nthe nature and purpose of the extraordinary measures that are implemented to\n\nmanage the pandemic. Democratic interests that secure the well-being of the\n\nmasses cannot be judicially aborted to preserve the unfettered freedom to conduct\n\nbusiness, of the few.</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                              54</span>\n\f                                                                                            PART D\n\nD     Conclusion\n\n\n58    Therefore, we find that the judgment dated 8 October 2020 of the Madhya\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">Pradesh High Court was correct in holding that Clause 2(iii) of the 2020 MTT\n\nGuidelines was a proportionate measure in ensuring the availability of sufficient\n\ndomestic stock of PPE products.
