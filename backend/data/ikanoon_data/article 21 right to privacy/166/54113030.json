A proceeding for dissolving the marriage on the\n\nground that the wife had treated the husband with cruelty\n\nand that she had deserted him for a continuous period of two\n\nyears was initiated by the husband. In this petition,an\n\nallegation was indeed made about the adulterous life that his\n\nwife was leading, though divorce on the ground that the wife\n\nhad a voluntary sexual intercourse with another person was\n\nnot raised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">        3.    In   addition   to   the   divorce   proceedings,    a\n\nproceeding     for maintenance under           <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 125</a> of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code, 1973 had also been initiated by the\n\nwife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">        4.    In the proceedings for divorce, an application was\n\nfiled to issue a direction to one Dr.Smita of Dr.Ramanagouda\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                    :3:</span>\n\n\n\nHospital, Malapur Cross, Dharwad to produce the entire case\n\ndetails (Including declaration letter, undertaking letter, daily\n\nsummary report sheet, doctor report, scan copy and other all\n\nrelating copies) and also to give evidence on the said\n\ndocuments in respect of wife who was stated to have been\n\ntreated under Patient I.D.No.30386.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">      5.    In the affidavit in support of the said application, it\n\nwas   stated   that     in   the   maintenance   proceedings,      an\n\napplication had been filed and the same was allowed and a\n\ndirection had been issued to the Dr.Ramangouda Hospital\n\nAuthority to submit the medical records and to give evidence.\n\nIt was stated that since the present proceeding was filed\n\nseeking for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce and\n\nthat was the main case, the said records needed to be\n\nsummoned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">      6. It was stated that since the husband had taken the\n\nspecific   contention    that the wife    was having     an     illicit\n\nrelationship and there was clear evidence that she became\n\npregnant, the said documents were necessary to establish the\n\ncontention.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      :4:</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">        7. It was stated that the wife had infact undergone an\n\nabortion on 21.11.2020 under Patient I.D.No.30386 and the\n\nsame had been suppressed. It was stated that though the\n\ndoctor had been summoned in the maintenance proceedings,\n\nonly some of the documents were produced and not all of\n\nthem were produced and since the petition for dissolution of\n\nmarriage was the main case, these documents needed to be\n\nproduced in these proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">        8.     This application was stoutly opposed by the wife.\n\nShe     stated    that   if    the   records    were    summoned,      the\n\nconfidentiality that was required to be maintained by the\n\nhospital would be violated. It was also stated that the\n\ndocuments sought to be produced, even if true, would not\n\nestablish or prove the adulterous life being led by her.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">        9.     The Trial Court, after hearing, has proceeded to\n\nallow    the     application    mainly     on   the    ground   that   the\n\ndocuments maintained by the Doctor of a Private Hospital\n\nwere private documents. The Court reasoned that the said\n\nprivate documents were related to one of the parties and\n\nsince the husband, by virtue of his legal relationship with his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 :5:</span>\n\n\n\nwife, was entitled to obtain the records concerning his wife.\n\nThe Family Court took the view that there was no question of\n\nHospital Authorities maintaining secrecy in respect of medical\n\nrecords of the wife vis-Ã -vis the husband. The Family Court\n\nalso observed that the proposed documents were very much\n\nnecessary since it related to the wife and it, therefore,\n\nallowed the said application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">     10.   It is this order of summoning the medical records\n\nwhich is the subject matter of this writ petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">     11.   The    learned   counsel   for     the    petitioner-wife\n\ncontended that the medical records of a person are absolutely\n\nprivate to the person concerned and the same cannot be\n\nsummoned     by   any   person    including   the    husband.    He\n\nsubmitted that the husband by virtue of a legal relationship\n\nwith his wife does not possess a right, either in law or in\n\nequity, to know or procure the medical records of his wife.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">     12. He also submitted that in proceedings for divorce, if\n\na husband is permitted to call for medical records of his wife\n\nand seek to publish her private details, the same would be a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                               :6:</span>\n\n\n\ngross violation of the &quot;Right to privacy&quot; guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">     13. Learned counsel also contended that the Family\n\nCourt by summoning the medical records pertaining to the\n\nwife was essentially transgressing the confidentiality that was\n\nrequired to be maintained between a Doctor and his patient.\n\nHe submitted that the confidentiality that is required to be\n\nmaintained between the doctor and his patient cannot be\n\nbroken even at the instance of one of the spouses. He\n\nsubmitted that by summoning the medical records from the\n\nDoctor and asking her to adduce evidence, the Court was\n\nessentially forcing the Doctor to act unethically and violate\n\nher oath of secrecy to her patient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">     14. Learned counsel for respondent Smt Sumangala\n\nA.Chakalabbi,   on   the   other   hand,   contended   that   the\n\ndocuments mentioned would establish the adulterous life that\n\nthe wife was leading and her medical documents relating to\n\nthe abortion would be the clinching piece of evidence that\n\nwould establish the allegations of her adulterous life without a\n\nshadow doubt.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   :7:</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">      15. She submitted that since the Doctor had already\n\nbeen summoned in the maintenance proceedings and had\n\nadduced evidence, there was no impediment for the Family\n\nCourt to      once again   summon        the   Doctor.   She   also\n\nhighlighted the fact that the order passed in the maintenance\n\nproceedings were accepted by the wife and therefore in the\n\ndivorce proceedings she could not be permitted to raise any\n\nobjections.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">      16.     Learned   counsel    for   the   respondent   further\n\nsubmitted that it was settled law that the Courts could issue\n\nan appropriate direction to a party to be subjected toa\n\nmedical examination as it would be difficult for the Court to\n\narrive at a conclusion as to whether the allegations made by\n\nthe spouse against the other spouse was correct or not. She\n\nsubmitted that since the records would establish the veracity\n\nof allegations made by the husband there was no infirmity or\n\nillegality in the order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">      17. She submitted that summoning of the records of the\n\nwife would not amount to an invasion of the right of privacy.\n\nShe sought to lay emphasis on the fact that the personal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              :8:</span>\n\n\n\nliberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia cannot be treated as an absolute right and this right to\n\nprivacy cannot apply to a case where a spouse was seeking\n\nfor divorce, even assuming that the wife did possess this\n\nright.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_8\">18. She relied upon the judgments rendered by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_7\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>,\n\nreported in AIR 2003 SC 3450 and in the case of <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_8\">MR.&#x27;X&#x27; v.\n\nHospital &#x27;Z</a>&#x27;, reported in (1998) 8 SCC 296 and an article\n\nregarding Medical privileges published in the Canadian Bar\n\nReview.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">         19. Learned counsel Smt. Sumangala A. Chakallabbi\n\nalso sought to place reliance on <a href=\"/doc/133793743/\" id=\"a_9\">Regulation 7</a>.14 of the Indian\n\nMedical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics)\n\nRegulations, 2002 (for short, &#x27;the Regulation, 2002&#x27;) to\n\ncontend that it was legally permissible for a registered\n\nmedical practitioner to disclose the secret of the patient that\n\nhad come to his knowledge or which was confided to him by\n\nthe patient during the discharge of their profession. She\n\nstated that when a Court of law passes an order directing the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   :9:</span>\n\n\n\nmedical practitioner to divulge the information relating to the\n\npatient, the medical practitioner was bound to disclose the\n\nsame. She submits that since it was permissible for the\n\ncourts to order the medical practitioner to disclose the secret\n\nof a patient, the application filed was legally tenable and did\n\nnot amount to any infringement of the Doctor-patient\n\nconfidentiality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      20.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,\n\nthe following issue arises for consideration in this writ\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;Whether, it is permissible for a Family Court to\n      summon the medical records of a spouse on the\n      request of the other spouse, especially when it\n      pertained    to   records   relating   to   any   procedures\n      relating to the reproductive choices of the spouse?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">      21. The Regulations framed for the professional conduct\n\nof the medical practitioners require the medical practitioner to\n\ngive a declaration at the time of registration. One of the\n\ndeclarations given by the medical practitioner is &quot;I will\n\nrespect the secrets which are confided in me&quot;. Thus, the\n\nmedical practitioner is statutorily bound to maintain secrecy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 : 10 :</span>\n\n\n\nin respect of the things which are confined to the medical\n\npractitioner by the patient. This declaration, fundamentally,\n\nestablishes that the Doctor-Patient relationship is one of\n\nabsolute trust and should not be broken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">     22. <a href=\"/doc/133793743/\" id=\"a_10\">Regulation 7</a>.14 of the Regulation, 2002, upon\n\nwhich, reliance was placed is a reflection of this declaration.\n\nThe said regulation reads as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           &quot;7.14. The registered medical practitioner shall\n     not disclose the secrets of a patient that have been\n     learnt in the exercise of his/her profession except -\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">           i)      in a court of law under orders of the\n                   Presiding Judge;\n           ii)     in circumstances where there is a serious\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                   and identified risk to a specific person and\n                   / or community ; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           iii)    notifiable diseases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">     In   case    of   communicable      /   notifiable   diseases,\n     concerned public health authorities should be informed\n     immediately.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">     23. As could be seen in <a href=\"/doc/133793743/\" id=\"a_11\">Regulation 7</a>.14 of the\n\nRegulations, 2002, there is an absolute embargo on the\n\nmedical practitioner from disclosing the secrets of a patient\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                : 11 :</span>\n\n\n\nthat comes within the knowledge of the medical practitioner\n\nduring the discharge of his professional duties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">     24.   To    this   embargo,    however,     there    are     three\n\nexceptions. The first exception, with which we are concerned,\n\nis when a presiding Judge passes an order calling upon the\n\nmedical practitioner to divulge a secret that he is aware of\n\nregarding his patient. Thus, unless there is a specific order of\n\na Judge presiding over a Court of law, no medical practitioner\n\ncan disclose the secrets that he has become privy to during\n\nthe discharge of his professional duties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">     25. Merely because a Court of law possesses that power\n\nto direct the medical practitioner to divulge a secret confided\n\nwith a medical practitioner, that power would not and should\n\nnot be exercised merely for the asking or routinely. The\n\npower to direct a medical practitioner to act in violation of his\n\ndeclaration   should    be   exercised    only     for   strong    and\n\ncompelling reasons and would be more or less be exercised\n\nonly when an element of public interest was involved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">     26.   The    Courts,    therefore,   cannot     direct   medical\n\npractitioners to disclose the secrets that they are privy to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                    : 12 :</span>\n\n\n\nDivorce proceeding, by their very nature, is adversarial and\n\nmore often than not a bitter and acrimonious battle, at times\n\ninitiated to tarnish the reputation of the warring spouse.\n\nThus,     the   power   of   the    Court   to   direct   the   medical\n\npractitioners to divulge secrets that are confided to them\n\nshould be exercised very sparingly and only for exceptional\n\nreasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">        27. In order to get over the bar imposed on the medical\n\npractitioners to disclose the secrets of the patients to which\n\nthey are privy, the Courts should not be asked to exercise\n\ntheir power to secure medical records. If this is permitted, it\n\nwould mean the Medical practitioner is required to divulge the\n\nsecrets that the patient has disclosed to him contrary to his\n\nprofessional ethics only because an adversary in litigation\n\nwishes to use it to non-suit the other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">        28. It is to be kept in mind that the medical records of\n\nan individual are very private and are not for public\n\nconsumption. If the medical record of a person is private to\n\nhim, a direction to his medical practitioner to produce the\n\nmedical records or divulge any secret that he is privy to it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       : 13 :</span>\n\n\n\nwould essentially amount to infringing the fundamental right\n\nof privacy guaranteed to an individual, which emanates from\n\nthe &quot;Right to Life&quot; granted under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">     29. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_14\">In fact, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_13\">K.S.Puttaswamy and\n\nanother v. Union of India and others</a>, a bench presided\n\nover by 9 judges, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has observed as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">              248. Privacy has distinct connotations including\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     (i) spatial control ; (ii) decisional autonomy ; and (iii)\n     informational control. Spatial control denotes the\n     creation       of    private   spaces.      Decisional   autonomy\n     comprehends intimate personal choices such as those\n     governing reproduction as well as choices expressed in\n     public such as faith or modes of dress. Informational\n     control empowers the individual to use privacy as a\n     shield    to    retain    personal        control   empowers     the\n     individual to use privacy as a shield to retain personal\n     control over information pertaining to the person. With\n     regard to informational privacy, it has been stated\n     that :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                    &quot;....     Perhaps    the       most    convincing\n           conception is proposed by Helen Nissenbaum\n           who argues that privacy is the expectation\n           that information about a person will be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 : 14 :</span>\n\n\n\n        treated      appropriately.      This     theory       of\n        &quot;contextual integrity&quot; believes people do not\n        want to control their information or become\n        inaccessible as much as they want their\n        information to be treated in accordance with\n        their expectation (Nissenbaum 2004, 2010,\n        2011)&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">          &quot;323. Privacy      includes      at     its   core        the\n    preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of\n    family life, marriage, procreation, the home and\n    sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be\n    left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and\n    recognizes the ability of the individual to control vital\n    aspects of his or her life. Personal choices governing a\n    way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects\n    heterogeneity     and    recognizes     the     plurality       and\n    diversity   of   out    culture.     While    the   legitimate\n    expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate\n    zone to the private zone and from the private to the\n    public arenas, it is important to underscore that\n    privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the\n    individual is in a public place. Privacy attaches to the\n    person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of\n    the human being.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">    30. Thus, things that are private to an individual would\n\nhave to be respected by one and all and every endeavour\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 : 15 :</span>\n\n\n\nshould be made to ensure that the privacy of the individual is\n\nnot violated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      31. The matter would also have to be looked at from a\n\ndifferent point of view. <a href=\"/doc/1520037/\" id=\"a_14\">S. 126</a> of the Evidence Act, which\n\ndeals with professional communications, grants immunity to\n\nthe professional named therein, i.e., a Vakil, barrister, or\n\npleader from divulging the communication made to him by his\n\nclient. <a href=\"/doc/894348/\" id=\"a_15\">S. 151</a> and<a href=\"/doc/1124413/\" id=\"a_16\"> S. 152</a> of the Indian Evidence Act prohibits\n\nindecent or scandalous questions and also question which are\n\nintended to insult or annoy the witnesses from being asked.

It is therefore clear that Courts cannot as a matter\n\nof course summon medical records or direct the Doctors to\n\ngive evidence about the medical condition of a litigant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">      33. Though<a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_20\"> S. 14</a> of the Family Courts permits the\n\nFamily   Court   to   receive   evidence,   which   is   otherwise\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               : 16 :</span>\n\n\n\ninadmissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_21\">Evidence Act</a>, in order to assist it in\n\ndealing effectually with a dispute, that power cannot be\n\nextended to commit a breach of the sacred obligation cast on\n\na   medical   practitioner   to   maintain   the   Doctor-patient\n\nconfidentiality or to intrude on the fundamental right of\n\nprivacy guaranteed to a citizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">     34. The only exceptions to this bar could be when one of\n\nthe parties to the lis is under a legal disability which is\n\nprobably handicapping him in some way and in order to\n\nsafeguard his legal rights, an evaluation of his physical or\n\nmental health would be necessary. In other words, when a\n\nparty is under a disability, in order to ascertain the disability,\n\nthe Courts can in appropriate cases direct the parties to\n\nsubject themselves to a medical examination. The exercise of\n\nthis right is to obviously protect the litigant and not to extract\n\nsome private information from the litigant which may aid the\n\nopposing litigant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_18\">35. It is in this context that the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has\n\nstated in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_22\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>, reported in AIR\n\n2003 SC 3450 stated that in any appropriate case the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                   : 17 :</span>\n\n\n\nCourts are empowered to subject a party to subject himself to\n\na medical examination. Therefore, this judgment, on which\n\nstrong reliance was placed by Smt. Chakalabbi, cannot be\n\nused to as support the request of the husband in the instant\n\ncase.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">        36. The other judgment relied upon by the learned\n\ncounsel which has been reported in (1998) 8 SCC 296 can\n\nalso be of no avail to the husband. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_23\">the said judgment</a> the\n\nHon&#x27;ble    Apex     Court   has    clearly    held    that   only   if   a\n\ncircumstance exists in which public interest of even true\n\nprivate facts are essential, then it would not amount to\n\ninvasion of the right of privacy. In fact, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt has stated that a Doctor and patient relationship is\n\nessentially a matter of trust and confidence between the two\n\nand the Doctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain\n\nsecrecy.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">        37. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has merely clarified that\n\nthis privilege of the Doctor is not absolute and can be lawfully\n\nexcluded     for   the   prevention    of    crime,   public   disorder,\n\nprotection of health, or morals or protection of life or freedom\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                : 18 :</span>\n\n\n\nof others.

Now coming to the facts of this case, it would be\n\nsignificant to notice that the proceedings initiated for a\n\ndivorce by the husband is not on the ground that the wife\n\nhad, after solemnization of the marriage, voluntary sexual\n\nintercourse with any person other than his/her spouse (i.e.,\n\nunder 13(1) (i) of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_24\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">      39. The grounds under which the divorce is sought for\n\nby the husband is that the wife had treated him with cruelty\n\nand she had deserted him for a continuous period of not less\n\nthan two years (i.e., under <a href=\"/doc/808094/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 13(1) (ia)</a> and (ib) of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_26\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>). If it is the case of the husband\n\nthat his wife, by leading an adulterous life, had inflicted\n\ncruelty on him this allegation will have to be proved with\n\ncogent evidence in a manner known to law. This allegation\n\ncannot be proved by summoning the private medical records\n\nof the wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">      40. The Doctor, even if summoned, cannot by the\n\nproduction of medical records, assist the Court in concluding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                              : 19 :</span>\n\n\n\nas to whether the wife had voluntary sexual intercourse with\n\na person other than the husband. If the husband can prove\n\nthat he had no access to his and if he can establish that his\n\nwife had or was having any illicit sexual relationship with\n\nanother person, the same will have to be established by\n\nappropriate evidence as provided under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_27\">Evidence Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">      41. In any event, the illicit relationship of a spouse\n\ncannot be proved by securing his or her private medical\n\nrecords. In fact, if this approach is to be accepted, it would\n\namount to the destruction of the entire concept of Doctor and\n\npatient confidentiality and also drag the Doctor into a marital\n\ndispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">      42.
