This,   according   to   the\n\npetitioner, is highly deplorable, absurd, and has virtually\n\nplaced the people in two categories, viz., vaccinated and not\n\nvaccinated, or those with RTPCR negative report or without\n\nsuch report, and those affected by the virus more than a\n\nmonth ago or those, who are not affected. This virtually\n\ncreates an imbalance and in-equilibrium among the people,\n\nbracketing them into two classes viz., the haves and have nots.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      12.

Hence,\n\nclause (iv) in the Government order dated 10.08.2021 imposes\n\nfetters on the fundamental rights of equality, freedom of\n\nmovement, and the right to carry out trade or profession.

The right to breathe air freely cannot be curtailed by\n            imposing fine or punishment, at any cost. Such\n            measures must be implemented as advisories as people\n            must be expected to take care of their life themselves.\n            The State of Kerala has modified the Covid guidelines in\n            the State and passed an order dated 04/ 08/ 2021 to\n            discriminate not only vaccinated and not vaccinated\n            public, but also discriminate shops as no such guidelines\n            seem to have been issued for beverages or other shops\n            run by the Government.

The insistence of wearing the mask at the\n            hospitals or isolation centres must be made strictly on\n            the advice of doctors and not in general. People must\n            be educated about the risk or side effects of wearing\n            masks   continuously.

A master guideline for treatment\n            protocol of Covid patients must be issued, discarding all\n            other guidelines to avoid confusion. Doctors must be\n            entrusted   to   do   their   professional   jobs   without\n            interference, and the choice of medicine must be left\n            with the doctor treating the patient.

Such a notification prohibiting a greater degree of\n\nrights having a direct effect on the fundamental rights of the\n\ncitizens on a matter concerning both public health and\n\npersonal    liberty,   cannot      survive,    since      it   infringes   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:19:-</span>\n\n\n\nfundamental right to life and livelihood and the same is nothing\n\nshort of a colourable exercise of power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      16. It is pertinent to state that vaccination for COVID-19\n\nis a voluntary affair and not coercive.

Be that as\n\nit may, Exhibit-P3 data uploaded in the Government website\n\nproviding details of COVID vaccination in the State as on\n\n7.8.2021 shows that only 1,52,31,555 people in the State have\n\nbeen administered the first dose of vaccine and only 63,29,067\n\npeople have been administered two jabs i.e., the first and\n\nsecond doses vaccine.

According to the petitioner, if we assume that all the 39\n\nCrores, who are vaccinated at least one dose, have acquired\n\nimmunity, the balance 5l Cr., have acquired natural immunity,\n\nwhich thus means, 56.6% of people have acquired immunity\n\nwithout vaccines. This refutes the claim that vaccination is the\n\nonly solution to immunity against Covid.

It is further contended that all persons, who fall\n            within the categories mentioned in point (iv) in\n            Annexure to the Government order dated 4.8.2021 or\n            not, are permitted to move out of home only for\n            essential activities indicated in point (v). As per point\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">            (iv) in paragraph 3 of the Government order dated\n            10.08.2021, this was clarified and unvaccinated persons\n            are allowed to move out of home for other essential\n            activities, which were not mentioned in point (v) in\n            Annexure to the Government order dated 4.8.2021. The\n            petitioner seeks to quash clause (iv) in paragraph 3 of\n            the Government order dated 10.08.2021. By the\n            Government order dated 10.08.2021, purchase of food\n            items, grocery, milk, meat, fish etc., were also brought\n            within the purview of essential activities. In the event of\n            allowing the prayers sought for in the writ petitions, the\n            range of permitted essential activities will shrink.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021         -:24:-</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">            F.   It is further contended that vaccination helps to\n            protect oneself from COVID - 19, limit the spread of\n            infection and reduce hospital admission. As observed by\n            the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, vaccination appears to be\n            one of the important strategies to combat further\n            spread of pandemic and would also provide a measure\n            of security and assure the people about their health and\n            well-being.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">            G. It is further contended that the figures as on\n            04.09.2021 would show that more than 2.16 crore\n            persons in the State were administered with first dose\n            of vaccine and above 80 lakh persons took their second\n            shot of vaccine. The target population (persons above\n            18 years age] in Kerala is 2.87 crores and 75.16% of\n            the target population has been inoculated with one dose\n            of vaccine. The restrictions in the Government orders\n            dated 4.8.2021 and 10.08.2021 were imposed in the\n            wake of a spike in COVID - 19.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">            H. It was found necessary that unvaccinated person&#x27;s\n            access   to   indoor   spaces     must   be   curtailed.   By\n            frequenting indoor spaces, the unvaccinated persons\n            expose themselves to infection. Hence, in their best\n            interest and in larger public interest, the restrictions in\n            the Government orders 4.8.2021 and 10.08.2021 were\n            imposed. In the light of continuing surge in infection\n            and concerns of a possible third wave, the restrictions in\n            the Government orders 4.8.2021 and 10.08.2021 are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021            -:25:-</span>\n\n\n\n            absolutely essential to prevent the further spread of\n            COVID - 19.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">            I. It is also contended that unvaccinated persons are\n            more prone to getting COVID - 19 infected than\n            inoculated persons. The severity of disease among the\n            vaccinated persons is reported to be less. It is pertinent\n            to point out that despite an increase in the number of\n            COVID - 19 patients in the State, there was no\n            corresponding demand for hospital admission.\n\n            J. It is further contended that the contention of the\n            petitioners   that   the    impugned      provisions   in   the\n            Government     order       dated     10.08.2021   violate   the\n            fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of\n            India is devoid of any merit or substance. It is settled\n            law that no fundamental right is absolute. In the\n            interest of the general public, reasonable restrictions\n            can be imposed in exercise of rights conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_33\">Article\n            19</a> of the Constitution. As per the Government orders\n            dated 4.8.2021 and 10.08.2021, reasonable restrictions\n            were imposed as a measure to suppress the spread of\n            COVID-19.     The restrictions imposed have a rational\n            nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In the\n            current scenario, those restrictions would advance the\n            social and general public interest. The rights of\n            individuals are always subservient to the public interest.\n            In the above circumstances, it is stated that the\n            contentions raised in both the writ petitions are devoid\n            of merit and, therefore, liable to be dismissed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021             -:26:-</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      20.

It is an admitted fact that COVID-19 pandemic so far\n\nas concerning the 2nd wave, has affected the State of Kerala\n\nand a large number of Covid patients were identified, when\n\ncompared to other States. In fact, taking into account the said\n\nalarming situation, the National Authority has given permission\n\nto the State Authority to take appropriate measures in the\n\nState-level, to curb the disease. Therefore, it is clear that by\n\nvirtue of the powers conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1700948/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 38</a> of the Disaster\n\nManagement Act, 2005, the State Government has issued\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021     -:42:-</span>\n\n\n\norders along with the guidelines, so as to guide the public to\n\nbe cooperative with the State Government in its endeavour to\n\nmitigate the circumstances due to the situation that is\n\nprevailing in the State, at present.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">      30. From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic itself,\n\nnotifications/guidelines/advisories       were    issued   taking    into\n\naccount the increase and decrease in the Total Positivity Rate\n\n(TPR), and at times, complete lockdowns were imposed and\n\nthe lockdown restrictions were relaxed, taking into account the\n\nmitigating situations.     Apart from those, when the COVID-19\n\npandemic situation was found to be not manageable, at micro\n\nlevel, containment zones were also declared by the District\n\nAuthority, as per the guidelines issued by the State Authority.\n\nThese measures are introduced by the State Government for\n\nthe larger interest of the public rather than providing too much\n\nsignificance to the individual rights conferred to the citizens\n\nunder Part III of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">      31.   Even     though,   contentions       are   raised   by   the\n\npetitioners, that their fundamental rights are affected, on an\n\nanalysis of the pleadings put forth by them, we have no doubt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021                    -:43:-</span>\n\n\n\nin our mind to say that the petitioners are self- centric and are\n\nconcerned only with their fundamental rights guaranteed under\n\nPart III of the Constitution of India. The State Government, as\n\na trustee of the public affairs, is duty bound to consider and\n\nview the issues due to the pandemic, in a broader and larger\n\ncanvas, and should be concerned more with the interest of the\n\npublic, rather than individual&#x27;s interest. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_44\">The Act, 2005</a> makes it\n\nfurther   clear        that    it    shall      be       the    responsibility   of    every\n\ndepartment        of    a     State,       to     take         necessary   measures      for\n\nprevention    of        disasters       and        mitigation,       preparedness       and\n\ncapacity-building, in accordance with the guidelines laid down by\n\nthe   National,        as     well    as     the         State    Authority,     and   such\n\ndepartments also have the duty to integrate into its development\n\nplans and projects, the measures for prevention or mitigation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">      32. Whatever that be, the Government of Kerala, taking\n\ninto account the present COVID-19 pandemic situation, has\n\npromulgated the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020,\n\non 26th March, 2020, to unify and consolidate the laws relating\n\nto the regulation and prevention of epidemic diseases and for\n\nmatters connected therewith and incidental thereto.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:44:-</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">      33. Later, in order to include certain provisions in the\n\nOrdinance, 2020 (18 of 2020), the Kerala Epidemic Diseases\n\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 was promulgated by the\n\nGovernor of Kerala on the 3rd July, 2020, and whereas the bills\n\nto replace Ordinance Nos.18 of 2020 and 38 of 2020 dated\n\n26.03.2020 and 3.7.2020 by the Act of State Legislature could\n\nnot be introduced in and passed by the Legislative Assembly of\n\nthe State of Kerala during its session, which commenced on\n\nthe 24th August, 2020 and ended on the same day, and in\n\norder to keep alive the provisions of the said Ordinance, the\n\nKerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020 (57 of 2020)\n\nconjoining the provisions of the above two Ordinances, was\n\npromulgated by the Governor of Kerala on the 26 th day of\n\nSeptember, 2020.

Apart from the above, there are various penal\n\nprovisions also contained in Act 4 of 2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">      37. Therefore, it could be seen that the authority\n\nconstituted under the district level and even micro level have a\n\nduty and obligation to see that required and adequate steps\n\nare taken to protect the welfare and interest of the public, by\n\nissuing appropriate orders/notifications/guidelines, which is a\n\nmandatory requirement under law, in order to tide over the\n\npresent COVID-19 pandemic situation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">      38. The grievance raised by the petitioners, who are\n\nseeking to quash certain clauses of the Government orders\n\ndated 4.8.2021 and 10.8.2021 is that the clauses violate their\n\nfundamental rights conferred under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_49\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_50\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India and if the said provisions are\n\nimplemented, the fundamental rights of the citizens along with\n\nthe rights enjoyed by the petitioners, would be infringed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">      39. In order to appreciate the abovesaid contention, we\n\npropose to refer to <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 19(1)</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\nwhich deals with protection of certain rights regarding freedom\n\nof speech and expression; to assemble peaceably and without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:48:-</span>\n\n\n\narms; to form associations or unions or co-operative societies;\n\nto move freely throughout the territory of India; to reside and\n\nsettle in any part of the territory of India; and to practise any\n\nprofession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">      40. It is true that to move freely throughout the territory\n\nof India is a fundamental right conferred on every citizen, but\n\nat the same time, clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 19</a> makes it explicit that\n\nnothing contained in the sub-clauses shall affect the operation\n\nof any law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so far\n\nas such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of\n\nthe right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of\n\nthe sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the\n\nState, friendly relations with Foreign States, public order, etc.\n\nTherefore, the rights enjoyed by a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19(1)</a>\n\nof the Constitution is not an absolute right, in order to enjoy\n\nthe same unmindful, ignorant, and negligent to the realities,\n\ntaking place in the nation that are likely to affect the larger\n\npublic, so as to create devastating effect in the public at large.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      41. One of the contentions raised by the petitioners is\n\nthat going by the provisions of the objectionable clause of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:49:-</span>\n\n\n\norders dated 4.8.2021 and 10.08.2021, extracted above, the\n\nauthority constituted under the District Management Act, 2005\n\nis not entitled to compel the citizens, to take COVID-19\n\nvaccination and wear mask, since the restrictions so imposed\n\nare violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_55\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">21</a> of the Constitution of India. However, we\n\nare of the considered opinion that the restrictions are imposed\n\nby the State Government and the authority under the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_57\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act, 2005</a>, after conducting in-depth study from\n\ntime-to-time, with the aid and assistance of experts, in the\n\nfield, and the orders/guidelines are issued, taking into account\n\nthe specific requirements of the prevailing situation, so as to\n\nensure safety and welfare of the public at large.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">      42. Going by the pleadings putforth by the petitioners,\n\nwhat we could gather is that, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, the petitioners require this Court to\n\nreplace/re-write the orders/guidelines issued by the Authority\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_59\">Disaster Management Act, 2005</a>. We cannot pass\n\nany such orders/directions, as sought for by the petitioners,\n\nsince no expertise in that regard is available to this Court or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021       -:50:-</span>\n\n\n\nthis Court is not expected to discuss the subject issue with\n\nsuch experts and modify the Government orders impugned. If\n\nwe do so, we would be transforming ourselves into a legislative\n\nbody    transgressing     the    Constitutional   mandate     of    the\n\nseparation of powers by and between the legislature, executive\n\nand the judiciary. To put it otherwise, the power exercised by\n\nthis Court is circumscribed normally and ordinarily to the\n\nextent of judicial review in administrative matters alone.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">       43. Implementation of the provisions of Act, 2005, and\n\nAct 4 of 2021 is the duty and obligation of the State\n\nGovernment and the authority under the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_60\">Disaster Management\n\nAct,   2005</a>.    When     the    State   and   other   authorities   are\n\nempowered by the provisions of Act, 2005 and Act 4 of 2021,\n\nto implement the same, we are of the view that the authorities\n\nconcerned have a duty and obligation under the provisions of\n\nthe Constitution, to ensure that the citizens are guided\n\nproperly, so as to be alert them timely with respect to the\n\nemergent situation prevailing in the nation as a whole and the\n\nState specific, and to regulate and restrict their movements in\n\nthe larger interest of the public, may be even diluting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:51:-</span>\n\n\n\nindividual rights and interests with the fundamental object of\n\npublic safety in the extraordinary circumstances prevailing in\n\nthe community.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">      44. Penal provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/172419058/\" id=\"a_61\">Kerala Epidemic Diseases Act,\n\n2021</a> are incorporated with the avowed object of regulating\n\nand restricting people from violating the provisions of Act 4 of\n\n2021 and they are deterrent in nature though appears to be\n\npunitive. In order to implement the provisions of the Act\n\neffectively, such measures are also required to be undertaken\n\nby the State Government and the authority under the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_62\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act, 2005</a> and Act, 2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">      45. When action is taken by the State Government, in the\n\nlarger interest of the citizens, it can never be said that the\n\nfundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_63\">Articles 19</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_64\">21</a> of the Constitution of India are violated. This we say\n\nbecause, there is a clear empowerment under clause (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 19</a>, to make reasonable restrictions by introducing law\n\nin the larger interest of the public, and further, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution makes it clear that no person shall be\n\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021         -:52:-</span>\n\n\n\nprocedure established by law, which also means, when the\n\nlarger interest of the citizens is a concern for the State and\n\nauthority under the Act, 2005, it is imperative on the part of\n\nthe State Government to ensure that appropriate orders/\n\nguidelines are put in place, in order to protect the life and\n\npersonal    liberty   of       the   citizens,   rather   than   making\n\nindividualistic approach, which if done, in our opinion, would be\n\ndetrimental to the interest of the citizens at large.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">      46. Now, looking at the alleged objectionable clause of\n\nthe Government order dated 10.08.2021, we are of the view\n\nthat it is not an absolute bar or prohibition, interfering with the\n\nfreedom of movement of the citizens, but it is a reasonable\n\nrestriction imposed by the State Government, for protecting\n\nthe interest of larger community from COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">      47. Going through the pleadings, the petitioners have\n\nraised a contention that even the scientists and experts in the\n\nfield are making different opinions, at various times, as\n\nregards spread of COVID-19 pandemic. We are of the\n\nconsidered view that the experts and scientists are at the\n\nevaluation stage and they themselves are conscious about the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021   -:53:-</span>\n\n\n\nspread of Coronavirus. In order to prevent the spread of\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the experts are making necessary and\n\nadequate advice, in the interest of the larger public, while\n\nattempting to attain perfection, to curb the menace caused by\n\nthe disease. That fluctuating evaluation process can never be\n\ncriticized as bad or irresponsible, but it can only be seen as a\n\nprogressive method adopted, to arrive at a definite conclusion.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">      48. It may also be noted that there would be different\n\ntheories and evaluations by the scientists and experts in\n\nrespect of the disease. But, ultimately, all the evaluations\n\ndrawn up by the scientists and specialised organisations would\n\nbe utilised for the purpose of arriving at a definite and\n\nconclusive result, so as to protect the interest of the citizens at\n\nlarge. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court had occasion to consider the\n\nresponsibility cast upon the Government in the present\n\nsituation, in the context of various vulnerable circumstances.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">      49.

Across the globe, the executive has\n            been given a wider margin in enacting measures which\n            ordinarily    may    have      violated    the      liberty     of\n            individuals, but are now incumbent to curb the\n            pandemic.     Historically,     the     judiciary    has      also\n            recognized that constitutional scrutiny is transformed\n            during such public health emergencies, where the\n            executive     functions   in    rapid     consultation        with\n            scientists and other experts. In 1905, the Supreme\n            Court    of   the   United      States    in     Jacobson       v.\n            Massachusetts 197 U.<a href=\"/doc/129956/\" id=\"a_74\">S. 11 (1905)</a>, considered a\n            constitutional liberty challenge to a compulsory\n            vaccination law that was enacted to combat the\n            smallpox epidemic.

The right to protest is, thus, recognised as a\n            fundamental right under the Constitution. This right is\n            crucial in a democracy which rests on participation of\n            an informed citizenry in governance.

In the aforesaid context, it would be\n            pertinent to point out that there may be situations\n            where conflict may arise between two fundamental\n            rights. Situations can conflict on inter fundamental\n            rights, intra fundamental rights and, in certain peculiar\n            circumstances,     in   respect    of   some   person   one\n            fundamental right enjoyed by him may come in conflict\n            with the other fundamental right guaranteed to him. In\n            all such situations, the Court has to examine as to\n            where lies the larger public interest while balancing the\n            two conflicting rights. It is the paramount collective\n            interest which would ultimately prevail.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">      58. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63865477\" id=\"span_82\">In <a href=\"/doc/63865477/\" id=\"a_83\">Ritesh Sinha v.

The State Government is imposed with a duty under\n\nthe Directive Principles of State Policy; <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 38</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, which clearly specifies that the State\n\nshall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing\n\nand protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which\n\njustice, social, economic, and political, shall inform all the\n\ninstitutions of the national life.

Even though the petitioners have also sought for a\n\ndirection to the State Government, to enhance the vaccination\n\nactivities, we do not think any such directions can be issued\n\nsince the supply of vaccine is regulated and controlled by the\n\nGovernment of India, in order to have an equitable distribution\n\namong various States/UTs. Moreover, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nhad occasion to consider the said issue in a Suo Motu Writ\n\nPetition (C) No.3 of 2021, [In Re: Distribution of Essential\n\nSupplies and Services during Pandemic] reported in AIR\n\n2021 SC 2356, and held that the Central Government is free to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\"> WP(C) Nos.16614 &amp; 17274/2021       -:68:-</span>\n\n\n\nchoose any available course of action that it deems fit to tackle\n\nthe issue of requirements of adequate vaccine.

This is also because, even according to the\n\npetitioners, a systematic vaccination procedure is followed by\n\nthe State and at the time of argument, the learned Special\n\nGovernment Pleader has handed over a copy of the COVID-19\n\nDaily Vaccination Bulletin dated 29.08.2021, which is extracted\n\nabove.
