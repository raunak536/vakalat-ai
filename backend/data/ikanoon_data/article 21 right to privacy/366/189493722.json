The news item also revealed that\nthree SIM cards and two mobiles were found from the jail and despite\njammers installed in high security prison, the record showed that\nterrorists were making calls freely to Pakistan. It was pointed out\nthat the jail-break plans were scuttled not on account of any\nalertness on the part of the jail establishment under Mathur but\nbecause of timely intercepts by the IB and quick follow up action\ntaken by the Crime Branch headed by Joint Police Commissioner,\nAhmedabad Shri Ashish Bhatia who confirmed to Times of India that\ninternational calls were made from the phones and SIM cards seized by\nthe police.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.\t\tOn\n29th\nMay, 2008, the Times of India, Ahmedabad edition published a news\nitem showing that at the instance of the High Court of Gujarat, an\noffence was registered against respondent No.2 - Shri Mathur\nfor attempt to murder and sexual harassment and issuing threats to a\nwoman lawyer Sarita Sharma and that he brandished a revolver and left\nit at his lady love&#x27;s house.

According to the applicants, the representation has not\nbeen decided despite the fact that almost ten days had passed and\nthat the investigating agency despite the pendency of the\nrepresentation had started summoning large number of persons from the\nTimes of India. According to the applicants, the entire purpose seems\nto be to ensure that the representation before the State Government\nbecomes infructuous. Under the circumstances, the applicants have\nmoved the present applications for quashing the above referred first\ninformation reports.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">10.\t\tMr.\nS.V.

It was submitted\nthat though essentially all offences are against the State, offences\nfalling under Chapter VI of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">Indian Penal Code</a> are of a nature\nwhich require the first information report to be lodged only by the\nState inasmuch as it is an offence specifically committed against the\nState in particular. It was, accordingly, argued that an offence\nunder section 124A is an offence against the State, however, the\nState is not an aggrieved party and the State has not thought it fit\nto lodge any complaint in respect thereof. It was contended that the\nsecond respondent has no locus standi to file a first information\nreport for sedition as the same being an offence against the State;\nit is only the State which can file a first information report in\nrespect of the said offence.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.2\t\t\tIt\nwas further submitted that <a href=\"/doc/967463/\" id=\"a_9\">section 196</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure prohibits a court from taking cognizance of an offence\npunishable under Chapter VI of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian Penal Code</a> except with the\nprevious sanction of the Central Government or of the State\nGovernment.

It was\npointed out that though the respondent had made an application\nseeking sanction from the State Government, the State Government had\ngranted sanction only in respect of <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_12\">section 499</a> I.P.C. i.e. for the\noffence of defamation however, no sanction has been granted in\nrespect of the offence of sedition falling under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_13\">section 124A</a> of the\nIndian Penal Code.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">10.3\t\t\tThe\nlearned counsel took the court through the relevant news items to\nsubmit that there is nothing in the said articles which would fall\nwithin the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_14\">section 124A</a> of the Indian Penal Code and that\nthe first information report on the face of it does not constitute\nany offence, much less an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_15\">sections 120B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_16\">124A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_17\">34</a> of\nthe Indian Penal Code and <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_18\">section 3</a> of the Police (Incitement to\nDisaffection) Act, 1922.

It was\npointed out that in <a href=\"/doc/111867/\" id=\"a_26\">Kedar Nath</a>&#x27;s case the Supreme Court agreed with\nthe Federal Court&#x27;s view in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar&#x27;s case and\ndisagreed with the\ninterpretation of the Privy Council and held that only the activities\ninvolving incitement to violence or intention or tendency to create\npublic disorder or cause disturbance of public peace would come\nwithin the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_27\">section 124A</a> I.P.C.

It was submitted that in the facts of the present case, the\nfirst information reports do not even remotely suggest that the news\nitems create any disloyalty to the Government or enmity to the\nGovernment.

This, in the opinion of this court, is the correct\napproach in judging the effect of exhibition of a film or of reading\na book. It is the standard of ordinary reasonable man or as they say\nin English law, &#x27;the man on the top of a Clapham omnibus&#x27;.&quot; In\nthe facts of the said case, the court found that there was no\nutterance in the film threatening to overthrow the Government by\nunlawful or unconstitutional means. There was no talk for secession\neither. Nor was there any suggestion for impairing the integration of\nthe country. All that the film seemed to suggest was that the\nexisting method of reservation on the basis of caste was bad and\nreservation on the basis\nof economic backwardness was better. The court observed that the\ndemocratic form of the Government itself demands from its citizens an\nactive and intelligent participation in the affairs of the community.\nThe public discussion with people&#x27;s participation is a basic feature\nand a rational process of democracy which distinguishes it from all\nother forms of the Government. The democracy can neither work nor\nprosper unless people go out to share their views. The truth is that\npublic discussion on issues relating to administration has positive\nvalue.

Gopal and Another v. State of Tamil Nadu and\nothers</a>, (1994)\n6 SCC 632 wherein the\nSupreme Court had laid down certain broad principles as regards right\nof privacy vis-à-vis freedom of press. The court, inter alia,\nheld that in case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\nprivacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is\nsimply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant\nto the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the\npublication is based upon facts and statements which are not true,\nunless the official establishes that the publication was made with\nreckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for\nthe defendant (member of\nthe press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\nverification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that\nwhat he has written is true. The Supreme Court also held that the\nright to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21.</a>  It is a\n&quot;right to be let alone&quot;.

Under the circumstances, the provisions of\nsection 124A would clearly not be attracted. It was submitted that\nthe second respondent is very well aware that in the light of this\nposition, no case for defamation under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_46\">section 499</a> I.P.C. has been\nmade out, and hence, with a malafide intention, the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_47\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. have been invoked. \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">10.12\tNext,\nit was submitted that the mode and manner in which the complaints\nhave been filed shows the misuse of official position by the second\nrespondent in seeing that the first information reports are\nregistered. It was submitted that the first information reports have\nbeen filed malafide and with ulterior motives by misusing the\nofficial position of the second respondent in literally forcing his\nsubordinate officer to register the offence by taking away the\ndiscretion vested in the Police Inspector, Navrangpura to refuse to\nregister the first information reports. It was submitted that when\nthe higher officer directs the subordinate to register the first\ninformation report, the Police Inspector has no choice but to\nregister the same. The registration of the first information reports,\ntherefore, is an abuse of the power of the respondent No.2,  inasmuch\nas, in his capacity as Police Commissioner he had got the first\ninformation reports registered by a subordinate who was under his\ninfluence. Inviting attention to the date and time of the first\ninformation reports in question, it was pointed out that each of the\nfirst information reports has been registered in the early hours of\nmorning when ordinarily officers would be reluctant to register the\ncomplaint.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">10.13\tInviting\nattention to the affidavit-in-reply filed by the respondent, it was\npointed out that it is the case of the respondent that the act,\naction and conduct of the applicants in publishing the articles\ncontinuously for five days clearly reveals that the same is intended\nto create disorder and/or disturbance of public peace and, therefore,\ningredients of offence punishable under section 124A are satisfied.\nIt was submitted that in this case, five first information reports\nhave been registered whereas it is the case of the second respondent\nthat the articles which have been published sequentially are part of\na larger conspiracy. It was submitted that if all the articles form\npart of the very same conspiracy, separate offences cannot be\nregistered in respect of each first information report and as such,\nthe first information reports are required to be quashed even on this\nground.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">10.14\tIn\nconclusion, it was submitted that the first information reports are\nvexatious and frivolous and filed with a malafide intention of\nharassing the applicants for having published the articles in\nquestion. It was submitted that the present cases directly fall\nwithin the categories enumerated in the decision of the Supreme Court\nin the case of State\nof Haryana v. Bhajanlal, AIR\n1992 SC 604 and as\nsuch, the first information reports in question deserve to be quashed\nand set aside.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">11.\t\tMr.\nB.B. Naik, Senior Advocate appearing for the second respondent\nsubmitted that on the allegations made in the first information\nreports the offences alleged are clearly spelt out, hence no case is\nmade out for intervention in exercise of powers under section 482 of\nthe Code. The attention of the court was drawn to the article\npublished in the Times of India edition published on 27th\nMay, 2008 to submit that on a perusal of the first paragraph itself,\nit is evident that the allegations made therein are directly against\nthe Government with a view to incite the people that the Government\nis completely oblivious to the security of the citizens of Ahmedabad.\nIt was submitted that whatever is stated in the article against the\nsecond respondent is to substantiate the allegation against the\nGovernment and is likely to incite hatred against the Government and\nfeeling of insecurity on the part of the citizens, thereby giving\nrise to a law and order problem. It was contended that the contention\nadvanced on behalf of the\napplicants that the allegations made in the news items are against\nthe second respondent and not against the Government, is not correct.\nIt was submitted that the allegations have been made against the\nsecond respondent to substantiate the main allegation that the action\nof the Government is not proper. The offence is further compounded by\nthe fact that continuously in a series of five articles such serious\nallegations which would amount to inciting the public and creating\ncontempt and hatred and disaffection in the minds of the public\nagainst the Government have been published. It was submitted that a\nbare perusal of the articles in question would clearly indicate that\nthe attack is directly on the Government.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">11.1\t\tIt\nwas submitted that the question which arises in the facts of the\npresent cases is as regards the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_48\">section 124A</a> I.P.C.\nby the Supreme Court. It was submitted that even if the provisions of\nsection 124A are read down as held by the Supreme Court in the\ndecisions on which reliance had been placed by the applicants, the\ningredients of section 124A are still made out. It was further\nsubmitted that an attempt to commit an offence under section 124A is\nalso an offence and that in the facts of the present case, there is a\nclear attempt on the part of the applicants to create hatred,\ncontempt and disaffection towards the Government which would result\nin a breach of public order.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the\nfirst information reports do not make a prima facie case of\ncommission of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_49\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. It was argued that\na first information report need not be an encyclopedia of all facts\nand that on a plain reading of the first information reports in\nquestion, the same clearly make out that this is an attack on the\nGovernment with the intention to create contempt, hatred and\ndisaffection in the minds of the public. It was submitted that a\nconjoint reading of the allegations made in the first information\nreports with the contents of the newspaper are sufficient to make out\nprima facie offence under section 124A I.P.C. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">11.2\t\tAs\nregards the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_50\">section 3</a> of the Police (Incitement to\nDisaffection) Act, 1922, it was submitted that if serious allegations\nare made against senior officers of the police force, it would induce\nthe subordinate officers not to obey their orders. It was urged that\nthe contents of the articles in question would create in the minds of\nthe members of the police force disaffection against the Government\nwho appoints such an officer. Under the circumstances, the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_51\">section 3</a> of the said Act are clearly attracted.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">11.3\t\tDealing\nwith the contention that in an offence relating to <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_52\">section 124A</a>\nI.P.C., it is the State which ought to be the complainant, the\nattention of the court was invited to the provisions of section 39 of\nthe Code to submit that every person, aware of the commission of, or\nof the intention of any other person to commit, any offence\npunishable under the sections enumerated thereunder is bound to\nforthwith give information to the nearest Magistrate or Police\nOfficer of such commission or intention. It was submitted that\nsection 124A is one of the offences enumerated under section 39 of\nthe Code and hence, any citizen who is aware of the commission of\nsuch an offence can lodge a first information report in respect\nthereof. It was submitted that merely because the second respondent \nis a Commissioner of Police, he does not cease to be a citizen hence,\nunder the provisions of section 39 of the Code, he is bound to inform\nthe commission of an offence when it comes to his notice.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">11.4\t\tAs\nregards the contention that necessary sanction for prosecuting the\napplicants under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_53\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. has not been obtained by the\nsecond respondent, it was submitted that no sanction is necessary for\nlodging a first information report and that the question of obtaining\nsanction comes at the stage  when after charge-sheet is filed and\ncognizance of the offence is to be taken, which stage has not yet\narrived.  .  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">11.5\t\tInviting\nthe attention of the court to the fact that the present applications\nhave been filed under section 482 of the Code, it was submitted that\nregistration of a first information report not being a proceeding\nbefore a court, the same cannot be questioned in an application under\nsection 482 of the Code. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1108225\" id=\"span_11\">In support of the said submission, the\nlearned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1108225/\" id=\"a_54\">State\nof W.B. and others v.

The\ncourt observed that even when charge is framed, the court has to only\nprima facie be satisfied about the existence of sufficient ground for\nproceeding against the accused.

An attempt may be described to\nbe an act done in part-execution of a criminal design, amounting to\nmore than mere preparation, but falling short of actual consummation,\nand possessing, except for failure to consummate, all the elements of\nthe substantive crime. In other words, an attempt consists in it the\nintent to commit a crime, falling short of, its actual commission or\nconsummation/completion. It may consequently be defined as that which\nif not prevented would have resulted in the full consummation of the\nact attempted. Referring to the facts of the present case, it was\nsubmitted there is nothing to indicate that there was any attempt of\nsedition and that the same failed on account of circumstances which\nwere neither foreseen nor intended by the applicants.</span> \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"855018\" id=\"span_24\">13.3\t\tIt\nwas further contended that section 39 of the Code requires\na person who becomes aware of an offence only to give information and\ndoes not require him to lodge a first information report.

Sujit Kumar Rana</a>\n(supra) for contending that the inherent power of the High\nCourt is saved only in a case where an order has been passed by the\ncriminal court which is required to be set aside to secure the ends\nof justice or where the proceeding pending before a court amounts to\nabuse of the process of court. In this regard, it may be germane to\nrefer to the background in which the above referred decision came to\nbe rendered. In the said case, what was subject matter of challenge\nunder section 482 of the Code was a proceeding for confiscation of\nforest produce under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/654536/\" id=\"a_90\">Indian Forest Act, 1927</a>.\nThe Supreme Court held that the power under section 482 of the Code\ncan be exercised in relation to a matter pending before a court,\nwhich in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_91\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> would mean &quot;a\ncriminal court&quot; or whence a power is exercised by the court\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_92\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. Once it is held that the\ncriminal court had no power to deal with the property seized under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/157078221/\" id=\"a_93\">Forest Act</a>, the question of the High Court exercising its\njurisdiction under section 482 of the Code would not arise. Thus, in\neffect and substance, what is held in <a href=\"/doc/1108225/\" id=\"a_94\">the said decision</a> is that\nsection 482 of the Code can be invoked in relation to proceedings\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_95\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> and not in respect of\nproceedings which are not related to criminal matters. The said\ndecision is not a decision for the proposition that powers under\nsection 482 of the Code can be exercised only in a matter pending\nbefore a court. Thus, reliance placed upon <a href=\"/doc/1108225/\" id=\"a_96\">the said decision</a> appears\nto be misconceived.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_27\">Moreover, it is settled legal position as held by\nthe Apex Court right from the year 1990 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_97\">State\nof Haryana v. Bhajan Lal and others</a>\n(supra) wherein it has been held that where the allegations made in\nthe first information report or the complaint even if they are taken\nat face value do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out\na case against the accused, the High Court can in exercise of\nextraordinary powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution or\ninherent powers under section 482 of the Code, intervene and quash\nthe same.</span> Subsequently, in a series of decisions, the Supreme Court\nhas followed its earlier decision in the case of State of Haryana and\nBhajan Lal (supra). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028094\" id=\"span_29\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1028094/\" id=\"a_99\">Manzar\nSayeed Khan v.

Thus, the contention\nthat powers under section 482 of the Code cannot be exercised to\nquash a first information report, being contrary to the settled legal\nposition, does not merit acceptance.</span></span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">16.\t\tThe\nnext question that arises for consideration is as to whether it is\nimpermissible for the court to quash a first information report\nunless the investigation is concluded. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"41295\" id=\"span_30\">In support of the said\ncontention the learned counsel for the respondent has <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_101\">placed reliance\nupon</a> the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/41295/\" id=\"a_102\">State\nof Karnataka v. Pastor P. Raju</a>\n(supra) for the proposition that the court would not interfere with\nthe investigation or during the course of investigation which would\nmean from the time of lodging of the first information report till\nthe submission of the report by the officer in charge of the police\nstation in court under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_103\">section 173(2)</a> CrPC, this field being\nexclusively reserved for the investigating agency. In this regard it\nmay be noted that in the said case, the High Court had quashed the\nproceedings at the stage\nprior to the stage of cognizance by the learned Magistrate on the\nground that previous sanction of the Central Government or of the\nState Government or the District Magistrate had not been obtained.\nThe court observed that on the view taken by the High Court, no\nperson accused of an offence, which is of the nature which requires\nprevious sanction of a specified authority before taking of\ncognizance by the court, can ever be arrested nor can such an offence\nbe investigated by the police. The specified authority empowered to\ngrant sanction does so after applying its mind to the material\ncollected during the course of investigation. There is no occasion\nfor grant of sanction soon after the FIR is lodged nor such a power\ncan be exercised before completion of investigation and collection of\nevidence.  The court held that, therefore, the whole premise on the\nbasis of which the proceedings had been quashed by the High Court was\nwholly erroneous in law and liable to be set aside. Thus, it is\napparent that in the facts of the said case, the High Court had not\nset aside the proceedings on the ground that the first information\nreport did not disclose commission of a cognizable offence but had\nquashed the first information report on the ground that previous\nsanction of the Central Government or the State Government had not\nbeen obtained. It is in the aforesaid backdrop, that the Supreme\nCourt had held that the court should not interfere with the\ninvestigation or during the investigation, this field being\nexclusively reserved for the investigating agency. The said decision\ndoes not lay down any absolute proposition of law that at the stage\nof lodging of a first information report, during the pendency of the\ninvestigation, in no case, a first information report can be quashed.\n Under the circumstances, the contention that at the stage\nwhen the investigation is yet to be carried out, the first\ninformation report cannot be quashed does not merit acceptance. As to\nwhether or not the first information report should be quashed prior\nto investigation would depend upon the facts and circumstances of\neach case.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">17.\t\tThe\nnext question that arises for consideration is as to whether on the\nallegations made in the first information report, the offence as\nalleged can be stated to have been made out. It would, therefore, be\nnecessary to briefly advert to the contents of the first information\nreports in question. A perusal of the first information report\nregistered vide Navrangpura Police Station I-C.R. No.286/2008 shows\nthat the main allegations as regards commission of the offence\nalleged are to be found in paragraphs 3, 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the\nsaid first information report. The case of the first informant is\nthat the applicants had made preparation to execute criminal\nconspiracy digging out old settled matter and making unsubstantial\nand uncorroborated allegations and inferences against the first\ninformant and that a criminal conspiracy was hatched to defame him as\nPolice Commissioner of Ahmedabad city, a law enforcing arm of the\nState Government with the intention to cause and spread hatred\nagainst the Police Commissioner and State Government by the owner of\nTimes of India, editor, correspondent, press photographer and\nconcerned member of TNN. It is further alleged that a statement made\nbefore about fourteen years by a known criminal and accused was made\nthe basis for causing hatred against the State Government for posting\nthe first informant as Police Commissioner, doubting whether his\ncareer is seen by the State Government. It is further alleged that\nthe statement of the\naccused has been made a basis to attempt to cause hatred against most\nof the police force of Ahmedabad city on the payroll of Latif\n(although the claim has not been substantiated or corroborated by any\nindependent evidence in material particulars) to facilitate his\ncriminal activities. Deliberately the date of the statement is not\nmentioned as it was recorded fourteen years ago. It is also alleged\nthat a concerted and organized tirade had been unleashed by Times of\nIndia against the first informant, the Gujarat police and the State\nGovernment of Gujarat by making various imputations against him,\nother senior officers and the State Government established by law\nwith intention to cause hatred, contempt and disaffection. Attempts\ntowards disaffection have been made by publishing unsubstantiated,\nuncorroborated, biased, malafide news items without referring to the\ntrue facts. That in paragraph (1) of the news item, an imaginary\nimputation is made against the State Government of Gujarat\nestablished by law with regard to the posting of the first informant\nin the Ahmedabad city as Police Commissioner, implying that the State\nGovernment has not seen his career records to cause anxiety, alarms\nand made attempt for hatred in the minds of five million residents of\nAhmedabad city against the State Government.  It is further alleged\nthat in paragraph (2) of the news item, an imputation has been made\nthat a statement taken by CBI does rake up some muck on Mathur then\nserving as Police Commissioner, Ahmedabad city. It is alleged that\nthe imputation is based on exculpatory statement of an accused who is\ninvolved in many serious offences which is an uncorroborated,\nunsubstantiated allegation and has been published with an intention\nto attempt to show that State Government has not applied its mind to\ncreate hatred amongst the\ncitizens. It is further alleged that in paragraph (4) of the news\nitem, imputation is made against most of the police officers of\nAhmedabad city being on payroll of Latif to facilitate his extensive\nactivities in areas such as bootlegging, contract killing, extortion,\nkidnapping and land grabbing apart from recklessly murdering people\nwho came his way to undermine faith of public of Ahmedabad city and\nelsewhere in the law and machinery of the State Government\nestablished by law and  thereby have made an attempt to cause\ncontempt and hatred. It is further alleged that in paragraphs (5),\n(6) and (7) of the news item, imputation is made against him as well\nas other senior officers and higher ups in the Government headed by\nthe Chief Minister which is also unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,\npublished with intention to cause hatred against other senior police\nofficers of the State Government established by law.  That the\nallegation of patronage given to organized crime by politicians and\npolice is also unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and is published only\nwith a view to cause contempt and hatred. The publication of the news\nitem at this time coupled with the tirade against him after being\nposted as Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad city has been made to\nattempt to undermine the lawful authority of police force of\nAhmedabad city, a part of the State Government established by law. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">These,\nin effect and substance, are the allegations made in the first\ninformation report for the purpose of invoking the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_104\">section 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_105\">124A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_106\">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">18.\t\tIt\nis settled legal position that while considering an application\nunder section 482 of the Code for the purpose of quashing a first\ninformation report, unimpeachable documents which are not refuted by\nthe other side can be looked into for the purpose of examining as to\nwhether or not an offence can be stated to be made out on the\nallegations made in the first information report. In the present\ncase, it is the case of the second respondent himself that on a\ncombined reading of the articles/news items and the first information\nreports in question, the offence as alleged is clearly made out.\nUnder the circumstances, it is permissible for this court to look\ninto the news items in question in the context of which the first\ninformation reports have been lodged. A perusal of the news items\nwhich have been published in various editions of the Times of India\nfrom 27th\nMay, 2008 to 1st\nJune, 2008 show that on the basis of statements recorded by the CBI\nin respect of earlier investigation in connection with the murder of\nCongress leader and Ex-M.P. Rauf Valiullah, the articles in question\nhave been published questioning the wisdom of the State Government in\nappointing the second respondent as the Police Commissioner, given\nhis background as narrated in the said articles. A close reading of\nthe said articles reveals that what is stated therein is based upon\nstatements recorded by the CBI, viz., official records. The said\nrecords are related to the official functions of the second\nrespondent. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_48\">19.\t\tA\nperusal of the article dated 28th\nMay, 2008 in respect of which the second first information report has\nbeen lodged shows that the same is based upon the allegations\ncontained in CBI documents presented before the courts at the\nrelevant time. It is stated in the said article that these\nallegations were never probed by successive regimes and now that\nthe facts have faded out of collective memory, the Government of the\nday does not bother checking the dark pasts of officers before\nrewarding them with plum postings. The second article contained\ntherein relates to jail break plans which had been made at the time\nwhen the second respondent was serving as DGP, CID (Crime) and Jails.\nIn the entire first information report, there is absolutely no\nallegation made against the State Government and the same only states\nthat jail break plans were scuttled not because of any alertness on\nthe part of the jail establishment under the second respondent, but\nbecause of timely intercepts by the I.B. and quick follow-up action\nby the Crime Branch.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">20.\t\tThe\nnext article published in the Times of India edition of 29th\nMay, 2008 contains two articles one stating facts to the effect that\nthe second respondent had gone to the house of one Sarita Sharma and\nthat during the course of an argument, he had brandished his service\nrevolver. The said article, can in no manner, be said to be an\narticle which would create hatred or contempt or disaffection towards\nthe State Government inasmuch as the same does not even mention any\nact of the State Government. The second article is in respect of an\nincident that had taken place earlier. It is stated in the said\narticle that  DCP Geetha\nJohri, an officer junior to the second respondent, promptly acted\nupon a tip-off that Latif and his gang had been spotted at Mahad Ka\nMohalla. However, while Latif escaped two of his men were arrested by\nGeetha and her men and that by the time Mathur dragged his feet to\nreach Mahad Ka Mohalla, things had quietened down Geetha was already\non her way to Shahibaug with her two prize catches.\n On a plain reading of the said article it is amply clear that the\nsame does not impute\nanything to the State so as to fall within the ambit of section 124A.\nIn the said edition, opinions have also been called for from the\nreaders as to whether they want O.P. Mathur to continue as\nAhmedabad&#x27;s Commissioner of Police.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">21.\t\tIn\nthe article published on 30th\nMay, 2008, various events right from 1992 to May, 2008 till the time\nthe second respondent was made the Commissioner of Police had been\ndetailed. In the said article, it has been alleged that the earlier\ninvestigating officer Rajnish Rai had handed over the case papers to\nMathur which included a CD containing telephone records of police\nofficers, businessmen and politicians which indicated towards a\npossible nexus behind the elimination of Sohrabuddin in order to save\nsome Rajasthan-based businessmen from his extortion threats. When\nMathur forwarded the case papers to Geetha, with instructions in\nwriting that she should inform him about every move in the case,\nGeetha found the CD of telephone records missing. Without the CD to\nestablish the political nexus, it is only police officers who find\nthemselves behind bars in the fake encounter of Sohrabuddin and the\nkilling of Kauserbi. The missing CD has also given confidence to the\nGujarat Government to admit in an affidavit before the Supreme Court\nthat Sohrabuddin encounter was fake, and his wife Kauserbi was also\nkilled by the same bunch of police officers. If the CD was still part\nof the Sohrabuddin case papers, a top Gujarat Minister and a high-\nranking BJP politician of Rajasthan would be running for cover.  This\npolitical duo reciprocated last week by making Mathur the\nCommissioner of Police, Ahmedabad. Thus, this article contains an\nimputation against the political duo, which is alleged to have\nreciprocated by making the second respondent a Commissioner in\nconnection with the CD which was found to be missing. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_51\">22.\t\tIn\nthe article published on 31st\nMay, 2008 which bears the heading &quot;Latif an ISI man and Mathur\na Latif man? Five Million Amdavadis can&#x27;t be safe under new police\nchief with dubious links&quot;, the background of the second\nrespondent has been stated and it has been further alleged that on\nthe one hand, the security cover of Chief Minister Narendra Modi has\nbeen upgraded to &quot;PM level&quot; on the other, there is\nvirtually no insulation from terror strikes for five million\nAmdavadis. The rickety security machinery of Gujarat&#x27;s largest city\nnow has a Head who cannot be trusted with handling either the\nunderworld or terror networks.  It is further stated that considering\nthat fighting terror has always been very high on the Chief\nMinister&#x27;s agenda but his credentials as a leader determined to fight\nterror and make Gujarat a safe and secure place do get dented with a\ncop of Mathur&#x27;s rather dubious credentials occupying such a critical\nposition in the security apparatus. In the said edition, the response\nof the readers of the Times of India on the opinions called for in\nthe earlier edition have also been published which reveal that 98% of\nthe readers wanted the second respondent out.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">23.\t\tWhat\nis now required to be examined is as to whether what is stated in the\narticles and reproduced hereinabove would amount to an offence of\nsedition under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_107\">section 124A</a> I.P.C.

It is also significant that the\ncorresponding Irish formula of &quot;undermining the public order\nor the authority of the State&quot; [<a href=\"/doc/1714884/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 40(6)(i)</a> of the\nConstitution of Eire, (1937)] did not apparently find favour with the\nframers of the Indian Constitution.  Thus, very narrow and stringent\nlimits have been set to permissible legislative abridgement of the\nright of free speech and expression, and this was doubtless due to\nthe reaslisation that freedom of speech and of the press lay at the\nfoundation of all democratic organisations, for without free\npolitical discussion no public education, so essential for the proper\nfunctioning of the processes of popular Government, is possible.  A\nfreedom of such amplitude might involve risks of abuse.  But the\nframers of the Constitution may well have reflected, with Madison who\nwas &quot;the leading spirit in the preparation of the First\nAmendment of the Federal Constitution&quot;, that &quot;it is\nbetter to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant\ngrowth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those\nyielding the proper fruits&quot;.</span></span> (Quoted in Near v.

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/111867/\" id=\"a_118\">Kedar\nNath Singh v. State of Bihar</a>\n(supra) was called upon to decide the constitutional validity of\n<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_119\">section 124A</a> IPC. It was contended before the Supreme Court that a\nperson who makes a very strong speech or uses very vigorous words in\na writing directed to a very strong criticism of measures of\nGovernment or acts of public officials, might also come within the\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_120\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. The court held that such words written\nor spoken would be outside the scope of the section. It was observed\nthat the security of the State which depends upon the maintenance of\nlaw and order is the very basic consideration upon which legislation,\nwith a view to punishing offences against the State is undertaken.\nSuch a legislation has, on the one hand, fully to protect the\nguarantee of freedom of speech and expression, which is the sine qua\nnon of a democratic form of Government that, Constitution has\nestablished. The court held that a citizen has a right to say or\nwrite whatever he likes about the Government or its measures, by way\nof criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite people to\nviolence against the Government established by law or with the\nintention of creating public disorder. The court observed that if it\nwere to hold that even without any tendency to disorder or intention\nto create disturbance of law and order, by the use of words written\nor spoken which merely create disaffection or feelings of enmity\nagainst the Government, the offence of sedition is complete, then\nsuch an interpretation of the sections would make them\nunconstitutional in view of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> read with clause (2). It\nwas held that it is well settled that if certain provisions of law\nconstrued in one way would make them consistent with the\nConstitution, and another interpretation would render them\nunconstitutional, the court would lean in favour of the former\nconstruction. It was further held that the provisions of the sections\nread as a whole, alongwith the explanations, make it reasonably clear\nthat the sections aimed at rendering penal only such activities as\nwould be intended, or have a tendency to create disorder or\ndisturbance of public peace by resorting to violence. It is only when\nthe words written or spoken etc. which have the pernicious tendency\nor intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and\norder that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the\ninterest of public order.</span> \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">25.\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1557467\" id=\"span_35\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1557467/\" id=\"a_122\">Manubhai\nTribhovandas Patel v.

In other words,\ndisloyalty to Government established by law is not the same thing as\ncommenting in strong terms upon the measures or acts of the\nGovernment, or its agencies, so as to ameliorate the condition of the\npeople or to secure the cancellation or alteration of those acts or\nmeasures by lawful means, i.e. to say, without exciting those\nfeelings of enmity and disloyalty which imply incitement to public\ndisorder or the use of violence. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">28.\t\tThe\ncontents of the news items in question are required to be examined in\nthe light of the aforesaid statutory position, to ascertain as to\nwhether they have the tendency to excite feeling of enmity or\ndisloyalty which imply incitement to public disorder or use of\nviolence so as to constitute the offence of sedition as envisaged in\n<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_128\">section 124A</a> IPC. The material contents of the articles published in\nthe various editions of the Times of India in respect of which the\nfirst information reports have been lodged have been referred to\nhereinabove. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">29.\t\tInsofar\nas the first article published on 27th\nMay, 2008 is concerned, various facts disclosed during the course of\ninvestigation by the CBI have been referred to therein and it has\nbeen commented that one presumes that the Government of Gujarat must\nhave seen the career records of the second respondent well before\nentrusting him the responsibility of providing security to five\nmillion residents of the State&#x27;s largest city. Thus, what is\ncommented upon is the wisdom of the State Government in appointing a\nperson like the second respondent given his background as reflected\nfrom the investigation made by the CBI.  The article published in the\nedition of 28th\nMay, 2008 refers to documents from the CBI&#x27;s records and statements\nmade by the accused about various officers of the police being\nrecipients of Latif&#x27;s largesse and states that the second\nrespondent should thank his stars that his name is not clearly\nidentified as a recipient of Latif&#x27;s largesse despite his\njurisdiction completely overlapping the Latif territory. It is\nfurther stated therein that the allegations contained in CBI\ndocuments presented before the courts were never probed by successive\nregimes and now that these facts have faded out of collective memory,\nthe Government of the day does not bother checking the dark pasts of\nofficers before rewarding them with plum postings. Thus, what is\ninsinuated in the said article is that the State Government has not\nchecked the background of the second respondent before appointing him\nas a Police Commissioner of the City of Ahmedabad. The contents of\nthe said articles are based upon CBI records and the only allegation\nagainst the State is of not verifying the background of the second\nrespondent before appointing him as the Police Commissioner.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">30.\t\tInsofar\nas the second article is concerned, it only relates to various calls\nmade from jail by terrorists during the tenure of the second\nrespondent as the DGP, CID (Crime) and Jails and there is no\nreference at all to the State Government. The third article published\non 29th\nMay, 2008 is in relation to an incident which had taken place when\nthe second respondent had gone to the residence of Sarita Sharma and\nan altercation had taken place, whereupon he had brandished his\nrevolver.  The said article can, in no manner, be said to be an\narticle exciting contempt, hatred and disaffection against the State\nGovernment inasmuch as there is not even a reference to any action of\nthe State Government in the said article. The second article in the\nsaid edition only refers to an incident where a subordinate officer\nof the second respondent had arrested members\nof the Latif gang whereas the second respondent had not taken the\ninitiative to do so. The fourth article published on 30th\nMay, 2008 refers to a CD which had been handed over by the earlier\ninvestigating officer to the second respondent and which was\nsubsequently found to be missing. It is alleged in the said article\nthat if the CD was still part of the Sohrabuddin case papers, a top\nGujarat minister and a high-ranking BJP official of Rajasthan would\nbe running for cover. The political duo had reciprocated last week by\nmaking Mathur the Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad. Thus, in this\nmanner, the allegation is against the political duo who made the\nsecond respondent a Police Commissioner with a view to reward him in\nrespect of the missing CD which would have implicated them in the\noffence in question. The said article cannot be said to be an article\nagainst the State Government inasmuch as no allegation or imputation\nhas been made against the State Government and the only imputation\nwhich is made is against a minister and a high-ranking BJP politician\nfrom Rajasthan. The fifth article published on 31st\nMay, 2008 says that on the one hand, the security of the Chief\nMinister has been upgraded to Prime Minister&#x27;s level, whereas there\nis virtually no insulation from terror strikes for five miliion\nAmdavadis and that the security of Gujarat&#x27;s largest city now has a\nHead who cannot be trusted with handling either the underworld or\nterror networks. In the said article, the correspondent has expressed\nhis opinion that in the light of the background of the second\nrespondent, the security of the citizens of the city is in the hands\nof a person who cannot be trusted. Thus, an apprehension has been\nvoiced as regards the capacity of the second respondent to provide\nsecurity to the citizens of Ahmedabad. The said article also says\nthat though terror fighting has always been very high on\nthe Chief Minister&#x27;s agenda, his credentials as a leader determined\nto fight terror and to make Gujarat a safe and secure place do get\ndented with a cop of Mathur&#x27;s dubious credentials occupying such a\ncritical position in the security apparatus. Thus, what is stated is\nthat by the act of appointing the second respondent as Commissioner\nof Police of Ahmedabad city, the Chief Minister&#x27;s credentials as a\nleader determined to fight terror gets dented. On a plain reading of\nthe aforesaid article, it is apparent that nothing has been imputed\nto the State Government established by law in the entire article, all\nthat is stated is that the security of the city would not be safe in\nthe hands of a person with the credentials of the second respondent\nand that the image of the Chief Minister gets dented on account of\nhaving appointed him. Thus, comments made in the said article are\ncomments as regards the wisdom of the concerned in appointing the\nsecond respondent as the Commissioner of Police of the city of\nAhmedabad. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"111867\" id=\"span_38\">The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/111867/\" id=\"a_129\">Kedar\nNath Singh v. State of Bihar</a>\n(supra) has held that the expression &quot;Government established by\nlaw&quot; has to be distinguished from the persons for the time\nbeing engaged in carrying on the administration.  &quot;Government\nestablished by law&quot; is the visible symbol of the State. The\nvery existence of the State will be in jeopardy if the Government\nestablished by law is subverted. Hence, the continued existence of\nthe Government established by law is an essential condition of the\nstability of the State. That is why, &quot;sedition&quot;, as the\noffence in section 124A has been characterised, comes under Chapter\nVI relating to offences against the State. Hence, any acts within the\nmeaning of section 124A which have the effect of subverting the\nGovernment by bringing that Government into contempt or hatred,\nor creating disaffection against it, would be within the penal\nstatute because the feeling of disloyalty to the Government\nestablished by law or enmity to it imports the idea of tendency to\npublic disorder by the use of actual violence or incitement to\nviolence. In other words, any written or spoken words, etc. which\nhave implicit in them the idea of subverting Government by violent\nmeans, which are compendiously included in the term &quot;revolution&quot;\nhave been made penal by the section in question. But the section has\ntaken care to indicate clearly that strong words used to express\ndisapprobation of the measures of the Government with a view to their\nimprovement or alteration by lawful means would not come within the\nsection. Similarly, comments, however strictly worded, expressing\ndisapprobation of the actions of the Government, without exciting\nthose feelings which generate the inclination to cause public\ndisorder by acts of violence, would not be penal. In other words,\ndisloyalty to Government established by law is not the same thing as\ncommenting in strong terms upon the measures or acts of the\nGovernment or its agencies, so as to ameliorate the condition of the\npeople or to secure the cancellation or alteration of those acts or\nmeasures by lawful means, i.e. to say, without exciting those\nfeelings of enmity and disloyalty which imply excitement to public\ndisorder or the use of violence. Adverting to the facts of the\npresent case, in the opinion of this court, a plain reading of the\narticles in respect of which the first information reports have been\nlodged clearly reveal that the same do not in any manner have the\ntendency of subverting the Government by violence means, nor do the\nsame have the effect of creating hatred, disaffection or contempt for\nthe Government. The articles merely comment in strong terms upon the\nmeasures of the Government namely, appointment\nof the second respondent as the Police Commissioner considering his\nbackground as brought out in the series of articles based upon\nrecords of the CBI.  It appears that by publishing the said article,\nthe applicants seek to ameliorate the conditions of the people and to\nsecure the cancellation and alteration of the acts of the Government\nnamely, appointment of the second respondent as Police Commissioner,\nwithout exciting feelings of enmity or disloyalty in the public at\nlarge. Commenting on the wisdom of the Government in making a\nparticular appointment, in the opinion of this court, would not fall\nwithin the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_130\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. The news items in question\nwould clearly fall within the ambit of the second and third\nexplanations to <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_131\">section 124A</a> IPC. Under the circumstances, the\ningredients to constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_132\">section 124A</a> IPC are\nclearly missing in the facts of the present cases. As held by the\nApex Court in the decisions cited hereinabove, a citizen has a right\nto say or write whatever he likes about the Government or its\nmeasures, by criticism or comment, so long as he does not incite\npeople to violence against the Government established by law or with\nintention to create public disorder.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_39\">31.\t\tThe\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_133\">S.\nRangarajan v.

State of Tamil Nadu</a>\n(supra), in case of public officials, the right to privacy or for\nthat matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available\nwith respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\ntheir official duties.  This is so even where the publication is\nbased upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\nofficial establishes that the publication was made by the defendant\nwith reckless disregard for truth.  In the facts of the present case,\nindubitably the articles in question are in respect of discharge of\nthe official duties of the second respondent. It appears that since\nit was, therefore, not possible for the second respondent to resort\nto the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_139\">section 499</a> IPC against the applicants, he has\nresorted to lodging the first information report under the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_140\">section 124A</a> I.P.C. by alleging serious offences against the\napplicants herein. On the allegations made in the first information\nreports, the second\nrespondent at best could have lodged a complaint alleging commission\nof the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_141\">section 499</a> IPC, if otherwise permissible in\nlaw. However, in no case could the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_142\">section 124A</a> IPC\nhave been invoked in the facts and circumstances of the present\ncases.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">34.\t\tThe\nsecond respondent has lodged five first information reports alleging\ncommission of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_143\">section 124A</a> IPC.

If the contention of the second respondent were to be\naccepted no adverse comment could be made as regards the\nappointment/promotion of any officer belonging to the police force,\nwhich cannot be the intention of the legislature while enacting the\nsaid provision. The test for the invoking the said provision would be\nwhether the news items in question has the propensity of evoking\namongst the members of\nthe police force feelings\nof disaffection towards the Government established by law in India or\nthe effect of inducing any member of the police force to withhold his\nservice or to commit a breach of discipline.

A\nmere comment on the wisdom of the State Government in appointing the\nsecond respondent as Commissioner of Police in the context of his\nbackground, can in no manner induce a prudent member of the police\nforce to withhold his service or commit a breach of discipline, nor\ncan such comment have the effect of creating disaffection against the\nGovernment.

In the facts of the present case,\nmerely because in the first information reports, it has been stated\nthat the articles in question have been published  with the intention\nto cause hatred against senior police officers of the State\nGovernment established by law and that the same have been published\nas an attempt to cause contempt and hatred against the State\nGovernment, the same would not fall within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_155\">section 124A</a>\nIPC or <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_156\">section 3</a> of the Police (Incitement to\nDisaffection) Act, 1922,\nwhen the ingredients for\nconstitution of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_157\">section 124A</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_158\">section 3</a> of\nthe said Act are woefully lacking.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">37.\tAs\nnoted earlier it has been contended on behalf of the applicants that\nit is the case of the respondent that the act, action and conduct of\nthe applicants in publishing the articles continuously for five days\nclearly reveals that the same is intended to create disorder and/or\ndisturbance of public peace and, therefore, ingredients of offence\npunishable under section 124A are satisfied. In this case, five first\ninformation reports have been registered whereas it is the case of\nthe second respondent that the articles which have been published\nsequentially are part of a larger conspiracy. It has been submitted\nthat if all the articles form part of the very same conspiracy,\nseparate offences cannot be registered in respect of each first\ninformation report and as such, the first information reports are\nrequired to be quashed even on this ground. It\nhas also been contended that since a larger conspiracy has been\nalleged, separate first information reports in respect of the same\noffence would not be maintainable. Since this court, after examining\nthe case of merits has found that on the allegations made in the\nfirst information reports, the offences alleged are not made out, the\ncourt does not deem it fit to enter into the arena of the larger\nquestion as to whether or not separate first information reports\ncould have been filed in respect of each individual news item.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">38.\t\tIn\nthe light of the aforesaid discussion, this court is of the view that\nthe allegations made in the first information reports in question do\nnot constitute the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_159\">sections 124A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_160\">120-B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_161\">34</a> IPC and\n<a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_162\">section 3</a> of the Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922. \nUnder the circumstances, continuance of the proceedings against the\napplicants would amount to abuse of the process of law, justifying\ninvocation of the powers under section 482 of the Code to secure the\nends of justice.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">39.\t\tFor\nthe foregoing reasons, the applications succeed and are, accordingly,\nallowed.
