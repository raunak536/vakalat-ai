At the outset, it is\n\n           pointed out that the authority to carry out a census is with the\n\n           Central Government under Entry 69 of List I of the Seventh\n\n           Schedule to the Constitution of India. The State cannot attempt\n\n           to carry out a caste census in the garb of a survey, especially\n\n           when the State has absolutely no legislative competence and, in\n\n           that circumstance, neither can an executive order be sustained\n\n           under <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India. Census though\n\n           not defined in the Act, the common parlance definition is put\n\n           forth before us from generic sources, to argue that it is quite\n\n           distinguishable from a survey as commonly defined. A census\n\n           while defined as a process of officially counting something,\n\n           especially a country&#x27;s population and recording the facts\n\n           relating to the individuals comprising the polity; a survey is an\n\n           investigation into the opinions and behavior patterns of a\n\n           particular group of people. In a survey the opinions are elicited\n\n           by asking prepared questions, for multifarious purpose, like\n\n           deciding the marketing strategy in a purely commercial venture\n\n           or the shape the welfare schemes should take, a governmental\n\n           function.     Hence, when a survey is carried out, there is a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           5/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           specific objective, which is totally absent in the present\n\n           exercise which again raises the question of whether the present\n\n           survey carried on as a caste based one, is in effect a Census;\n\n           especially when in reality it is an attempt to elicit the caste\n\n           status of the individuals native to the State. It is pointed out\n\n           that the last Census was carried out in the year 1931, before\n\n           independence and there were identified 74 (seventy-four)\n\n           categories of castes within the State of Bihar which has now\n\n           risen to 215 (two hundred and fifteen) even as per the\n\n           Government&#x27;s showing as displayed from the castes identified\n\n           for the purpose of the survey. It is argued that there is no\n\n           legislative power to carry out such a survey which in effect is a\n\n           Census and there is also no disclosed object for carrying out\n\n           such a survey.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">                          4. Answering the contention of the State, that there\n\n           is no compulsion on any individual to disclose their personal\n\n           details, it is pointed out from the guidelines issued to the\n\n           hierarchical officers that, the details are to be collected from\n\n           the eldest family member and in the case of caste status it could\n\n           even be from the relatives or neighbors which militates against\n\n           the claim of voluntary disclosure. From the guidelines it is\n\n           pointed out that in the case of a woman, in the event of non-\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           6/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           disclosure of caste of the father of her child, the officers are\n\n           directed to ensure such disclosure in the presence of another\n\n           person, which deprives the woman of the right to not disclose\n\n           the details and further degrades her on account of her gender\n\n           alone. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_4\">In effect, it turns out to be a compulsory disclosure\n\n           which is in violation of the right to privacy of an individual\n\n           which is held to be an intrinsic part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n           Constitution of India by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case\n\n           of <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_3\">K.S. Puttaswamy v Union of India</a> (2017) 10 SCC 1. It is\n\n           pointed out that positive discrimination on the ground of caste\n\n           could be upheld only under sub-clauses (4), respectively of\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_5\">16</a> of the Constitution of India and otherwise it\n\n           falls foul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 14.</a></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_5\">5. Annexure-1 is the notification issued by the\n\n           Government which does not disclose any perceivable object for\n\n           carrying out such a survey and Annexure-2 is the\n\n           communication issued to the District Officers, who have, by\n\n           Annexure-3 directed the lower hierarchical officers to comply\n\n           with the procedure directed. Annexure-4 is the mode of\n\n           implementation giving specific guidelines as to how the details\n\n           have to be elicited.            Annexure-4 specifically speaks of\n\n           collecting the information through the head of the family and\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           7/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           the details of any other member given by the head of the family\n\n           cannot be voluntary disclosure of the members of the family. It\n\n           is pointed out from Annexure-4 that there are 17 different\n\n           parameters of which caste is only one of them; but the survey\n\n           all the same is termed a caste survey, laying bare the very\n\n           intention of the Government. As far as the reference to <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_7\">Indira\n\n           Sawhney v. Union of India</a>, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 is\n\n           concerned, the dictum revolves around reservation to\n\n           educational institutions and public employment, which\n\n           affirmative action has not been declared as an objective by the\n\n           State Government, of the present exercise. In fact, even the\n\n           Government of India has confessed to the practical difficulties\n\n           in carrying out a caste-based census thus, making the present\n\n           survey a mindless exercise. It is argued that the State cannot be\n\n           allowed to justify its actions by virtue of the statements made\n\n           in a counter affidavit filed in the writ petition. Especially when\n\n           there is no perceivable reason or deliberation, stated, prior or\n\n           simultaneous to the bringing out of Annexure-1 notification.</span>\n\n           The decision in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (Aadhaar\n\n           Case), (2019) 1 SCC 1, is also relied on to point out that\n\n           privacy being an inextricable facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a>, there cannot\n\n           be any compulsory extraction of the personal details from the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           8/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           citizens, which would fall foul of the constitutional guarantee\n\n           to life, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a>, which has also been held to be a right\n\n           to live with dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_8\">6. It is argued that in addition to the total absence\n\n           of data integrity, there is also no measure implemented by the\n\n           State to ensure the data security. Even if the collection of data\n\n           is on a voluntary basis, there can be no public consumption of\n\n           such data, which would again violate the right to privacy of an\n\n           individual; even if the data is given voluntarily. It is also\n\n           pointed out that transgenders were included as a caste which\n\n           goes against the principles enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_10\">National Legal\n\n           Services Authority v.

Any collection of\n\n           data by the Government should be with sufficient protection\n\n           afforded for the personal details and if that is not ensured it\n\n           would lead to dissemination of the information collected,\n\n           leading to infringement of informational privacy and the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           9/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           individuals autonomy to decide how the sensitive personal data\n\n           is to be used. In conclusion, it is pointed out that there is no\n\n           legislation to support the caste based survey and in fact, there is\n\n           no legislative power conferred on the State to carry out such an\n\n           exercise. There is absolute absence of statement of objects\n\n           which should also be a reasonable one having nexus with the\n\n           ultimate aim and contemplated prior to the notification or\n\n           simultaneous to its issuance. The action cannot be substantiated\n\n           through any object or explanation, stated in the counter\n\n           affidavit filed to the writ petition. Lastly, it is argued that the\n\n           entire exercise violates the principles of proportionality.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"104626448\" id=\"span_11\">7.

Sri Shashwat, learned\n\n           counsel appearing in CWJC No.6505 of 2023 relied on the\n\n           decision in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_20\">National Legal Services Authority</a> (supra) to point\n\n           out that the transgenders&#x27; individual identity and entity were\n\n           compromised by putting them together as a caste. Though they\n\n           have been qualified as a backward community for the purpose\n\n           of getting State relief, there is no reason to put them in a single\n\n           caste category, which caste category does not really exist. It is\n\n           pointed out that though the Government has clarified that\n\n           transgenders would not be classified as a caste, the\n\n           classification remains in the guidelines issued by the State\n\n           Government, which prejudices them.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">                          9. The learned Advocate General, first of all,\n\n           pointed out that the notification itself was issued on 06.06.2022\n\n           and after a detailed exercise of training undertaken, the first\n\n           field survey commenced in January, 2023 and the second phase\n\n           is expected to conclude by 15.05.2023. As of now 80% of the\n\n           work is completed. The petitioners are wayfarers who were\n\n           sitting on the fence; when the entire exercise was commenced\n\n           and undertaken, without raising any challenge. The learned\n\n           Advocate General points out that two writ petitions were filed,\n\n           admittedly by different parties, before this Court challenging\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                          12/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           the appropriation of Rs.500 Crores from the contingency fund,\n\n           which writ petitions were withdrawn on the submission made\n\n           by the then Advocate General that appropriation bills were\n\n           placed and passed. It is asserted that at that stage and even\n\n           now the submission of the State is that an appropriation bill\n\n           was passed but then, not a single farthing was withdrawn from\n\n           the contingency fund. The petitioners are guilty of gross delay\n\n           and they were conscious of the exercise commenced by the\n\n           State as early as in June, 2022. Yet another party had\n\n           approached the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court with a writ petition in\n\n           January, 2023, which was dismissed granting liberty to\n\n           approach the High Court. Further delay was caused by filing a\n\n           writ petition and not curing the defects and the entire exercise\n\n           smacks of an ill motivated, malafide attempt to stall a valid\n\n           exercise initiated by the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_18\">10. It is asserted that there is no prima facie case\n\n           projected by the petitioners for grant of an interim order and in\n\n           fact, there is absolutely no case on the facts or law, as coming\n\n           out    from     the    pleadings,       regarding   the   caste   survey\n\n           contemplated and continued by the State of Bihar. The learned\n\n           Advocate General specifically refers to the equality clause in\n\n           the Preamble of the Constitution of India, which, it is urged,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                          13/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           has to be read in consonance with the directive principles,\n\n           which puts forth the ultimate goal. It is for the ultimate purpose\n\n           of achieving an ideal situation as contemplated in the directive\n\n           principles that both Houses of the elected representatives in the\n\n           State of Bihar unanimously resolved to carry out a caste\n\n           census. The decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_21\">Indira\n\n           Sawhney</a> (supra) is specifically relied on and Paragraph 859\n\n           (3) (a) and (b) at page 766 thereof are read over. It is pointed\n\n           out that the last caste census was carried out in 1931 and\n\n           Mungeri Lal Commission appointed by the State Government\n\n           in 1978 relied on the data collected in the year 1931. The\n\n           attempt of the said Commission was to find the backwardness\n\n           among      the    backward        communities   and   there   was   a\n\n           classification made of backward communities and extremely\n\n           backward communities.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_20\">The affirmative exercise of granting\n\n           reservation would depend upon the caste census to be carried\n\n           out and this is also sanctioned by the nine-Judges Constitution\n\n           Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_22\">Indira Sawhney</a> (supra). The entire\n\n           population of the State of Bihar is being surveyed and the\n\n           experience of such survey has opened the eyes of the State\n\n           Government to a number of shortcomings which are also\n\n           sought to be rectified. It is asserted that when such policy\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                          14/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           decision has been taken, there is no scope for a public interest\n\n           litigation against the said policy. Placing reliance on lofty,\n\n           abstract ground of right to privacy; which no common man is\n\n           concerned with, the above writ petition attempts to hamper a\n\n           legitimate exercise of a survey carried out by the State\n\n           Government to better understand the needs and requirements of\n\n           its people; all aimed at ensuring it&#x27;s people, a life with dignity.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61360196\" id=\"span_22\">11. The learned Advocate General asserts that on\n\n           the question of privacy, it is to be mentioned that there is no\n\n           law prohibiting the disclosure of caste nor the exercise of a\n\n           survey carried out by the State of Bihar. In the Indian context,\n\n           it cannot be said that disclosure of caste is a violation of\n\n           privacy; especially when the same is disclosed for the purpose\n\n           of reservation and availing benefit of welfare schemes by the\n\n           citizens themselves, voluntarily. It is also pointed out that the\n\n           Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has laid down a triple test which has\n\n           been noticed by a Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/61360196/\" id=\"a_23\">Sunil\n\n           Kumar vs. State of Bihar</a>, 2022 (4) PLJR 428. The\n\n           determination of ratio of representation to the local bodies is\n\n           one of the triple tests, to satisfy which, definitely there should\n\n           be a survey in the manner in which it is now conducted. In this\n\n           context, it is pointed out that as of now only 37% reservation is\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                          15/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           provided for elections to the Local Self Government\n\n           Institutions with 50% horizontal reservation for women. Only\n\n           extremely backward classes have been granted 20% reservation\n\n           out of 37% and there remains 13%; to determine which\n\n           necessarily there should be a caste survey, which alone could\n\n           bring in the realization of proportionate political representation\n\n           to the various classes and categories. It is emphasized that after\n\n           75 years of independence, the ideal situation of equality, still\n\n           eludes the nation; and the right to privacy, in the balancing\n\n           scale of social welfare, has to take a back seat. It is specifically\n\n           pointed out that the entire details collected by the State are\n\n           already available in the public domain and what is attempted is\n\n           only collecting and collating the information already available.\n\n           There is absolute cooperation from the general public and the\n\n           survey is an accepted exercise within the State.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_24\">The judgment\n\n           in <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_24\">Indira Sawhney</a> (supra) was referred to copiously to point\n\n           out the necessity for such survey, which is recognized by the\n\n           Constitution Bench. <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_25\">The Census Act</a> provides for an obligation\n\n           on the citizen and un-hindered access to the officers of the\n\n           Government, involved in the activity of census; which is absent\n\n           in the present survey attempted by the State since it is\n\n           voluntary in nature.

It is argued that\n\n           the State has the absolute exclusive privilege of shaping its\n\n           policies to give maximum advantage to the citizens; especially\n\n           the marginalized, which is the ultimate objective of the caste\n\n           based survey.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                           12.

There is a unanimous resolution taken in the two\n\n           House of the State to carry out the survey which also has been\n\n           approved by the State Cabinet. There could arise minor\n\n           infirmities in an exercise of this magnitude, which is normal\n\n           and natural, but will be rectified and redressed. The learned\n\n           Advocate General specifically points out the grievance raised\n\n           by the transgenders and the community of &#x27;Lohars&#x27;, which\n\n           arose in the midst of the survey, which have been addressed by\n\n           the State Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">                          13.

The social\n\n           reform movement started before the pre-independence era and\n\n           continued after the independence unabated; but the caste-based\n\n           divisions are still not overcome.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">                          14. The petitioners assert that the present survey\n\n           would only reinforce the said divisions and result in the\n\n           perpetuation of depravations to which many were subjected to,\n\n           in the sole name of caste. It is famously said that a progress\n\n           backwards into and not over the tombs can result in disastrous\n\n           consequences. But, we are not social reformers and it is best\n\n           left to those working within the societies and the legislators,\n\n           elected directly by the people, who also shape the policies of\n\n           the State. Here, we are concerned with the ticklish question of\n\n           whether the instant survey falls within the policy realm or in\n\n           the legislative domain; and if in the latter, whether there is a\n\n           power so to do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                          15.

The three issues are: (i) whether the\n\n           expenditure for the massive exercise is with the due sanction of\n\n           law, (ii) whether the exercise of a caste based survey is one in\n\n           accordance with law &amp; (iii) whether the questions asked result\n\n           in infringement of privacy. We propose to answer these in-\n\n           seriatim and if on any issue, we find favour with the arguments\n\n           of the petitioners, then the other issue/issues need not be\n\n           considered; which need be considered only at the final stage.\n\n           However, if we find all the points urged to be not sustainable,\n\n           then necessarily interim prayer would have to be declined.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                          16. With respect to the allegation of Rs.500 Crores\n\n           having been taken from the contingency fund without due\n\n           appropriation as provided under the Constitution of India, the\n\n           legislation on that count as also the Rules of Business framed\n\n           by the State, have to be looked at on the basis of the arguments\n\n           raised by the learned Advocate General, regarding the absence\n\n           of a challenge to the submission made before this Court, on the\n\n           strength of which the earlier writ petitions on similar lines were\n\n           closed.

Annexure-R-2 is the judgment in CWJC No.9339\n\n           of 2022 filed by one Veterans Forum for Transparency in\n\n           Public Life, again, challenging the notification dated\n\n           06.06.2022 wherein also, on similar submissions made by the\n\n           then Advocate General, the writ proceedings were closed. The\n\n           learned Advocate General specifically points out that in fact\n\n           Annexure-R-2 has been filed by the very same advocate who\n\n           has filed CWJC No.4624 of 2023 and hence the mere fact that\n\n           there is no specific contention raised in the present writ\n\n           petition, doubting the veracity of the submission made by the\n\n           then learned Advocate General; has prevented the State from\n\n           answering it completely with substantiating records.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">                          17. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in\n\n           CWJC No.4624 of 2023 admits that there is no such contention\n\n           raised in the writ petition. We are conscious of the fact that the\n\n           petitioners are different, but it has to be noticed that the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                          20/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           advocate who settles the pleadings has a duty to his client and\n\n           also an onerous duty to the Court to disclose the full facts, to\n\n           both the client and the Court. Hence, it cannot be said that the\n\n           petitioner in CWJC No.4624 of 2023 was not aware of the\n\n           earlier proceedings having been closed on the submission of\n\n           the learned Advocate General regarding budgetary allocation\n\n           having been made and passed by the legislature. The veracity\n\n           of such submission having not been challenged, we are of the\n\n           opinion that at this stage we need not look into the specific\n\n           allegation raised of expenditure, without sanction of law and\n\n           the same would be reserved for consideration at the final\n\n           hearing; if the petitioner makes suitable amendments with\n\n           notice to the State, in which event the State would also be\n\n           enabled to resist it with substantiating materials.

The difference between &quot;census&quot; and &quot;survey&quot;\n\n           as has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the\n\n           petitioners has to be understood from the generic sources, since\n\n           the relevant statutes do not define it. Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary\n\n           defines &#x27;census&#x27; as an official count of people, made for the\n\n           purpose of compiling social and economic data of the political\n\n           sub-division to which the people belong. &#x27;Census&#x27; as defined in\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                          21/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           Webster&#x27;s New Collegiate Dictionary is the count of a\n\n           population and a property evaluation in early Rome, which is\n\n           almost a complete enumeration of the population, made by the\n\n           Government. The Concise Law Dictionary by P. Ramanatha\n\n           Aiyar defines it as an official enumeration of the inhabitants of\n\n           the State or country with details of sex, age, family, occupation,\n\n           possession etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                          19. &quot;Survey&quot; on the other hand, as defined in the\n\n           Oxford Advanced Dictionary, is an investigation of the\n\n           opinions, behaviour, etc. of a particular group of people, which\n\n           is usually done by asking them pre framed question. Black&#x27;s\n\n           Law Dictionary defines it as an appraisal and a general\n\n           consideration of something and also includes the measuring of\n\n           a tract of land.          It has also been defined as a poll or\n\n           questionnaire, especially one examining popular opinions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                          20. The essential difference between a &#x27;census&#x27; and\n\n           &#x27;survey&#x27;, as we discern from the above definitions, is that the\n\n           former contemplates collection of accurate facts and verifiable\n\n           details; while, a survey is intended at collection and analysis of\n\n           opinions and perceptions of the general public which may be\n\n           aimed at a specific community or group of people or the\n\n           extended community of a polity. Hence, while in a &#x27;census&#x27; the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                          22/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           details of an individual are collected, in a &#x27;survey&#x27; often the\n\n           opinions and perceptions of the targeted persons are collected.\n\n           Both result in an analysis of the data collected; which in the\n\n           case of a &#x27;census&#x27; are empirical, while in a &#x27;survey&#x27; are mostly\n\n           logical conclusions. Viewed from the above perspective, the\n\n           present exercise by the State of Bihar can only be seen as an\n\n           attempt to carry out a &#x27;census&#x27; under the name of a &#x27;survey&#x27;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">                          21. &#x27;Census&#x27; is included in List I of the Seventh\n\n           Schedule of the Constitution of India at Entry 69. It is trite that\n\n           the entries in the various Lists of the Seventh Schedule are only\n\n           fields of legislation and the source of the legislative power is to\n\n           be traced to <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 246</a> of the Constitution of India. <a href=\"/doc/671198/\" id=\"a_27\">Article\n\n           246(1)</a> is a non-obstante provision which overrides clauses (2)\n\n           and (3) and confers Parliament with the exclusive power to\n\n           make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in\n\n           List I of the Seventh Schedule.

Entry 45 of the Concurrent List deals with\n\n           inquiries and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters\n\n           specified in List II or List III. List I stands excluded and\n\n           collection and enumeration of the details of caste does not find\n\n           a place in either List II or List III, in which circumstance, the\n\n           power has to be found exclusively confined on the Union\n\n           Parliament, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 246</a> read with Entry 69 of List I\n\n           which deals with census. Entry 20 of the Concurrent List deals\n\n           with economic and social planning, Entry 23 deals with social\n\n           security and social insurance; employment and unemployment,\n\n           Entry 24 is concerned with welfare of labour including\n\n           conditions of work and Entry 30 is with respect to vital\n\n           statistics including registration of births and deaths.

In the\n\n           present case, we have found that census would be in the\n\n           exclusive domain of the Parliament and there could be no\n\n           orders brought out in exercise of the coinciding legislative\n\n           power, like the impugned notification for reason of the total\n\n           absence of such legislative power.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">                          23. In this context, we have to notice that the\n\n           notification produced at Annexure-1 specifically speaks of the\n\n           State Government having decided to conduct a caste-based\n\n           survey through the General Administration Department,\n\n           expenditure of which was intended to be taken from the Bihar\n\n           Contingency Fund, with a target to complete the exercise by\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                          25/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           February, 2023. Annexure-2, communication issued by the\n\n           Principal Secretary to the District Officers, also indicates the\n\n           subject to be of &#x27;Bihar Caste-based enumeration for\n\n           determination of caste list for 2022.&#x27; The proforma in which\n\n           the survey is to be conducted enumerates seventeen heads or\n\n           details to be collected; one of which is &#x27;caste&#x27;. The details of\n\n           even caste and income of every family member would be taken\n\n           from the head of the family and not from the respective\n\n           individual, which itself militates against the veracity and\n\n           integrity of the data supplied. This also stands against the\n\n           contention taken of a voluntary disclosure. It was pointed out\n\n           by the learned Advocate General that the data would be entered\n\n           only after each &amp; every individual, who is a native of Bihar\n\n           and not resident within the State, at the time of survey, being\n\n           contacted and the enumerator verifying the data through video\n\n           conferencing. We are of the prima facie opinion that such data\n\n           obtained from the head of the family, cannot be merely verified\n\n           through video conferencing, which would also require due\n\n           authentication of the identity of the person who comes on video\n\n           conferencing. Further, over and above the mere collection and\n\n           collation of the details, there is insisted a declaration to be\n\n           made by the head of the family; which could be used against an\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                          26/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           individual if there is no data integrity &amp; security ensured. In\n\n           this context, we reckon the arguments of the learned Advocate\n\n           General, with reference to the counter affidavit and the\n\n           measures brought in for ensuring the security of the data. We\n\n           are not for the moment proposing to consider this aspect, since\n\n           the accuracy &amp; integrity of the data collected; under the\n\n           seventeen enumerated heads as seen from the proforma\n\n           produced along with the writ petition, in the haphazard manner\n\n           in which it is contemplated, through the head of the family,\n\n           neighbours and relatives, could itself be in question. It has also\n\n           to be pertinently observed that survey, though extends to the\n\n           age,    gender,      marital     status,      income,   possessions   and\n\n           educational qualification of each individual, the intention was\n\n           solely to identify the caste, which is more than evident from the\n\n           terminology with which the survey has been called, i.e.: &#x27;a\n\n           caste-based survey&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                          24.

It is admitted\n\n           that to satisfy the &#x27;triple tests&#x27;, ensuring proportionate\n\n           representation in the Local Self Government Institutions, there\n\n           is appointed a Commission, which could very well consider the\n\n           issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                          25. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_39\"><a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_35\">Indira Sawhney</a> (supra) inter alia held that\n\n           reservations, by affirmative action, can be provided by the\n\n           Parliament, State Legislatures, statutory rules as well as by way\n\n           of executive instructions issued by the Central Government\n\n           from time to time. This is not to say that the State can carry out\n\n           a caste-based census. While recommending the approach and\n\n           methodology adopted by Justice O Chinnappa Reddy\n\n           Commission, the Constitution Bench also observed that it was\n\n           not the only procedure or method or approach and it is for the\n\n           authority (appointed to identify) to adopt such approach and\n\n           procedure as it thinks appropriate and so long as the approach\n\n           adopted by it is fair and adequate, the Court has no say in the\n\n           matter. The identification, dealt with by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n           Court, was identification of backwardness, which may as well\n\n           start with the castes and proceed to occupational groupings\n\n           among others. To effectuate affirmative action and identify\n\n           backwardness, a Commission has already been appointed. We\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                          28/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           are afraid the impugned exercise is not of identification of\n\n           backwardness but of the caste- status of the natives of the State\n\n           of Bihar. This is explicit from the requirement in the guidelines\n\n           to ascertain the caste of an individual, from the head of the\n\n           family, relative or neighbour. As far as a child is concerned, the\n\n           guidelines insist for ascertainment of the father&#x27;s caste from the\n\n           mother.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                          26. There is also a compulsion on the mother, if she\n\n           fails to disclose it, to do so in front of any other person present\n\n           there. The guidelines also prohibits the caste of the mother to\n\n           be entered as that of the child; which is in violation of the\n\n           Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court declaration that the backwardness of a\n\n           person, for reason of his belonging to a caste, should be\n\n           determined by the circumstance in which he grows up. The\n\n           possibility of deprivation having visited on the child on\n\n           account of the caste status, in which he is brought up, is the\n\n           relevant aspect to be considered for the purpose of enabling the\n\n           benefits of an affirmative action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                          27. It was also pointed out to us that both the\n\n           Houses of the Legislature unanimously resolved to carry out\n\n           the caste-based survey, which has also been approved by the\n\n           Cabinet. We fail to understand why if there was law making\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                          29/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           power available with the Legislature and there being\n\n           unanimous agreement across the treasury and opposition\n\n           benches, why a legislation was not brought about; especially in\n\n           the teeth of the argument raised of lack of legislative power.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">                          28. We are also not impressed with the argument\n\n           raised of delay, especially since the writ petition is filed in\n\n           public interest and there is no question arising of having slept\n\n           over individual rights. We are convinced that the survey, in the\n\n           manner in which it is carried out, cannot be said to be within\n\n           the policy realm of the State. Even the defence raised was to\n\n           source the State&#x27;s power to legislate under the Concurrent List;\n\n           which we have found to be untenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                          29. On the above reasoning, we find that the caste-\n\n           based survey is a census in the garb of a survey; the power to\n\n           carry out which is exclusively on the Union Parliament which\n\n           has also enacted a <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_36\">Census Act, 1948</a>. True, there is a\n\n           compulsion by way of an obligation on the citizen under the\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_37\">Census Act</a> and un-hindered entry conferred on the authorized\n\n           officers; but also a protection from the records of census not\n\n           being open to inspection nor admissible in evidence; under\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/142059368/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 15</a>. Though it has been vehemently urged that both\n\n           Houses of the State Legislature has sanctioned the survey, there\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                          30/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n           is nothing placed on record regarding the deliberations made or\n\n           the objects sought to be achieved by embarking upon such a\n\n           massive exercise, that too for the collection of details which\n\n           include the sensitive issue of caste. There are broad reasons\n\n           stated in the counter affidavit, but nothing comes out from the\n\n           notification, nor is any specific reasoning or object stated to\n\n           have motivated the initiation of the exercise of a caste-based\n\n           survey, which reasoning or motivation should also be relatable\n\n           to a time, contemporaneous with the time of bringing out the\n\n           notification. It is also submitted before us that 80% of the work\n\n           is over and what remains is mere collation of the details\n\n           collected and the further action based on such data collected\n\n           and made available to the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                          30. We are of the considered opinion that the\n\n           petitioners have made out a prima facie case against the\n\n           continuation of the process of caste- based survey, as attempted\n\n           by the State of Bihar. There is also the question raised of data\n\n           integrity and security which has to be more elaborately\n\n           addressed by the State. Prima facie, we are of the opinion that\n\n           the State has no power to carry out a caste-based survey, in the\n\n           manner in which it is fashioned now, which would amount to a\n\n           census, thus impinging upon the legislative power of the Union\n           Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023(6) dt.04-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                    31/31</span>\n\n\n\n\n                     Parliament. We also see from the notification issued that the\n\n                     Government intends to share data with the leaders of different\n\n                     parties of the State Assembly, the ruling party and opposition\n\n                     party which is also a matter of great concern. There definitely\n\n                     arises the larger question of right to privacy, which the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n                     Supreme Court has held to be a facet of right to life.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">                                    31.
