Petitioners, herein, claim to be major and one of the party to the marriage has converted to the religion/faith of his/her partner. The petitioners apprehend threat to their life, liberty and well-being. Hence the instant writ petitions seeking protection. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tIn the leading writ petition (14896 of 2021)1, it is pleaded  that both the petitioners are medical professionals. The first petitioner (Vaishnavi), a Hindu, after conversion accepted Islam, thereafter, she married the second petitioner according to Muslim customs. The petitioners have applied for registration of their marriage. It is specifically pleaded that since they belong to different faiths, they eloped and got married on their free will. They apprehend threat to their life and liberty as the contesting private respondent, father of the first petitioner, is opposing the interfaith marriage. The first petitioner converted to Islam on 5 January 2021 and the Nikahnama is dated 23 January 2021. It is also pleaded that the first petitioner belongs to Maharashtra and the second petitioner is from Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh. The conversion and marriage had taken place in the State of Maharashtra. The registration of the marriage has been applied before the Marriage Registrar/Officer at Bijnore.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tIn Writ Petition No. 16411 of 20212, the first petitioner                                                                                             Zeent Aman @ Neha Soti, aged about 27 years, a muslim, converted and accepted the Hindu faith. It appears that the conversion and the marriage under Hindu rites and customs was solemnized on 22 April 2021 at Arya Samaj Mandir in Bijnore. It is specifically pleaded that the registration of marriage is not possible without prior permission of the District Magistrate.  The couple apprehends honour killing. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8.\tIn Writ Petition No. 16796 of 20213, the first petitioner Maahi @ Manaal Khan, a Muslim, converted and accepted Hindu faith on 29 August 2020, thereafter, the petitioners solemnized marriage under the Hindu rites and customs at Arya Samaj Mandir, District Kanpur, on the same date. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">9.\tIn Writ Petition No. 16848 of 20214, the first petitioner Shama Paravin, a Muslim, converted and accepted Hindu religion. Petitioners have applied for registration of their marriage at Ghazipur.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">10.\tIn Writ Petition No. 15464 of 20215, the first petitioner Gulafasa @ Gauravi, a Muslim, married the second petitioner a Hindu at a Radha Krishna Temple, Amroha on 14 June 2021, after leaving her parents home. It is pleaded that the first petitioner accepted Hindu faith, but there is no document evidencing her conversion, nor have the petitioners applied for registration of their marriage. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">11.\tIn Writ Petition No. 15675 of 20216, the first petitioner Ekta Madhwani @ Mehar Khan, a Hindu converted to Islam on 21 June 2021, thereafter on the same day contracted marriage with the second petitioner, a Muslim. The petitioners are graduates. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">12.\tIn Writ Petition No. 15778 of 20217, the first petitioner  Mahira @ Mamta Maurya, a Hindu converted to Islam on 11 January 2018, thereafter, marriage was contracted on 15 June 2019, according to Muslim rites and customs at Bareilly. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">13.\tIn Writ Petition No. 13623 of 20218, the first petitioner Fija, a Muslim, converted and accepted Hindu faith. The marriage was solemnized in a Shiv Temple at Badaun, on 15 March 2021. Petitioners apprehend harassment accordingly a notarized marriage affidavit was prepared on 14 April 2021, declaring their marital status. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">14.\tIn Writ Petition No. 16062 of 20219, the first petitioner  Sarita @ Salma Kaur, a Muslim, converted to Hindu faith in a ceremony conducted at Arya Samaj Mandir, Saharanpur, thereafter, solemnized marriage under Hindu rites and customs on 16 March 2021. The first petitioner is aged about 34 years, whereas, the second petitioner is 25 years. It appears that the petitioners are illiterate and the second petitioner is working as a carpenter. Aadhaar has been filed as proof of age by the respective petitioners.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">15.\tIn Writ Petition No. 6422 of 202110, the first petitioner Snehlata @ Rukaiya Mansuri, a Hindu, aged about 42 years converted to Islam and contracted marriage with the second petitioner aged about 40 years. The conversion and marriage appears to have taken place at Surat, Gujarat.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">16.\tIn Writ Petition No. 17568 of 202111, the first petitioner-Naseema @ Neha, a Muslim, converted to Hindu faith, thereafter, married the second petitioner  on 7 July 2021 in a Shiv Temple, at Prayagraj, according to Hindu rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">17.\tIn Writ Petition No. 16321 of 202112, the first petitioner Renu @ Ruby, a Hindu, converted to Muslim religion, thereafter, married the second petitioner on 21 June 2021, according to Muslim rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">18.\tIn Writ Petition No. 18559 of 202113, it is the second marriage of both the petitioners. The first petitioner, Salma @ Sarla, a muslim by birth, contracted marriage with second petitioner after taking divorce from her husband, thereafter, she converted to Hindu religion. The second petitioner is a widower. The marriage of the petitioners is alleged to have been solemnized on 24 March 2020, at Arya Samaj, Adarsh Colony, Muzaffar Nagar, according to the Hindu rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">19.\tIn Writ Petition No. 14731 of 202114, the first petitioner-Ayasha @ Pratibha, a Hindu, converted to Muslim faith, thereafter, married the second petitioner on 3 August 2020, at Jalalnagar Bajariya, Shahjahanpur, according to Muslim rites and rituals.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">20.\tIn Writ Petition No. 17790 of 202115, the first petitioner-Nisha @ Nisha Khatoon, a Hindu, converted to Muslim faith, thereafter, married the second petitioner on 4 September 2013 at PAC Naya Gaon, Moradabad, according to Muslim rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">21.\tIn Writ Petition No. 17940 of 202116, the first petitioner-Smt. Siba Bano, a Muslim, converted to Hindu faith, thereafter, married the second petitioner on 14 July 2021 in a Shiv Temple, at Jahanpur Bilar Mau, according to Hindu rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">22.\tIn Writ Petition No. 13508 of 202117, the first petitioner-Baby @ Fatima Khatoon, a Hindu, converted to Muslim faith, thereafter, married the second petitioner on 28 December 2018, according to Muslim rites and customs.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">23.\tThe common thread running through all the petitions is that the petitioners have contracted interfaith marriage upon conversion; petitioners are major. It is pleaded that the conversion is on free will; some petitioners are highly qualified i.e. professionals, graduates and some appear to have not passed secondary examinations. They apprehend threat to their life and liberty at the hands of their parents, relatives and other family members in connivance of the State machinery. Some of the petitioners have approached the District Police seeking protection.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">24.\tThe petitioners are before this Court, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, seeking protection of their life, liberty and privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a>, to live independently as man and woman without the interference of the private respondents.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">B. Rival Submissions\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">25.\tLearned Standing Counsel appearing for the State-respondents submits that the conversions is for the purpose of marriage; approval of the District Magistrate has not been obtained before conversion, and/or, contracting marriage; marriage cannot be registered without the district authority making an enquiry, as to whether, the conversion is voluntary and not induced by coercion, allurement and threat. In other words, the State-Counsel submits that the petitioners are not entitled to any relief from this Court, they should approach the competent district authority and obtain approval, in the first instance, with regard to their conversion. The writ petitions are liable to be dismissed.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">26.\tPer contra, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the argument advanced by the State counsel is misconceived; the citizens have a right to make choice of their partner and faith; the conversion of religion/faith, followed by marriage under the personal law is on free will without coercion, threat or inducement. Interference by the State or by the private respondents would tantamount to encroaching upon their constitutional right to freedom, choice, life, liberty and to live life on own terms as man and woman. The prior approval of the district authority followed by registration of marriage is not sine qua non before conversion and marriage. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">27.\tHe further submits that even taking a case that approval of the authority was not taken prior to conversion, the petitioners still have a right to live together being major. He further submits that the legal frame work, pertaining to interfaith marriage, as it stands today, is archaic, regressive and primarily discourages registration and recognition of interfaith marriage, rather, the law compels and encourages a party to convert. The petitioners are entitled to protection under the Constitution as their life, liberty and privacy are under threat.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">28.\tRival submissions fall for consideration.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">29.\tIt would be apposite to briefly gauge into the laws governing conversion, particularly, in State of Uttar Pradesh and the relief, if any, the petitioners are entitled to.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">C. Anti Conversion Laws/Freedom of Religion Act\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">30.\tFreedom of religion and belief is a basic human right across civilized states. The Constitution of India and the Declaration of Human Rights guarantees every person right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion which includes freedom from religion, freedom to change religion and belief. The freedom of conscience means that a person is free to entertain any belief or doctrine regarded by him/her as conducive to his/her spiritual well being. Religion and thought constitute the most intrinsic part of human nature. This implies that State cannot enquire into or take notice of a persons religious or moral beliefs. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed upon the external manifestation of thought, conscience, religion and belief to protect public safety, public order, health, morality and fundamental right of others. It follows that no person can be compelled to profess a particular religion or be bound to remain a member of a particular sect.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">31.\tIn this backdrop, it would be apposite to briefly consider the Anti Conversion Laws/Freedom of Religion Acts.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">32.\tIndia is home to all the principal religions of the world - Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism and Bahaism. In the Indian sub-continent enactment of anti-conversion laws is an age old pratice. During the British era the Hindu Princely States enacted laws during 1930-40 restricting religious conversion18. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">33.\tAfter independence, Parliament introduced a number of anti-conversion laws but none saw the light of the day. <a href=\"/doc/64531482/\" id=\"a_4\">The Freedom of Religion Act</a> or Anti-Conversion Laws came to be  enacted, thereafter, by the States. The first law was enacted by Odisha, followed by Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, several States followed suit- Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttrakhand and Uttar Pradesh. The Anti-Conversion Laws/Freedom of Religion Acts came to be enacted between 1967 to 2021. The provisions of the enacted laws primarily are similar, varying in the degree of punishment and penalty. The later enactments of Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh and the Gujarat (Amendment) (Freedom of Religion Act, 2021), are stringent and in particular prohibit conversion  for the sole purpose of marriage, mandating advance notice to the District Magistrate. In some of the enactments the offence has been made cognizable and non-bailable. The legislations primarily prohibit active proselytizing, conversions from the religion of one&#x27;s ancestors carried out by forcible or fraudulent means. The vires of the Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat enactments are under challenge and pending in respective High Courts. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">34.\tSupreme Court upheld the anti-conversion laws of Odisha and Madhya Pradesh and refused to read the freedom to convert within the right to propagate one&#x27;s religion and held that: \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;What the <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_5\">article (25)</a> grants is not the right to convert another person to one&#x27;s own religion, but to transmit or spread one&#x27;s religion by an exposition of its tenets. It has to be remembered that <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_6\">article 25(1)</a> guarantees &quot;freedom of conscience&quot; to every citizen, and not merely to the followers of one particular religion, and that, in turn, postulates that there is no fundamental right to convert another person as one&#x27;s own religion because if a person purposely under-takes the conversion of another person to his religion, as distinguished from his effort to transmit or spread the tenets of his religion, that would impinge on the &quot;freedom of conscience&quot; guaranteed to all the citizens of the country alike.&quot; (Refer: Rev. stainislaus vs. State of Madhya Pradesh)19. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">35.\tThese legislations in the opinion of the Court pertain to public order, as forcible conversions could result in disturbing public order. The Court was of the view that one has a right to propagate but not to propagate in order to convert another. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">36.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"733037\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80351\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/80351/\" id=\"a_7\">Lily Thomas vs. Union of India20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/733037/\" id=\"a_8\">Sarla Mudgal vs. Union of India21</a>, Supreme Court held that religious conversion without a bona fide belief and for the sole purpose of deriving some legal benefit are illegal. The cases pertain to conversions to Islam by Hindu/Parsi, married under personal law, to contract bigamous marriages during the subsistence of their earlier marriage. In the opinion of the Court such a marriage would be void.</span></span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">37.\tIt is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that Uttar Pradesh enactment22 proposes to criminalise conversions for the purpose of marriage. <a href=\"/doc/64531482/\" id=\"a_9\">The Act</a>, inter alia, violates the right to privacy read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21.</a> He submits that the individuals right to make a choice of his/her spouse/partner as families, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation is absolute, as long as, it is not illegal. The State or the Executive have no business to encroach upon the space of &#x27;&#x27;conscience&#x27;. The act of conversion and interfaith marriage does not per se disturb public order.  The marriage and consent to conversion is voluntary act exercised on free will. Most of the parties have submitted before the authority and applied for registration of their marriage, no further permission with regard to conversion is required from the district administration. There is merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners. I would revert to the submission later during the course of the order.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">D. Law Governing Interfaith Marriage\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">38.\tParliament enacted Special Marriage Act, 195423, for regulating and registration of interfaith marriage. It is a secular enactment providing for civil marriage. All marriages, whether interfaith or contracted in any other form, including, under the personal law can be registered under the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_11\">Special Marriage Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/64531482/\" id=\"a_12\">The Act</a> mandates conditions relating to solemnization of special marriage24. <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_13\">The Special Marriage Act</a> further mandates that parties to the marriage shall give prior notice in writing to the Marriage Officer; the marriage  ceremony is required to be performed within three months from the date of notice. <a href=\"/doc/64531482/\" id=\"a_14\">The Act</a> further requires domicile of one of the parties for a period of not less than 30 days immediately preceeding such notice. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">39.\tThe Marriage Officer, thereafter, shall call every such notice to be published and if any one of the parties is not permanently residing within the local limits of the district of the Marriage Officer, the provision mandates that the Marriage Officer shall call a copy of the notice to be transmitted to the Marriage Officer of the district within whose limit such party is permanently residing.  In other words domicile of one of the party at the place of notice is mandatory.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">40.\t<a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_15\">The Special Marriage Act</a> provides that any person before expiry of thirty days period of notice can file objection to the marriage. <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_16\">The Act</a> further provides that where marriage has been contracted in any other manner, the parties can seek registration of the marriage25. The procedure thereunder again mandates publication of a notice inviting objections and domicility of a party. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">41.\tOn bare perusal of the provisions, the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_17\">Special Marriage Act</a> contemplates marriage and registration both at pre and post marriage stage. But what is compulsorily mandated is of providing notice and inviting objections in either case and in the event of an objection being received, the Marriage Officer will have to decide the objection. In other words, the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_18\">Special Marriage Act</a>, enacted in 1954, the legislature could not have contemplated the situation as it exists after 65 years of its enactment. The society since has transformed phenomenally and the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_19\">Special Marriage Act</a> does not subscribe, nor does it meet the changing attitudes, needs and expectation of the present day society. The principal object of law is to serve the society as per its requirements and it necessarily requires that the law also keeps evolving with the perceptible changes occurring in the society. <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_20\">The Special Marriage Act</a> miserably falls short of its objective and is surely not responsive to the changed circumstances with the massive rise in interfaith marriage26.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1703207\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"588155\" id=\"span_4\">42.\tThe legislation, be it <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_21\">Special Marriage Act</a>, that has been upheld earlier at the given point of time, the Court may strike down the same if in the changed circumstances become arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of principles enshrined in the Constitution.  (Refer: <a href=\"/doc/588155/\" id=\"a_22\">Madhya Pradesh v. Bhopal Sugar Industries27</a>; and <a href=\"/doc/1703207/\" id=\"a_23\">Satyawati Sharma v.

A private and personal affair between two individual has been made mandatorily public. It is urged that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_27\">Special Marriage Act</a> is primarily responsible in compelling couples to take recourse to instant conversion under the personal laws to escape the rigours of the delayed and prolonged procedure mandated under the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_28\">Special Marriage Act</a>. In other words, it is submitted that the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_29\">Special Marriage Act</a> compels and encourages conversion. An unwilling person who intends to contract interfaith marriage, retaining his/her faith, has no option but to convert. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there should be a single uniform secular family code for all the citizens irrespective of faith, as against multiple laws governing marriage so as to avoid the mischief of anti conversion laws.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">E.

Marriage Registration Rules, 2017, pursuant to a Supreme Court decision rendered in 2006, requiring mandatory registration of all marriages performed in the State of Uttar Pradesh or where one of the parties to the marriage is a resident of the State. Under this Rule all marriages can be registered, including marriage with a foreigner. It is a secular law.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">47.\tThat apart the Arya Samajist are governed by the <a href=\"/doc/385841/\" id=\"a_30\">Arya Marriage Validation Act, 1937</a>. It was enacted to recognize and remove doubts as to the validity of inter-marriages among Arya Samajist. It is a short Act of two sections. Section (2) provides, notwithstanding any provision of Hindu law, usage or custom to the contrary, no marriage contracted by two persons being at the time of marriage Arya Samajist shall be invalid or shall be deemed to have been invalid by reason only of the fact that the parties at the time belong to different castes or different sub-castes of hindus or that either or both of the parties at any time before the marriage belong to religion other than hindu. The Arya Samajists fall within the ambit of &#x27;&#x27;hindu&#x27; defined under the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_31\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">48.\tThe State further has enacted the <a href=\"/doc/37453521/\" id=\"a_32\">U.P.

Both these Acts separately provide for registration of marriage. <a href=\"/doc/1166543/\" id=\"a_36\">Under the Christian Marriage Act</a>, a Christian can solemnize marriage with a non-christian.  \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">49.\tThe interfaith marriage generally are performed either under the Muslim Personal Law, (Shariyat) Application Act, and/or, under the <a href=\"/doc/385841/\" id=\"a_37\">Arya Marriage Validation Act</a>. The services provided by the Qazi, and/or, the Arya Samajist is instant matrimonial service across the counter. The conversion of faith followed by marriage stands concluded within hours. Whereas, registration of the marriage, under the U.P. Marriage Registration Rules, 2017, the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_38\">Special Marriage Act</a>, or seeking approval of the district authority of interfaith conversion, is time consuming requiring mandatory notice and enquiry. In any case, the time for registration of marriage, from the date of application takes several weeks, which necessarily compels the couple to take recourse under the personal law by converting.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">50.\tIn the backdrop of multiplicity of marriage and registration laws, the State of Uttar Pradesh has enacted the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 202129. <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_39\">The Act</a> provides for prohibition of unlawful conversion from one religion to another religion by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion or allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage and in the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">51.\t<a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_40\">The Act</a>, inter alia, defines &#x27;&#x27;religion convertor&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;undue influence&#x27;, &#x27;&#x27;unlawful conversion&#x27;, which reads thus:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">  &quot;(i) &quot;Religion Convertor&quot; means person of any religion who performs any act of conversion from one religion to another religion and by whatever name he is called such as Father, Karmakandi, Maulvi or Mulla etc.;\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(j) &quot;Undue influence&quot; means the conscientious use by one person of his/her power or influence over another in order to persuade the other to act in accordance with the will of the person exercising such influence;\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(k) &quot;Unlawful Conversion&quot; means any conversion not in accordance with law of the land.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">52.\tOn perusal of the definitions, any person of any religion who performs any act of conversion to another religion would fall within the ambit of &#x27;&#x27;religion convertor&#x27;, and such  conversion not performed in accordance with law would be &#x27;&#x27;unlawful conversion&#x27;. Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1573762/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3</a> mandates that no person shall convert or attempt to convert.

Admittedly, the petitioners, herein, have solemnized marriage after conversion to another faith. The conversion would fall within the ambit of the Act, and would be liable to be dealt with under the penal provisions. The issue, therefore, is whether such a conversion for the purpose of marriage would be &#x27;&#x27;unlawful conversion&#x27; against the will of the person is a question of fact, open to enquiry. The expressions used in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1573762/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 3</a> i.e. misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or any fraudulent means, is a question of fact which has to be determined by the competent court on an allegation being made by the aggrieved party to the marriage or the aggrieved person i.e. parents, brother and sister as stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/594580/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 4</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1124257/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 6</a> further provides that an aggrieved person to the marriage can seek a declaration before the Family Court and get his or her marriage declared void in the event of unlawful conversion.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">54.\tTaking a case that there is an objection from an aggrieved person i.e. parents, brother and sister of any one party to the marriage, that would not ipso facto nullify the marriage, if it is lawful and the parties are adult. A declaration would have to be sought from the competent court. Marriage Registrar/Officer cannot refuse registration of the marriage merely on an allegation or a complaint by an aggrieved person.  The registration merely evidences the factum of marriage between two persons. The validity of the marriage being void or voidable cannot be gone into by the Marriage Registrar/Officer. The authority, be it the Marriage Registrar/Officer, or the district authority under the unlawful Conversion Act, 2021, is neither a court nor authorised by law to enter into the issue pertaining to the validity of marriage or prohibit inter faith marriage. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">55.\tHaving regard to the rigour of the enactments governing conversion, marriage and registration of marriage, the parties in the backdrop of the opposition of the family members, as is the case with the petitioners, are compelled to take recourse, either, under the <a href=\"/doc/385841/\" id=\"a_46\">Arya Marriage Validation Act</a> or Muslim Personal Law (Shariyat) Application Act i.e. instant conversion followed by marriage. In other words, the legal system, particularly secular laws, governing marriage and registration, as it exists on date, compels and coerces a party to interfaith marriage to compulsorily convert. The conversion of faith may appear voluntary, but, at the same time it could in all probability be a case of going against one&#x27;s conscience, thus, unwillingly violating the freedom of conscience guaranteed to the individual under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">56.\tThe stage has reached that the Parliament should intervene and examine, as to whether, the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single Family Code. Marriage is just an association of two persons, recognized by law. There is nothing &#x27;&#x27;special&#x27; about marriage to subject it under different laws for various communities, thus, erecting barriers in the free intermingling of the citizens. The petitioners, herein, cannot be hounded as criminals. Their crime, if any, is that they have succumbed to the dictates of their heart for each other. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">F.\tUniform Civil Code30 \n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">57.\tThe issue of UCC, though Constitutional, rakes political overturns whenever raised or debated in public domain.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">58.\tIn the midst of all this clamour, the Law Commission31 struck a wary note. In its report, the Commission observed:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t&quot;While diversity of Indian culture can and should be celebrated, specific groups or weaker sections of the society must not be dis-privileged in the process. Resolution of this conflict does not mean abolition of difference. This Commission has, therefore, dealt with laws that are discriminatory rather than providing a uniform civil code which is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage ..... Most countries are now moving towards recognition of difference, and the mere existence of difference does not imply discrimination, but is indicative of a robust democracy. (emphasis supplied)\n \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">59.\tThe single sentence/observation by the Commission that &#x27;&#x27;uniform civil code is neither necessary nor desirable at this stage&#x27; has been flagged by the opponents of UCC as their anchor sheet to oppose the enactment of UCC. The entire report of the Commission neither discusses nor points out the merit or demerit of UCC for the citizen. The observation is probably confined to the discrimination noted in the personal laws of various religious groups. On having detailed the discrimination with regard to family laws within the personal laws of Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis, the Commission recommended their removal, in the first instance, to make the personal laws equitable with regard to marriage, divorce, guardianship, succession and adoption. In doing so, probably the &#x27;&#x27;stage&#x27; for enacting UCC would be facilitated, therefore, the Commission opined that the stage for enacting UCC has not reached. The desirability, and/or, non desirability of UCC, in the backdrop of differences/discrimination of various personal laws has not been considered by the Commission so as to keep the directive of <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 44</a> in abeyance. The bald observation of the Law Commission is of no assistance to the opponents of UCC.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190351781\" id=\"span_5\">60.\tSupreme Court, very recently (2019), in <a href=\"/doc/190351781/\" id=\"a_49\">Jose Paul Coutinho vs Maria Luiza32</a>, as against the view of the Commission, observed that:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t&quot;Whereas the founders of the Constitution in <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 44</a> in Part IV dealing with the Directive Principles of State Policy had hoped and expected that the State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territories of India, till date no action has been taken in this regard.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">61.\tThe observation of the Supreme Court that till date no action has been taken with regard to UCC comes within a year, in contradiction to the observation of the Law Commission.

It is clarified that reference to UCC is confined to Family Code uniformally applicable to all the residents of India. It would be apposite to  turn the pages of history to briefly examine as to how uniform codification of law evolved and gradually cemented and integrated, the Indians into a nation in the making.\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(i).\tHistorical Perspective:\t\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">63.\tThe colonial rulers transformed the otherwise archaic, and feudal administration of justice by codifying the laws, both civil and criminal, making it uniformally applicable to all its residents through a defined hierarchy of courts and jurisdictions. The process commenced in the beginning of the eighteenth century (1700A.D.) when the then State of Bengal was handed over to the colonial ruler with diwani rights. A number of legislations came to be enacted framing Regulations commencing 1772 A.D. Law Commission was constituted in the year 1834 by the colonial rules to codify the laws in India based on the laws of England adaptable to the India conditions. The Commission, inter alia, recommended codification of substantive civil law for India having regard to the condition, character and institutions of India and religious usages/customs of the population. The caveat, however, was that codification should not extend to matters pertaining to personal laws of the Hindus and Muslims which is embedded in and derived authority from their respective religions33.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">64.\tIn between the one hundred years that followed, until the setting up of the Hindu Law Committee/B.N. Rau Committee in 1941, to examine the necessity of common Hindu Laws, a spate of laws came to be enacted by the colonial rulers that delved into the personal laws of the Hindus, in particular, with property, inheritance, widow remarriage. Based on the Rau Committee Report (1944), Hindu Code Bill came to be introduced in the Parliament in independent India. The Bill lapsed and was resubmitted in 1952, after the first General Elections. Having regard to the massive opposition, across the board, the provisions of the Hindu Code Bill came to be broken into four separate enactments and received assent of the Parliament after drastically diluting and abridging the provisions of the Hindu Code Bill. The laws that came to  be enacted, for the sake of convenience, is being collectively referred to as the Hindu Family Code34. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">65.\tIt would be relevant to briefly refer to the Constituent Assembly debate on the UCC (<a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 35</a>, corresponding to <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 44</a> of the Constitution of India). The objections and apprehension to the UCC raised by the members, of minority/community and counter argument and reasons assigned to reject the objections and misgivings about UCC.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">(ii).\tConstituent Assembly Debate\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">(a).\tObjection to UCC\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">66.\tMr. Mohamad Ismail Sahib: Sir, I move that the following proviso be added to <a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_54\">article 35: (<a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 44</a> of the Constitution of India)\n \n&quot;</a>Provided that any group, section or community of people shall not be obliged to give up its own personal law in case it has such a law.&quot; \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">67.\tNow the right to follow personal law is part of the way of life of those people who are following such laws; it is part of their religion and part of their culture. If anything is done affecting the personal laws, it will tantamount to interference with the way of life of those people who have been observing these laws for generations and ages. This secular State which we are trying to create should not do anything to interfere with the way of life and religion of the people.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">68.\tMr. Naziruddin Ahmad:- [....]  But during the 175 years of British rule, they did not interfere with certain fundamental personal laws. Today, even without <a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_56\">article 35</a>, there is nothing to prevent the future Parliament of India from passing such laws. Therefore, the idea is to have a uniform civil code.  [....] They have been imposed gradually as occasion arose and they were intended to make the laws uniform although they clash with the personal laws of a particular community. But take the case of marriage practice and the laws of inheritance. They have never interfered with them. It will be difficult at this stage of our society to ask the people to give up their ideas of marriage, which are associated with religious institutions in many communities. The laws of inheritance are also supposed to be the result of religious injunctions. I submit that the interference with these matters should be gradual and must progress with the advance of time. I have no doubt that a stage would come when the civil law would be uniform. But then that time has not yet come. [....] I have therefore in my amendment suggested that religious laws relating to particular communities should not be affected except with their consent. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">69.\tB. Pocker Sahib Bahadur - By uniform, I ask, what do you mean and which particular law, of which community are you going to take as the standard? [....] By this one clause you are revolutionising the whole country and the whole setup. There is no need for it. [....] What is the purpose served by this uniformity except to murder the consciences of the people and make them feel that they are being trampled upon as regards their religious rights and practices? Such a tyrannous measure ought not to find a place in our Constitution. [....] as I take it, it is the duty of the majority to secure the sacred rights of every minority. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">70.\tMr. Hussain Imam:  [....] I feel that it is all right and a very desirable thing to have a uniform law, but at a very distant date. For that, we should first await the coming of that event when the whole of India has got educated, when mass illiteracy has been removed, when people have advanced, when their economic conditions are better, when each man is able to stand on his own legs and fight his own battles. Then, you can have uniform laws.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">(b) Response in favour of UCC:\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">71.\tShri K. M. Munshi - A further argument has been advanced that the enactment of a Civil Code would be tyrannical to minorities. Is it tyrannical? Nowhere in advanced Muslim countries the personal law of each minority has been recognised as so sacrosanct as to prevent the enactment of a Civil Code. But I go further. <a href=\"/doc/1325952/\" id=\"a_57\">When the Shariat Act</a> was passed or when certain laws were passed in the Central Legislature in the old regime, the Khojas and Cutchi Memons were highly dissatisfied. [....] We want to divorce religion from personal law, from what may be called social relations or from the rights of parties as regards inheritance or succession. What have these things got to do with religion I really fail to understand. [....] But after all we are an advancing society. We are in a stage where we must unify and consolidate the nation by every means without interfering with religious practices. If however the religious practices in the past have been so construed as to cover the whole field of life, we have reached a point when we must put our foot down and say that these matters are not religion, they are purely matters for secular legislation. This is what is emphasised by this article. [....] They feel that the personal law of inheritance, succession etc. is really apart of their religion. If that were so, you can never give,for instance, equality to women. But you have already passed a Fundamental Right to that effect and you have an article here which lays down that there should be no discrimination against sex. [....] Therefore, there is no reason why there should not be a civil code throughout the territory of India. [....] There is one important consideration which we have to bear in mind-and I want my Muslim friends to realise this that the sooner we forget this isolationist outlook on life, it will be better for the country. Religion must be restricted to spheres which legitimately appertain to religion, and the rest of life must be regulated, unified and modified in such a manner that we may evolve, as early as possible a strong and consolidated nation. Our first problem and the most important problem is to produce national unity in this country. We think we have got national unity. But there are many factors-and important factors-which still offer serious dangers to our national consolidation, and it is very necessary that the whole of our life, so far as it is restricted to secular spheres, must be unified in such a way that as early as possible, [....] I hope our friends will not feel that this is an attempt to exercise tyranny over a minority; it is much more tyrannous to the majority. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">72.\tShri Alladi Krishanaswami Ayyar - The second objection was that religion was in danger, that communities cannot live in amity if there is to be a uniform civil code. The article actually aims at amity. It does not destroy amity. [....] It is not as if one legal system is not influencing or being influenced by another legal system. [....] Therefore, no system can be self-contained, if it is to have in it the elements of growth. There is no use clinging always to the past. We are departing from the past in regard to an important particular, namely, we want the whole of India to be welded and united together as a single nation. Are we helping those factors which help the welding together into a single nation, or is this country to be kept up always as a series of competing communities? That is the question at issue. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">73.\tDr. B. R. Ambedkar - I was very much surprised at that statement, for the simple reason that we have in this country a uniform code of laws covering almost every aspect of human relationship. [....] I can cite innumerable enactments which would prove that this country has practically a Civil Code, uniform in its content and applicable to the whole of the country. The only province the Civil Law has not been able to invade so far is Marriage and Succession. It is this little corner which we have not been able to invade so far and it is the intention of  those who desire to have <a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_58\">article 35</a> as part of the Constitution to bring about that change. [....] Coming to the amendments, [....] members who put forth these amendments say that the Muslim personal law, so far as this country was concerned, was immutable and uniform through the whole of India. Now I wish to challenge that statement. I think most of my friends who have spoken on this amendment have quite forgotten that up to 1935 the North-West Frontier Province was not subject to the Shariat Law. It followed the Hindu Law.  That is not all. [....] Up till 1937 in the rest of India, in various parts, such as the United Provinces, the Central Provinces and Bombay, the Muslims to a large extent were governed by the Hindu Law in the matter of succession. In order to bring them on the plane of uniformity with regard to the other Muslims who observed the Shariat Law, the Legislature had to intervene in 1937 and to pass an enactment applying the Shariat Law to the rest of India. [....] The Mussulmans, therefore, in North Malabar were up to now following the Marumakkathyam law (matrilineal law) [....] I am quite certain that it would not be open to any Muslim to say that the framers of the civil code had done great violence to the sentiments of the Muslim community. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">74.\tThe arguments that resonate today opposing the UCC was unequivocally raised seven decades back.

The limited recognition of rights of L.G.B.T.Q. community; &#x27;&#x27;live in&#x27; relationship41; legitimacy of children borne from such relationship; surrogacy; right of adoption by enacting secular law42; right to maintenance irrespective of personal law; recognizing single parent family; right of persons with disability etc. There has been a steep rise in intercommunity, intercaste and interfaith marriage/relationship, which has exploded specially in the last few decades. The society since 1950 has considerably evolved and the relationships, be it interfaith, inter culture, coupled with the rise in the number of single women requires a comprehensive Family Code which is in conformity with the changing times.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">                      80.\tThe education and mobility, particularly, amongst women has drastically unleashed forces transforming the society.

Their presence is decisively and emphatically felt in government offices, corporates and they dominate the White House.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">                      81.\tGoa the only Indian State which has a uniform civil code applicable to all, also requires reform.

The legislations lifted and transported the Hindu personal law from the Shastra/Religion and placed it within the domain of the Parliament. The HFC, henceforth, could be amended/modified inconformity with and in response to the modern/changing society without the intervention of Shastra, and/or, the Shastri. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">                      85.\tHFC saw the light of the day in 1955-56 after fifteen years of deliberation and public debate.

The expression means where the citizens can interact with each other on equal terms at will without discrimination and age old social barriers, thus, uniting and integrating Hindu&#x27;s into a body of citizens.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">                      89.\tThe Hindu citizenry after 65 years of the implementation of HFC, is distinct and different class of hindus as against their ancestors prior to 1955. The rigidity/barrier of caste, pollution, purity has been made permeable, if not obliterated, by the effect, successful implementation and operation of HFC. They can interact with each other through marriage or otherwise, the so called class, born from the forehead of the Lord and that those born from the feet, are entering into relationship on equal terms. Such a situation was unenvisagable prior to 1955.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">                      90.\tEvery Indian is a citizen but it does not imply that the citizens together foster unity to be classified as citizenry. The citizenry does not come about naturally. It has to be fostered by the legislature and the executive consciously by creating the necessary legal ecosystem by enacting the requisite law, as has been in the case of HFC. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">                      91.\tHFC has not encroached upon the religious custom, culture, practise, and propagation of the miniscule minority i.e. Sikhs, Buddhist and Jains, included within the definition of Hindus. There is no friction or animosity between the majority and the minority religions, including the sub religious groups, that has grown out of Hinduism. The afore-noted minorities have not complained that HFC in any manner encroached, influenced or was an impediment in their cultural practices or the way of life. Rather, HFC has fostered and cemented the minority communities included within the definition of Hindus as a citizenry interacting on a legal platform on equal terms, without, the intervention of religious texts, priest customs and dogmas of the respective communities.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_104\">                      92.\tTo put it in a nutshell, the HFC as a uniform civil code has integrated the citizens into an integrated and united Hindu citizenry, on terms that is equal and uniform, insofar as the law regulating family law is concerned. The impact of HFC on Hindu society has been phenomenal. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">                      93.\tThe area that immediately demands attention of the Parliament is with regard to the interfaith relationships. The answer to regulating such relations is through legislative intervention by enacting the UCC. The Court since Shah Bano (1986) opined that enactment of UCC is necessary for the unification and national unity of the country. This has been reiterated by the Supreme Court time and again until recently. By national unity, the Court meant to say that by enacting UCC, the legislature would create an environment based on uniform law pertaining to family that would foster creation of an Indian citizenry where citizens of the country, irrespective of their religion, culture can interact on equal terms without the intervention of religious texts, priest, customs and dogmas of personal law. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">                      94.\tThere is no evidence of any official activity for framing a uniform civil code for the country. A belief seems to have gained ground that it is for the minority community to take a lead in the matter of reforms of their personal law. That has been the consistent official stand of the Government within the country and in international forums. A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to laws which have conflicting ideologies. No community is likely to bell the cat by making gratuitous concessions on this issue. It is the State which is charged with the duty of securing a uniform civil code for the citizens of the country and, unquestionably, it has the legislative competence to do so.The Supreme Court speaking through Justice Kuldeep Singh46 had humbly requested the Government through the Prime Minister to intervene and initiate the process of framing the UCC by appointing a committee, but after a lapse of so many decades nothing has been done. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">                      95.   We have entered in the third decade of the twenty first century, the UCC is long due. It should be taken note of the fact that before HFC could see the light of the day the deliberations went on for 15 years. The Government, if decides to initiate the process by appointing a Committee/Commission for enacting the UCC, it would take considerable time. The process, therefore, should be initiated forthwith. This Court reiterates and calls upon the Government of India to initiate the process as the &#x27;&#x27;stage&#x27; has been reached. The UCC is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made &#x27;&#x27;purely voluntary&#x27; as was observed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">                      96.\tThe Supreme Court way back in 1995 expressed its anguish and observed:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                  \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"733037\" id=\"span_12\">&quot;30.
