WRIT\nPETITION (CIVIL) NO.490 OF 2002 with WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) No.509 OF 2002 AND WRIT\nPETITION (CIVIL) No. 515 of 2002 wherein it had been held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       &quot;By calling upon the contesting candidate to disclose the assets and liabilities of his/her\n       spouse, the fundamental right to information of a voter/citizen is thereby promoted. When\n       there is a competition between the right to privacy of an individual and the right to\n       information of the citizens, the former right has to be subordinated to the latter right as it\n       serves larger public interest. The right to know about the candidate who intends to become a\n       public figure and a representative of the people would not be effective and real if only\n       truncated information of the assets and liabilities is given&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">Furthermore, Justice M.B.

WRIT PETITION had held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       &quot;In our view, the aforesaid decision nowhere supports the said 30 contention. This Court\n       only considered--to what extent a citizen would have right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21.</a> The\n       court itself has carved out the exceptions and restrictions on absolute right of privacy.\n       Further, by declaration of a fact, which is a matter of public record that a candidate was\n       involved in various criminal cases, there is no question of infringement of any right of\n       privacy. Similarly, with regard to the declaration of assets also, a person having assets or\n       income is normally required to disclose the same under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_27\">Income Tax Act</a> or such similar\n       fiscal legislation. Not only this, but once a person becomes a candidate to acquire public\n       office, such declaration would not affect his right of privacy. This is the necessity of the day\n       because of statutory provisions of controlling wide spread corrupt practices as repeatedly\n       pointed out by all concerned including various reports of Law Commission and other\n       Committees as stated above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">Right to know Antecedents of Candidates part of Fundamental Right\n\nThe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the decision of Association for Democratic Reforms (AIR\n2002 SC 2112) while holding that right to know the antecedents of candidates as a fundamental right\nof citizens under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19 (1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950 had held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       &quot;If right to telecast and right to view sport games and the right to impart such information is\n       considered to be part and parcel of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, we fail to understand why the right of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                                            Page 6 of 9</span>\n        citizen/voter - a little man - to know about the antecedents of his candidate cannot be held to\n       be a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> In our view, democracy cannot survive without\n       free and fair election, without free and fairly informed voters. Votes cast by uninformed\n       voters in favour of X or Y candidate would be meaningless. As stated in the aforesaid\n       passage, onesided information, disinformation, misinformation and non- 12 information, all\n       equally create an uninformed citizenry which makes democracy a farce. Therefore, casting of\n       vote by a misinformed and non-informed voter or a voter having one-sided information only\n       is bound to affect the democracy seriously. Freedom of speech and expression includes right\n       to impart and receive information which includes freedom to hold opinions. Entertainment is\n       implied in freedom of &quot;speech and expression&quot; and there is no reason to hold that freedom of\n       speech and expression would not cover right to get material information with regard to a\n       candidate who is contesting election for a post which is of utmost importance in the\n       democracy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">In the decision of People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) (AIR 2003 SC 2363) Hon&#x27;ble Mr.\nJustice M.B. Shah, in his judgment held as follows\n\n       &quot;(D) The contention that as there is no specific fundamental right conferred on a voter by any\n       statutory provision to know the antecedents of a candidate, the directions given by this Court\n       are against the statutory provisions is, on the face of it, without any substance. In an election\n       petition challenging the validity of an election of a particular candidate, the statutory\n       provisions would govern respective rights of the parties. However, voters&#x27; fundamental right\n       to know the antecedents of a candidate is independent of statutory rights under the election\n       law. A voter is first citizen of this country and apart from statutory rights, he is having\n       fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution. Members of a democratic society should be\n       sufficiently informed so that they may cast their votes intelligently in favour of persons who\n       are to govern them. Right to vote would be meaningless unless the citizens are well informed\n       about the antecedents of a candidate. There can be little doubt that exposure to public gaze\n       and scrutiny is one of the surest means to cleanse our democratic governing system and to\n       have competent legislatures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">       (E) It is established that fundamental rights themselves have no fixed content, most of them\n       are empty vessels into which each generation must pour its content in the light of its\n       experience. The attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the\n       fundamental rights by process of judicial interpretation. During the last more than half a\n       decade, it has been so done by this Court consistently. There cannot be any distinction\n       between the fundamental rights mentioned in Chapter III of the Constitution and the\n       declaration of such rights on the basis of the judgments rendered by this Court.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">       Being of this view, he declared Section 33-B as illegal, null and void.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77678068\" id=\"span_15\">The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the decision of <a href=\"/doc/77678068/\" id=\"a_31\">Resurgence India Vs.

It was further held that the voter&#x27;s speech or\n       expression in case of election would include casting of votes, that is to say, voter speaks out\n       or expresses by casting vote. For this purpose, information about the candidate to be selected\n       is a must.
