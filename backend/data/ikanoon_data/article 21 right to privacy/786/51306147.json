It has no place in the\n\n         governance of the State and its legitimate use of force. In any\n\n         democracy, the right to live with dignity and self-worth, cannot\n\n         be violently defiled within the ambit of Rule of Law and good\n\n         governance.\n\n                         2. Truck drivers in our country are amongst the\n\n         most vulnerable sections of our society. The backbone of the\n\n         national economy is dependent upon the untiring and ever\n\n         driving efforts and labour of the poor, mostly illiterate and the\n\n         vulnerable. In the absence of the hard work and toil of truck\n\n         drivers, economic activity throughout the country is bound to\n\n         come to a standstill.\n\n                         3. Truck drivers lack proper education; proper\n\n         healthcare; face daily hardships; have strained and unstable\n\n         personal relationships; and most importantly are most\n\n         susceptible to be at odds with the law and the functionaries of\n\n         the State. These individuals are under the constant, endless\n\n         pressure to make ends meet and ensure the survival of their\n\n         families. It is these vulnerabilities that make them prone to\n Patna High Court CR.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, in D.K. Basu v. State\n\n         of West Bengal, AIR 1997 SC 610, has observed that &quot;12. In\n\n         all custodial crimes what is of real concern is not only infliction\n\n         of body pain but the mental agony which a person undergoes\n\n         within the four walls of police station or lock-up. Whether it is\n\n         physical assault or rape in police custody, the extent of trauma,\n\n         a person experiences is beyond the purview of law.&quot; (emphasis\n\n         supplied)\n\n                         5. Truck drivers are faced with a great deal of high\n\n         stress and pressure as part of their job. The introduction of the\n\n         additional hassle and trauma, perpetuated by the authorities,\n\n         through the use of hostility and torture is akin to grave human\n\n         injustice. Such practices are a clear violation of the human\n\n         rights guaranteed to every citizen of the world. With the failure\n\n         of the State to protect its citizens, it becomes the responsibility\n\n         and duty of the Judiciary to intervene in aid of these most\n\n         downtrodden and helpless individuals.\n\n                         6. All these issues arise for consideration in the\n\n         present petition.\n\n                         7.

Also, there is no statement of a person witnessing\n\n         the occurrence of the accident. Then how did the Police get to\n\n         know of such facts? No investigation in that regard ever took\n\n         place or placed on record.

Also, information of arrest was not supplied to a friend,\n\n         relative or close person or entry made in the book, as required\n\n         under Section 56A Cr. P.C., which is sacrosanct.

P.C., either upon the\n\n         owner of the vehicle or the person driving at the time of\n\n         occurrence of the alleged accident. Thus, there is an infraction of\n\n         not only the said provision but also Section 41B Cr.

Significantly, the valuable right of the\n\n         accused of seeking legal advice envisaged under Section 41D Cr.\n\n         P.C. stood infringed.

In our view, whatever be the situation, it is of no use to\n                keep such seized vehicles at the police stations for a long\n                period. It is for the Magistrate to pass appropriate orders\n                immediately by taking appropriate bond and guarantee as\n                well as security for return of the said vehicles, if required at\n                any point of time. This can be done pending hearing of\n                applications for return of such vehicles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                18. In case where the vehicle is not claimed by the accused,\n                owner, or the insurance company or by a third person, then\n                such vehicle may be ordered to be auctioned by the Court.\n                If the said vehicle is insured with the insurance company\n                then the insurance company be informed by the Court to\n                take possession of the vehicle which is not claimed by the\n                owner or a third person. If the insurance company fails to\n                take possession, the vehicles may be sold as per the\n                direction of the Court. The Court would pass such order\n                within a period of six months from the date of production of\n                the said vehicle before the Court. In any case, before\n                handing over possession of such vehicles, appropriate\n                photographs of the said vehicle should be taken and detailed\n                panchnama should be prepared.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"> Patna High Court CR.

It is a matter of common knowledge that as and when\n                vehicles are seized and kept in various police stations, not\n                only they occupy substantial space of the police stations but\n                upon being kept in open, are also prone to fast natural decay\n                on account of weather conditions. Even a good maintained\n                vehicle loses its road worthiness if it is kept stationary in\n                the police station for more than fifteen days. Apart from the\n                above, it is also a matter of common knowledge that several\n                valuable and costly parts of the said vehicles are either\n                stolen or are cannibalized so that the vehicles become\n                unworthy of being driven on road. To avoid all this, apart\n                from the aforesaid directions issued hereinabove, we direct\n                that all the State Governments/ Union Territories/Director\n                Generals of Police shall ensure macro implementation of\n                the statutory provisions and further direct that the activities\n                of each and every police stations, especially with regard to\n                disposal of the seized vehicles be taken care of by the\n                Inspector General of Police of the concerned\n                Division/Commissioner of Police of the concerned\n                cities/Superintendent of Police of the concerned District.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                        42.

The payment\n\n        of compensation in such cases is not to be understood, as it is\n\n        generally understood in a civil action for damages under the\n\n        private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by order of\n\n        making &#x27;monetary amends&#x27; under the public law for the wrong\n\n        done due to breach of public duty, of not protecting the\n\n        fundamental rights of the citizen. The compensation is like\n\n        &#x27;exemplary damages&#x27; awarded against the wrongdoer for the\n\n        breach of its public law duty.
