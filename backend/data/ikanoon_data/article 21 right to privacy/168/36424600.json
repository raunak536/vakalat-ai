After reaching the\n\nhouse, the police party asked the petitioner to open the door,\n\nbut the petitioner not only refused to abide by their direction,\n\nbut abused and intimidated the police personnel, thereby\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    4</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2025:KER:44716\n\npreventing the officers from discharging their duty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">       2. The petitioner&#x27;s version of the incident and the reasons\n\nbehind registration of the crime are as under;\n\n The Thoppumpady Police had framed the petitioner in a false\n\nPOCSO case, of which the petitioner got acquitted after a full\n\nfledged trial.       Alleging foul play in registering that case, the\n\npetitioner approached the State Police Chief.            This led to\n\nanimosity towards the petitioner and the police started\n\nregistering false cases against him, alleging violation of traffic\n\nrules and dangerous driving. While so, the petitioner started\n\nreceiving frequent phone calls from the police enquiring about\n\nhis whereabouts. On 03.04.2025 also, by about 12:58 am, the\n\npetitioner received a call from the police, asking him to stand\n\noutside his house. In obedience of the direction, the petitioner\n\nstood outside his house for some time, but did not find anyone\n\nthere.    Later in the morning, the petitioner got another call,\n\nasking him to report at the Thoppumpady Police Station.           As\n\ndirected, petitioner went to the Police Station and without any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                        2025:KER:44716\n\nreason, was subjected to torture by the Sub Inspector of Police.\n\nImmediately thereafter, the petitioner filed W.P.(C) No. 15550\n\nof 2025, alleging police harassment and the writ petition was\n\ndisposed of by directing the Principal                Secretary, Home\n\nDepartment, to enquire into the complaint. According to the\n\npetitioner, he is implicated as accused in the present crime to\n\ndivert that enquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_5\">3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the\n\npolice have no right to intrude into a citizen&#x27;s privacy at\n\nmidnight.      It    is   submitted   that   the   general   instructions\n\nregarding surveillance contained in Paragraph 265 of the\n\nKerala Police Manual permits only &#x27;informal watch&#x27; over the\n\nactivities of history sheeters and &#x27;close watch&#x27;, if the individual\n\nis leading a criminal existence. According to the counsel, the\n\npetitioner is not a history sheeter and even if so, the police have\n\nno authority to make domicile visits at night. Reference is made\n\nto the decision in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_2\">Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Others</a>\n\n[1962 SCC OnLine SC 10], to point out that the Apex Court had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2025:KER:44716\n\nset aside        the provision in the U.P. Police Regulations\n\nauthorising domicile visits, finding the provision to be violative\n\nof the freedom and liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of lndia. As the visit by the police personnel\n\nto the petitioner&#x27;s residence at midnight and the direction\n\nrequiring him to come out of the house are not part of their\n\nofficial duties, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/88078555/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 117(e)</a> of the Kerala\n\nPolice Act is not attracted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">       4.   Learned     Public        Prosecutor     contended       that   the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s     name       figures    in   the    Rowdy     History    Sheet\n\nmaintained       at   the    Thoppumpady          Police   Station    and   on\n\n03.04.2025, the 2nd respondent had telephoned the petitioner\n\nto know about his whereabouts. Thereupon, the petitioner told\n\nthe 2nd respondent that he is in his house. The police had later\n\ngone to the petitioner&#x27;s house to ascertain whether he is\n\nactually in the house. As the 2nd respondent and others were\n\nthus discharging their official duties, the petitioner&#x27;s refusal to\n\nabide by the direction to step out of the house and intimidation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 7</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                     2025:KER:44716\n\nof the policemen, attracts the alleged offence. The learned\n\nPublic    Prosecutor   further   contended   that    the   State   is\n\nempowered to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom\n\nand liberty guaranteed by the constitution and surveillance of\n\nhistory sheeters is also part of such restriction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">       5. From the rival contentions, the question arising for\n\nconsideration is whether the police has got the authority to visit\n\nthe residences of history sheeters as part of surveillance. While\n\nanswering this question it has to be borne in mind that the right\n\nto freedom of movement and decent living, guaranteed by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">21</a> of the Constitution cannot be impinged,\n\nwithout the support of law. Indisputably, the Kerala Police\n\nManual is only a set of guidelines, governing the members of\n\nthe force and does not fall within the meaning of statute. Even\n\nthen, it will be profitable to refer the General instructions\n\nregarding Surveillance, contained in Paragraph 265 of the\n\nPolice Manual;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                        8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">                                                                 2025:KER:44716\n\n       &quot;General instructions regarding Surveillance\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">       265.

Orders for such transfers should be obtained from the Sub\n      Divisional Officer or the Superintendent of Police as the case may\n      be. A bad character who continues to be under close watch for a\n      considerable period, is a fit person for action under <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_8\">section 110</a>,\n      Criminal Procedure Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">              (5) The surveillance of a suspect or rowdy other than an\n      ordinary criminal shall be conducted in a confidential manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">              (6) Under the History Sheet heading &#x27;Current doings&#x27;,\n      entries which are informative and useful based on the facts\n      ascertained both by the Sub Inspector and his men since the date\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       9</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2025:KER:44716\n\n      of the last entry, shall be made month-war for close watch bad\n      characters and quarterly for non-close watch bad characters.\n      Anything of interest coming to notice in respect of a bad character\n      during a month should be entered then and there, without waiting\n      for the end of the month or the quarter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">              (7) When any information favourable to an individual for\n      whom a History Sheet is being kept is received, it shall be entered\n      therein.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">              (8) The entries in the various columns in the History Sheet\n      should be checked by the Sub Inspector personally and brought\n      up-to-date once a year.

Undoubtedly, neither of those\n\nexpressions permit domicile visits at night. While on the issue,\n\nit will be apposite to note that a specific provision in the U.P.\n\nPolice Regulations permitting domiciliary visits at night was set\n\naside by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_9\">Kharak Singh</a>                         (supra). The\n\ncontextually relevant portion of the judgment reads as under;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                            10</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                                                              2025:KER:44716\n\n         &quot;7. The sole question for determination therefore is whether\n\n     &quot;surveillance&quot; under the impugned Chapter 22 of the U.P. Police\n     Regulations constitutes an infringement of any of a citizen&#x27;s\n     fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The\n     particular Regulation which for all practical purposes defines\n     &quot;surveillance&quot; is Regulation 236 which reads:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;without prejudice to the right of Superintendents of Police to put\n     into practice any legal measures, such as shadowing in cities, by\n     which they find they can keep in touch with suspects in particular\n     localities or special circumstances, surveillance may for most\n     practical purposes be defined as consisting of one or more of the\n     following measures:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         (a) Secret picketing of the house or approaches to the houses of\n     suspects;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         (b) domiciliary visits at night;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">         (c) through periodical inquiries by officers not below the rank of\n     sub-inspector into repute, habits, associations, income, expenses\n     and occupation;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">         (d) the reporting by constables and chaukidars of movements\n     and absences from home;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         (c) the verification of movements and absences by means of\n     inquiry slips;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         (f) the collection and record on a history-sheet of all information\n     bearing on conduct.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                      11</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">                                                             2025:KER:44716\n\n         xxx                            xxx                         xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">         13. We shall now proceed with the examination of the width,\n     scope and content of the expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21.</a>\n     Having regard to the terms of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 19(1)( d)</a>, we must take it that\n     the expression is used as not to include the right to move about or\n     rather of locomotion. The right to move about being excluded its\n     narrowest interpretation would be that it comprehends nothing more\n     than freedom from physical restraint or freedom from confinement\n     within the bounds of a prison; in other words, freedom from arrest\n     and detention, from false imprisonment or wrongful confinement.\n     We feel unable to hold that the term was intended to bear only this\n     narrow interpretation but on the other hand consider that &quot;personal\n     liberty&quot; is used in the Article as a compendious term to include\n     within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the\n     &quot;personal liberties&quot; of man other than those dealt with in the several\n     clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words, while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19(1)</a> deals\n     with particular species or attributes of that freedom, &quot;personal\n     liberty&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> takes in and comprises the residue. We have\n     already extracted a passage from the judgment of Field, J. in Munn\n     v. Illinois [94 US 113 at p. 142] where the learned Judge pointed out\n     that &quot;life&quot; in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution\n     corresponding to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a>, means not merely the right to the\n     continuance of a person&#x27;s animal existence, but a right to the\n     possession of each of his organs his arms and legs etc. We do not\n     entertain any doubt that the word &quot;life&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> bears the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> Crl.M.C.No.3751/25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                      12</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2025:KER:44716\n\n     signification. Is then the word &quot;personal liberty&quot; to be construed as\n     excluding from its purview an invasion on the part of the police of\n     the sanctity of a man&#x27;s home and an intrusion into his personal\n     security and his right to sleep which is the normal comfort and a dire\n     necessity for human existence even as an animal? It might not be\n     inappropriate to refer here to the words of the preamble to the\n     Constitution that it is designed to &quot;assure the dignity of the\n     individual&quot; and therefore of those cherished human values as the\n     means of ensuring his full development and evolution. We are\n     referring to these objectives of the framers merely to draw attention\n     to the concepts underlying the constitution which would point to\n     such vital words as &quot;personal liberty&quot; having to the construed in a\n     reasonable manner and to be attributed that sense which would\n     promote and achieve those objectives and by no means to stretch\n     the meaning of the phrase to square with any pro-conceived notions\n     or doctrinaire constitutional theories.
