In\n\n her submission, telephone tapping is serious invasion to the right\n\n of privacy, and therefore, strict adherence to the provisions of\n\n <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Telegraph Act, 1885</a>, so also to the judgment of the\n\n Honourable Apex Court in the matter of People&#x27;s Union for Civil\n\n Liberties vs. Union of Indian and Another 1 is necessary.\n\n However, cross-examination of PW28 Mohan Kulkarni, Assistant\n\n Commissioner of Police, shows that he was not aware about the\n\n proposal sent to the Government and he had not sent the record\n\n regarding public emergency. This witness had not maintained any\n\n record regarding his visit to Mantralaya.      Cross-examination of\n\n PW7 Rajesh Kasare, Assistant Police Inspector, and that of PW8\n\n Datta Gawade, Assistant Police Inspector, shows that they were\n\n not having any written order from their superior in respect of\n\n interception of telephonic conversation and no documentary\n\n evidence is placed on record to show that at the relevant time this\n 1   AIR 1997 SUPREME COURT 568\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> avk                                                                 9</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018             ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:34 :::</span>\n                                                    APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n witnesses were present on the duty.

Evidence of PW4 Usman Batliwala so also that of\n\n PW5 Shanawaz Shaikh and other witnesses is not worth reliance\n\n because these witnesses have not even reported the matter to\n\n police.

The order of authorization (Exhibit 137) issued by\n\n the Additional Chief Secretary reflects that there is due application\n\n of mind by the authorising authority to the facts of the case.\n\n Recitals in the order at Exhibit 137 makes it clear that the\n\n Competent Authority under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_43\">Indian Telegraph Act, 1885</a>, had\n\n kept in mind the fact that in view of recent blasts at the German\n\n Bakery, Koregaon Park, Pune, some foreigners are contacting their\n\n associates in India and are planning to execute destruction as well\n\n as commission of serious offences.      The order at Exhibit 137\n\n makes it clear that the authorizing authority has come to the\n\n conclusion that other modes of enquiries for gathering intelligence\n\n have failed and therefore, it is necessary to permit interception of\n\n the targeted mobile phone numbers for preventing incitement to\n\n the commission of serious offences.      It is, thus, clear that, the\n\n order passed under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act,\n\n 1885, and the recitals thereof shows that the same was passed in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\"> avk                                                                  25</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018              ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:35 :::</span>\n                                        APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n the interest of the public safety which is one of the ground for\n\n authorising interception of conversation. Perusal of the order at\n\n Exhibit 137 issued by the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) as\n\n such shows that it was necessary to avert danger or risk to the\n\n people at large and this was the consideration for issuance of the\n\n order.

The learned counsel for the appellants/accused persons\n\n tried to assail the said order by pointing out admission in cross-\n\n examination of PW28 Mohan Kulkarni, Assistant Commissioner of\n\n Police, to the effect that he had not maintained any record of his\n\n visit to Mantralaya, and before going to Mantralaya for getting the\n\n order at Exhibit 137 from the authorising authority, he had not\n\n seen the record regarding public emergency.

The same is duly proved by\n\n the prosecution through evidence of PW20 Sanjay Patil, Police\n\n Sub-Inspector, and that of panch witness PW1 Jagannath Jadhav.\n\n Cross-examination of both these witnesses has not created any\n\n dent in their version and there is nothing to infer that seized cell\n\n phones with the Sim cards were planted on the person of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\"> avk                                                                        38</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                    ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:35 :::</span>\n                                          APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n appellants/accused persons.

This witness, who was working as an agent\n\n in the Regional Transport Office (R.T.O.) at Andheri was knowing\n\n appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @ Riyan. Version of this witness\n\n goes to show that when appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @ Riyan\n\n had been to him somewhere in the year 2008 for obtaining the\n\n Driver license, that Sim card was given by this witness to\n\n appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @ Riyan. PW25 Rafiq Khan has\n\n made it clear that since then, appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @\n\n Riyan had not returned the said Sim card to him.\n\n\n\n 19               This evidence adduced by the prosecution proved a\n\n fact that appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu was using\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\"> avk                                                                   39</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018               ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:35 :::</span>\n                                                APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n mobile         phone          bearing   number      9323947342              whereas\n\n appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @ Riyan was using the mobile\n\n phone bearing number 9773084167 till the date of their arrest on\n\n 13th March 2010.

He advised appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @\n\n Guddu to bribe the concerned for getting the passport early.\n\n\n\n 21               If the conversation recorded in the intercepted calls,\n\n the transcripts whereof are at Exhibits 45 to 51C is appreciated in\n\n proper       perspective,     then   it   is   clearly    revealed        that      the\n\n appellants/accused persons along with the Uncle based at\n\n Pakistan were indulging in conspiracy of committing the terrorist\n\n act in Mumbai with intent to strike terror in the minds of people\n\n at large by using inflammable substance for causing death of\n\n persons and destruction of property apart from disruption of\n\n supplies of services essential to the life of community. It is clearly\n\n reflected from the intercepted conversation that the Uncle based\n\n at Pakistan had entrusted the work of commission of terrorist act\n\n at Mumbai to appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu and in\n\n turn, appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu had entrusted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\"> avk                                                                          48</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                      ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                                APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n execution of this work to appellant/accused no.2 Riaz Ali @\n\n Riyan.           The      telephonic   conversation    intercepted          by     the\n\n prosecuting agency indicates that appellants/accused persons\n\n were planning to set the Thakur Mall, the colony adjacent to\n\n Thakur Mall as well as the building of the ONGC on fire. The\n\n meticulous planning was being made by deciding to use 30 to 35\n\n litres of inflammable substance which was deliberately referred to\n\n as water in the telephonic conversation.                       The telephonic\n\n conversation indicates that the Uncle based at Pakistan was taking\n\n due caution by instructing appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @\n\n Guddu to have a brief talk in the matter instead of narrating the\n\n entire details.          This was obviously done to avoid detection of\n\n conspiracy which was being hatched by appellants/accused\n\n persons with the aid and assistance of the Uncle based at Pakistan.\n\n The material gathered by the prosecution in the form of the\n\n telephonic conversation shows that the appellants/accused\n\n persons were intending to execute the act with intent to strike\n\n terror in the people by using inflammable substance for causing\n\n death or injuries to the people at large apart from mass\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\"> avk                                                                         49</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                     ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                                     APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n destruction of property.

This was done in\n\n presence of panch witness PW22 Satpal Singh by PW26 Subhash\n\n Dudhgaonkar, Police Inspector, Anti-Terrorist Squad.                           Both the\n\n appellants/accused persons were directed to talk on the\n\n telephones and their voice came to be recorded in the tape\n\n recorders attached to another telephone. The appellants/accused\n\n persons were asked to read from the written pages given to them.\n\n The recorded conversation from the cassette was got verified in\n\n presence of the panch witnesses by playing those cassettes, and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\"> avk                                                                              50</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                          ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                               APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n subsequently, those cassettes were sealed.

The cause for not disclosing all these facts, as stated\n\n by this witness is to the effect that appellant/accused no.1 Abdul\n\n Latif @ Guddu was having relations with wanted accused in the\n\n bomb blast case apart from the fright.

Evidence of this\n\n witness is congruous to the evidence of PW5 Shanawaz Shaikh\n\n and       it     shows        that   this   witness    was        present        when\n\n appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu met PW5 Shanawaz\n\n Shaikh on some occasion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n 25               True it is that this witness had not disclosed evil\n\n intention of appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu to the\n\n law enforcing agencies but it needs to be kept in mind that these\n\n witnesses were sharing friendly relations with appellant/accused\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\"> avk                                                                           57</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                       ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                               APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu.

As per version of this witness,\n\n appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu has made a\n\n disclosure statement that he would point out the place where the\n\n material collected for the mission is kept.

Evidence of these two witnesses goes to\n\n show that appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu after\n\n making disclosure statement had taken the police party and panch\n\n witnesses to the compound wall of National Women Polytechnic\n\n of Bandra. It is in evidence of both these witnesses that from\n\n under the heap of garbage and plastic bags adjacent to compound\n\n wall of National Women Polytechnic, appellant/accused no.1\n\n Abdul Latif @ Guddu dug out a gunny bag and on opening that\n\n gunny bag two plastic cans containing petrol as well as the balls\n\n made of cloths were found.

Therefore,\n\n resultant recovery made in pursuant to the voluntary disclosure\n\n statement of appellant/accused no.1 Abdul Latif @ Guddu does\n\n not become suspicious. Cross-examination of PW14 Sumit Tambe\n\n shows that wax seal was put after seizing of the articles under\n\n Recovery panchanama Exhibit 86.

The composite effect of the\n\n evidence adduced by the prosecution as discussed in foregoing\n\n paragraphs goes to show that the appellants/accused persons\n\n were intending to strike terror in the people by using inflammable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\"> avk                                                                         60</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                     ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                            APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n substance by setting the populous residential colony and market\n\n on fire in order to cause death and injuries to the people at large\n\n and for interrupting the supply of services essential to the life of\n\n the community.

The   order   sanctioning    prosecution          of     the\n\n appellants/accused persons is at Exhibit 135.

Evidence of this\n\n witness shows that after receipt of the proposal for according\n\n sanction to prosecute the appellants/accused persons submitted\n\n by the Anti-Terrorist Squad of Mumbai Police, it was examined by\n\n him as well as the Joint Secretary of the Law Department of the\n\n State.         Opinion of the Director of the prosecution was\n\n independently called. It was then decided to obtain sanction of\n\n the Hon&#x27;ble Home Minister of the State, and therefore, the matter\n\n was placed before the Hon&#x27;ble Home Minister of the State.\n\n Accordingly, the sanction as envisaged by Section 45(1)(ii) of the\n\n U.A.P.Act          came       to   be   accorded       for      prosecuting           the\n\n appellants/accused persons. Cross-examination of this witness is\n\n only to the effect that a draft sanction order was put up before\n\n him and he had not read provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1890913/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections 15</a>, <a href=\"/doc/100648/\" id=\"a_50\">16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1123529/\" id=\"a_51\">17</a> of\n\n the U.A.P.Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1315447\" id=\"span_125\">30               At this juncture, it is necessary to quote that it was\n\n PW27 Suresh Sonawne, Deputy Secretary, Home Department of\n\n the State, who was the Sanctioning Authority.

Perusal of the sanction order at Exhibit\n\n 135 makes it clear that the sanction was given after application of\n\n mind. The sanction order is self contained and its language shows\n\n that there was due application of mind by the Sanctioning\n\n Authority. The facts constituting the offence under the U.A.P.Act\n\n are duly recited in the sanction order.             At this juncture, it is\n\n apposite to quote the observations in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1315447/\" id=\"a_52\">Mohd.Iqbal\n\n Ahmed vs. State of Andhra Pradesh2</a> wherein the Honourable\n\n Supreme Court has held thus :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                       &quot;It is incumbent on the prosecution to prove that a\n                       valid sanction has been granted by the Sanctioning\n                       Authority after it was satisfied that a case for\n                       sanction has been made out constituting the\n                       offence. This should be done in two ways; either\n                       (1) by producing the original sanction which itself\n                       contains the facts constituting the offence and the\n                       grounds of satisfaction and (2) by adducing\n                       evidence aliunde to show that the facts placed\n                       before   the   Sanctioning     Authority          and       the\n\n 2   AIR 1979 SC 677\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\"> avk                                                                        64</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">::: Uploaded on - 05/12/2018                    ::: Downloaded on - 28/12/2018 22:55:36 :::</span>\n                                                APPEAL-187-2016-APPA-979-2017-J.doc\n\n\n                       satisfaction arrived at by it.
