The facts of this Petition shall briefly be summarised. The Petitioner\nis an (Mahila) Inspector GD in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF),\ngoverned by the <a href=\"/doc/1033710/\" id=\"a_2\">Central Reserve Police Force Act, 1949</a> (the Act) and Rules\nframed thereunder. When the Petitioner was a Sub Inspector she had been\ndenied promotion to Inspector on account of non-fulfilment of the\nMandatory Field Service criteria i.e. two years‟ service in a duty battalion\n(or „operational post‟) in the promotion list dated 06.09.2007. Subsequently,\non 03.02.2009, a special promotion list was released promoting her to rank\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                        Page 1\n of Inspector (GD) without protecting her seniority. Aggrieved at that stage,\nshe filed a Petition being <a href=\"/doc/187805212/\" id=\"a_3\">Ravina Malik v. UOI and Ors</a> [W.P. (C) No.\n617/2011] before this Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"918536\" id=\"span_2\">This Court, by an order on 01.02.2011 directed\nthe CRPF to treat the Petitioner‟s case as a representation requiring\nconsideration of the decision dated 27.10.2009 in <a href=\"/doc/918536/\" id=\"a_4\">Ashok Kumar v. Union of\nIndia [W.P. (C) No.</a> 21900/2005]. Ultimately, by signal No. P.VII-10/2011-</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">Est. dated 11.04.2011, the Petitioner‟s seniority was restored with\nconsequential benefits w.e.f. 06.09.2007.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.     In the interim, two pre-promotional courses for upward movement to\nthe cadre of Assistant Commandant, (Senior Inspector Cadre Course SL.\nNos.83 and 84) were conducted between 03.05.2010 to 10.07.2010 and\n19.09.2010 to 27.11.2010 respectively. However, Petitioner could not attend\nthe same because the re-assignment of her seniority occurred only on\n11.04.2011- consequent to the directions of this court, in W.P. (C) 617/2011.\nSubsequently, she was eligible for SICC SL. No. 85 conducted from\n04.07.2011 to 13.09.2011. However, she was unable to attend that course\nowing to her pregnancy at that time and was declared SHAPE-III.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.     The petitioner attempted the next pre-promotional course (now\nrenamed as Assistant Commandant Promotion Course SL. No. 1) conducted\nfrom 02.07.2012 to 15.09.2012 and qualified it, fulfilling the eligibility\ncriterion for promotion to Asst. Commandant. However, the promotion list\nwhich was released on 20.02.2014, did not include the Petitioner‟s name and\nconsequently she lost her seniority vis-à-vis her batch mates and juniors. In\nthis respect, she filed a representation on 21.02.2014 requesting restoration\nof her seniority which was denied through office order dated 07.04.2014, on\nthe ground that she „had shown unwillingness to attend the promotional\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                       Page 2\n course‟ SICC SL No.85 to maintain her seniority. The CRPF order also\nclarified that her seniority was protected for SICC SL Nos. 83 and 84,\nwhereas only her chance was protected with respect to SICC No. 85 and not\nher seniority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.     The petitioner urges that her seniority must be reinstated w.e.f. SICC\nSL No. 83 on compassionate grounds of her pregnancy considering that she\nhad passed the required course subsequently. Counsel on behalf of the\nPetitioner has brought this Court‟s attention to the case of Insp. Navin\nKumar Jha as a similar case, wherein he was notionally promoted and\nseniority was protected w.e.f. from SICC SL No. 83. It was argued that\nconcededly when the respondents denied the petitioner her chance to\nparticipate in the pre-promotional course on the ground of her pregnancy,\nshe could not have been discriminated against. It was argued that her\ncolleagues and batchmates, who were unable to attend Course Nos. 83 and\n84 but attended course No. 85 and qualified, were given due seniority,\nbecause the CRPF recognised that their deployment for that course was\ninvoluntary and for circumstances outside their control. Thus, upon her\ncompletion of the Assistant Commandant Promotion Course SL. No.1 on\n15.09.2012 her seniority should be calculated as if she had completed\npromotion course SICC SL. No. 83 on 10.07.2010. In this regard, it is\nargued that the petitioner‟s seniority and chance was protected for her\nappearance in SICC SL. No. 85 in lieu of batch/course Nos. 83 and 84 due\nto an administrative lapse i.e. fixing her seniority and post as Inspector w.e.f.\n06.09.2007. Her unwillingness in this regard with respect to her seniority in\nlight of the Standing Order, would be untenable.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">W.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                          Page 3\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"> 6.     The CRPF submits that the present issue stands squarely decided by\nthe Standing Order No. 6/99 dated 19.03.1999. Clause (J) deals with\nsituations where candidates show unwillingness to perform the course. It\ncategorically states that in case unwillingness shown by a candidate is\naccepted on compassionate grounds, only the chance shall be preserved but\nseniority shall be forfeited. In this regard, learned counsel relied upon letter\nP.VII-35/2011- Estt-85 dated 21.10.2011, wherein it is noted that the\nPetitioner was SHAPE-III owing to her pregnancy and that her chance was\npreserved in accordance to the Standing Order, but not her seniority.\nAnalysis and Conclusions\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">7.     The main question which this court has to decide is whether the\nPetitioner‟s pregnancy would amount to unwillingness or signify her\ninability to attend a required promotional courseand if she is entitled to a\nrelaxation of rules to claim seniority at par with her batchmates.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.     The facts are not in controversy; the petitioner had to approach this\ncourt, on an earlier occasion, along with her colleagues, due to the CRPF‟s\nstand that she lacked two years‟ experience in an operational post. The\npromotion list dated 06.09.2007 omitted her name. This was set right\npursuant to W.P. (C) No. 617/2011 and the CRPF restored the Petitioner‟s\nseniority and consequential benefits w.e.f. 06.09.2007. In the meanwhile, the\npre-promotional courses were conducted; the petitioner could not attend\nthose, on account of pendency of dispute. Her colleagues/batchmates got the\nfirst opportunity to do so, when Batch No. 85 was sent for the course. She\ncould not attend the course - not on account of her volition, but for medical\nreasons (she was declared Shape III as she was pregnant). She ultimately\ncleared the course in the next batch.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">W.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                         Page 4\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\"> 9.     To conclude that pregnancy amounts to mere unwillingness - as the\nrespondents did in this case- was an indefensible. The choice to bear a child\nis not only a deeply personal one for a family but is also a physically taxing\ntime for the mother. This right to reproduction and child rearing is an\nessential facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution; it is underscored by the\ncommitment of the Constitution framers to ensure that circumstances\nconducive to the exercise of this choice are created and maintained by the\nState at all times. This commitment is signified by <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 42 (&quot;Provision\nfor just</a> and humane conditions of work and maternity relief- The State shall\nprovide conditions for securing just and humane conditions of work and for\nmaternity relief&quot;) and <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 45 (&quot;Provision for early childhood care</a> and\neducation to children below the age of six years- The State shall endeavour\nto provide for early childhood care... &quot;). The Maternity Benefits Act, 1976\nprotects the expecting mother‟s interests in employment. <a href=\"/doc/1955064/\" id=\"a_8\">Provisions of the\nFactories Act, 1948</a> and the Central Civil Service (Leave) Rules, 1972\nprovide for post-natal care leave enabling mothers to spend time with infants\nwho need early childhood care.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">10.    The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n(ICESCR), which has been ratified by India, spells out in greater detail the\nvarious facets of the broad right to health. <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 10</a> of ICESCR which is\nrelevant, reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      &quot;<a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 10</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      1.

The Court held that:</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">      &quot;11. ... There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\n      reproductive choices is also a dimension of `personal liberty&#x27; as\n      understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is\n      important to recognise that reproductive choices can be\n      exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from procreating.\n      The crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy,\n      dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This means that\n      there should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\n      reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\n      participation in sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on\n      use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also free\n      to choose birth-control methods such as undergoing sterilisation\n      procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion, reproductive\n      rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its\n      full term, to give birth and to subsequently raise children...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">12.    It would be a travesty of justice if a female public employee were\nforced to choose between having a child and her career. This is exactly what\nthe CRPF‟s position entails. Pregnancy is a departure from an employee‟s\n&quot;normal&quot; condition and to equate both sets of public employees- i.e. those\nwho do not have to make such choice and those who do (like the petitioner)\nand apply the same standards mechanically is discriminatory. Unlike plain\nunwillingness- on the part of an officer to undertake the course, which can\npossibly entail loss of seniority- the choice exercised by a female employee\nto become a parent stands on an entirely different footing. If the latter is\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                           Page 6\n treated as expressing unwillingness, CRPF would clearly violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21.</a>\nAs between a male official and female official, there is no distinction, in\nregard to promotional avenues; none was asserted. In fact, there is a\ncommon pre-promotional programme which both have to undergo; both\nbelong to a common cadre. In these circumstances, the denial of seniority\nbenefit to the petitioner amounts to an infraction of <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 16 (1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_15\">(2)</a> of\nthe Constitution, which guarantee equality to all in matters of public\nemployment, regardless of religion, caste, sex, descent, place of birth,\nresidence etc. A seemingly &quot;neutral&quot; reason such as inability of the\nemployee, or unwillingness, if not probed closely, would act in a\ndiscriminatory manner, directly impacting her service rights. That is exactly\nwhat has happened here: though CRPF asserts that seniority benefit at par\nwith the petitioner‟s colleagues and batchmates (who were able to clear\ncourse No. 85) cannot be given to her because she did not attend that course,\nin truth, her &quot;unwillingness&quot; stemmed from her inability due to her\npregnancy. In this present situation the course was in Coimbatore.\nTravelling and living in an alien area without support was not a feasible\nproposition for an expecting mother; besides, the CRPF had determined that\nher medical category was SHAPE III. Mercifully, the CRPF does not\ncontend that its regulations imposed any restrictions on a female employee‟s\npregnancy at the stage of the Petitioner‟s career. That the petitioner\nexercised her right therefore to become a parent should not operate to\npenalise her, and her „choice‟ to do so was irrelevant, in the circumstances\nof the case; the CRPF should have taken the reasons for the unwillingness\ninto account given the admitted fact that she was pregnant.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">W.P.(C) 4525/2014                                                        Page 7\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"> 13.    Standing Order dated 19.03.1999, by clause (J), clothes the Director\nGeneral, CRPF with discretion - through non-obstante and overriding\npower. This case was eminently suitable for the Director General to exercise\nhis powers on a compassionate basis, enabling the petitioner to catch up on\nlost opportunity due to her involuntary condition (on account of her exercise\nof reproductive rights) and regain her seniority with her batchmates who\ncleared the 85th course. The omission to exercise this power has led to the\npresent dispute. The lack of an express plea of pregnancy based\ndiscrimination does not in any way stop this court from doing complete\njustice, to further the rights of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_17\">, 15 (1)</a><a href=\"/doc/1011960/\" id=\"a_18\">, 16 (2)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">14.    For the foregoing reasons, this Court hereby directs the Respondents\nto restore seniority of the Petitioner from 10.07.2010, the completion date of\nSICC SL. No. 83- as in the case of her other batchmates who completed that\ncourse, and consequently promote as well as assign her consequential\nseniority. Consequential seniority and all pay benefits including fixation of\npay and arrears of pay shall also be disbursed to the petitioner within twelve\nweeks.
