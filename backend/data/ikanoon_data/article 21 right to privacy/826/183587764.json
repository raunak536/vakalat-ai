The facts of\n                          the case are briefly outlined below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                          1.1.     The Petitioner got married in 2016. From this union a baby girl was\n                          born in 2017, however, subsequently the husband of the Petitioner\n                          abandoned her and the minor child. As such, the whereabouts of the\n                          Petitioner&#x27;s husband are not known to her.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                          1.2.     The Petitioner has been raising her daughter on her own with financial\n                          hardships and difficulties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                          1.3.     On 8th August 2024, the Petitioner felt nausea and went to the doctor\n                          for consultation at the Delhi Government Dispensary where she was advised\n                          to get an ultrasound scan. On the same day, she underwent an ultrasound\n                          scan at the Public Path Lab &amp; Diagnostic Centre in Delhi. The scan revealed\n                          that she was 21 weeks and 4 days pregnant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                          1.4.     The Petitioner claims that she did not realise the ongoing pregnancy\n                          till such a belated stage due to certain health concerns - particularly an\n                          irregular menstrual cycle. The said pregnancy is an unwanted one as it arises\n                          from a live-in-relationship and the Petitioner is concerned about the social\n                          stigma and ostracization she would have to face. Further, she comes from a\n                          poor background and has serious financial constraints due to which she\n                          cannot raise and nurture a second child.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                          1.5.     Once she became aware of the pregnancy, she went to various doctors\n                          and clinics seeking medical termination of her pregnancy, however, all\n                          doctors refused to do so, on the ground of limitation under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_3\">MTP Act</a> for\n                          pregnancies above 20 weeks.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_7\">2.

Further it is urged that\n                          continuing the ongoing pregnancy is causing grave injury to the physical and\n                          mental health and well-being of the Petitioner as the pregnancy arises from a\n                          live-in-relationship, which has caused her to face social stigma. Moreover,\n                          she is already working multiple jobs to support herself and her first child,\n                          and therefore, the ongoing pregnancy is causing mental strain on her as she\n                          does not have the financial stability to care for a second child. In light of the\n                          above, considering the insecure situation of the Petitioner, she ought to be\n                          allowed to terminate her ongoing pregnancy. Reliance in this regard is also\n                          placed upon the judgement of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/184376178/\" id=\"a_5\">XYZ v.

As a single mother abandoned by her\n                          husband, whose current whereabouts remain unknown, the Petitioner faces\n                          formidable financial and societal challenges. Struggling to support her first\n                          child on a limited income, she has made a considered decision to seek the\n                          termination of her pregnancy at a gestational age of 22 weeks, invoking the\n                          provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_7\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act</a>, as\n                          amended in 2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">                          5.       Under <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act, a pregnancy may be\n                          terminated when the length of the pregnancy exceeds 20 weeks but does not\n                          exceed 24 weeks if: (a) the woman falls within the prescribed category of\n                          women under the MTP Rules, and (b) two registered medical practitioners\n                          opine that the continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the life of\n                          the pregnant woman or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">                          6.       Before examining the second criterion of the aforementioned\n                          provision, it is essential to determine if the Petitioner qualifies under the\n                          prescribed &#x27;category of women&#x27; as per the MTP Rules. Rule 3B of the MTP\n                          (Amendment) Rules, 2021, specifies that a woman who experiences a\n                          change in marital status during an ongoing pregnancy is eligible to seek\n                          termination after 20 weeks of gestation. In this case, the Petitioner, though\n                          legally married, has been abandoned by her husband. Additionally, she\n                          conceived this pregnancy from a live-in relationship, but her partner has\n                          since become untraceable, and they no longer cohabit. The Petitioner&#x27;s\n                          counsel has confirmed that the couple has separated and the partner cannot\n                          be contacted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          7.

The Court&#x27;s analysis of Rule 3B of the MTP (Amendment) Rules,\n                          2021, emphasized that this provision acknowledges the profound impact of\n                          changes in a woman&#x27;s marital status on her life circumstances, which can\n                          materially alter during an ongoing pregnancy. Such change in circumstances\n                          during an ongoing pregnancy has been held to be inclusive of a scenario\n                          where the woman has been abandoned by her partner as well as cases where\n                          a woman separates from her partner. The relevant extracts of the\n                          abovementioned judgment are as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                                    &quot;95. Rule 3-B(c) is based on the broad recognition of the fact that a\n                                    change in the marital status of a woman often leads to a change in her\n                                    material circumstances.

Firstly, the health of the woman is paramount.

Further, since the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_30\">MTP Act</a> only allows abortion\n                                 beyond twenty-four weeks if the foetus is diagnosed with substantial\n                                 abnormalities, the Medical Board opines against termination of\n                                 pregnancy merely by stating that the threshold under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_32\">B) of\n                                 the MTP Act</a> is not satisfied. The clarificatory report dated 3-4-2024 fell\n                                 into this error by denying termination on the ground that the gestational\n                                 age of the foetus is above twenty-four weeks and there are no congenital\n                                 abnormalities in the foetus.</span></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                 26. The report failed to form an opinion on the impact of the pregnancy\n                                 on the physical and mental health of the pregnant person. If a pregnant\n                                 person meets the condition under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_34\">B) of the MTP Act</a> then\n                                 there would be no need for any permission by the courts.

The powers vested under the Constitution in the High Court and this\n                                 Court allow them to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under Part\n                                 III of the Constitution. When a person approaches the court for\n                                 permission to terminate a pregnancy, the courts apply their mind to the\n                                 case and make a decision to protect the physical and mental health of\n                                 the pregnant person. In doing so the court relies on the opinion of the\n                                 Medical Board constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_35\">MTP Act</a> for their medical\n                                 expertise. The court would thereafter apply their judicial mind to the\n                                 opinion of the Medical Board. Therefore, the Medical Board cannot\n                                 merely state that the grounds under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 3</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_37\">B) of the MTP Act</a> are\n                                 not met.

Therefore, a Medical Board must examine the pregnant person\n                                 and opine on the aspect of the risk to their physical and mental\n                                 health.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">                                                                                     [Emphasis added]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">                          14.
