Until 1960&#x27;s, abortion was illegal in India. The Shantilal\n\nShah Committee was formed in the mid-1960s to examine the\n\nneed for regulations governing abortion. As a result, the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_9\">Medical\n\nTermination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> (for short, <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_10\">MTP Act</a>) was\n\nenacted legalising safe abortions and protecting women&#x27;s health.\n\nThe law is an exception to the criminalisation of abortion under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Penal Code</a>. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_12\">MTP Act</a> permits licenced medical\n\nprofessionals to perform abortions in specific predetermined\n\nsituations as provided under the legislation - such as, when there\n\nis danger to the life or risk to the physical or mental health of the\n\npregnant women, when pregnancy arises from sex crime or rape\n\nor intercourse with lunatic women etc., and when there is\n\nsubstantial risk that the child when born would suffer from\n\ndeformities and diseases. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_13\">The MTP Act</a> was amended in 2021 to\n\nallow abortions up to 24 weeks of gestation, raising it from the\n\nprevious 20 weeks for &quot;certain categories of women&quot;. These are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> WP(C) No.16366/2024</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             -:4:-</span>\n\nlisted under Rule 3B of the MTP Rules notified under the <a href=\"/doc/1834371/\" id=\"a_14\">MTP\n\nAmendment Act</a> and include survivors of rape, incest, minors,\n\nwomen experiencing a change of marital status (widowhood or\n\ndivorce), women with disabilities, women with foetal anomaly and\n\nthose living in emergency, disaster or humanitarian crisis. The\n\nAmendment Act allows termination of pregnancies beyond 24\n\nweeks only in cases of foetal anomalies of the child. It sets up\n\nState Level Medical Boards to decide if the pregnancy may be\n\nterminated after 24 weeks in cases of substantial foetal\n\nabnormalities. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_15\">The MTP Act</a> also provides for the protection of\n\nwomen&#x27;s privacy, confidentiality and dignity in accessing safe\n\nabortion services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_5\">6.

Coming to the facts of the case, when the victim was\n\nmedically    examined    on   25/4/2024,   by   a    medical   board\n\nconstituted by the Government Medical College Hospital, Kannur\n\nas per the direction of this Court, she was found to be carrying a\n\npregnancy of 27 weeks. It is relevant to note at this juncture that\n\nas per <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act, termination of pregnancy of a\n\nwoman where it exceeds 20 weeks but does not exceed 24 weeks\n\ncan only be allowed in special categories, and where the medical\n\npractitioners are of the opinion that continuance of such\n\npregnancy would either involve a risk to the life of a woman or\n\ncause grave injury to her physical or mental health. The\n\ncategories under which pregnancy can be terminated where\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> WP(C) No.16366/2024</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                              -:7:-</span>\n\npregnancy is between 20 to 24 weeks, have been prescribed by\n\nthe MTP Rules, 2021. Clause (a) of the Rules relate to victims of\n\nsexual assault, rape or incest and clause (b) relates to minors. In\n\nthis case, the victim falls under both, i.e., clauses (a) and (b) as\n\nshe is a minor aged 16 years who is alleged to have been raped.\n\nThough the MTP Act does not provide for termination of\n\npregnancies over the gestational age of 24 weeks except in cases\n\nof detection of substantial foetal abnormalities while exercising\n\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226</a>, this Court has wider powers than what is\n\nspecified under <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MTP Act. The extraordinary\n\npowers of the constitutional courts in this regard have been\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court and exercised several times by\n\nthe High Courts including this Court to allow termination of\n\npregnancies even in cases where pregnancy has exceeded the\n\nlimit of 24 weeks. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169797775\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/169797775/\" id=\"a_27\">A. v.

Pregnancy   outside   marriage,   in   most   cases,   is\n\ninjurious, particularly after sexual abuse and is a cause for\n\ntrauma affecting both physical and mental health of the pregnant\n\nwoman, the victim. Sexual assault or abuse of a woman is itself\n\ndistressing and the resultant pregnancy compounds the injury.\n\nThis is because such a pregnancy is not a voluntary or mindful\n\npregnancy. [see <a href=\"/doc/184376178/\" id=\"a_31\">XYZ v. State of Gujarat</a> (supra)]. <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 3(2)</a> of\n\nthe MTP Act provides that if the continuance of the pregnancy\n\nwould cause grave injury to the physical or mental health of the\n\npregnant woman, the pregnancy can be terminated. Explanation\n\n2 of <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_33\">section 3 (2)</a> says that where the pregnancy was caused by\n\nrape, the anguish caused by the pregnancy shall be presumed to\n\nconstitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> WP(C) No.16366/2024</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                  -:9:-</span>\n\nwoman. Hence, a rape victim cannot be forced to give birth to a\n\nchild of a man who sexually assaulted her. Declining permission\n\nto a rape victim to medically terminate her unwanted pregnancy\n\nwould     amount   to   forcing    her    with   the   responsibility   of\n\nmotherhood and denying her human right to live with dignity\n\nwhich forms a significant part of the right of life guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">     9.     In the report of the Medical Board, it was pointed out\n\nthat continuance of pregnancy may be detrimental to the\n\nphysical and mental health of the victim. The psychiatrist who\n\nwas part of the Medical Board opined that the continuation of the\n\npregnancy may result in severe psychological trauma to the\n\nvictim. The adverse impact of the continuance of the pregnancy\n\non the victim&#x27;s mental health and the resultant trauma could very\n\nwell be inferred as she is a rape survivor. The family of the victim\n\ngirl belongs to a scheduled caste community. It is stated in the\n\nwrit petition that poor family members including the victim girl\n\nare in a state of shock over the turns of events. The victim is now\n\nhoused at the Childcare Home and it is stated that she is not\n\nmentally prepared to accept the state of affairs and deliver the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> WP(C) No.16366/2024</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                              -:10:-</span>\n\nchild. Moreover, the social isolation of a minor girl before the\n\nSC/ST community who is subjected to sexual assault and giving\n\nbirth to a child at such a young age cannot be ruled out. For all\n\nthese reasons, I deem it appropriate to grant the relief sought\n\nand permit the petitioner&#x27;s minor daughter/victim to undergo\n\nmedical termination of pregnancy at the Pariyaram Medical\n\nCollege, Pariyaram, Kannur District, in the following manner:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     (i) On production of this judgment, the 5th respondent shall\n\ntake immediate measures for constituting a medical team to\n\nconduct the procedure and carry out the termination of\n\npregnancy of the victim.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (ii)    The petitioner shall file an appropriate undertaking,\n\nauthorising to conduct the surgery at her risk.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (iii)   After terminating the victim&#x27;s pregnancy, the 5 th\n\nrespondent shall preserve the foetus for carrying out the medical\n\ntest for the purpose of criminal case pending against the accused\n\nin Crime No.210/2024 of Edakkad Police Station,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (iv) If the foetus is found to be alive at birth, the hospital\n\nshall give all necessary assistance including incubation either in\n\nthat hospital or any other hospital where incubation facility is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\"> WP(C) No.16366/2024</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                   -:11:-</span>\n\navailable in order to ensure that the foetus survives.
