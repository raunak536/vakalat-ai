In brief, the prosecution story is that on 10.05.2015,\n\nthe complainant Puran Chand moved an application to the\n\npolice at Police Station, Palampur in which it was alleged that\n\nthe appellant had allured his daughter, who was 17 years old\n\nand giving false assurances on the pretext of marriage had been\n\ncommitting sexual assault upon her for the last many months\n\nand had threatened her not to disclose the same to anyone and\n\nall these facts were disclosed   to him by his wife.   When he\n\ntalked with the mother of that boy whether she was ready to\n\nmarry his daughter, she refused and told that she could not\n\nbring the daughter of a caste. The victim was got medically\n\nexamined. Her samples were preserved. Statement of mother\n\nof the victim was recorded and the appellant was also\n\nassociated in the investigation and his MLC was also obtained\n\nand his undergarments were also taken into possession.\n\nStatement of the victim was also got recorded before Ld. ACJM,\n\nPalampur. On the identification of the victim, the places where\n\nsexual intercourse had taken place, were identified by her. The\n\nspot maps were prepared and the caste certificate of the victim\n\nwas taken after moving an application to Tehsildar. On the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               3</span>\n\nidentification of the appellant,       the spot map was prepared.\n\nCopy of &#x27;Parivar&#x27; register was also taken into possession.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">3.          On   completion       of   the   investigation,   the   I.O.\n\npresented the challan in the Court and on finding a prima facie\n\ncase, the appellant was charged for the commission of offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/455161/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 376 (1)</a> of IPC, under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 6</a> of\n\nPOCSO Act and under <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3(1)(XII)</a> of SC &amp;ST (Prevention of\n\nAtrocities) Act, 1989, to which he pleaded not guilty and\n\nclaimed trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">4.          In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined\n\n19 witnesses in all.   Thereafter, the appellant was examined\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_7\">section 313</a> Cr.P.C. in which he denied the case of the\n\nprosecution and pleaded his innocence and stated that he had\n\nalready told the victim that he would marry her after she turned\n\n18 years of age and he had given a mobile phone to the victim\n\nwhich came in the hands of mother of the victim,                    who\n\nthereafter gave beatings to her. Later, the victim had also cut\n\nveins of her hands and on that day, he and his mother had been\n\ncalled and the villagers had also gathered there and he was\n\nasked to marry the victim, but he told that he would marry her\n\nafter she turned 18 years of age and thereafter they returned to\n\ntheir home, but after one week, he came to be arrested.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">                                    3­A\n\n4(a).       The learned Special Judge, Fast Track Court (under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_8\">POCSO Act</a>) after evaluating the evidence on record convicted\n\nand sentenced the appellant to undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/­ (Rs. Ten\n\nThousand) and in default of payment of fine to further undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for a period of one year for the\n\ncommission of an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 6</a> of the\n\nAct. It was further directed that the period, if any, during which\n\nthe appellant had been in judicial/police custody would be set­\n\noff under <a href=\"/doc/914361/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 428</a> Cr.P.C. against the substantive sentence\n\nonly and not against the sentence in default.\n\n\n4(b).       As regards the charge framed against the appellant\n\nfor the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/12362825/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3(1)(XII)</a> of the\n\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of\n\nAtrocities) Act, 1989, the appellant was acquitted and, as such,\n\nacquittal has attained finality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n4(c).       Aggrieved   by   the    judgment   of   conviction   and\n\nsentence as passed by the learned Special Judge, the appellant\n\nhas filed the instant appeal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">5.            It is vehemently argued by Shri Kul Bhushan\n\nKhajuria, learned counsel for the appellant that the findings\n\nrecorded by the learned Special Judge are totally perverse,\n\nwhereby an innocent young man has been sent to gallows, and,\n\ntherefore, the same deserve to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">6.            On the other hand, Shri Yashwardhan Chauhan,\n\nlearned Senior Additional Advocate General, would argue that\n\nsince   the    prosecution   has   established   its   case   beyond\n\nreasonable doubt, therefore, the findings rendered by the\n\nlearned Special Judge warrants no interference.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">7.            We have heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nand have gone through the material placed on record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">8.            At the outset, it needs to be observed that rape is\n\nthe most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a\n\nsociety, as it is an assault on the body, mind and privacy of the\n\nvictim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the\n\nvictim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless\n\nfemale. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the\n\nvery core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an\n\naccomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the\n\nvictim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher\n\npedestal than an injured witness.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">9.          Rape is the most hated crime, which tantamounts to a\n\nserious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends\n\nboth, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and physical\n\nharm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks. Gang rape is\n\nall the more a serious and heinous offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">10.         The committal of rape is a beastly act and takes out\n\nthe life from the life of victim. The scars of rape always remain\n\nengraved in her mind and she cannot overcome throughout her\n\nlife. Rape leaves physical as well as mental scars on the victim.\n\nPhysical wounds may heal up, but the mental scars, though less\n\nvisible are more difficult to treat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">11.         Rape is a crime not against an individual but a\n\ncrime which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social\n\natmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not only lowers the dignity of a woman but\n\nalso mars her reputation. The plight of the woman and shock\n\nsuffered by the victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape\n\ngrows with traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame\n\nhaunted by the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of\n\nterrifying melancholia. The torment on the victim has the\n\npotentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized\n\nsociety. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer\n\ndestroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and\n\ndefiles the soul of a helpless female. The offence of &quot;Rape&quot; is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    6</span>\n\ngrave by its nature, which warrants a strong deterrent by\n\njudicial hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">12.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255210\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/255210/\" id=\"a_12\">State of Punjab vs. Ramdev Singh</a>, AIR 2004\n\nSC 1290, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held as under:­\n\n           This Court dealt with the issue and held that rape is\n           violative of victim&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of\n           the Constitution. So, the courts should deal with such\n           cases sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from\n           being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the\n           right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious\n           blow to her supreme honour and offends her self­esteem\n           and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim\n           and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a\n           minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist\n           not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a\n           scar on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her\n           dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only\n           an offence against the person of a woman, rather a crime\n           against the entire society. It is a crime against basic\n           human rights and also violates the most cherished\n           fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the\n           Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">13.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60548682\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/60548682/\" id=\"a_15\">Jugendra Singh Vs. State of UP</a>, (2012) 6 SCC\n\n297, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held:­\n\n           &quot;Rape or an attempt to rape is a crime not against an\n           individual   but   a   crime   which   destroys   the   basic\n           equilibrium of the social atmosphere. The consequential\n           death is more horrendous. It is to be kept in mind that an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         7</span>\n           offence against the body of a woman lowers her dignity\n           and mars her reputation. It is said that one&#x27;s physical\n           frame is his or her temple. No one has any right of\n           encroachment. An attempt for the momentary pleasure of\n           the accused has caused the death of a child and had a\n           devastating effect on her family and, in the ultimate\n           eventuate, on the collective at large. When a family\n           suffers in such a manner, the society as a whole is\n           compelled to suffer as it creates an incurable dent in the\n           fabric of the social milieu. The cry of the collective has to\n           be answered and respected and that is what exactly the\n           High Court has done by converting the decision of\n           acquittal to that of conviction and imposed the sentence\n           as per law.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">14.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"635584\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1355852\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1314858\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9578432\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/9578432/\" id=\"a_16\">Shyam Narian Vs.

It is a crime against the holy body of a\n           woman and the soul of the society and such a crime is\n           aggravated by the manner in which it has been\n           committed.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                   8</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">15.         Equally settled is the proposition of law that\n\nconviction can be based on the sole testimony of the victim of\n\nsexual assault without corroboration from any other evidence.\n\nThe statement of the victim is more reliable than any other\n\nwitness. Where the testimony of victim of sexual assault instills\n\nthe confidence in court, the same can be relied upon for\n\nconviction of the accused. It is also a well settled principle of\n\nlaw that corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the\n\ntestimony of the victim is not a requirement of law but a\n\nguidance to prudence under the given circumstances.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">16.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732998\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/1732998/\" id=\"a_20\">Vijay @ Chinee vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>,\n\n(2010) 8 SCC 191, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has dealt with\n\nthe issue and held that :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;Thus, the law that emerges on the issue is to the effect\n            that the statement of the prosecutrix if found to be worthy\n            of credence and reliable, requires no corroboration.

Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies\n\nshould not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable\n\nprosecution case.

At that\n\ntime her father was working at Hamirpur and prior to her\n\njoining the Sewing Centre at Panchrukhi, she was studying in\n\nGovt. High School, Andretta. When she used to go to the school,\n\nthe appellant, who belonged to their village used to harass her\n\non the way and asked her for marriage with him, but she\n\nrefused.

He\n\nadmitted that the statement of victim        under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 164</a>\n\nCr.P.C. was not got recorded on 10.05.2015. He denied that the\n\nstatements of victim under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_24\">section 161</a> Cr.P.C. and 164 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_25\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nwere the tutored versions. He denied that he had not carried\n\nout fair investigation and accused had been falsely implicated\n\nin this case. He denied that the victim and accused had not\n\nidentified any spot to the police. He denied that he had recorded\n\nthe statements of witnesses on his own.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">           This is the entire evidence of the case on record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">54.        Adverting to the testimony of victim, it would       be\n\nnoticed that as per version put­forth by her, the appellant\n\ncommitted sexual intercourse with her that too under the\n\npretext of marriage, firstly, on 14.02.2014 and for the second\n\ntime on 25.01.2015.    But, on both the occasions, she never\n\ncomplained and rather it is the specific case that she talked\n\nabout the incident only after her mother came to know after she\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                27</span>\n\nseized the mobile phone from the victim that had been given by\n\nthe appellant to her. It has also come in the evidence that the\n\nfamily of the victim had tried to impress upon the appellant to\n\nmarry their daughter and the appellant had not out rightly\n\nrefused to marry her, but had stated that he would marry the\n\nvictim after she attained the age of 18 years. The versions put­\n\nforth by the victim and her mother regarding conflict of caste\n\nclearly appear to be an afterthought.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_75\">55.        Going by the statement of the victim, she had never\n\ndisclosed to the police that the appellant used to tease her on\n\nher way to school. She had further not disclosed to the police\n\nthat the appellant had threatened her to do away with her life\n\nand to defame her in case she did not have sexual intercourse\n\nwith him. She further admitted that she had not disclosed to\n\nthe police in her statement that the appellant had brought &#x27;dori&#x27;\n\n(thread) and &#x27;sindhoor&#x27; (vermilion) from &#x27;chela&#x27; and asked her to\n\ntie &#x27;dori&#x27; around her waist and apply &#x27;sindhoor&#x27; on her forehead.\n\nShe admitted the letters Ext. DA­1 and Ext. DA­26 to have been\n\nwritten by her to the appellant and further volunteered to state\n\nthat even the appellant had written letters to her. What is more\n\nimportant is the clear admission of the victim regarding the\n\nsuggestion that the appellant had admitted that he would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                      28</span>\n\nmarry her on attaining the age of 18 years, as would be evident\n\nfrom the following version:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               &quot;It is correct to suggest that the accused had\n               admitted that he would marry me on my attaining\n               age of 18 years.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">56.            From   the     aforesaid      discussions,    we   find   the\n\ntestimony of the victim to be not trustworthy or credible so as\n\nto be considered as sterling witness. The sterling witness has to\n\nbe of a very high quality and caliber, whose version should be\n\nunassailable and such statement ought to have been accepted\n\non its face value without any hesitation. The witness has to be\n\ntruthful and there would have been no reason for the victim to\n\nhave come up with a false version as in the instant case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">57.            Therefore, we would look for other evidence which\n\nmay corroborate the evidence as has come on record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">58.            Evidently, PW­2 Kanta Devi, who was associated by\n\nthe   police     during     investigation,    has   not     supported    the\n\nprosecution case regarding the identification of the spot where\n\nthe appellant is alleged to have committed sexual intercourse\n\nwith the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">59.            As regards PW­9, Rajni Devi, who was Pradhan of\n\nGram Panchayat, Andhretta, no doubt, she tried to support the\n\ncase of the prosecution. But, then her testimony will have to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                 29</span>\n\nbe taken with a pinch of salt as she happens to be belonging to\n\nthe same community and caste as that of the victim. This\n\nassumes importance that when her testimony is considered\n\nalong with the testimonies of the victim and her mother and\n\nstatement of PW­11 Kushma Devi @ Sunka, who clearly stated\n\nthat on 06.05.2015 she was cutting grass in her field and upon\n\nhearing noise, she had gone to the courtyard of the father of the\n\nvictim where lot of people had gathered and she saw mother of\n\nthe victim giving her beatings and she had intervened in the\n\nmatter and asked the mother of the victim why she was giving\n\nbeatings to her daughter upon which victim disclosed that she\n\nwanted to marry with the appellant. On the same day, at about\n\n5.00­6.00 p.m., she had again heard noise from the house of\n\nPuran Chand and thereafter went there to pacify the situation\n\nwhen the mother of the appellant disclosed that after attaining\n\nthe age of majority by the victim she would be ready for the\n\nmarriage of her son with the victim. She further stated that it\n\nwas mother of the victim who told that due to nearness of place\n\nof residence, she was not ready to get her daughter married\n\nwith the appellant and nothing­else had happened except the\n\naforesaid in her presence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_80\">60.        Be it stated,     this witness was not even declared\n\nhostile and upon cross­examination by the defence counsel, she\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                30</span>\n\nadmitted that when she had gone to the house of Puran Chand\n\non 06.05.2015, there were lot of people, who had already\n\ngathered there and named a few of them. She also admitted\n\nthat in her presence      mother of the appellant as well as\n\nappellant had not used any casteist remarks to the family of\n\nthe victim. She further admitted that even in her presence, the\n\nmother of the victim as well as victim had not disclosed about\n\nsexual assault being committed by the appellant            with the\n\nvictim. Lastly, she admitted that the appellant had also agreed\n\nto marry the victim after attaining the age of majority.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">61.        Evidently, nothing has come on record to show that\n\nPW­11 Kushma Devi was inimical to the victim or her family or\n\nthat she was in any way related to the appellant or had any\n\nother reason to depose in favour of the appellant. Rather, her\n\ntestimony appears to be truthful and is probable for this reason\n\nthat at no stage she was turned hostile unlike PW­2 and was\n\nfurther permitted to complete her testimony which casts a\n\nserious dent in the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">62.        It is in this background that one may have to fall\n\nback to the medical evidence which again is of no avail because\n\nthe victim had alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse\n\nwith her on 14.02.2014 and thereafter for the second time on\n\n25.01.2015. She was medically examined on 10.05.2015 and,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                 31</span>\n\nobviously then, there could be no signs of any recent sexual\n\nintercourse, yet, PW­6 doctor Preeti Sood would give a stereo­\n\ntype opinion that &quot;the possibility of sexual assault could not be\n\nruled out&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">63.           Here, we need to observe that as per the statement\n\nof the victim, she had categorically stated that the appellant for\n\nthe first time had sexual intercourse with her on 14.02.2014 at\n\nthe place outside her cowshed which was situated at the back\n\nof their house and for the second time he had committed sexual\n\nintercourse with her on 25.01.2015.       But, then she further\n\ndeposed that when she refused for sexual intercourse with the\n\nappellant, he had been threatening her to defame her. He had\n\nalso been threatening to kill her in case she refused to have\n\nsexual intercourse with him and also qualified that she had not\n\ntold about it to anyone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">64.           We really fail to understand that even as per the\n\nstory of the victim herself, it was on two occasions that she had\n\nsexual intercourse with the appellant and she did not even term\n\nthe same either to be forcible or without her consent. In case,\n\nthe testimony of the victim is believed, then we see no reason\n\nwhy the victim should not have complained immediately to her\n\nparents and waited for more than 3½ months.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 32</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">65.         Importantly, the victim infact never complained to\n\nher parents and talked about the incident only after her parents\n\ncame to know about the relationship. The silence of the victim\n\nin the given circumstances is something more than what meets\n\nthe eye.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">66.         The further story of the victim as well as her mother\n\nKaya Devi (PW­8) that the appellant had given her &#x27;dori&#x27; to tie\n\naround her waist and &#x27;sindhoor&#x27;         to apply on her forehead\n\nwhich made the victim     to abuse them when she used to tie\n\n&#x27;dori&#x27; around her waist and apply &#x27;sindhoor&#x27;          on her forehead\n\nand then they got treated her daughter from &#x27;chela&#x27;, is not at\n\nall worthy of credence. After­all the Court cannot give credence\n\nmuch less uphold any theory of black magic as was sought to\n\nbe put­forth by the prosecution.           Even for the sake of\n\narguments if the versions of the victim and her mother are read,\n\nthen there is no evidence led by them which may indicate how\n\nand by whom the victim was         treated and who removed the\n\n&#x27;dori&#x27; from her waist and &#x27;sindhoor&#x27; from her forehead as stated\n\nby the victim (PW­7) and PW­8 Kaya Devi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">67.         In absence of there being any material on record,\n\nsave and except, bald statements of victim and her mother,\n\nregarding   penetrative   sexual     assault   with    victim,   which\n\ntestimonies as observed are not fully reliable, it cannot be held\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                 33</span>\n\nthat the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt, rather, the appellant is entitled to benefit of doubt.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">68.        Even assuming that it was the appellant, who\n\nrefused to marry with the victim that too at a stage subsequent\n\nto the alleged incident, even the same cannot be a handle to\n\nincriminate the appellant on the charges clamped against him,\n\nparticularly keeping in view the admitted previous relationship\n\nbetween the victim and the appellant. Any other interpretation\n\nwould frustrate the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_26\">POCSO Act</a> as well as the\n\njurisprudence behind the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">Indian Penal Code</a> and lead to\n\nunscrupulous abuse of the said statutes at the drop of a hat.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">69.        In view of the aforesaid discussions, impugned\n\njudgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the\n\nlearned Special Judge, which suffer from patent illegality and\n\nbeing legally unsustainable, are set aside. The appellant is\n\nacquitted of the charges framed against him after giving benefit\n\nof doubt in his favour.     Consequently, the appellant, in the\n\ninstant case, is ordered to be released immediately, if not\n\nrequired in any other case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">70.        The Registry is directed to prepare release warrants\n\nof the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">71.        In view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 437A</a> Cr.P.C., the\n\nappellant is directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                        34</span>\n\n    Rs.25,000/­ with one surety of the like amount to the\n\n    satisfaction of the learned Registrar (Judicial) of this Court,\n\n    which shall be effective for a period of six months with a\n\n    stipulation that in an event of an SLP being filed against this\n\n    judgment or on grant of the leave, the appellant on receipt of\n\n    notice thereof shall appear before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">    72.
