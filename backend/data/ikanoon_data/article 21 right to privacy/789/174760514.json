The first respondent is the Secretary to the Reserve Bank of India,\nwhile the second respondent is the Regional Director, Reserve Bank of India,\nChennai. The third respondent is the Joint Secretary, Department of Economic\nAffairs, New Delhi. The fourth respondent is the Managing Director of Credit\nInformation Bureau (India) Limited, Nariman Point, Mumbai. The fifth\nrespondent is the Managing Director of Equifax Credit Information Services\nPrivate Limited, Mumbai. The sixth respondent is the Managing Director of\nCRIF HIGH MARK Credit Information Services Private Limited, Mumbai. The  \nseventh respondent is the Managing Director of Experian Credit Information\nCompany of India, Mumbai. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">        3. Neither the Reserve Bank of India nor the Union of India, as it is,\nhave been chosen to be impleaded as party respondents to this writ petition.\nInstead, the officers of the Reserve Bank of India and the Union of India are\nimpleaded. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">        4. No provision of law of the <a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_2\">Credit Information Companies (Regulation)\nAct, 2005</a>, was challenged in this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">        5. The petitioner would go about setting forth that the banks and other\nfinancial institutions are collecting vital information of their customers,\nwhich included the Permanent Account Number, Driving Licence Number, e-mail  \naddress, Employment information, Aadhaar Card details and the type of loan\ntransaction availed, etc. The information so collected is transmitted to the\nCredit Information Companies and those Credit Information Companies, in turn,\nare assigning rating to the transactions without affording any opportunity to\nthe customers concerned. It is further asserted that in spite of good and\nbona fide conduct of the customers/borrowers of banks/financial institutions,\nthe ratings are assigned by these companies in a mechanical fashion and in\nthat process, the customers would suffer grave hardship in availing any\nfurther financial assistance. It is stated that four Credit Information\nAgencies are approved by the Reserve Bank of India and the entire writ\npetition is directed against such companies. But, unfortunately, instead of\nthe company, per se, the Managing Director of the Company alone is impleaded. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">        6. The petitioner would urge that if the banks and financial\ninstitutions were to make available financial assistance to their customers\nonly based upon the credit rating assigned by one company or the other, then,\nhe would wonder the necessity of the respective banks and the financial\ninstitutions, seeking collateral security to be provided to the financial\nassistance so availed by way of mortgage and also the need to obtain personal\nguarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">        7. Since the information maintained and furnished by the Credit\nInformation Companies is uni-directional, in the sense that they are non-\nresponsive to the request of any corrections by the concerned customers, the\npetitioner would urge that their actions are all in violation of the\nfundamental principle of natural justice, namely, audi alteram partem. The\nCredit Information Companies have no concern for a genuine dispute existing\nbetween the customers and the bank/financial institution concerned. Against\nany of the lending institutions, if a customer/borrower initiates any legal\nproceedings for redressal of such grievance, the customer is misbranded as a\ndefaulter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">        8. The petitioner has taken the illustration of an individual,\nSri.S.Prashanthan, who is a software professional at Chennai, who it is\nclaimed, has never availed any Credit Card facility furnished by ICICI Bank.\nBut, still, the said bank demanded Rs.18,000/- (Rupees Eighteen Thousand \nonly) from the said individual and for want of clearing the said outstanding\nliability, the name of the individual has been maintained in the list of\ndefaulters by the Credit Information Companies, as a consequence of which,\nwhen the said individual applied for sanction of International Credit Card\nwith HDFC Bank, the said Bank has flatly rejected his application for grant\nof International Credit Card. Thus, to get over the problems consistently\ncreated by the defaulters&#x27; list maintained by the Credit Information\nCompanies, the said individual cleared the dues of Rs.18,000/- (Rupees\nEighteen Thousand only) by paying it up to the ICICI Bank.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">        9. The petitioner has taken another illustration of one Rajkumar\nThakur, who has instituted certain proceedings in the Consumer Redressal\nForum, Raipur, Chattishgarh, as the bank has included his name in the list of\ndefaulters, even after the payment of full lumpsum amount of Rs.66,100/-\n(Rupees Sixty Six Thousand and One Hundred only) to the loan account. \nConsequently, the Consumer Redressal Forum ordered for payment of  \ncompensation to the individual while directing necessary action to be taken\nup for removing the complainant&#x27;s name from the list of defaulters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">        10. The petitioner would cite instance of one other individual, a\nresident of Chennai, who availed Credit Card from the State Bank of India and\nin spite of settling the dues to the bank, his name is still maintained by\nthe Credit Information Companies in the list of defaulters. As a consequence,\nwhen the individual applied for sanction of a housing loan, the same was\nrejected. Based on these stray instances, facts relating to which are\ndifficult to be verified effectively, without there being any sustainable\nlegal basis, the petitioner proceeds to assert that around 80% of CIBIL score\ndefaulters are, thus, related to Credit Card payments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        11. It is asserted by the petitioner that the banks would treat the\nCredit Card dues as unsecured loans and would consequently, charge interest\nat the rate of 48% annually, which is usurious and therefore, urges that the\nCredit Card defaulters should not be included in the list of defaulters\nmaintained by the Credit Information Companies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">        12. The petitioner proceeds to assert - that too without any reasonable\nbasis - if the credit history of Indian citizens who have availed any\nfinancial assistance is made available to the Non-Governmental Companies or\nsubsidiary companies of foreign Principals, there is any amount of security\ndanger involved. The petitioner wonders as to why, when there is a huge pool\nof homegrown software professionals, the Central Government and the Reserve \nBank of India is not utilising their talent. The writ petitioner would also\napprehend that one day or the other, the foreign companies may use or sell\naway by way of leakage or by way of deceit, this data bank to foreign banks\nand other financial institutions, who intend to do business in India and\nhence, deduces that right to life and privacy of the citizens of this\ncountry, is put to peril, thus, violating <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">        13. It is urged by the petitioner that these &#x27;Credit Information\nCompanies&#x27; collect huge money from the borrowers for providing any\ninformation, whereas a &#x27;member&#x27; of the Credit Information Companies needs to\npay only a nominal amount. Ultimately, the writ petitioner would postulate\nthat the &#x27;increased number of non-performing assets of banks/financial\ninstitutions&#x27; is the result of the Credit Rating activity of these companies.\nHe, therefore, urges that the lacuna found, without specifying what they are,\nin the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_4\">Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005</a>,\nrequires to be attended to by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">        14. This so-called &#x27;public interest litigation&#x27; is bereft of any merit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">        15. The Parliament, with a view to provide for regulation of Credit\nInformation Companies and to facilitate efficient distribution of credit and\nfor matters connected therewith, enacted the <a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_5\">Credit Information Companies\n(Regulation) Act, 2005</a> [for short called &#x27;the Act&#x27;, henceforth].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">        16. <a href=\"/doc/1780064/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 2</a> of this Act contained the definition of various\nexpressions found used in the Act.

Under <a href=\"/doc/460261/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 15</a> of this Act, &#x27;every credit institution&#x27; existing\nas on the date of coming into force of this Act, was required, before expiry\nof three months time, from such commencement or within such extended period  \nas the Reserve Bank of India may allow, to become a member of at least one\n&#x27;Credit Information Company&#x27; or the other and no Credit Information Company\nshall refuse to register a credit institution as its member, without\nproviding a reasonable opportunity of being heard to such credit institution.\nThus, a statutory obligation is thrust upon every &#x27;credit institution&#x27; to\ncompulsorily become member of one &#x27;Credit Information Company&#x27; or the other.\nWhen once it becomes a member, the &#x27;credit institution&#x27; is bound to pass on\nall the relevant information about all those who have availed financial\nassistance from it, to the &#x27;Credit Information Company&#x27; to enable the latter\nto collate such information. Thus, without regard being had to this statutory\nregime and in a mechanical manner, the petitioner has gone about settling the\npleadings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">        29. Under <a href=\"/doc/38428/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 17</a> of this Act, every credit institution is obliged\nto furnish information to the Credit Information Company. Thus, an obligation\nis cast upon every credit institution to make available the credit\ninformation of its customers to the Credit Information Company, of which, it\nis a member. In the absence of any challenge to these provisions, the banks\nand financial institutions, which answer the description of credit\ninstitutions, cannot refuse to make available such information to the Credit\nInformation Companies.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">        30. Under <a href=\"/doc/924877/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 19</a> of this Act, every Credit Information Company or\ncredit institution, who is in possession or control of credit information,\nshall take such steps including security safeguards to ensure that the data\nrelating to the credit information maintained by them is accurate, complete,\nduly protected against any loss or unauthorised access or use or unauthorised\ndisclosure thereof. Again, ignoring this safety feature encrypted in the Act,\nthe petitioner goes about airing apprehensions about possible misuse of the\ninformation by way of leakage and the possible ill-effects of such\nunauthorised disclosure.\n</p>        \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">        31. <a href=\"/doc/1966725/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 20</a> of this Act required every credit information company,\ncredit institution and the specified user, to adopt the privacy principles\nadumbrated therein in relation to collection, processing, collating,\nrecording, preservation, secrecy, sharing and usage of credit information.\nAmongst others, the purpose for which the credit information may be used,\nrestriction on such use and disclosure thereof, is also provided for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">        32. One of the grievances nurtured by the petitioner is that the Credit\nInformation Companies act in uni-direction and that they are non-responsive\nto the pleas for updating the information. Such a contention is developed\nwithout regard being had to the provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/326754/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 21</a> of the Act.\nSub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/326754/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 21</a> of this Act enables any person, who applies for\ngrant or sanction of credit facility from any credit institution, may request\nsuch institution to furnish him a copy of the credit information obtained by\nsuch credit institution from the Credit Information Company. Such information\nis liable to be made available subject to payment of such charges as may be\nspecified by the regulations framed by the Reserve Bank of India in that\nregard. In case, it is found that the credit information has not been\nupdated, as per sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/326754/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 21</a> of the Act, a borrower or a\nclient of a credit institution may request to update the information by\nmaking an appropriate correction or addition, or otherwise and on such a\nrequest, the Credit Information Company shall take appropriate steps to\nupdate the credit information within thirty days after being requested to do\nso. The procedure to be followed for updating the information is also\nprovided under the two provisos thereunder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">        33. Insofar as the plea relating to possible unauthorised access to the\ncredit information is concerned, <a href=\"/doc/381584/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 22</a> of the Act makes it very clear\nthat no person shall have access to credit information in the possession or\ncontrol of a Credit Information Company unless the access is authorised by\nthe Act or any other law for the time being in force or directed to do so by\nany Court or Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">        34. Further, <a href=\"/doc/26804/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 23</a> of this Act has recognised that any wilful act\nof Credit Information Company or engaging in any practice, in breach of any\nof the principles referred to <a href=\"/doc/1966725/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 20</a>, shall be punishable with fine not\nexceeding one crore rupees. This apart, sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/26804/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 23</a> of this\nAct has gone to the extent of recognising that the action of any Credit\nInformation Company in wilfully providing credit information which is false\nin any material particular, knowing it to be so, or wilfully omitted to make\na material statement, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one\ncrore rupees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">        35. Under <a href=\"/doc/1196873/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 27</a> of this Act, power is conferred on the Reserve\nBank of India to specify, by regulations, a maximum amount of fees leviable\nunder sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/992809/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 14</a> for providing information to the\nspecified users and also for admissions of credit institutions. Thus, the Act\nwhen read as a whole, clearly brings out the essence of not only collecting\nthe credit information, but preserving and protecting such information from\nany unauthorised access or usage.       \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">        36. Thus, the apprehensions entertained by the writ petitioner are all\nill-founded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">        37. <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_45\">The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934</a>, has been made amongst other \nobjectives for securing monetary stability in our country and for operating\nthe credit system to its advantage. Under <a href=\"/doc/1649267/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 3</a> of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank of India has been constituted and several\nimportant functions and responsibilities have been entrusted to the Reserve\nBank of India, so constituted. <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_47\">The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934</a>, has been\namended by the Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Act, 1962 [No.35 of 1962],  \ninserting Chapter III-A therein, which dealt with collection and furnishing\nof credit information. The object behind it is spelt clearly by setting forth\nthat in the absence of any regular and systematic arrangement for the\ncollection, pooling and supply of particulars relating to the loans and\nadvances or other credit facilities granted by the various banks and\nfinancial institutions to those borrowing any amounts from them, individual\nbanks or other financial institutions are handicapped in obtaining reliable\ninformation about the creditworthiness or financial position of the various\npersons to whom credit has been or may have to be granted. By virtue of the\nprovisions contained under Chapter III-A of this Act, it is the duty of the\nReserve Bank of India to collect credit information from banking companies\nand then, furnish such information to any banking company in accordance with\nthe procedure contained under <a href=\"/doc/334592/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 45D</a> of the Reserve Bank of India Act,\n1934.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">        38. Secondly, in <a href=\"/doc/323435/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 45E</a> of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934,\ndisclosure of information has also been prohibited. It is, therefore, more\nthan clear that the writ petitioner has not noticed the legal regime with\nregard to the collection, preservation and usage of credit information\nprevailing in the country for the past over 50 years, but instead, rashly\nproceeded to institute this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">        39. Even prior to ushering in the <a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_50\">Credit Information Companies\n(Regulation) Act, 2005</a>, the Reserve Bank of India through its circular dated\n17.06.2004, urged all Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural \nBanks) and Notified All-India Financial Institutions and State Financial\nCorporations, to obtain consent of all their borrowers (and not only\ndefaulters) for pooling of data for development of a comprehensive credit\ninformation system. It is considered by the Reserve Bank of India that the\ndevelopment of an efficient credit information system is critical for the\ndevelopment of a sound financial system and the wisdom behind it cannot be\nimpeached easily. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">        40. This matter, beyond any pale of doubt in our mind, is a frivolous\nlitigation. No effort has been made to discredit a fiscal statute, which made\nprovision for a fool-proof credit information system to be put in place. If\nthe economic development of the nation is the aim and objective of the\nGovernment, then, it is bound to put in place various economic mechanisms and\nalso regulatory measures concerning them. Securing economic stability is a\nmost vital factor for the sustenance of various organs of the country as it\nis. While seeking to achieve the constitutional goals, as promised to the\ncitizens of this country, the State is under enormous obligation to stabilise\nits economy first and for achieving that objective, it was required to\nundertake various regulatory measures. Sans the economic stability, the\nconstitutional goals remain potentially unachieved fully.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">        41. It is a pity that the petitioner, notwithstanding being a\npractitioner of law, has not bestowed his attention as to how the\nlegislations are framed and what kind of serious studies precede such\nlegislations. The subject matter of every legislation is bound to be studied\nby the experts and/or expert bodies, who come up with relevant suggestions,\nrecommendations and steps to stabilise the economy, which again are studied \ncarefully. Consequent to increased trade and commercial activities across the\nfrontiers of various nations, every country is bound to make an endeavour to\npreserve, protect and regulate it&#x27;s economic activities in such a manner\nwhich suits its own needs and caters to special requirements peculiar to it.\nThe credit information system plays a vital role in making an appropriate\nassessment about the creditworthiness of the individuals or\ncustomers/borrowers concerned. More importantly, it plays a vital role in\nrisk assessment. What is to be taken note of from the collated information in\nthat process is a value input by the decision maker before he extends credit\nfacilities. Once the credit facilities are availed, they are required to be\nrecycled promptly and also leave the extender of such facilities, a\nreasonable margin to provide for his enterprise. A sticky account or\nabnormally delayed repayment is capable of eating into the very vitals of\nevery credit institution. It is, therefore, very vital for efficient\nfunctioning of the credit institution itself that there should be\n&#x27;creditworthy information&#x27; relating to the customers or the prospective\nborrower available at some place, so that, the same can be consulted/verified\nbefore any decision is taken on the request of the customer/borrower before\nextending the credit facility. The risk analysis is a perfect professional\nactivity carried on meticulously by every credit institution. A Regulatory\nenactment, which has got significant &#x27;input and value addition&#x27;, is sought to\nbe discredited by the writ petitioner in a very light-hearted manner. Such\nattempts are wholly unwarranted and deserve to be dealt with a firm hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">        42. Every piece of legislation shall be assumed to have been validly\nmade and is liable to be construed to have been made for achieving the\nobjectives spelt out by it. And such objectives behind every piece of\nlegislation are essentially grounded in public interest. The constitutional\nCourts, advisedly, proceed very cautiously before adversely commenting upon\nthe provisions contained in any legislation. It is a settled principle that a\nlegislation can be attacked only on limited grounds which include the\nlegislative competence or violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to\nthe citizens or for violation of any other constitutional provision and\nwithout demonstrating any such grounds, no parliamentary legislation can be\nprevented from being given effect to or acted upon. The present writ petition\ndoes not attempt to recognise the well-laid out limitations which the\nconstitutional Courts steadfastly adhere to, when it sought for a relief\nwhich, in effect, calls in question the legitimacy of actions authorised by\nthe Parliamentary legislation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">        43. It is a pity that the writ petitioner appears to have rendered\nassistance in some case or the other, on behalf of some clients and the\ninformation gathered in that process, is sought to be made the basis upon\nwhich the foundations for this writ petition are laid. This is one reason why\nthe lawyers are not supposed to turn themselves to litigants. Every piece of\ninformation is required to be vetted, verified, analysed and then\nappropriately used by the professionals. The writ petitioner has grossly\nfailed to do any of them.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">        44. For the aforementioned reasons, we dismiss this writ petition and\nimpose token costs of Rs.1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand only) payable to the \nMediation and Conciliation Centre attached to this Bench, within a period of\nfifteen days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
