State of TN &amp; Others</a>, (1994)\n                          6 SCC 632, which lays down the broad principles while considering\n                          defamation on publication vis-à-vis the freedom of speech and expression\n                          and may be beneficially quoted:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                                 &quot;26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the\n                                 above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                                 (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n                                 guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be\n                                 let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\n                                 family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education\n                                 among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above\n                                 matters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and whether\n                                 laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to\n                                 privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for\n                                 damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n                                 thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a\n                                 controversy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                                 (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\n                                 concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such\n                                 publication is based upon public records including court records. This is\n                                 for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the\n                                 right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for\n                                 comment by press and media among others. We are, however, of the\n                                 opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must\n                                 be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual\n                                 assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be\n                                 subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised\n                                 in press/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                                 (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above -- indeed,\n                                 this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public\n                                 officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of\n                                 action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and\n                                 conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Digitally Signed          CS(OS) 370/2022                                                            Page 10 of 14</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">By:DINESH CHANDRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">Signing Date:14.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">19:17:28</span>\n                                  where the publication is based upon facts and statements which are not\n                                 true, unless the official establishes that the publication was made (by\n                                 the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n                                 would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to\n                                 prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not\n                                 necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course,\n                                 where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n                                 personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be\n                                 liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to\n                                 the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n                                 protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It\n                                 needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to\n                                 punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures protected\n                                 as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_19\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_20\">104</a> respectively of the\n                                 Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.\n                                 (4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\n                                 institutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot\n                                 maintain a suit for damages for defaming them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                                 (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_21\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>,\n                                 or any similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not\n                                 bind the press or media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                                 (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to\n                                 impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">                          12.   Coming back to the facts of the case, on the face of record, the tweets\n                          in question referred at serial No.1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12&amp;13 in para 5, prima facie\n                          appear to be libellous statement made by defendant No. 1 and are per se\n                          defamatory.    The same appear to be reckless in the absence of any\n                          supporting material reflected in the aforesaid tweets and are completely in\n                          disregard of the right to reputation of the plaintiffs guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article\n                          21</a> of the Constitution of India.       I am of the considered opinion that if the\n                          same are permitted to continue on record, it is likely to further blemish/blot\n                          the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiffs and may cause a misimpression\n                          in the trust of the voters/supporters of the party or common citizens of the\n                          country in the absence of any cogent evidence.

I am further of the opinion that defendant Nos. 1 &amp; 2 cannot be\n                          permitted to further inflict injury on the reputation of the plaintiffs by virtue\n                          of re-tweeting similar tweets which appear to be calculated to injure the\n                          reputation of the plaintiffs by exposing them to an adverse opinion or\n                          ridicule in the eyes of the public. It cannot be ignored that unfounded\n                          allegations in print or electronic media can be damaging forever, if there is\n                          no opportunity to vindicate one&#x27;s reputation. The voting strategy of an\n                          individual or of a political party or their nominees is purely based upon the\n                          ideology and policy of the political party or an individual, and alleging that\n                          the same had been sold off, without any foundational basis, deeply causes an\n                          irreparable harm, loss and damage to the reputation of the individual/party\n                          concerned and clearly encroaches the right of privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                                 Having established the prima facie case, the balance of convenience\n                          also lies in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. In case the\n                          ex-parte interim relief is not granted, at this stage, the plaintiffs are likely to\n                          further lose their credibility in public life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">                          14.
