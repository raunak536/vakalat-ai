Albert Schweitzer, highlighting on  Glory  of  Life,  pronounced  with\nconviction and humility, “the reverence of life  offers  me  my  fundamental\nprinciple on morality”.   The aforesaid  expression  may  appear  to  be  an\nindividualistic  expression  of  a  great  personality,  but,  when  it   is\nunderstood in the complete sense,  it  really  denotes,  in  its  conceptual\nessentiality, and connotes, in its macrocosm, the fundamental perception  of\na thinker about the respect that life commands.  The reverence  of  life  is\ninsegragably associated with the dignity of a human being who  is  basically\ndivine,  not  servile.   A  human  personality  is  endowed  with  potential\ninfinity and it blossoms when dignity is sustained.  The sustenance of  such\ndignity has to be the superlative concern  of  every  sensitive  soul.   The\nessence of dignity can never be treated as a momentary spark  of  light  or,\nfor that matter, ‘a brief candle’, or ‘a hollow bubble’.  The spark of  life\ngets more resplendent when man is treated  with  dignity  sans  humiliation,\nfor every man is expected to lead an honourable life  which  is  a  splendid\ngift of “creative intelligence”. When a dent is created in  the  reputation,\nhumanism is paralysed.  There are some megalomaniac  officers  who  conceive\nthe perverse notion that they are the  `Law’  forgetting  that  law  is  the\nscience of what is good and just and, in very nature of  things,  protective\nof a civilized society.  Reverence for the nobility of a human being has  to\nbe the corner stone of a body polity  that  believes  in  orderly  progress.\nBut, some, the incurable ones, become totally oblivious  of  the  fact  that\nliving with dignity has been enshrined in our Constitutional philosophy  and\nit has its ubiquitous presence, and the majesty  and  sacrosanctity  dignity\ncannot be allowed to be crucified  in  the  name  of  some  kind  of  police\naction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.    The aforesaid prologue gains signification since in the case at  hand,\na doctor, humiliated in custody, sought  public  law  remedy  for  grant  of\ncompensation and the High Court, despite no factual  dispute,  has  required\nhim to submit a representation to the State Government for  adequate  relief\npertaining to grant of compensation after expiry of 19 years with a  further\nstipulation that if  he  is  aggrieved  by  it,  he  can  take  recourse  to\nrequisite proceedings available to him under law.   We  are  pained  to  say\nthat this is not only asking a man  to  prefer  an  appeal  from  Caesar  to\nCaesar’s wife but it also compels him like a cursed Sisyphus  to  carry  the\nstone to the top of the mountain wherefrom the stone rolls down  and  he  is\nobliged to repeatedly perform that futile exercise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.    The factual matrix as uncurtained is that the appellant, an  Ayurvedic\nDoctor with B.A.M.S. degree, while practising  in  West  Chirmiri  Colliery,\nPondi area in the State  of  Chhattisgarh,  used  to  raise  agitations  and\nspread awareness against exploitation of  people  belonging  to  weaker  and\nmarginalized sections of the society.  As a social activist, he  ushered  in\nimmense awareness among the down-trodden people which caused  discomfort  to\nthe people who had vested interest in the  coal  mine  area.   The  powerful\ncoal mafia, trade union leaders, police officers and other persons  who  had\nfiscal interest felt disturbed and threatened  him  with  dire  consequences\nand pressurized him to refrain  from  such  activities.    Embedded  to  his\ncommitted stance, the petitioner declined to succumb to  such  pressure  and\ncontinued the activities.  When the endeavor failed to  silence  and  stifle\nthe agitation that was gaining strength and momentum, a consorted  maladroit\neffort was made to rope him in certain criminal offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.  As the factual narration further unfolds, in the  initial  stage,  cases\nunder <a href=\"/doc/291822/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 110</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1226542/\" id=\"a_2\">116</a> of the Criminal  Procedure  Code  were  initiated  and\nthereafter crime No. 15/92 under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 420</a> of the Indian Penal  Code  (for\nshort  ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>’)  and crime No. 41/92 under <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 427</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_6\">379</a>  of  the\nIPC were registered.  As the activities gathered further  drive  and  became\nmore pronounced, crime No. 62/90 was registered for  an  offence  punishable\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 379</a> of the IPC for alleged theft of electricity.  In the  said\ncase, the appellant was taken into custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">6.    Though  he  was  produced  before  the  Magistrate  on  22.9.1992  for\njudicial remand and was required to be taken to  Baikunthpur  Jail,  yet  by\nthe time the order was passed, as it was evening, he was kept  in  the  lock\nup at Manendragarh Police Station.   On 24.9.1992, he  was  required  to  be\ntaken to jail but instead of being taken to the jail, he was taken to  Pondi\nPolice Station at 9.00 a.m.  At  the  police  station,  he  was  abused  and\nassaulted.  As asseverated, the physical assault was the beginning  of  ill-\ntreatment.  Thereafter, the SHO and ASI, the respondent Nos. 3 and  4,  took\nhis photograph compelling him to hold a placard on which it was written :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “Main Dr. M.N. Azam Chhal Kapti Evam Chor Badmash Hoon”. (I, Dr.\n           M. N. Azam, am a cheat, fraud, thief and rascal).\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.    Subsequently, the said photograph was  circulated  in  general  public\nand even in the revenue proceeding, the respondent No. 5 produced the  same.\n The said atrocities and the torture of the police caused tremendous  mental\nagony and humiliation and, hence, the petitioner submitted  a  complaint  to\nthe National Human Rights Commission who, in turn, asked the  Superintendant\nof Police, District Koria to submit a report.   As  there  was  no  response\nfrom the 2nd respondent the Commission again required him to look  into  the\ngrievances and take  proper  action.   When  no  action  was  taken  by  the\nrespondent or the  police,  the  petitioner  was  compelled  to  invoke  the\nextraordinary jurisdiction of the High  Court  of  Judicature  at  Bilaspur,\nChattisgarh with a prayer for punishing the respondent Nos. 4, 5 &amp; 7 on  the\nfoundation that their action was a complete transgression  of  human  rights\nwhich affected his fundamental right  especially  his  right  to  live  with\ndignity as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of  the  Constitution.   In  the  Writ\nPetition, prayer was made for awarding compensation to the tune  of  Rs.  10\nlakhs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">8.    After the  return  was  filed,  the  learned  single  Judge  passed  a\ndetailed order on  3.1.2003  that  the  Chief  Secretary  and  the  Director\nGeneral of Police should take appropriate steps for issue  of  direction  to\nthe concerned authorities to take  appropriate  action  in  respect  of  the\nerring  officers.   Thereafter,  some  developments  took   place   and   on\n24.3.2005, the Court recorded that  the  writ  petitioner  was  arrested  on\n22.9.1992 and his photograph was taken at the police station.   The  learned\nsingle Judge referred to Rule 1 of  <a href=\"/doc/870189/\" id=\"a_9\">Regulation  92</a>  of  Chhattisgarh  Police\nRegulations which lays down that no Magistrate shall order photograph  of  a\nconvict or other person to be  taken  by  the  police  for  the  purpose  of\nIdentification under <a href=\"/doc/52066971/\" id=\"a_10\">Prisoners Act, 1920</a>, unless he is satisfied  that  such\nphotograph is required for circulation to different places  or  for  showing\nit for the purpose of identification to  a  witness  who  cannot  easily  be\nbrought to a test identification at the place  where  the  investigation  is\nconducted or that photograph is required to  be  preserved  as  a  permanent\nrecord.  Thereafter, the learned single Judge proceeded to record  that  not\nonly the photograph of the writ petitioner had been taken with  the  placard\nbut had also been circulated which had caused great mental agony and  trauma\nto his school going children.  Thereafter, he referred to Regulation 737  of\nthe Chhattisgarh Police Regulations which relates to action to be  taken  by\nthe superior officer in respect of  an  erring  officer  who  ill-treats  an\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">9.    After referring  to  various  provisions,  the  learned  single  Judge\ncalled for a report from the Chief Secretary.  On 18.11.2005, the Court  was\napprised that despite several communications, the Chief  Secretary  had  not\nyet sent the report.  Eventually, the report  was  filed  stating  that  the\nappellant was involved in certain cases including  grant  of  bogus  medical\ncertificate and regard being had to the directions issued in 1992  that  the\nphotograph of the offender should be kept on record, the same was taken  and\naffixed against his name and  after  7.9.1992,   it  was  removed  from  the\nrecords.  It was  also  stated  that  the  Sub-Inspector  had  been  imposed\npunishment of “censure” by the Superintendent of Police on  19.11.2001.   It\nwas also set forth that on 3.5.2003, a charge-sheet was served  on  all  the\nerring officers and a departmental enquiry was  held  and  in  the  ultimate\neventuate, they had been imposed major penalty of withholding of one  annual\nincrement with cumulative effect for one year  commencing  27.5.2004.   That\napart, on 19.7.2005, a case had been registered  under  <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  29</a>  of  the\nPolice Act against the erring officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">10.   It is apt to note here that when  the  matter  was  listed  for  final\nhearing for grant of compensation, the learned  single  Judge  referred  the\nmatter to be heard by a Division Bench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">11.   The Division Bench referred to the prayer clause  and  various  orders\npassed by the learned single Judge and eventually directed the appellant  to\nsubmit a representation to the Chief Secretary for  grant  of  compensation.\nWe think it appropriate to reproduce the relevant paragraphs  of  the  order\npassed by the Division Bench: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           “4.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that during the\n           pendency of  the  writ  petition,  Relief  Clause  No.  7.3  was\n           fulfilled under the directions of this court and  now  only  the\n           compensation  part,  as  claimed  in  Relief  Clause  No.  7.5A,\n           remained there.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           5.    In the instant case, it is an admitted position  that  the\n           respondent  State  authorities  have  taken  cognizance  of  the\n           harassment meted out to the petitioner by the  erring  personnel\n           of the police  department  and  initiated  departmental  enquiry\n           against them in which they were found guilty and punishment  has\n           also been awarded to them.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">12.   After issuing notice, this Court, on 17.2.2012,  thought  it  apposite\nthat the appellant should submit a representation within a week which  shall\nbe considered by the respondents within four weeks therefrom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">13.   In pursuance  of  the  aforesaid  order,  the  appellant  submitted  a\nrepresentation which has been rejected on 19.3.2012  by  the  OSD/Secretary,\nGovernment of Chhattisgarh, Home  (Police)  Department.   In  the  rejection\norder, it has been stated as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                 “In  the  aforesaid  cases,  the  arrest  and  the  action\n           regarding submission of chargesheet in the Hon’ble Court was  in\n           accordance with law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           (2)   On 24.9.92 the police officers taking your photograph  and\n           writing  objectionable  words  thereon  was  against  the  legal\n           procedure.  Considering  this,  action  was  taken  against  the\n           concerned guilty police officers in accordance with law and  two\n           police officers were punished.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           (3)   In your representation, compensation has been demanded  on\n           the following two grounds:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           A.    Defamation was caused due to the  police  officers  taking\n           photograph.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           B.    Your wife became unwell mentally.  She is still unwell.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           C.    Difficulty in marriage of daughter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                 Regarding the aforesaid grounds, the actual position is as\n           follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           A.    Defamation is such a subject, the  decision  on  which  is\n                 within jurisdiction of the competent  court.   No  decision\n                 pertaining to defamation has been received from  the  court\n                 of competent jurisdiction.   Therefore,  it  would  not  be\n                 proper for the State Government to take a decision in  this\n                 regard.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           B.    Regarding mental ailment of your wife, no such  basis  has\n                 been submitted by you, on the basis of which any conclusion\n                 may be drawn.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           C.    On the point of there being no marriage of  children  also\n                 no such document or  evidence  has  been  produced  by  you\n                 before the Government along with the representation, on the\n                 basis of which any decision may be taken.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                 Therefore, in the light of the above, the State Government\n           hereby rejects your representation and accordingly decides  your\n           representation.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">14.   Mr.  Niraj  Sharma,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant,\nsubmitted that when the conclusion has been arrived at  that  the  appellant\nwas harassed at the hands of the police officers  and  in  the  departmental\nenquiry they have been found guilty and punished, just  compensation  should\nhave been awarded by the High Court.  It is further urged by him  that  this\nCourt had directed to submit a representation to  grant  an  opportunity  to\nthe functionaries of the  State  to  have  a  proper  perceptual  shift  and\ndetermine the amount of compensation and grant the same,  but  the  attitude\nof indifference reigned supreme  and  no  fruitful  result  ensued.   It  is\ncanvassed by him that it would  not  only  reflect  the  non-concern  for  a\ncitizen who has been humiliated at the police station, but,  the  manner  in\nwhich the representation has been rejected clearly  exhibits  the  imprudent\nperception and heart of stone  of the State.  It is argued that the  reasons\nascribed by the State authority that defamation is such a subject  that  the\nissue of compensation has to be decided by the competent court  and  in  the\nabsence of such a  decision,  the  Government  cannot  take  a  decision  as\nregards  the  compensation  clearly  reflects  the  deliberate   insensitive\napproach to the entire  fact  situation  inasmuch  as  the  High  Court,  in\ncategorical terms,  had  found  that  the  allegations  were  true  and  the\nappellant was harassed and thereby it did tantamount  to  custodial  torture\nand there was no justification to adopt a hyper-technical mode to  treat  it\nas a case of defamation in the ordinary sense of the term and requiring  the\nappellant to take recourse to further  adjudicatory  process  and  obtain  a\ndecree from the civil court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">15.   Mr. Atul Jha, learned counsel appearing for the State,  has  supported\nthe order of the High Court as well as the order  passed  by  the  competent\nauthority  of  the  State  who  has  rejected  the  representation  on   the\nfoundation that when the appellant puts forth a claim  for  compensation  on\nthe ground of defamation, he has to take recourse to the  civil  court  and,\ntherefore, no fault can be found with the decision taken either by the  High\nCourt or the subsequent rejection of the representation by the authority  of\nthe State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">16.    The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  private  respondents  has\nsubmitted that they have already been punished in a disciplinary  proceeding\nand, therefore, the question of grant of compensation  does  not  arise  and\neven if it emerges, the same has to be determined by the civil court on  the\nbase of evidence adduced to establish defamation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">17.   At the very outset, we are obliged to  state  that  five  aspects  are\nclear as day and do not remotely admit of any doubt.  First,  the  appellant\nwas arrested in respect of the alleged  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">Indian  Penal  Code</a>,\n1860 and the <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_13\">Electricity Act, 2003</a>; second, there was  a  direction  by  the\nMagistrate for judicial remand and thereafter instead of taking him to  jail\nthe next day he was brought to the police station;  third,  self-humiliating\nwords were written  on  the  placard  and  he  was  asked  to  hold  it  and\nphotographs were taken; and  fourth,  the  photographs  were  circulated  in\ngeneral public and were also filed by one of the respondents  in  a  revenue\nproceeding; and five,  the High Court, in categorical terms, has found  that\nthe appellant was harassed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">18.   In the aforesaid backdrop, the singular question required to be  posed\nis that whether the appellant should be asked to  initiate  a  civil  action\nfor grant of damages on the foundation that he  has  been  defamed  or  this\nCourt should grant compensation on the bedrock that he has been harassed  in\npolice custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">19.   At this juncture, it is condign to refer  to  certain  authorities  in\nthe field.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_14\">D.K. Basu v. State of W.B.</a>[1] it has been held thus: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           “10.  “Torture” has not been defined in the Constitution  or  in\n           other penal laws. “Torture” of a human being  by  another  human\n           being is essentially an instrument to impose  the  will  of  the\n           “strong” over the “weak” by suffering.  The word  torture  today\n           has  become  synonymous  with   the   darker   side   of   human\n           civilization.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                       “Torture is a wound  in  the  soul  so  painful  that\n                 sometimes you can almost  touch  it,  but  it  is  also  so\n                 intangible that there is no way to  heal  it.   Torture  is\n                 anguish squeezing in your chest, cold as ice and heavy as a\n                 stone, paralyzing as sleep and dark as the abyss.   Torture\n                 is despair and fear and rage and hate.  It is a  desire  to\n                 kill and destroy including yourself.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                                         - Adriana P.

No violation of any one of the human rights has  been  the\n           subject of so many Conventions and Declarations as  “torture”  –\n           all aiming at total banning of it in all forms, but in spite  of\n           the commitments made to eliminate torture, the fact remains that\n           torture is more widespread now  than  ever  before.   “Custodial\n           torture” is a naked violation of human dignity  and  degradation\n           which  destroys,  to  a  very  large  extent,   the   individual\n           personality.  It is a calculated assault on  human  dignity  and\n           whenever human dignity is wounded,  civilization  takes  a  step\n           backward – flag of humanity must on each such occasion fly half-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">           mast.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">           12.   In all custodial crimes what is of  real  concern  is  not\n           only infliction of body pain but the mental agony which a person\n           undergoes within the four walls of police  station  or  lock-up.\n           Whether it is physical assault or rape in  police  custody,  the\n           extent of trauma, a person experiences is beyond the purview  of\n           law.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">20.   We have referred to the aforesaid paragraphs to  highlight  that  this\nCourt has emphasized on the  concept  of  mental  agony  when  a  person  is\nconfined within the four walls of police station or lock-up.   Mental  agony\nstands in contradistinction to infliction of physical  pain.   In  the  said\ncase,  the  two-Judge  Bench  referred  to  <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_15\">Article  5</a>  of   the   Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, 1948 which  provides  that  “No  one  shall  be\nsubjected to  torture  or  to  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or\npunishment”.  Thereafter, the Bench adverted to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> and proceeded  to\nstate that the expression “life  or  personal  liberty”  has  been  held  to\ninclude the right to live  with  human  dignity  and  thus,  it  would  also\ninclude within itself a guarantee against torture and assault by  the  State\nor  its  functionaries.   Reference  was  made  to  <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_17\">Article  20(3)</a>  of   the\nConstitution which postulates that a person accused of an offence shall  not\nbe compelled to be a witness against himself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"768175\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_3\">21.   It is worthy to note that in  the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_18\">D.K.  Basu</a>  (supra),  the\nconcern shown by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/768175/\" id=\"a_19\">Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P.</a>[2] was  taken\nnote of.  In Joginder Kumar’s case, this Court voiced its concern  regarding\ncomplaints of violation of human rights during and after arrest.  It is  apt\nto quote a passage from the same: -</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                 “The horizon of human rights is expanding.   At  the  same\n           time, the crime rate is also increasing.  Of  late,  this  Court\n           has been receiving complaints about violations of  human  rights\n           because of indiscriminate arrests.   How  are  we  to  strike  a\n           balance between the two?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                 A realistic approach should be  made  in  this  direction.\n           The law  of  arrest  is  one  of  balancing  individual  rights,\n           liberties and  privileges,  on  the  one  hand,  and  individual\n           duties,  obligations  and  responsibilities  on  the  other;  of\n           weighing and balancing the rights, liberties and  privileges  of\n           the single individual and those of individuals collectively;  of\n           simply deciding what is wanted and where to put the  weight  and\n           the emphasis; of deciding which comes first –  the  criminal  or\n           society, the law violator or the law abider…”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"768175\" id=\"span_4\">22.   After referring to the case of <a href=\"/doc/768175/\" id=\"a_20\">Joginder Kumar</a> (supra), A.S. Anand,  J.\n(as his Lordship then was), dealing with the various facets of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article  21</a>,\nstated that any form of torture or cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment\nwould fall within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution,  whether  it\noccurs  during  investigation,   interrogation   or   otherwise.    If   the\nfunctionaries of the Government become law-breakers, it is  bound  to  breed\ncontempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every  man  would  have\nthe tendency to become law unto himself  thereby  leading  to  anarchy.   No\ncivilized nation can permit that to happen, for a citizen does not shed  off\nhis fundamental right to life, the moment  a  policeman  arrests  him.   The\nright to life of a citizen cannot put  in  abeyance  on  his  arrest.    The\nprecious right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India  cannot\nbe denied to convicts, undertrials, detenus and other prisoners in  custody,\nexcept according to  the  procedure  established  by  law  by  placing  such\nreasonable restrictions as are permitted by law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">23.   At this juncture, it becomes absolutely necessary to  appreciate  what\nis meant by the term “harassment”.  In P.  Ramanatha  Aiyar’s  Law  Lexicon,\nSecond Edition, the term “harass” has been defined, thus: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">           “Harass. “injure” and “injury” are  words  having  numerous  and\n           comprehensive popular  meanings,  as  well  as  having  a  legal\n           import.  A line may be drawn between these words  and  the  word\n           “harass” excluding the latter from being comprehended within the\n           word “injure” or “injury”.  The synonyms  of  “harass”  are:  To\n           weary, tire, perplex,  distress  tease,  vex,  molest,  trouble,\n           disturb.  They all have relation  to  mental  annoyance,  and  a\n           troubling of the spirit.”\n\nThe term “harassment”  in  its  connotative  expanse  includes  torment  and\nvexation.  The term “torture” also engulfs  the  concept  of  torment.   The\nword “torture” in its denotative concept includes mental  and  psychological\nharassment.   The  accused  in  custody  can   be   put   under   tremendous\npsychological pressure by cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1745823\" id=\"span_5\">24.   At this juncture, we may  refer  with  profit  to  a  two-Judge  Bench\ndecision  in  <a href=\"/doc/1745823/\" id=\"a_24\">Sunil  Gupta  and  others  v.  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and\nothers</a>[3].  The said case pertained to handcuffing where the  accused  while\nin judicial custody were being escorted to court  from  jail  and  bound  in\nfetters.  In that context, the Court stated that  the  escort  party  should\nrecord reasons for doing so in writing and intimate the court  so  that  the\ncourt, considering the circumstances may either approve  or  disapprove  the\naction of the escort  party  and  issue  necessary  directions.   The  Court\nfurther observed that when the  petitioners  who  had  staged  ‘Dharna’  for\npublic cause and voluntarily submitted themselves for arrest and who had  no\ntendency to escape, had been subjected to humiliation by  being  handcuffed,\nsuch act of the escort party is against all  norms  of  decency  and  is  in\nutter violation of the principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of  the  Constitution\nof India.  The said act was condemned by this  Court  to  be  arbitrary  and\nunreasonably humiliating towards the  citizens  of  this  country  with  the\nobvious motive of pleasing ‘someone’.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">25.   In Bhim Singh, MLA v. State of J &amp;  K[4],  this  Court  expressed  the\nview that the police officers  should  have  greatest  regard  for  personal\nliberty of citizens as they are the custodians of law and order and,  hence,\nthey should not flout the law by stooping to bizarre  acts  of  lawlessness.\nIt was  observed  that  custodians  of  law  and  order  should  not  become\ndepredators of civil liberties, for their duty is  to  protect  and  not  to\nabduct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_7\">26.   It needs no special emphasis to state  that  when  an  accused  is  in\ncustody, his Fundamental Rights are not  abrogated  in  toto.   His  dignity\ncannot be allowed to be comatosed.   The  right  to  life  is  enshrined  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and a fortiorari, it includes  the  right  to\nlive with human dignity and all that goes along with it.   It  has  been  so\nstated in <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_27\">Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of  Delhi\nand others</a>[5] and <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_28\">D.K.

It is apposite to note that inhuman treatment has many  a  facet.   It\nfundamentally can  cover  such  acts  which  have  been  inflicted  with  an\nintention to cause physical suffering or severe mental pain.

At this stage, it is seemly to refer to the decisions of some  of  the\nauthorities relating to a man’s reputation which forms a facet of  right  to\nlife as engrafted under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">31.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"220787\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/220787/\" id=\"a_33\">Smt.

However, we  must  recognize\n           that a forcible intrusion into a person’s  mental  processes  is\n           also an affront to human dignity and liberty, often  with  grave\n           and long-lasting consequences.  [A similar conclusion  has  been\n           made in the following paper: Marcy Strauss, ‘Criminal Defence in\n           the Age of Terrorism – Torture’, 48  New  York  Law  School  Law\n           Review 201-274 (2003/2004)].”\n\nAfter so stating, the Bench in its conclusion recorded as follows: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           “We have also elaborated how the  compulsory  administration  of\n           any of these techniques is an  unjustified  intrusion  into  the\n           mental privacy of  an  individual.

We have referred to  these  paragraphs  to  understand  how  with  the\nefflux  of  time,  the  concept  of  mental  torture  has  been   understood\nthroughout the world, regard being had to the essential conception of  human\ndignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">36.   From the aforesaid discussion, there is no shadow of  doubt  that  any\ntreatment meted out to an accused  while  he  is  in  custody  which  causes\nhumiliation and mental trauma corrodes the concept of  human  dignity.   The\nmajesty of law protects the dignity of a citizen in a  society  governed  by\nlaw.  It cannot be forgotten that the Welfare State is governed by  rule  of\nlaw which has paramountcy.  It has been said by Edward Biggon “the  laws  of\na  nation  form  the  most  instructive  portion  of   its   history.”   The\nConstitution as the organic law of the land has unfolded itself in  manifold\nmanner like a living organism in the various decisions of  the  court  about\nthe rights of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of  India.  When\ncitizenry rights are  sometimes  dashed  against  and  pushed  back  by  the\nmembers of City Halls, there has to be a rebound and when the rebound  takes\nplace, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution springs up to action as  a  protector.\nThat is why,  an  investigator  to  a  crime  is  required  to  possess  the\nqualities of patience  and  perseverance  as  has  been  stated  in  Nandini\nSathpaty v. P. L. Dani[14].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">37.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1496509\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/1496509/\" id=\"a_40\">Delhi Judicial Services Association v. State of Gujarat</a>[15],  while\ndealing with the role of police, this Court condemned the excessive  use  of\nforce by the police and observed as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           “The main objectives of police is  to  apprehend  offenders,  to\n           investigate crimes and to prosecute them before the  courts  and\n           also to prevent commission of crime and above all to ensure  law\n           and order to protect  citizens’  life  and  property.   The  law\n           enjoins the police to be scrupulously fair to the  offender  and\n           the Magistracy is to ensure fair investigation and fair trial to\n           an offender.  The purpose and object of  Magistracy  and  police\n           are complementary to each other.  It is unfortunate  that  these\n           objectives have remained unfulfilled even after 40 years of  our\n           Constitution.   Aberrations  of  police  officers   and   police\n           excesses in dealing with the law and order situation  have  been\n           subject of adverse comments from this  Court  as  well  as  from\n           other courts but it has failed to have any corrective effect  on\n           it.  The police has  power  to  arrest  a  person  even  without\n           obtaining a warrant of arrest from a court.   The  amplitude  of\n           this power casts an obligation on the police and it must bear in\n           mind, as held by this Court that if a person is arrested  for  a\n           crime, his constitutional and fundamental  rights  must  not  be\n           violated.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_14\">38.    It is imperative to state that it  is  the  sacrosanct  duty  of  the\npolice authorities to remember that  a  citizen  while  in  custody  is  not\ndenuded of his fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.   The\nrestrictions imposed have the sanction of law  by  which  his  enjoyment  of\nfundamental right is curtailed but his basic human rights are  not  crippled\nso that the police officers can treat him in  an  inhuman  manner.   On  the\ncontrary, they are under obligation to protect his human rights and  prevent\nall forms of atrocities.  We may hasten to add that  a  balance  has  to  be\nstruck and, in this context, we may fruitfully quote a passage  from  <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_42\">D.  K.\nBasu</a> (supra): -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">            “There can be no gainsaying that freedom of an  individual  must\n            yield to the security of the State.   The  right  of  preventive\n            detention of individuals in the  interest  of  security  of  the\n            State in various situations prescribed under different  statutes\n            has been upheld by the Courts.  The  right  to  interrogate  the\n            detenus, culprits or arrestees in the interest  of  the  nation,\n            must take precedence over  an  individual’s  right  to  personal\n            liberty.   …….…The action of the State, however, must be “right,\n            just and fair”.  Using any form of torture  for  extracting  any\n            kind of information would neither be ‘right nor just  nor  fair’\n            and, therefore,  would  be  impermissible,  being  offensive  to\n            <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21.</a>  Such a crime-suspect  must  be  interrogated-indeed\n            subjected to sustain and scientific interrogation-determined  in\n            accordance with the provisions of law.  He cannot,  however,  be\n            tortured or subjected to third degree methods or eliminated with\n            a view to  elicit  information,  extract  confession  or  derive\n            knowledge   about   his   accomplishes,   weapons   etc.     His\n            constitutional right cannot be abridged  except  in  the  manner\n            permitted by law, though in the  very  nature  of  things  there\n            would be qualitative difference in the method  of  interrogation\n            of such a person as compared to an ordinary criminal.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">39.   In the case at hand, the appellant, while in  custody,  was  compelled\nto hold a  placard  in  which  condemning  language  was  written.   He  was\nphotographed with the said placard and the photograph was made  public.   It\nwas also filed in a revenue proceeding by  the  5th  respondent.   The  High\nCourt has recorded that the competent authority of the State  has  conducted\nan enquiry and found the erring officers to be guilty.  The High  Court  has\nrecorded the findings in the favour of the appellant but left him to  submit\na representation to the concerned authorities.   This  Court,  as  has  been\nindicated earlier, granted an opportunity to the  State  to  deal  with  the\nmatter in an appropriate manner  but  it  rejected  the  representation  and\nstated that it is not a case of defamation.  We may at once clarify that  we\nare not at all concerned with defamation as postulated under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 499</a>  of\nthe IPC.  We are really concerned how in a country governed by rule  of  law\nand where <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution  is  treated  to  be  sacred,  the\ndignity and social reputation of a citizen has been affected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">40.   As we perceive, from the admitted  facts  borne  out  on  record,  the\nappellant has been humiliated.  Such  treatment  is  basically  inhuman  and\ncauses mental trauma.    In “Kaplan  &amp;  Sadock’s  Synopsis  of  Psychiatry”,\nwhile  dealing  with  torture,  the  learned  authors   have   stated   that\nintentional physical and psychological torture of one human by  another  can\nhave emotionally damaging effects comparable to, and  possibly  worse  than,\nthose seen with  combat  and  other  types  of  trauma.   Any  psychological\ntorture inflicts immense mental pain.  A mental  suffering  at  any  age  in\nlife can carry the brunt and may have  nightmarish  effect  on  the  victim.\nThe hurt develops a sense of insecurity, helplessness and  his  self-respect\ngets gradually  atrophied.   We  have  referred  to  such  aspects  only  to\nhighlight that in the case at hand, the  police  authorities  possibly  have\nsome kind of  sadistic  pleasure  or  to  “please  someone”  meted  out  the\nappellant with this kind of treatment.  It is not to be forgotten that  when\ndignity is lost, the breath of  life  gets  into  oblivion.   In  a  society\ngoverned by rule of law where humanity has  to  be  a  laser  beam,  as  our\ncompassionate constitution has so emphasized, the police authorities  cannot\nshow the power or prowess to vivisect and dismember the same.     When  they\npave such path, law cannot become a silent spectator.    As  Pithily  stated\nin Jennison v. Baker[16]:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           “The law should not be seen to sit by limply,  while  those  who\n           defy if go free, and those who seek its protection lose hope.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">41.   Presently, we shall advert to the aspect  of  grant  of  compensation.\nThe learned counsel for the  State,  as  has  been  indicated  earlier,  has\nsubmitted  with  immense  vehemence  that  the  appellant  should  sue   for\ndefamation.   Our  analysis  would  clearly  show  that  the  appellant  was\ntortured while he was in custody.  When  there  is  contravention  of  human\nrights, the inherent concern as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> springs to life  and\nenables the citizen to seek relief by taking recourse to public law remedy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">42.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1628260\" id=\"span_15\">In this regard, we may fruitfully refer to <a href=\"/doc/1628260/\" id=\"a_47\">Nilabati  Behera  v.  State</a>\nor Orissa[17] wherein it has been held thus: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           “A claim in public law for  compensation  for  contravention  of\n           human rights and fundamental freedoms, the protection  of  which\n           is guaranteed in the Constitution, is an acknowledged remedy for\n           enforcement and protection of such  rights,  and  such  a  claim\n           based on strict liability made by resorting to a  constitutional\n           remedy provided for the enforcement of a  fundamental  right  is\n           ‘distinct from, and in addition to, the remedy  in  private  law\n           for damages for the tort’ resulting from  the  contravention  of\n           the fundamental right.  The defence of sovereign immunity  being\n           inapplicable,  and  alien  to  the  concept  of   guarantee   of\n           fundamental rights, there can be no question of such  a  defence\n           being available  in  the  constitutional  remedy.   It  is  this\n           principle which justifies award  of  monetary  compensation  for\n           contravention  of   fundamental   rights   guaranteed   by   the\n           Constitution, when that is the only practicable mode of  redress\n           available for  the  contravention  made  by  the  State  or  its\n           servants  in  the  purported  exercise  of  their  powers,   and\n           enforcement of the fundamental right is claimed by resort to the\n           remedy in public law  under  the  Constitution  by  recourse  to\n           <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_48\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_49\">226</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">43.   Dr. A.S. Anand J., (as his  Lordship  then  was),  in  his  concurring\nopinion, expressed that the relief of monetary  compensation,  as  exemplary\ndamages, in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 32</a>  by  the  Supreme  Court  or  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_51\">Article  226</a>  by  the  High  Courts  for  established  infringement  of  the\nindefeasible right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21</a>  is  a  remedy  available  in\npublic law and is based on the strict liability  for  contravention  of  the\nguaranteed basic and indefeasible rights of the  citizen.   The  purpose  of\npublic law is not only to civilize public  power  but  also  to  assure  the\ncitizen that they live under a legal system  which  aims  to  protect  their\ninterests and preserve their rights.  Therefore, when the court  moulds  the\nrelief by granting ‘compensation’ in proceedings under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_53\">Article  32</a>  or  226\nseeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights, it  does  so  under\nthe public law by way of penalizing the wrongdoer and fixing  the  liability\nfor the public wrong on the State which has failed in  its  public  duty  to\nprotect the fundamental rights of the citizen.  The payment of  compensation\nin such cases is not to be understood, as it is generally  understood  in  a\ncivil action for damages under the private law but in the broader  sense  of\nproviding relief by an order of making ‘monetary amends’  under  the  public\nlaw for the wrong done due to breach of public duty, by not  protecting  the\nfundamental rights of the citizen.  The compensation is  in  the  nature  of\n‘exemplary damages’ awarded against the wrongdoer  for  the  breach  of  its\npublic law duty and is independent of the rights available to the  aggrieved\nparty to claim compensation under the private law  in  an  action  based  on\ntort, through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction  or/and\nprosecute the offender under the penal law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">44.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"785041\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/785041/\" id=\"a_54\">Sube Singh v. State of Haryana</a>[18],  a  three-Judge  Bench  of  the\nApex Court,  after  referring  to  its  earlier  decisions,  has  opined  as\nfollows: -</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           “It is thus now well settled that award of compensation  against\n           the State is an appropriate and effective remedy for redress  of\n           an established infringement of a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article\n           21</a>, by a public servant.

At this stage, we may fruitfully refer  to  the  decision  in  <a href=\"/doc/810564399/\" id=\"a_57\">Hardeep\nSingh v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>.[19]   The appellant  therein  was  engaged\nin running a coaching centre where students were given  tuition  to  prepare\nfor  entrance  test  for  different  professional   courses.    On   certain\nallegation, he was arrested  and  taken  to  police  station  where  he  was\nhandcuffed by the police without there being any valid reason.  A number  of\ndaily newspapers published the appellant’s photographs  and  on  seeing  his\nphotograph in handcuffs, the appellant’s elder sister was  so  shocked  that\nshe expired.  After a long and delayed trial, the appellant, Hardeep  Singh,\nfiled a writ petition before the High Court of Madhya  Pradesh  at  Jabalpur\nthat the prosecution purposefully caused delay in conclusion  of  the  trial\ncausing harm to his dignity and reputation.  The learned single  Judge,  who\ndealt with the matter, did not find any ground to  grant  compensation.   On\nan appeal being preferred, the Division Bench observed that  an  expeditious\ntrial ending in acquittal  could  have  restored  the  appellant’s  personal\ndignity but the  State  instead  of  taking  prompt  steps  to  examine  the\nprosecution witnesses delayed the trial for five long years.   The  Division\n<a href=\"/doc/810564399/\" id=\"a_58\">Bench further held</a> there was no warrant for putting  the  handcuffs  on  the\nappellant which adversely affected his dignity.  Be it noted,  the  Division\nBench granted compensation of Rs. 70,000/-.  This Court, while dealing  with\nthe facet of compensation, held thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">           “Coming, however, to the issue of compensation, we find that  in\n           light of the findings arrived at  by  the  Division  Bench,  the\n           compensation of Rs. 70,000/-  was  too  small  and  did  not  do\n           justice to the  sufferings  and  humiliation  undergone  by  the\n           appellant.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, we  feel\n           that a sum of Rs. 2,00,00/-  (Rupees  Two  Lakhs)  would  be  an\n           adequate compensation for the appellant and would meet the  ends\n           of justice.  We, accordingly, direct the State of Madhya Pradesh\n           to pay to the appellant the sum  of  Rs.  2,00,000/-(rupees  Two\n           Lakhs) as compensation.  In  case  the  sum  of  Rs.70,000/-  as\n           awarded by  the  High  Court,  has  already  been  paid  to  the\n           appellant, the State would naturally pay only the balance amount\n           of Rs.1,30,000/- (Rupees One Lakh thirty thousand)”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">Thus, suffering and humiliation were highlighted and amount of  compensation\nwas enhanced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">46.   On a reflection of the facts of the case,  it  is  luculent  that  the\nappellant had undergone mental torture at the  hands  of  insensible  police\nofficials.  He might have agitated to ameliorate the cause of the  poor  and\nthe downtrodden, but, the social humiliation that has been meted out to  him\nis quite capable of destroying the heart of his  philosophy.   It  has  been\nsaid that philosophy has the power to sustain a man’s courage.  But  courage\nis based on self-respect and when self-respect is dented,  it  is  difficult\neven for a very strong minded person to maintain that courage.  The  initial\ninvincible mind paves the path of corrosion. As is perceptible, the  mindset\nof the protectors of law appears to cause torment and insult  and  tyrannize\nthe man who is helpless in custody.  There can be no trace of doubt that  he\nis  bound  to  develop  stress  disorder  and  anxiety  which  destroy   the\nbrightness and strength of the will power.  It has been  said  that  anxiety\nand stress are  slow poisons.  When torment is added, it  creates  commotion\nin the mind and the slow poisons get activated.  The inhuman  treatment  can\nbe well visualized when the appellant came out from  custody  and  witnessed\nhis photograph being circulated with the self-condemning  words  written  on\nit.  This withers away the very essence of life as enshrined  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution.  Regard being had to the various  aspects  which  we\nhave analysed and taking note of the totality of  facts  and  circumstances,\nwe are disposed to think that a sum of Rs.5.00 lacs (Rupees five lacs  only)\nshould be granted towards compensation to the  appellant  and,  accordingly,\nwe so direct.  The said amount shall be paid by the respondent State  within\na period of six weeks and be realized from  the  erring  officers  in  equal\nproportions from their  salary  as  thought  appropriate  by  the  competent\nauthority of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">47.   Consequently, the appeal is allowed to  the  extent  indicated  above.\nHowever, in the facts and circumstances of  the  case,  there  shall  be  no\norder as to costs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">                                                             ……………………………….J.\n                                                       [K.
