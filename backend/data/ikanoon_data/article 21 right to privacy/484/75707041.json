In the backdrop of the aforesaid discussed provisions of the Act\n   2005 this Court is now adverting to the factual aspects of the instant\n   case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">25. Admittedly, the information having not been supplied within time\n   frame as stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/71945405/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 7</a> of the Act 2005 rather beyond the\n   time frame, therefore, the matter ultimately travelled to the\n   Commission and the Commission had issued notice to the parties\n   and thereafter, the order has been passed by being satisfied that the\n   information has been supplied after delay, i.e., beyond the period of\n   thirty days. The Commission, therefore, has inflicted penalty of\n   Rs.25,000/- upon the first incumbent who was posted during the\n   relevant time the day when the application was submitted by the\n   information seeker as also upon the writ petitioner who joined the\n   duty thereafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">26. However, the first incumbent who was posted as Public Information\n   Officer the day when the information was sought for by making\n   application, subsequent to the order passed by the Commissioner,\n   has filed review.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">27. The writ petitioner had also preferred review but the order imposing\n   penalty of Rs.25,000/- has been recalled by exercising the power of\n   review with respect to the first incumbent namely Ajoy Kumar who\n   was posted during the relevant time when the application was\n   received in the office. However, the said review petition as has been\n   preferred by the writ petitioner has been dismissed therefore, the\n   writ petition has been preferred by agitating the aforesaid two\n   grounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">28. So far as the first ground is concerned that the application has not\n   been served by the subordinate staffs of the office but the same\n   cannot be said to be a ground when the petitioner has admitted the\n   fact that he was posted in the office and if any laches is there from\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                        11                             W.P.(C) No. 6681 of 2010</span>\n                                                            2025:JHHC:14144\n\n\n\n\n   the subordinate staffs of the office it is the accountability of the\n   incumbent holding the charge of the office, hence, the\n   accountability which has been casted upon him in the capacity of\n   project officer by merely taking the ground that the letter which was\n   send by the information seeker has not been placed before him,\n   cannot be a ground to make an excuse by denying the information\n   sought to be supplied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">29. The writ petitioner was posted in the office after receipt of the\n   application , i.e., two months thereafter and as such, no liability can\n   be casted upon him but such argument is also not fit to be accepted\n   due to the reason that the petitioner is posted in the office and even\n   if the first incumbent who was discharging the duty as Public\n   Information Officer had not supplied the information and being\n   transferred to another place, thereafter the petitioner has come then\n   he was also accountable to take the effective measure for supply of\n   information which was sought for by the information seeker.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">30. The writ petitioner has failed in discharging his statutory duty\n   casted upon him under the Act, 2005. Even though, he was not\n   Public Information Officer when the application sought for\n   requisite information has been filed but on 28.10.2006, the Asstt.\n   Survey Officer wrote a letter in reference to the aforesaid\n   application so that information could be furnished to the applicant.\n   On 28.10.2006 present writ petitioner was not posted at Bhowra as\n   Project Officer but on 18.11.2006, the writ Petitioner joined at\n   Bhowra as Project Officer. Thereafter, the Asstt. Survey Officer\n   sent two reminders&#x27; letters to the Project Officer dated 22.11.2006\n   &amp; 29.11.2006 for furnishing information mentioning that if\n   information is not furnished within time, penalty may be imposed\n   on him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">31. Thus, it is evident that on the concept of deemed Public Information\n   Officer he will also be said to have accountability. However, the\n   writ petitioner has not taken the ground of deemed Public\n   Information Officer but what has been gathered from the argument\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                        12                              W.P.(C) No. 6681 of 2010</span>\n                                                                  2025:JHHC:14144\n\n\n\n\n   advanced on behalf of the petitioner, therefore, the said making\n   reference of the implication of deemed Public Information Officer\n   is being referred herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">32. The ground has also been taken that the incumbent who was posted\n   the day when the application was received in the office has also\n   been dealt with in exercise of power conferred under <a href=\"/doc/95274179/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 20(1)</a>\n   of the Act, 2005 by inflicting penalty of Rs.25,000/-, but the said\n   order was recalled by exercising the power of review but the said\n   parameter has not been adopted by the Commissioner with respect\n   to the writ petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">33. There is no dispute that the parity is to be followed but before\n   considering the question of applicability of the principle of parity,\n   it needs to refer herein the principle of parity and order of review\n   dated 17.03.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">34. However, it requires to refer herein that the Central Information\n   Commission (CIC) does not have the power to review its own\n   orders under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_42\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_43\">The Act</a> 2005 do\n   not provide for such review, and the CIC has held that re-visiting\n   orders would amount to reviewing a prior decision, which has not\n   been provided in the Act 2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1992752\" id=\"span_14\">35.

It is well settled that the power to review is not\n         an inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically\n         or by necessary implication. No provision in the Act was brought\n         to notice from which it could be gathered that the Government\n         had power to review its own order. If the Government had no\n         power to review its own order, it is obvious that its delegate could\n         not have reviewed its order. The question whether the\n         Government&#x27;s order is correct or valid in law does not arise for\n         consideration in these proceedings so long as that order is not set\n         aside or declared void by a competent authority. Hence the same\n         cannot be ignored. The Subordinate Tribunals have to carry out\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                          13                                  W.P.(C) No. 6681 of 2010</span>\n                                                               2025:JHHC:14144\n\n\n\n\n           that order. For this reason alone the order of Mr Mankodi was\n           liable to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">36. Thus, the Commission had not been vested with the powers to\n    review of its earlier decisions but this Court has no concern with the\n    issue that whether the Central Information Commission has the\n    power of review or not, since it is not the case herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">37. Further, it will be clear from the plain and simple language of\n    <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_46\">Sections 18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_47\">19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/63569722/\" id=\"a_48\">20</a> of the Act 2005 that, under <a href=\"/doc/155093635/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 18</a> the\n    Information Commission has the power and function to receive and\n    inquire into a complaint from any person who is not able to secure\n    information from a public authority; under <a href=\"/doc/104637659/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 19</a> it decides\n    appeals against the decisions of the Central Public Information\n    Officer or the State Public Information Officer relating to\n    information sought by a person; and under <a href=\"/doc/63569722/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 20</a> it can impose\n    a penalty only for the purpose of ensuring that the correct\n    information is furnished to a person seeking information from a\n    public authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">38. Hence, the functions of the Information Commissions are limited to\n    ensure that a person who has sought information from a public\n    authority in accordance with his right to information conferred\n    under <a href=\"/doc/52309463/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 3</a> of the Act is not denied such information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">39. Now coming to the issue of parity as contended by the counsel for\n    the writ petitioner by referring the order dated 17.03.2009 that\n    prayer of Shri Ajoy Kumar allowed and he was relieved from the\n    penalty of Rs.25,000/- on the ground that he had a short spell of\n    time of 18 days for furnishing reply of R.T.I.
