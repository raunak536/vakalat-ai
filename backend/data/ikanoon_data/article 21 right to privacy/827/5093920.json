The       factual      matrix      of      the      case     of    the\n\nplaintiffs/appellants    is     that   the    suit   is      filed   against   the\n\ndefendants for the relief of permanent injunction restraining\n\ndefendant Nos.1 to 5 from reprinting, circulating or modifying\n\nand publishing in any manner whatsoever the defamatory, false\n\nand man-aligning content contained in introductory page 54 and\n\nchapter even (7th) of the book page 145 to 154 about late Manna\n\nDey and published in the book &quot;Tarader Sesh Chitthi&quot; (Star&#x27;s last\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n\nletter) and also sought permanent injunction against defendant\n\nNo.6 to air or communicate in any manner any content specified\n\nin infringing book    and also       mandatory injunction against\n\ndefendant Nos.1 to 5 and also direction to furnish true and fair\n\naccounts of the sale and circulation of the infringing Book in\n\nphysical and virtual form and anybody acting from making,\n\npublishing, circulating and also direct the defendants to jointly\n\nand severally pay a sum of Rs.1,10,00,000/- to the plaintiffs as\n\ncompensation and directing defendant No.1 to individually pay a\n\nsum of Rs.25,00,000/- to the plaintiffs towards damages.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">      4.    It is the contention of the plaintiffs that defendant\n\nNo.1 has engaged in a vilifying campaign against the plaintiffs by\n\npublishing an article in Anand Bazar Patrika dated 28.10.2013\n\nand subsequently publishing a chapter in book called &quot;Taradar\n\nShesh Chitthi&quot;. It is also contended that the article written by\n\ndefendant No.1 about Manna Dey is false and malicious, more\n\nparticularly regarding the private relationship of plaintiffs&#x27; and\n\nManna Dey and the said article has been published to expose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  6</span>\n\n\n\nplaintiffs to public hatred and ridicule and the articles which are\n\npublished are defamatory in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">      5.    The defendants appeared and filed the written\n\nstatement contending that the suit is bad for non-joinder of\n\nnecessary parties and also the suit is barred by limitation and\n\nalso contended that the publication which are made out of right\n\nof freedom of press.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      6.    The Trial Court having considering the pleadings of\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendants, framed several Issues,\n\nAdditional Issues and considered Issue No.5 as preliminary issue\n\nthat is with regard to the territorial jurisdiction to try the suit.\n\nThe counsel for defendant No.1 contended that the Court has no\n\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain the present suit and for the\n\nconvenience of the plaintiffs, twisted the cause of action.    It is\n\ncontended that books are published and circulated at West\n\nBengal and both the book and article are launched in the book\n\nfair at Kolkata, West Bengal in the month of January 2016 and\n\nthe same is also in the Bengali language and book was offered\n\nby the readers within the State of West Bengal and any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                  7</span>\n\n\n\npurported damage suffered by the plaintiffs due to the said\n\npublication, the same is confined to Kolkata, West Bengal, thus,\n\nought to have filed the suit at West Bengal not in Bengaluru.\n\nHence, the Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try the suit. On\n\nthe other hand, the appellants contend that the book has been\n\ncirculated in all parts of India and also in Bengaluru. Therefore,\n\ndamage to the plaintiffs&#x27; reputation has been caused within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court and the plaintiffs right to\n\nprivacy has been infringed within the jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nIt is also contended that the plaintiffs have been residents of\n\nBengaluru since 1994 and infringing book was circulated in\n\nBengaluru.   It is also contended that the right to privacy has\n\nbeen infringed within the jurisdiction of this Court because the\n\nsaid book contained personal and private details of Sri Manna\n\nDey who was legendary singer which has been read by the\n\npeople within the jurisdiction of this Court. No doubt, defamatory\n\ncontents has been printed and published in Kolkata, West\n\nBengal, but circulation of the said contents is not only in Kolkata,\n\nbut also in the rest of the States of India and moreover, the said\n\ndefamatory contents published in the book and newspaper sold\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  8</span>\n\n\n\nin other places of those Courts in that places can be entertained\n\nthe cases of defamatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">      7.     The Trial Court taking into note of the pleadings of\n\nrespective parties, analysed the material available on record and\n\ncomes to the conclusion that it is not in dispute that publication\n\ncontents have been published in Bengali language.               The\n\ndefamatory contents have been published in &#x27;Anand Bazaar\n\nPatrika&#x27; and in &#x27;Tarader Shesh Chitthi&#x27; book in Kolkata, West\n\nBengal.    The same is also an admitted fact.     It is also not in\n\ndispute that the defendants are the permanent residents of\n\nKolkata and carrying their respective business in the Kolkata,\n\nWest Bengal. The Trial Court also taken note of <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 19</a> of\n\nCPC and extracting the same made an observation that if any\n\nperson affected by the wrong done by another person can file\n\nthe   suit for   compensation within the      local limits   of the\n\njurisdiction of one Court and comes to the conclusion that the\n\nplaintiffs allege that the cause of action has arisen within the\n\nlocal jurisdiction of this Court since infringing books were sold in\n\nBengaluru at the Bengali book stall set up during Durga pooja in\n\n2016 and the said circulation has also been widely in social\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   9</span>\n\n\n\nmedia.       But the Trial Court comes to the conclusion that the\n\nlanguage published in the newspaper and book is in Bengali and\n\nthe plaintiffs are residing within the jurisdiction of this Court and\n\nthe said books have been sold in Bengaluru does not mean that\n\nthis Court has got the territorial jurisdiction.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39631288\" id=\"span_6\">8.     The Trial Court also considered the judgment relied\n\nupon by the defendants and also taken note of recent judgment\n\nof the Delhi High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/39631288/\" id=\"a_4\">ESCORTS LIMITED vs\n\nTEJPAL SINGH SISODIA</a> decided on 08.03.2019 and comes to\n\nthe conclusion that <a href=\"/doc/39631288/\" id=\"a_5\">the said judgment</a> will comes to the aid of\n\nthe defendants and answered preliminary issue as affirmative in\n\ncoming to the conclusion that Court has no jurisdiction. Hence,\n\nthe present appeal is filed before this Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">        9.     The   main   contention   of   the   learned   counsel\n\nappearing for the appellants that the appellants are husband and\n\nwife.   The counsel also would vehemently contend that though\n\nthe books are published in Bengali language in Kolkata, the\n\nsame were sold in Bengaluru and the said fact is not in dispute.\n\nThe counsel also would vehemently contend that the Trial Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                    10</span>\n\n\n\ncommitted an error in coming to the conclusion that this Court\n\nhas   no   territorial   jurisdiction.   The   counsel   also   would\n\nvehemently contend that when the temporary injunction was\n\nsought and the same was granted and the same was challenged\n\nbefore this Court and this Court confirmed the same during the\n\ncourse of trial considering the preliminary issue. The impugned\n\norder suffers from an error apparent on the face of record, is\n\nnon-speaking, considers extraneous reasons. The suit is filed\n\nseeking injunctive, declaratory and compensatory relief.         The\n\nimpugned order was passed without considering <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 19</a> of\n\nCPC wherein it is held that where a suit is for compensation for a\n\nwrong done to a person if the wrong was done within the local\n\nlimits of the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendants resides\n\nand carry on business in another Court, the suit may instituted\n\nat the option of the plaintiff in either of said Courts. The reason\n\ngiven by the Trial Court is contrary to <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 19</a> of CPC. The\n\nrespondents specifically admitted that for the purpose of hearing\n\non preliminary issue that the defamatory book is being in\n\ncirculation in Bengaluru within the jurisdiction of this Court and\n\nthe same was recorded by the Trial Court in its order dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  11</span>\n\n\n\n29.07.2024.    The counsel also brought to notice of this Court\n\nthat the language of the defamatory book is immaterial for the\n\npurposes of determining whether harm to the reputation of the\n\nappellants were done within the territorial jurisdiction of the Trial\n\nCourt.   Once it is admitted that the defamatory book was\n\ncirculated within the territorial jurisdiction of the Trial Court,\n\nlanguage is immaterial since in Bengaluru also Bengalis resides\n\nand read the said book.      The counsel also would vehemently\n\ncontend that the Court has to read both <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/175502059/\" id=\"a_9\">20(c)</a> of\n\nCPC and Trial Court has not referred <a href=\"/doc/175502059/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 20(c)</a> of CPC while\n\npassing the said order. The counsel would vehemently contend\n\nthat when the books are sold and circulated in Bengaluru, the\n\nplaintiffs have received the phone call in Bengaluru and the\n\nsame is a matter of right of privacy. Even also the defamatory\n\nstatements were found in face book and also interview was\n\nmade at Bengaluru. Hence, <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_12\">20</a> of CPC has to be\n\nconjointly read and it is not in dispute that the conversation was\n\nmade in Bengaluru.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    12</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"63895421\" id=\"span_10\">10.    The counsel of the appellants in support of his\n\narguments relies upon the judgment of this Court passed in CRP\n\nNo.89/2011             decided          on          22.09.2011          in\n\nMANU/KA/1228/2011 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/63895421/\" id=\"a_13\">S N MANJUNATH vs H\n\nB HONNAMAKKI RAMESH HEGDE AND OTHERS</a> and brought\n\nto notice of this Court paragraph 12 wherein discussion was\n\nmade with regard to <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 19</a> of CPC which deals with the\n\nterritorial   jurisdiction   and   held      that   where   a   suit   for\n\ncompensation for wrong done to the person or to movable\n\nproperty, if the wrong was done within the local limits of the\n\njurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, or carries on\n\nbusiness, or personally works for gain, within the local limit of\n\nthe jurisdiction of another Court, the suit may be instituted at\n\nthe option of the plaintiff in either of the said Courts.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"922867\" id=\"span_11\">11.    The counsel also relied upon the judgment of this\n\nCourt reported in ILR 1994 KAR 2410 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/922867/\" id=\"a_15\">P\n\nLANKESH vs H SHIVAPPA</a> and brought to notice of this Court\n\nparagraphs 9 and 10 wherein discussion was made that where a\n\ndefamatory imputation in any newspaper can be said to have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  13</span>\n\n\n\nbeen published. One of the essential ingredients of the offence\n\nis publication of the defamatory imputation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">       12.     The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of\n\nthis   Court    passed   in   M.F.A.No.4019/2022      decided   on\n\n14.07.2023 and this Court while dealing with the jurisdiction\n\nmade an observation in paragraphs 32 and 34 holding that under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 19</a> of the CPC such a suit could be instituted either\n\nwithin the local limits of the jurisdiction of a Court where the\n\ndefendant resides or carries on business or personally works for\n\ngain. Such a suit could also be instituted within the local limits\n\nof the jurisdiction of a Court where the wrong was done and\n\nthough there is no dispute with regard to the fact that suit could\n\nbe instituted in a Court where the wrong was done. Referring\n\nthis judgment, the counsel would vehemently contend that this\n\nCourt already comes to the conclusion that where the wrong is\n\ndone, the Court is having jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1378317\" id=\"span_13\">13.     The counsel also relied upon the judgment of this\n\nCourt reported in 1961 SCC ONLINE KAR 1 in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378317/\" id=\"a_17\">GOKALDAS MELARAM vs BALDEVDAS T CHABRIA</a> and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    14</span>\n\n\n\nbrought to notice of this Court paragraph 8 wherein discussion\n\nwas made that <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 19</a> is only an extension of <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 20</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 20</a> of CPC is a residuary section, every suit referred to in\n\nthat section has to be instituted either in the Court within whose\n\njurisdiction the defendant resides or carries on business or\n\npersonally works for gain, or the cause of action wholly or in part\n\narises. The counsel also brought to notice of this Court\n\nparagraph 10 wherein it is held that where the wrong is done to\n\nthe person is undoubtedly also a place where the cause of action\n\narises and detail discussion was made about <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_22\">20</a>\n\nof CPC in paragraph 14.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"132336158\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_16\">14.

The counsel also would vehemently contend that interview\n\ncannot be a ground to invoke jurisdiction even if any such\n\ninterview was made in Bengaluru.

The    counsel    would    vehemently      contend      that\n\nmaximum or minor injury is irrelevant while filing the suit and\n\nthe    Court   has     to   see   whether   the     Court   has   territorial\n\njurisdiction.

It is specifically pleaded that cause of action was\n\narose in Bengaluru.         Having perused the plaint itself it is\n\nspecifically stated that when the plaintiff received a copy of book\n\nin Bengaluru by post, defamatory remarks arose when the\n\ninfringing books were sold in Bengaluru at Bengali Book Stall set\n\nup during Durga Pooja in the year 2016 and cause of action\n\ncontinues as infringing book is available for sale through online\n\ne-commerce website in India including Bengaluru and all the\n\nbook stores in West Bengal. It is not in dispute that books are\n\nsold in Bengaluru. Respondent also not disputes the same. No\n\ndoubt, the books are released in Kolkata, West Bengal but the\n\nfact that when the books are sold in Bengaluru and no doubt, the\n\nsame are in Bengali language.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">       22.    It is also important to note that this Court has to\n\ntake note of the reason given by the Trial Court while answering\n\nIssue No.5 that the plaintiffs are residing within the jurisdiction\n\nof this Court and the said books have been sold in Bengaluru\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                     21</span>\n\n\n\ndoes not mean that this Court has got the territorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe fact that the Trial Court observed that books have been sold\n\nin Bengaluru but made an observation that no territorial\n\njurisdiction arises here. The only reason assigned by the Trial\n\nCourt in order to comes to such a conclusion that selling of\n\nbooks in Bengaluru not gives any territorial jurisdiction and also\n\nan observation is made that book was published in the\n\nnewspaper and book is in Bengali language. But the fact that\n\nBengali people also residing in Bengaluru is not in dispute. It is\n\nalso the case of the appellants that books are circulating all over\n\nthe country but the fact that book is sold in Bengaluru is not in\n\ndispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">      23.

Having considered <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_45\">20</a> of CPC as\n\ncontended by the appellant&#x27;s counsel and the proviso is very\n\nclear in <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 19</a> that where a suit is filed for compensation for\n\nwrong done to the person and if it is done within the local limits\n\nof the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, or\n\ncarries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local\n\nlimits of the jurisdiction of another Court, it is an option of the\n\nplaintiff to institute a suit either of the said Courts. In the case\n\non hand, it has to be noted that there is no dispute that books\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                     23</span>\n\n\n\nand articles are released at Kolkata, West Bengal. It is specific\n\ncase of the appellants that the books were sold in Bengaluru also\n\nduring the Durga Pooja in the year 2016. No doubt, it is the\n\ncontention of the respondents&#x27; counsel that said books are in\n\nBengali language. When books were sold in Bengaluru that too\n\nduring Durga pooja season, people including Bengalis will attend\n\nwho are residing in Bengaluru and having contact with the\n\nappellants since the appellants are residing in Bengaluru since\n\n1994. All these aspects have not been disputed by the\n\nrespondents.   It   is   specific   case   of   the   appellants   that\n\nimmediately after selling those books, the people who are\n\nresiding in Bengaluru contacted the appellants and brought to\n\nnotice of defamatory statements made in the said books and\n\ndiscussed the issue. Hence, it is clear that wrong was done\n\nwithin the local jurisdiction of the Trial Court. <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 19</a> is very\n\nclear in this regard and the suit is filed for the relief of wrong\n\ndone to persons. It is the specific case of the appellants that the\n\narticles which have been released and sold in Bengaluru affect\n\nthe privacy of the appellants but the Trial Court committed an\n\nerror in coming to the conclusion that mere selling of book in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 24</span>\n\n\n\nBengaluru will not cause any injury to the appellants.            The\n\ncounsel for the appellants also brought to notice of this Court\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 20</a> of CPC wherein also the provision says that the suits\n\nto be instituted where defendants resides, cause of action arises\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/175502059/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 20(c)</a> of CPC is very clear that if cause of action\n\nwholly or part arises, suit can be instituted where the cause of\n\naction arose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      25.   I have already pointed out that in the suit, it is\n\nspecifically stated by the appellants that books are sold in\n\nBengaluru, hence, the cause of action arose in Bengaluru also as\n\npleaded. The very contention of the respondents that Delhi High\n\nCourt distinguished the same.       The counsel also submits that\n\nboth <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_50\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_51\">20</a> of CPC are distinct. But it is an admitted\n\nfact that <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 20</a> of CPC is the addition to <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 19</a> of CPC\n\nand both Sections have to be read conjointly. This Court also in\n\nthe   judgment   referred   supra    by   the   appellants   in   CRP\n\nNo.89/2011 taken note of similar set of facts and in paragraph\n\n12, it is discussed that <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 19</a> of CPC which deals with the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction and also held that where a suit for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  25</span>\n\n\n\ncompensation for wrong done to a person within the local limits\n\nof the jurisdiction of one Court and the defendant resides, or\n\ncarries on business, or personally works for gain, within the local\n\nlimits of the jurisdiction of another Court, it is an option of the\n\nplaintiff to institute a suit either of the said Courts. The counsel\n\nfor the appellants also relied upon other judgment of this Court\n\nin the case of P LANKESH referred supra and brought to notice\n\nof this Court paragraphs 9 and 10 wherein also a discussion was\n\nmade   with   regard   to   publishing   and   making   defamatory\n\nimputation said to have been published. In the case on hand also\n\nit is held that first offence may be committed where it is printed\n\nand published and it gets repeated whenever the newspaper\n\ncirculated in other places.    It is also very clear that books are\n\nsold in Bengaluru and circulated in Bengaluru wherein Bengali\n\npeople also residing. No doubt, the respondents relied upon the\n\njudgment of the Delhi High Court which has been relied upon by\n\nthe Trial Court also wherein it is a case of internet material. But,\n\nherein it is a case of publication of book and selling of book and\n\nbooks are sold in Bengaluru.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 26</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">      26.   This Court also in M.F.A.No.4019/2022 referred\n\nsupra categorically held that suit could be instituted either within\n\nthe local limits of the jurisdiction of a Court where the defendant\n\nresides or carries on business or personally works for gain. Such\n\na suit could also be instituted within the local limits of the\n\njurisdiction of a Court where the wrong was done and through\n\nthere is no dispute with regard to the fact that suit could be\n\ninstituted in a Court where the wrong was done, but nothing is\n\ndiscussed by the Trial Court. The fact that book was sold in\n\nBengaluru is not in dispute and the same is circulated within the\n\njurisdiction of the Trial Court. The counsel for the respondents\n\nalso mainly relies upon the judgment of Delhi High Court in case\n\nof ESCORTS LIMITED referred supra and brought to notice of\n\nthis Court paragraph 9 with regard to the jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt. In paragraph 17 also taken note of cause of action arising\n\nin Delhi and publication and damage is at Delhi. Herein, it has be\n\ntaken note of the fact that in whose eyes, the appellants have\n\nbeen defamed and the appellants are entitled to file a suit. It is\n\nnot in dispute that the appellants are allegedly defamed in\n\nselling the book in Bengaluru. Hence<a href=\"/doc/198876472/\" id=\"a_55\">, <a href=\"/doc/198876472/\" id=\"a_56\">the said judgment</a></a> also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                27</span>\n\n\n\ncomes to the aid of the appellants that they have got an option\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 19</a> of CPC and the same has been discussed in\n\nparagraph 32 of <a href=\"/doc/198876472/\" id=\"a_58\">the said judgment</a> also.       Having perused all\n\nthese materials, this Court is of the opinion that the Trial Court\n\ncommitted an error coming to a conclusion that merely because\n\nbook is sold in Bengaluru, jurisdiction does not arise within this\n\nCourt and the same is an erroneous approach when the wrong\n\nwas done in Bengaluru by selling the books and by circulating\n\nthe same in Bengaluru and restricted meaning of <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 19</a> of\n\nCPC with regard to the jurisdiction to file the suit and fails to\n\ntake note of the fact that wrong was done in Bengaluru and also\n\nmade an error in making an observation that book was published\n\nin Bengali language.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"198876472\" id=\"span_33\">27.   This Court already pointed out that in Bengaluru, the\n\nBengalis were also living and selling of the books at Bengaluru as\n\ncontended by the appellants also disrepute the appellants and\n\nthe very contention of the respondents that no wrong was done\n\nin Bengaluru cannot be accepted since books are sold in\n\nBengaluru that too during Durga Pooja.       Having perused the\n\nmaterial on record and also considering the principles <a href=\"/doc/198876472/\" id=\"a_60\">laid down\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                28</span>\n\n\n\nin</a> the judgments referred supra, this Court is of the opinion that\n\nthe very reasoning given by the Trial Court is erroneous when\n\nthe suit is filed for the injunctive relief as well as damages,\n\ndefamation and for compensation, ought to have taken note of\n\nboth <a href=\"/doc/70735214/\" id=\"a_61\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_62\">20</a> of CPC as contended by the counsel for\n\nthe appellants. The contention that where the defendants\n\nresides, the appellants ought to have filed the suit therein\n\ncannot be accepted.    The other contention of the respondents\n\nthat the Court has to take note of the maximum injury and the\n\nsame is not the question to decide in the present case that\n\nwhether it is a maximum injury or minimum injury and the same\n\nis not a ground to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court and the\n\nCourt has to take note of public domain in which the book was\n\nsold and also articles were circulated in Bengaluru but the said\n\nfact has not been taken note of by the Trial Court. In the\n\njudgment of Delhi High Court referred supra which is relied by\n\nthe respondents&#x27; counsel, taken note of internet article and same\n\ncan be viewed. But here is a case of books sold in Bengaluru and\n\nthe same is not the circulation only on internet and whether it is\n\na maximum injury or minor injury is immaterial for consideration\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                   29</span>\n\n\n\nof territorial jurisdiction.     Hence, there is a force in the\n\ncontention of the appellants&#x27; counsel that this Court can interfere\n\nwith the findings of the Trial Court since the Trial Court\n\nproceeded in an erroneous approach in coming to the conclusion\n\nthat it is only in a Bengali language and mere selling of books in\n\nBengaluru does not create any jurisdiction.           Thus, it requires\n\ninterference of this Court. Hence, I answer the above point as\n\naffirmative.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">Point No.2:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">         28.
