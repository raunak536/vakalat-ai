The   plaintiff   throughout   had   been \n\nraising an objection with regard to the authenticity of the CD played before \n\nthe Delhi High Court claiming it to be doctored and also on the correctness \n\nof the events as shown in the visuals.  It is in this background that in order \n\nto   put   an   end   to   this   controversy   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Delhi   High   Court   on \n\n06.05.2010  passed an order in  CM (M) No. 612/2000  directing the Trial \n\nCourt  to  call  for the Micro Cassettes  seized  in  FIR No. 94/2000  dated \n\n27.03.2000 to ascertain if the contents are not different to what was shown \n\nto the Court and then proceed in accordance with law.   Pursuant to the \n\nsame the Ld. Predecessor of this Court had repeatedly summoned for the \n\nsaid   micro   cassette   which   was   never   produced   and   ultimately   on \n\n12.05.2011  Inspector R.K. Ojha  (PW5) personally appeared before the \n\nLd. Predecessor Court when it was for the first time that the Delhi Police \n\ninformed the Court that no such micro cassette was ever seized in   case \n\nFIR   No.   94/2000,   under  <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections   498</a>­A/304/201/34   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>,  State   Vs. \n\nSohaib   Ilyasi.     It   is   in   this   background   that   the   defendants   being   the \n\nProducers   and   Broadcasters   were   directed   to   produce   the   same   in   the \n\nCourt.  Initially the defendants were highly evasive and stated that the same \n\nwas not preserved and had been misplaced/ destroyed during the shifting of \n\nthe office at Mumbai but later on 18.12.2015 they most reluctantly placed \n\non before this Court a soft copy of the &#x27;docudrama&#x27; on the &quot;CP Shoot out \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

The said \n\n&#x27;docudrama&#x27; of the &quot;CP Shootout Case&quot; was then played in the Court in the \n\npresence of the plaintiff and the respective counsels and it was observed by \n\nme that many of the portions of the said copy so produced before me by the \n\ndefendants was found to be erased at places.   The Ld. Counsel for Zee \n\nTelevision pleaded his helplessness stating that as per his information the \n\ndefendants have no other copy of the same and whatever was available, \n\nthey have produced in the Court.  \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">(15)             This being  the background, though the plaintiff disputed the \n\nauthenticity and correctness of the same claiming the same to be doctored \n\nbut     since     despite     best   efforts   no   copy   of   the   original   version   was \n\navailable   with   the   Delhi   Police   as   evident   from   the   proceeding   dated \n\n12.05.2011 when Inspector R.K.

Counsel  for the plaintiff agreed to \n\nproceed on the basis of the version duly admitted by the defendants who \n\nhave   filed   the   soft   copy   before   this   Court.   He   has   argued   that   the \n\ndocudrama does not depict the correct sequence of events which have been \n\ntwisted and distorted only to sensationalize the incident.   He has in this \n\nregard placed his reliance on the charge sheet filed by the CBI in the Trial \n\nCourt  (not  disputed  by  the parties)  on the basis of which the Ld. Trial \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs. M/s.

He has also pointed out that in the \n\ndocudrama   the   plaintiff   has   been   shown   to   be   pulling   out   one   of   the \n\ndeceased   i.e.   Jagjit   Singh   from   the   driver   seat,   dragging   him   and   after \n\nthrowing   him   on   the   ground   pumping   bullets   into   him   and   thereafter \n\nkicking his dead body.  Here, I may note that while paying the &#x27;docudrama&#x27; \n\nin the Court, it has been noticed that after this portion where the deceased \n\nJagjit Singh has been shown to have been killed and his body was shown to \n\nhave   been   dragged   and   the   bullets   have   been   pumped   into   his   chest, \n\nsuddenly the remaining portion where the plaintiff is shown to have kicked \n\nthe dead body has been erased where screen has became blank for about \n\nthree seconds.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">(16)             It is an admitted case of the defendants and never disputed that \n\nwhen   the   docudrama   &#x27;India&#x27;s   Most   Wanted&#x27;   was   scripted,   prepared   and \n\ntelecasted,  the plaintiff was in Judicial Custody, the investigations were \n\ncomplete and the charge sheet in the case had been filed and hence there \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

Therefore,   whatever   harm   was   caused   to \n\nreputation of the plaintiff had already taken place much prior to the airing \n\nof the said episodes of the said serial in question and the airing of the said \n\ntwo episodes in March, 1998 was only re­capitulation of widely publicised \n\nnews and had nothing to do with the maligning or defaming the reputation \n\nor image of the plaintiff, who was already by then charge sheeted by the \n\npolice and appearing before the Court of Law.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_70\">(27)             Sh.

He has also \n\nplaced his reliance on the cross­examination of Satyavir Singh Rathi.  It is \n\nargued that the witness of the defendant Sh. Rajesh Choudhary (DW1) has \n\nduly supported the written statement filed by the defendants.   It is also \n\nargued that in order to establish defamation the complainant/ must prove \n\nfirstly  that   the   act   of   defamation   has   exposed   the   plaintiff   to   hatred, \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

It is also argued \n\nthat the defendant company has only portrayed the true and correct facts \n\nand has not in any manner harmed the reputation of the plaintiff and the re­\n\nenactment of the C.P. Shoot out incident was nothing new and the same has \n\nturned out to be substantial proved/ correct.   It is further argued that the \n\nChannel being a new Channel, such programmes are informative in nature \n\nand are protected under  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19</a> rule 1(a)  of the Constitution of India \n\nand it was simply, a dramatization/ recap of widely published news which \n\nhad occurred almost one year prior to filing of the suit.

In   this \n\nregard,   I   may   observe   that   the  International   Covenant   on   Civil   and \n\nPolitical Rights, 1966 recognized the right to have opinions and the right \n\nto freedom of expression under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 19</a> has been recognized to be the \n\nsubject to the right of reputation of others. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

Reputation is fundamentally a glorious amalgam  \n                  and   unification   of   virtues   which   makes   a   man   feel  \n                  proud of his ancestry and satisfies him to bequeath it as  \n                  a part of inheritance on the posterity. It is a nobility in  \n                  itself for which a conscientious man would never barter  \n                  it   with   all   the  tea   of   China   or   for   that   matter   all   the  \n                  pearls of the sea.

It   is   an   honour   which   deserves   to   be   equally  \n                  preserved by the down trodden and the privileged.  The  \n                  aroma of reputation is an excellence which cannot be  \n                  allowed   to   be   sullied   with   the   passage   of   time.   The  \n                  memory   of   nobility   no   one   would   like   to   lose;   none  \n                  would conceive of it being atrophied.

If   it   were   wholly   free   even   from  \n                  reasonable   restraints   it   would   lead   to   disorder   and  \n                  anarchy. The freedom is not to be misunderstood as to be  \n                  a press free to disregard its duty to be responsible. In  \n                  fact, the element of responsibility must be present in the  \n                  conscience   of  the   journalists.   In  an  organised  society,  \n                  the   rights   of   the   press   have   to   be   recognised   with   its  \n                  duties   and   responsibilities   towards   the   society.   Public  \n                  order, decency, morality and such other things must be  \n                  safeguarded. The protective cover of press freedom must  \n                  not be thrown open for wrong doings. If a newspaper  \n                  publishes   what   is   improper,   mischievously   false   or  \n                  illegal and abuses its liberty it must be punished by court  \n                  of law.  The editor of a newspaper  or a journal  has a  \n                  greater responsibility to guard against untruthful news  \n                  and   publications   for   the   simple   reason   that   his  \n                  utterances   have   a   far   greater   circulation   and   impact  \n                  than   the  utterances  of  an individual  and by  reason  of  \n                  their appearing in print, they are likely to be believed by  \n                  the   ignorant.   That   being   so,   certain   restrictions   are  \n                  essential   even   for   preservation   of   the   freedom   of   the  \n                  press itself.

The fundamental objective of journalism is to \n\nserve the people with news, views, comments and information on matters \n\nof   public   interest   in   a   fair,   accurate,   unbaised   and   decent   manner   and \n\nlanguage.  The media today does not remain satisfied as the Fourth Estate \n\nand has assumed the foremost importance in society and governance.  Such \n\nis the influence of media that  it can make or unmake any individual, \n\ninstitution or any thought.   So all pervasive and all­powerful is today its \n\nimpact on the society.  With so much power and strength, the media cannot \n\nloose sight of its privileges, duties and obligations. However, to enjoy these \n\nprivileges,   to   this   end,   media   is   mandated   to   follow   certain   ethics   in \n\ncollecting and disseminating the information viz., ensuring authenticity of \n\nthe news, use of restrained and socially acceptable language for ensuring \n\nobjectivity   and   fairness   in   reporting   and   keeping   in   mind   its   cascading \n\neffect on the society and on the individuals and institutions concerned. \n\n(66)             These words of Hon&#x27;ble Justice G.N. Ray perfectly encapsulate \n\nthe power of the media not since the present day but all the way back to \n\nbefore independence as well. Back then it served as a fire which united us \n\nall   as   a   countrymen   in   our   fight   to   seek   independence   and   institute   a \n\ndemocratic rule. That role hasn&#x27;t greatly differed in the present day and \n\nage,   while   new   channels   of   media   may   have   emerged,   it&#x27;s   role   as   a \n\nguardian/ watchdog for Democracy continues.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

It is this very statement \n\nwhich lies at the heart of three matters in question. \n\n(68)             As stated in the facts earlier the plaintiff&#x27;s were heading the the \n\npolice   party   that   carried   out   indiscriminate   shooting   over   a   car   with   3 \n\ncivilians in case of mistaken identity, under the assumption of the victims \n\nbeing noted criminals from Aligarh. Hence forth which criminal cases were \n\ninstituted against all the concerned officers and the plaintiff has been held \n\nguilty and accordingly been convicted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(69)             The   defendants   about   ten   to   eleven   months   from   the   said \n\nincident produced and broad­casted a docu­drama under the dais of the title \n\n&#x27;India&#x27;s   Most   Wanted&#x27;   on  17.03.1998.

Thus   a   logical   yet \n\nsuperficial deduction would be that the acts of the defendants by producing \n\nsuch a show are completely merited and on this basis the pleading of the \n\nplaintiff would be dismissed. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">(74)             However it is essential to dig deeper into the circumstances at \n\nhand.

An   aspect   which   can   be   ascertained   from   the \n\ntestimony   of   the  plaintiffs  ,  whereby  they have  been  shown  to  be cold \n\nblooded killers who murdered two innocents without reason and caution. \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

These aspects \n\nas shown in the docudrama were clearly in contradiction to the events as \n\nthey emerged during the investigations and as mentioned in the chargesheet \n\nand later proved in the Trial Court and also upheld by the Delhi High Court \n\nin the appeal and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the SLP.  There was a clear \n\ncut distortion when ACP S. S. Rathi was shown to be hitting the car of the \n\nvictims and thereafter dragging the victims out of the car and kicking the \n\ndead body.  This was a clean attempt to sensitize the event which showed \n\nthis decorated officer of Delhi Police in poor light.

Point 1, 2, 3 of \n\nPart   A   contend   with   issues   of   Accuracy   and   fairness,   Pre­publication \n\nverification and Caution against defamatory writings respectively. The acts \n\nof the defendants are in complete violation of these set recommendations \n\nfor   all   the   acts   that   they   engaged   in  were   poignant   examples   of   not \n\nJournalism instead Sensationalism. Their journalistic endeavors were not \n\nbacked by credible sources nor did they take requisite steps to distance \n\nthemselves via the medium of disclaimers from unwarranted views which \n\nthey have added in their Docu­ drama. The above statement alludes to the \n\nviews of one of the victims(Pradeep Goyal) brother of the Connaught Place \n\nShootout,   one   Sh.   Dinesh   Goyal   whereby   he   states   that   the   plaintiffs \n\ncarried out the shootout for an out of turn promotion. An aspect which \n\nwasn&#x27;t proven back then and has been not been proven in the years since, \n\nthus making his comments mere conjecture.  This was an aspect which the \n\ndefendants   should   have   certainly   looked   into   and   since   they   wished   to \n\nbroadcast the same, a disclaimer distancing the channel,  the program and \n\nall concerned parties from these views should have been issued.  Strangely, \n\nthe examination of the entire episode shows that no disclaimer whatsoever \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs. M/s.

Additional \n\ninternational covenants such as the UNESCO Declaration on Fundamental \n\nPrinciples concerning the Contribution of the Mass Media to strengthening \n\nPeace and International Understanding, to the Promotion of Human Rights \n\nand   to   Countering   Racialism,   Apartheid,   and   Incitement   to   War   are \n\nenshrined on similar principles. However the problem lies herein that these \n\nare mere recommendations with mere persuasive and not binding authority \n\nin regard to our cases. It is the reliance on the mere persuasive nature of \n\nsuch legislative covenants that entities like Defendant No. 4 i.e. Shohaib \n\nIIyasi   and   channels   such   as  Zee TV, flout  these  recommendations  with \n\nreckless abandon due to no fear of any penal provisions being imposed on \n\ntheir person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">(80)             While   the   defendants   may   plead   for   exercise   of   their \n\nFundamental Right <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19</a> rule 1(a) of the Constitution of India, which \n\nis   Right   to   Freedom   Of   Speech   and   Expression.

The defendants have however taken no such care to \n\nprotect   their   identities   instead  have   gone  two  steps   further  by  not   only \n\ndepicting fraudulent and unnecessarily graphic construction of the actual \n\nevents but also naming and showing photographs of the plaintiffs, along \n\nwith hiring look­alike actor for dramatic effect.

Thus posing the question as to why only \n\nshould they be penalized and not others. The answer to which lies in the \n\nfact that unlike other   publications   there wasn&#x27;t any misappropriation or \n\ndistortation of the content as it was done by the defendants in this case. \n\nThe plaintiff S.S. Rathi in his cross­examination has specifically deposed \n\nthat   the  others   did   not   twist,   distort   and   sensitize   the   way   the \n\ndefendants did but only put forth the facts as they emerged during \n\ninvestigations and in the chargesheet.

In tune of the idea of broadcasting information which is \n\nnot   only   fraudulent   and   exaggerated   to   a   certain   extent,   to   millions   of \n\nhouseholds. As well as being well aware of the ramifications it can have is \n\nnot just a mere legal violation but also humanitarian one as well. Rather I \n\nwould go as far to say that it serves as an underhanded attempt to subvert \n\nthe legal proceedings against the plaintiff in their criminal matter.  Thereby \n\nit wouldn&#x27;t be an extension to state that it serves as an attempt to deprive \n\nthem of their constitutional  Right to Equality before Law i.e. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 14</a> of \n\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1596139\" id=\"span_109\">(85)             The   objective   behind   the   aforementioned   discussion   was   to \n\nelucidate the relationship between the media and the legal realm. As the 4th \n\nEstate,   the  media  is   supposed  to function in consonance  with the other \n\norgans of the government to provide and promote for a system of checks \n\nand   balances   for   the   democratic   structure   to   appropriately   function. \n\nHowever too often in our nation&#x27;s legal history have we  seen an adverse \n\nimpact of the relationship between legal proceedings and media.

What is essential to note in this case is the \n\nmedia   campaign   launched   by   Blitz   magazine   upholding   the   honorable \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

While   the   judiciary   ultimately   did   not   fall   prey   to   such   tactics \n\n(although the jury voted in favor of his release), the executive ultimately \n\nbuckled and granted judicial pardon to the accused. \n\n(86)             In the case at hand, the flow of events   as mentioned <a href=\"/doc/1596139/\" id=\"a_79\">in <a href=\"/doc/1596139/\" id=\"a_80\">the \n\nabove case</a></a> are to the contrary.

To   defend   their \n\nactivities, the defendants have even portrayed oneself as an agency which \n\nassists  law enforcement agencies to catch criminals , however promotion \n\nof such kind of unregulated vigilantes is bound to cause more harm than \n\ngood.   Neither   the   police   nor   any   governmental   or   statutory   body \n\nrecognizes their presence and with good reason as one can conclude in \n\nwake of the events of this case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">(87)             Contestations regarding the plaintiffs being deemed as &quot;India&#x27;s \n\nMost Wanted&quot;, appear to be inaccurate on the basis of the video graphic \n\nevidence furnished.

Firstly, that Sub section (4) of 65<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_81\">B of the Indian \n\nEvidence   Act,   1872</a>   which   lists   down   non­technical   qualifications \n\nconditions   as   required   to   ascertain   the   authenticity   of   the   electronic \n\nevidence.

I further \n\nnote   that   during   the   hearing   of   this   matter   before   the   High   Court,   the \n\ndefendants furnished the video graphic evidence only for them to take it \n\nback while they were supposed to deposit it to the court. While they only \n\nfurnished the video graphic evidence after repeated notifications were sent \n\nto   the   defendants   about   the   same.   Upon   reading   of   <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_84\">Section   106</a>   of   the \n\nIndian   Evidence   Act,   1872   in   accordance   with   the   above   information   , \n\nwhich states that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any \n\nperson,   the   burden   of   proving   that   fact   is   upon   him.   Here   ardent \n\nconcealment of information for a protracted period of time along with the \n\nnon ­ furnishing of required document/ certificate puts forward the burden \n\nof   proof   on   the   defendants.   A   further   reading   of   <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_85\">Section   114</a>   of   the \n\nEvidence Act which contends with the   Court presuming the existence of \n\ncertain facts ultimately leads me to reach the conclusion that not only has \n\nthe video graphic evidence has been doctored, a fact which is reflected by \n\nthe   technical   difficulties/   blots   which   appear   on   viewing   the   Video \n\n(something which can be confirmed by a videographer expert) and the non­\n\nprovision of the required certificate only provide for further basis against \n\nthe defendants. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">(90)             On examination of evidence PW1 to PW3, one can clearly see \n\nthe decorated tenure of   the plaintiff S.S.

But on \n\nperusing   through   the  all  the commendations and awards as received  by \n\nPlaintiffs, it is clear that these men were highly decorated officers of the \n\npolice and not mere cronies/ hardened criminals. Nevertheless the acts as \n\ncarried out warrant punishment as the blood of innocents was spilt albeit \n\n&#x27;mistakenly&#x27;   and   of   present   there   is   no   such   law   protecting     law \n\nenforcement agencies in case of wrong­doing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">(91)             Thus   this   farcical   media   campaign   that   was   initiated   by   the \n\nactions of the defendants, begs forward the question Have these officers \n\nnot faced enough?. As I stated above these were highly decorated officers \n\nof the police force who time and again would put their lives on the line to \n\nprotect the innocent citizens of their country.  Furthermore, in accordance \n\nwith   the   criminal   proceedings   the   plaintiff   was   accorded   Life \n\nimprisonment.   This   leads   me   to   the   conclusion   that   the   actions   of   the \n\ndefendants have not only lead to violation of their fundamental rights but \n\nalso resulting in unequal detriment suffered upon the plaintiffs. Contractual \n\nlaw   pervades   the   theory   of   Unjust   Enrichment   whereby   one   person \n\nis unjustly or   by   chance is   enriched at   the   expense   of   another. \n\nExtrapolating this treatise  to our case, the plaintiffs have already received \n\ntheir due punishment  as ordained by the criminal proceedings, but is it \n\nnecessary for their reputation to be further maligned  by misappropriating \n\nfacts merely because they committed  a crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

Taking a cue from \n\nthe United states of America or United Kingdom who have legislations \n\nsuch   as   the   Law   Enforcements   Officers   Bill   of   Rights   (LEOBR   or \n\nLEOBoR) in the U.S.A or the Health and Safety at Work etc, Act. 1974 \n\nand guidelines as mentioned in Operation Kratos in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe   former   brought   about   in   wake   of   the   case   of  Garrity   Vs.   New  \n\nJersey, reported   in  385   U.S.   493(1967)  providing   for   an   ideologue   for \n\nQualified immunity ( protection granted upon meeting of certain conditions \n\n­ Webster Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of \n\nNarcotics, 403 U.S. 388) and privileged immunity (absolute protection) to \n\nfederal   agents.   The   latter   legislation   is   from   the   U.K.   and   was   used \n\nmoreover as a proxy mechanism for police to evade the legislation in the \n\ncase of infamous killing of Jean Charles De Menezes by the London Police \n\nin 2005. This legislation which is more of a general set of guidelines for \n\nvarious public functions was employed to provide compensation   to the \n\naggrieved party in this case. However, this is a debate which needs to be \n\nexamined with caution seeing the nature of  law enforcement agencies and \n\nthe power they exercise ­ rightly or wrongly so. Nevertheless, in wake of \n\ncontinued   acts   like   in   the   case   at   hand   it   is   certainly   an   aspect   worth \n\nconsideration particulalry when the Apex Court of our Country in a recent \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Satyaveer Singh Rathi Vs.

A sudden  \n\ndecision to do something under authority or the purported exercise of such  \n\nauthority may not necessarily be predetermined except for the purpose for  \n\nwhich the official proceeds to accomplish. For example, while conducting  \n\na raid an official may not have the apprehension of being attacked but  \n\nwhile performing his official duty he has to face such a situation at the  \n\nhands   of   criminals   and   unscrupulous   persons.   The   official   may   in   his  \n\ndefence perform a duty which can be on account of some miscalculation or  \n\nwrong information but such a duty cannot be labelled as an act in bad  \n\nfaith unless it is demonstrated by positive material in particular that the  \n\nact   was   tainted   by   personal   motives   and   was   not   connected   with   the  \n\ndischarge   of   any   official   duty.  Thus,   an   act   which   may   appear   to   be  \n\nwrong or a decision which may appear to be incorrect is not necessarily a  \n\nmalicious act or decision. The presumption of good faith therefore can  \n\nbe dislodged only by cogent and clinching material and so long as such a  \n\nconclusion is not drawn, a duty in good faith should be presumed to have  \n\nbeen   done  or  purported   to  have been  done  in   exercise   of  the powers  \n\nconferred under the statute......&quot;.
