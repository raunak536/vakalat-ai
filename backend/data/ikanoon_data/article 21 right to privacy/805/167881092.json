The issue in the lis need not detain this Court for the\n\nlong or delve deep into the matter. This Court considering the\n\nidentical prayer of masking of the name of the accused, in the\n\nlight of the &#x27;B&#x27; report being filed and &#x27;B&#x27; report accepted by the\n\nconcerned     Court,    in   W.P.No.25557/2023,         disposed    on\n\n28.02.2024, has held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             &quot;9. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute.\n      The petitioner is alleged of exchanging lewd messages\n      with the daughter of the complainant. Therefore, the\n      crime comes to be registered in Crime No.105 of 2021.\n      The police conduct investigation and in the detailed final\n      report would opine that it was a false case and,\n      therefore, &#x27;B&#x27; report is filed. The concerned Court\n      accepts the &#x27;B&#x27; report and closes the proceedings\n      against the petitioner by discharging him of the\n      allegations. The situation is that the petitioner who was\n      once an accused becomes blame free today.               The\n      charge sheet itself was not filed against him, as the\n      investigation led to filing of &#x27;B&#x27; report. The &#x27;B&#x27; report,\n      even after it being notified to the complainant was not\n      contested and, therefore, the petitioner was discharged\n      on acceptance of &#x27;B&#x27; report resulting in closure of the\n      case. In those circumstances, the name of the petitioner\n      being dubbed as an accused even after the aforesaid\n      circumstance, undoubtedly leads to grave prejudice to\n      the petitioner. He is on a higher pedestal than any of\n      the accused who would get acquitted after a full blown\n      trial. The petitioner, at the threshold itself, is declared\n      to be innocent. The issue is whether the name of the\n      petitioner-accused should be masked in the digital\n      records of this Court. She would submit that the other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      -5-</span>\n                                                    NC: 2024:KHC:14572\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                  WP No. 6504 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n         respondents have already yielded to the request of the\n         petitioner and have masked the name of the petitioner\n         in their records. What remains is only the masking of\n         the name in the digital records of this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                10. The law in this regard cannot be termed to be\n         static, but dynamic. Dynamic, I deem it necessary to\n         observe, as it should evolve like evolution of the\n         Constitution of India, which is a dynamic document. A\n         facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is that\n         every citizen in the country should have a life with\n         dignity; the dignity does get trampled on account of\n         various acts of a citizen. Those acts are punishable after\n         a due process of law. If the result of due process of law\n         is absolving of any person of alleged guilt, those\n         persons become the ones who would get a right to live\n         with dignity, having no blame against them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_7\">11. This Court, in plethora of cases, comes about\n         issues where crimes are registered without any rhyme\n         or reason and lead to quashment of those proceedings\n         in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a> of the\n         Cr.P.C., sometimes on the sole score that it was\n         frivolous or an act of wreaking vengeance, inter alia. It\n         is therefore, after the accused gets blame-free by a\n         process of law, he cannot be seen to be carrying the\n         sword of him being accused on his head, for all his life.\n         Right to oblivion; right to be forgotten are the principles\n         evolved by the democratic nations, as one being a facet\n         of right to informational privacy. Countries like France\n         and Italy, had by themselves evolved the concept of\n         right to oblivion, which dates back to 19th century.\n         Europe, in the European Union has, over privacy and\n         personal data, evolved the principle of right to be\n         forgotten, as a right to be a part of ones right to\n         personality, which encompasses dignity, honour and\n         right to a private life. The aforesaid principles evolved\n         from time to time, can be paraphrased into what could\n         become right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n         of India. It becomes apposite to refer to the judgment\n         of the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_9\">JUSTICE K.S.\n         PUTTASWAMY(RETD) v. UNION OF INDIA1</a>.

The right of an individual to exercise\n      control over his personal data and to be able to control\n      his/her own life would also encompass his right to\n      control his existence on the internet. Needless to say\n      that this would not be an absolute right. The existence\n      of such a right does not imply that a criminal can\n      obliterate his past, but that there are variant degrees\n      of mistakes, small and big, and it cannot be said that a\n      person should be profiled to the nth extent for all and\n      sundry to know.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">             630.

The impact of the digital age results\n      in information on the internet being permanent.\n      Humans forget, but the internet does not forget\n      and does not let humans forget.

The Apex Court observes that the impact of\n         digital age results in information on the internet being\n         permanent. Humans forget, but the internet does not\n         forget and does not let humans forget. Therefore, the\n         soul of the judgment of the Apex Court quoted supra is\n         that the footprints in certain circumstances should not\n         be     permitted      to    remain,    as    it   is    an\n         anti-thesis to right to be forgotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49149701\" id=\"span_15\">12.

Moreover, the court has to draw\na balance between the right to access information, in\ngeneral on the one hand and the petitioner&#x27;s well-\nbeing, mental health, career prospects and prospects in\nlife and family on the other hand. The fulcrum of any\nsociety following the rule of law would be to reform a\nperson and not condemn a person permanently.

It is\n               also worth noting here a point that I shall come back\n               to: a successful delisting request or order in respect of\n               a specified URL will not prevent Google returning\n               search results containing that URL; it only means that\n               the URL must not be returned in response to a search\n               on the claimant&#x27;s name.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">4</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">    [2018] EWHC 799 (QB)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">                        - 15 -</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n                                        NC: 2024:KHC:14572\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                      WP No. 6504 of 2024</span>\n\n\n\n\n       ...                        ...                  ...\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">        101. In my judgment, both versions of the\nargument would fail on the alternative ground that the\nprocessing involved when Google Search makes\navailable third party content that happens to be of a\njournalistic nature is not properly regarded as\nprocessing undertaken &quot;solely&quot; or &quot;only&quot; for journalistic\npurposes, as required by <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 9</a> and s 32. In Google\nSpain, the Grand Chamber indicated at [85] that it did\nnot consider an ISE would process solely for\njournalistic purposes, and although that was not an\nintegral part of the Court&#x27;s reasoning I consider it is\ntrue. I also accept the argument of Ms Proops, for the\nICO that Google&#x27;s approach to the journalism\nexemption is to be resisted because it would have\nconsequences that cannot have been intended by the\nlegislators. The argument, shortly stated, is that the\neffect of ss 3, 45 and 46 of the DPA is to impose\nsevere constraints on the ICO&#x27;s powers of enforcement\nwhere data are processed for the special purposes. If\nGoogle&#x27;s activities fall within that description, it would\nbe able to operate the &quot;right to be forgotten regime&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">without regulatory oversight and control. I consider\nmy conclusions to be consistent with the stricture\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 9</a> of the DP Directive, that Member\nStates may provide for journalistic exemptions &quot;only if\nthey are necessary to reconcile ... privacy with ...\nfreedom of expression&quot; (emphasis added).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">       ...                        ...                  ...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">        165. Behind these competing submissions lie\nsome obvious difficulties. It is not a simple matter of\napplying s 4 of the 1974 Act, without regard to other\nfactor or considerations. Such a hard-edged approach\nwould     be     incompatible     with   human      rights\njurisprudence, and the fact-sensitive approach that is\nrequired. The argument for the ICO, and the argument\nwith which Mr Tomlinson ended up, acknowledge as\nmuch. The Court&#x27;s task is to interpret and apply the\nwill of Parliament as expressed in a statute passed\nsome 25 years before the advent of the internet, to a\nset of facts of a kind that Parliament cannot then have\nforeseen; to do so consistently with the will of\nParliament as expressed via the HRA in 1998; and to\ndo so in the light of the fact that it was not until 2004\nthat the Courts identified the existence of the common\nlaw tort of misuse of private information.

The Queen&#x27;s Bench declines to accept the\ncontentions of Google for delisting the name of the\naccused therein. The claim of the appellant before the\nQueen&#x27;s Bench, on an allegation of misuse of private\ninformation succeeded. The distilled essence of the\njudgments rendered by the Apex Court and the\njudgment of the Delhi High Court, as also that of the\njudgment of Queen&#x27;s Bench all quoted supra would\nmean that, even an accused who has been discharged\nor acquitted honourably by a competent Court of law\nhas a right to live with dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">       17. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\nmandates that no person shall be deprived of his life or\nliberty except in accordance with law.
