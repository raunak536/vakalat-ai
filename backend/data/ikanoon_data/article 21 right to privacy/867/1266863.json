Singhvi, J.\n \n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">1. To some people State is essentially a class-structure, an organization of one class dominating over the other classes; others regard it as an organization that transcends all classes and stands for the whole community. They regard it as a power-system. Some view it entirely as a legal structure, either in the old Austrinian sence which made it a relationship of governors and governed, or, in the language of modern jurisprudence, as a community, &#x27; organized for action under legal rules&#x27;. Some regard it as no more than a mutual insurance society, others as the very texture of all our life. Some class the state as a great &#x27; corporation&#x27; and others consider it as indistinguishable from society itself.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">(Mac Iver, &quot;The Modern State&quot;)\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">2. During recent times, the concept of State has undergone drastic changes. Today, State cannot be conceived of simply as a coercive machinery wielding the power of authority for simply collecting tax or for enforcing law and order. It now carries out multifarious activities affecting the lives of the individuals. State also renders varied kind of services to the people. According to Mac Iver- &quot;if we clearly grasp the character of the State as a social agent, understanding it rationally as a form of service and not mystically as an ultimate power, we shall differ only in respect of the limits of its ability to render service.&quot;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3. Part III of the Constitution of India gives a picture of various fundamental rights available to citizens of India whereas Part IV indicates the areas in which the State has to render service to the people in general and the weaker sections in particular.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4. The interplay of part III and part IV has been considered by the Courts in various decisions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"149321\" id=\"span_1\">In one of the earliest decisions-in <a href=\"/doc/149321/\" id=\"a_1\">The State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan, A.I.R.</a> 1951 SC 226 - fundamental rights were held pre- eminent vis-a-vis Directive Principles but since then there has been a perceptible shift in the Court&#x27;s approach to the inter-play of Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. In the Kerala Education Bill, A.I.R. 1958 SC 956 a Special Bench of the Supreme Court speaking through S.R. Das, C.J., while affirming the primacy of Fundamental Rights, qualified in with the following words :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"149321\" id=\"span_2\">&quot;Nevertheless, in determining the scope and ambit of the fundamental rights relied upon by or on behalf of any person or body, the Court may not entirely ignore these directive principles of State Policy <a href=\"/doc/149321/\" id=\"a_2\">laid down in</a> Part-IV of the Constitution but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to give effect to both as much as possible.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">5. In Keshavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala A.I.R. 1973 SC 1461, various Judges constituting the larger Bench expressed themselves on the inter relationship of the fundamental rights and the directive principles. Hedge and Mukherjee, JJ., observed :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> &quot;The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles constitute the &#x27;conscience&#x27; of the Constitution.......... To ignore part IV is to ignore the sustenance provided for in the Constitution, the hopes held out to the nation and the very ideals on which our Constitution is built... There is no anti-thesis between the Fundamental Rules and the Directive Principles.....one supplements the other.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">Shelat and Grover, JJ, in their judgment observed :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"> &quot;Both Parts II and IV....have to be balanced and harmonised.... then alone the dignity of the individual can be achieved.....They (Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles) were meant to supplement each other.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">Mathew, J. while adopting the same approach remarked :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"> &quot;The object of the people in establishing the Constitution was to promote justice, social and economic liberty and equality. The modus operandi to achieve these objectives is set out in parts III and IV of the Constitution, Both Parts III and IV enumerate certain &quot;moral rights. Each of these Parts represents in the main the statements in one sense of certain aspirations whose fulfillment was regarded as essential to the kind of society which the Constitution-makers wanted to build. Many of the articles, whether in Part III or Part IV, represent moral rights which they have recognised as inherent in every human being in his country. The task of protecting and realising these rights is imposed upon all the organs of the State, namely, legislative, executive and judicial. What then is the importance to be attached to the fact that the provisions of Part HI are enforceable in a Court and the provisions in Part IV are not ? Is it that the rights reflected in the provisions of Part III are somehow superior to the moral claims and aspirations reflected in the provisions of Part-IV ? I think not, Free and compulsory education under <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 45</a> is certainly as important as freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 25 -</a> Freedom from starvation is as important as right to life. Nor are the provisions in Part III absolute in the sence that the rights represented by them can always be given full implementation.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Y.V. Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) put the same idea in the following words.-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> &quot;As I look at the provisions of Parts III and IV, I feel no doubt, that the basic object of conferring freedoms on individuals is the ultimate achievement of the ideas set out in Part-IV... May I say that the directive principles of State Policy should not be permitted to become &#x27;a mere rope of sand.&#x27; If the State fails to create conditions in which the fundamental freedoms can be enjoyed by all, the freedom of the few will be at the mercy of the many and then all freedoms will vanish.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">In U.P.S.C. Board v. Harishankar, A.I.R. 1979 SC 65, it was observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> &quot;Addressed to courts, what the injunction (<a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 37</a>) means is that while courts are not free to direct the making of legislation, courts are bound to evolve, affirm and adopt principle of interpretation which will further and not hinder the goals set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy. This command of the constitution must be ever-present in the minds of the Judges while interpreting statutes which concern themselves directly or indirectly with matters set out in the Directive Principles of State Policy.&quot; This is on the view that the &#x27;State&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/784506/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 36</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 12</a> includes the judiciary as well.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">6. In Randhir Singh v. Union of India, A.I.R. 1982 SC 879, the Supreme Court read the principle of &quot;equal pay for equal work&#x27; enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/608806/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 39(d)</a> as a part of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_10\">16</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">7. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1775396/\" id=\"a_11\">Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, (1993) 1 SCC 745, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J., speaking for himself and on behalf of S.R. Pandian, J. made reference to the various previous decisions and observed thus :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> &quot;It is thus well established by the decisions of this Court that the provisions of Parts III and IV are supplementary and complementary to each other and that Fundamental rights are but a means to achieve the goal indicated in Part-IV. It is also held that the Fundamental Rights must be construed in the light of the Directive Principles.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">8. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> speaks of protection to life and personal liberty. <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 41</a> requires the State to make effective provision within the limits of its economic capacity and development for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness etc. <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 47</a> declares that raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among primary duties of the State. These three Articles can usefully be quoted below :-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21.</a> Protection of life and personal liberty: -\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"><a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 41.</a> Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases: The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work* to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 47.</a> Duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and&#x27; to improve public health: The State shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">9. What is the meaning of scope of term &quot;life&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21?</a> Does it merely connote animal existence? Is it confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint or it means some thing more? During the debate in Constituent Assembly, one of its member Shri K.T. Shah presented a lucid paper on the scope of term &quot;life&quot;. He said that expression &quot;life&quot; has a much wider meaning. It does not merely connote animal existence and a continued drudgery through life but it would include one&#x27;s livelihood, reputation and all those finer graces of human civilization which make life worth living.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">10. At this stage, it would be profitable to note the forward march made by the Supreme Court in giving new dimensions to the meaning of expression &quot;Life and personal liberty&quot;. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, A.I.R. 1978 SC 597, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court referred to the following observations of Gran-villa Austin (The Indian Constitution - Corner Stone of a Nation) :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> &quot;These Fundamental Rights and their deep root in the struggle of independence and they were included in the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one day the tree of true liberty would bloom in India&quot;.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">Their Lordships then went on to reject the argument that the expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> should be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping between that Article and <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)</a> and in law depriving a person of personal liberty has to stand the test of Fundamental Rights conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19.</a>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">11. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, A.I.R. 1984 SC 802, a new meaning came to be given to the expression &quot;life&quot;. A three Judges Bench of the Supreme Court observed:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country, assured under the interpretation given to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> by this Court in Francis Mullin&#x27;s case (AIR 1980 SC 849) to live with human dignity, free from exploitation. This right to live with human dignity enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses (e) and (f) of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 39</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_25\">Articles 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_26\">42</a> and at the least, therefore, it must include protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women, and of the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief. These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no state - neither the Central Government nor any State Government - has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials.&quot; The Court went on to observe:-\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;Since the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in clauses (e) and (f) of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 39</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_28\">Articles 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_29\">42</a> are not enforceable in a court of law, it may not be possible to compel the State through the judicial process to make provision by statutory enactment or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials which go to make up a life of human dignity, with concrete reality and content, the State can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation for inaction on the part of the State in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a>, more so in the context of <a href=\"/doc/76145/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 256</a> which provides that the executive power of every State shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that State.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"709776\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/709776/\" id=\"a_32\">Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation, A.I.R.</a> 1986 SC 181, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> came to be interpreted in the context of the provisions contained in the <a href=\"/doc/22122408/\" id=\"a_34\">Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888</a>. The Supreme Court was called upon to answer - whether the right to live includes the right to livelihood. Argument on behalf of the petitioner was that if they are evicted from their slum and pavement dwellings they would be deprived of their livelihood. While upholding the plea of the petitioner, their Lordships observed :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"> &quot;We see only one answer to that question, namely, that it does. The sweep of the right of life conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> is wide and far-reaching. It does not mean merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as, for example, by the imposition and execution of the death sentence, except according to procedure established by law. That is but one aspect of the right to life. An equally important facet of that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can live without the means of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is not treated as a part of constitutional right to life, the easiest way of depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his means of livelihood to the point of abrogation. Such deprivation would not only denude the life of its effective content and meaningfulness but it would make life impossible to live. And yet, such deprivation would not have to be in accordance with the procedure established by law, if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to life. That, which alone makes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life livable, must be deemed to be an integral component of the right to life. Deprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"268805\" id=\"span_5\">13. The same view has been expressed by some of the Judges constituting the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/268805/\" id=\"a_36\">Delhi Transport Corporation v. Delhi Transport Corporation Mazdoor Congress</a>, A.I.R. 1991 SC 101, and D.K. Yadav v. J.M.A. Industries, 1993(4) SLR 126.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">14. In Pt. Parmanand Katara v. Union of India, A.I.R. 1989 SC 2039, a two Judge Bench gave another dimension to the expression &quot;life&quot; when it observed: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\"> &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution casts the obligation on the State of preserve life. The provision as explained by this Court in scores of decisions has emphasized and reiterated with gradually increasing emphasis that position. A doctor at the Government hospital positioned to meet this State obligation is, therefore, duty-bound to extend medical assistance for preserving life. Every doctor whether at the Government hospital or otherwise has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life. No law or State action can intervene to avoid/delay the discharge of the paramount obligation cast upon members of the medical profession. The obligation being total, absolute and paramount, laws of procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which would interfere with the discharge of this obligation cannot be sustained and must, therefore, give way.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1775396/\" id=\"a_38\">Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P.</a> (supra) a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court considered the question - whether right to education is a fundamental right. By a majority judgment, the Supreme Court held that &quot;right to receive education upto the age of 14 years as enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 45</a> of the Constitution of India is a part of right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21&quot;.</a></span> In his judgment Mohan, J., made reference to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_41\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_42\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">, 21</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_44\">, 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_45\">26</a> and observed that&quot; there is no need to provide a right to life in a positive manner because right to life and property inheres in every man and quoted with approval the following observations in Pathumma v. State of Kerala, A.I.R. 1978 SC 771 :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"> &quot;Attempt of the Court should be to expand the reach and ambit of the fundamental rights rather than accentuate their meaning and content by process of judicial construction....

In a series of pronouncements, during the recent years, this court has culled out from the provisions of Part-IV of the Constitution, the several obligations of the State and called upon it to effectuate them in order that the resultant picture by the Constitution fathers may become a reality.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">(Underlying is ours)\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">19. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_62\">Francis C. Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, A.I.R.</a> 1981 SC 746, the Supreme Court elaborated on the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a> and held :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\"> &quot;But the question which arises is whether the right to life is limited only to protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace some thing more. We think that the right to life includes right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it viz., the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about the mixing and commingling with fellow human being. Of course, the magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country, but it must in any view of the matter, include a right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human self.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">20. From the above discussion, it is clear that the Courts have unhesitatingly read the provisions of Part-IV of the Constitution as integral part of various fundamental rights enumerated in Part-Ill of the Constitution. Therefore, it must be held that <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution which declares that raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties as well as <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 41</a> which obliges the State to make effective provision for securing among other things public assistance in cases of sickness and disablement within the limits of its economic capacity and development forms part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is the duty of the State to provide adequate assistance to the people in cases of sickness. Various finer aspects of life would be rendered meaningless if one cannot get adequate medical attention. In fact, providing of medical assistance to sick and disabled is an integral part of the obligations of the State to improve public health. Therefore, every provision made by the State legislature or executive for providing medical assistance will be deemed to have their source in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Articles 21</a><a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_68\">, 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_69\">47</a> of the Constitution and in appropriate case the citizen will be entitled to enforce such provisions and it will be no answer to such a claim that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_70\">Articles 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_71\">47</a> are not enforceable by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 37.</a> After having given effect to the provisions contained in Part-IV of the Constitution, the State cannot back track and deny the benefit of the legislative measure or executive orders passed by it for giving effect to the contents of the Directive Principles of the State Policy, which as already held above, form part of the right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">21. We shall now refer to the administrative instructions issued by the Government on the issue of re-imbursement of medical expenses.

The Division Bench held:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">&quot;There is no reason nor any has been pointed out to restrict the right of the petitioner to get the best Medical treatment available in the country from an Institute recognised by the State Government. Since provision of free medical treatment or reimburse&quot;ment in lieu thereof is a beneficial act of the welfare State for its employees, the rules/instructions have to be construed liberally in favour of the employees, for granting them the relief, rather than adopting a wooden attitude to deprive a person of his due. The respondents appear to have patently used excuses in refusing full reimbursement, when the factum of treatment and the urgency for the same has been accepted by the respondents by reimbursing the petitioner the expenses incurred by him, which he would have incurred in the A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi, We cannot loose sight of factual situation in the A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi, i.e. with respect to the number of patients received there for heart problems. In such an urgency, one cannot sit at home and think in a cool and calm atmosphere for getting medial treatment at a particular hospital or wait for admission in some Government medical institute. In such a situation decision has to be taken forthwith by the person or his attendants if precious life has to be saved.&quot; The Division Bench further held:-\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">&quot;In view of the observations made above, we do not find force in the contention raised by the respondents. It is ridiculous to suggest that for a disease like heart trouble, particularly in the facts and circumstances of this case, the petitioner should have first appeared before the Medical Board and got their prior approval for treatment from a recognised institute. The very defence put forth by the respondents in view of the fact is frivolous. Taking the State&#x27;s contention to its logical end, it would mean that a person who suffers a heart attack, should first get recommendation from the Medical Broad by appearing before it personally etc. before getting himself treated he should first get an approval for treatment from the medical board. In such circumstances as revealed in the instant petition, the petitioner would have never made it to the Medical Board as he in all probability would have died before the medical board could meet and examine him. In such diseases and situations timely medical aid is of paramount consideration.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">We are of the considered view, by reading the instructions dated 8.10.1991 in pith and substance that the instructions do not authorise the respondents to refuse reimbursement as suggested by them. The instructions are meant for human being s and have to be read liberally and with an object to serve the purpose and the persons for whom they are meant. The defence taken by the respondents is nothing else but a frivolous defence which cannot be sustained in the eye of law. The very act of the respondents is arbitrary and an attempt at defeating justice.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"929862\" id=\"span_14\">23. The same issue was again considered in <a href=\"/doc/929862/\" id=\"a_74\">Ravi Mohan Duggal v. State of Punjab</a> and other, 1995(3) RSJ 399, and it has been held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\"> &quot;Once the Escort Heart Institute, new Delhi and Apollo Hospital, Madras are recognised institutions and the Government has authorised the Government servant to go for treatment to these Institutions, the State cannot refuse reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by a Government servant for it is the bona fide duty of the Government to pay for the beneficial act of an employee as it is Welfare State. All the rules and regulations are to be considered in favour of the Government employee liberally and to the benefit of the Government employee and the State is not permitted to have an iron heart in such matters. The State has admitted the full expenditure to have been incurred by the petitioner in both the hospitals. The treatment and urgency for the same has been accepted by the respondents. They no where claimed that such an amount has not been incurred by the petitioner for his treatment. Once the petitioner was suffering from a serious heart attack he could not consult the doctor in Government hospital and sit at his home or wait for the permission of the Government to seek the treatment in a recognised hospital lest that would cause danger to his life and in many cases it could even cause death. In such a situation it was quite justified for the petitioner to take treatment in a recognised hospital and save his life.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">24. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"754689\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/754689/\" id=\"a_75\">K.L. Kohli v. State of Punjab</a> 1995(3) P.L.R. 88, another Division Bench held that one exfacto sanction was given by the Government then mere absence of prior approval of the Medical Board could not be a ground to refuse reimbursement.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">25. In G.S. Randhawa v. State of Punjab, 1995(1) R.S.J. 853, another Division Bench followed the judgment in Sadhu R. Pall v. State of Punjab (supra) and upheld the claim for reimbursement.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">26. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1789374\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/1789374/\" id=\"a_76\">Mrs. Surya Pandit v. State of Punjab</a>, 1995(4) RSJ 670, I had an occasion to deal with the argument raised by the respondents that when approval is granted for treatment in a private recognised institute but the reimbursement is limited to expense which would have been incurred for similar treatment in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the employee cannot get more than that. While rejecting the argument, it has been held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\"> &quot;Once the Government of Punjab has taken a policy decision to recognise the Hospital and Medical Institutes other than All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and others also within the State of Punjab for the purpose of treatment of its employees, there can be no justification for limiting the reimbursement of expenses at the rates of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. May be that the expenses incurred for a heart surgery at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences are less than those incurred for similar operation at Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi or the Apollo Hospital, Madras the employees, who undergo treatment at these institutes and incur expenditure, cannot be denied to claim the total medical reimbursement. Heart ailment is of such a nature which at times requires emergent treatment and, therefore, a patient cannot be expected to wait in the queue for months together for by pass surgery or similar treatment in All India Institute of Medical Sciences. In the very nature of things, the emergency compels the patient to get the treatment at the earliest available opportunity.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">27. We may also take note of the order passed on 2.6.1993 in Civil Petition No. 16145 of 1992 (Dr. Prem Nath Garg v. State of Punjab and others) by which a Division Bench allowed medical reimbursement even where the treatment was taken abroad at Sh. Lukes Hospital, Houston. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"495476\" id=\"span_17\">In Civil Writ Petition No. 13792 of 1993 (<a href=\"/doc/495476/\" id=\"a_77\">K.K. Malhotra v. State of Punjab and Ors.</a>) decided on 10.5.1994, a Division Bench of which one of us (G.S. Singhvi, J.)</span> was a member, the observations made in Sadhu R. Pall&#x27;s case were quoted with approval and it was further observed:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">Although that decision was rendered by this Court in a case where the petitioner had been operated at Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, after issue of Circular dated 8th October, 1991 but in our opinion the observations made by the Court in that case are fully attracted and can appropriately be applied to the case of the petitioner. Thus, we do not find any justification in the Government&#x27;s action to decline full medical reimbursement to the petitioner for the treatment which he received at Apollo Hospital, Madras.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">We would also like to observe that as and when application is made by an employee for receiving medical treatment at a hospital/institute outside the State, the concerned authority must apply its mind with great urgency and take a decision at the earliest so that complications like the one which has arisen in the present case do not arise&#x27; in future and the employees are not compelled to come to the Court for seeking relief in matters like medical reimbursement. The Government authorities must adopt a more rationale and humanist approach in these matters.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">28. In a recent decision in Surjit Singh v. State of Punjab and Ors., JT 1996(2) SC 28, their Lordships of the Supreme Court have also considered the instructions issued on 25.1.1991 and 8.10.1991 after making reference to the various judgments of the Division Benches and Single Benches of this Court including ones to which reference has been made above, the apex Court held:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">&quot;All the aforementioned judgments of the High Court have a common factual basis, i.e. each receipt of the relief from the High Court had in fact been treated in the Escorts and had borne expenses. The other common factor is that the High Court believed each writ petitioner pleading emergency to go to Escorts in the given fact situation. But this factor by itself is not the core of the views of the High Court. Hypothetically, the appellant says, he too may be considered to have been treated in the Escorts, more so, when he is being treated to have been operated upon in AIIMS without actually having been so, and had a choice to go either to the AIIMS or Escorts or Christian Medical, College Madras. The appellant in these circumstances cannot be said to be far too wrong in choosing the Escorts amongst the three recognised hospitals for open heart surgery available in the North. The AIIMS being governmental and the other two being private hospitals.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">XX XX XX XX XX\n \n\nIt is otherwise important to bear in mind that self preservation of one&#x27;s life is the necessary concomitant of the right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, fundamental in nature, scared, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right to self preservation has a species in the right of self defence in criminal law. Centuries ago thinkers of this Great Land conceived of such right and recognised it.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">29. Even though the various judgments of this Court would have been enough for the Government to have accepted the claim made by all the petitioners and similarly situated persons but what has happened is that in a large number of cases, the employees (serving and retired) who have received treatment in the hospitals and institutions recognised by the Government have been forced to seek intervention of the Court for issue of a mandamus to the Government to reimburse the expenses incurred by them. It is disquietening that the Government should have adopted a purely ministerial approach in these matters and where a more humanistic approach should have been adopted, the Government has by and large resisted the claims on hypertechnicalities. It should be a matter of great concern for all those who run the Government that these matters should also come to the Court Frequently inspite of the observations made by a Division Bench of which one of us (G.S. Singhvi, J.) was a party. While allowing the Civil Writ Petition No. 82761 of 1994 (Smt. Devki Rani v. State of Punjab) on 30.8.1994, the Division Bench observed:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\"> &quot;Before parting, we are constrained to point out that it is highly unfortunate that the petitioner had to approach this Court to seek its help by filing a writ petition to get reimbursement of the medical expenses incurred on the treatment of her deceased husband and all this is because of the apathy shown by the officers concerned who are public servants and from whom a better human approach is expected. It is being noticed by this Court that quite often writ petitions are filed to obtain redress in the matter of reimbursement of medical expenses particularly by those who have either retired from service or by the heirs of a deceased official which is a sad commentary indeed on the working style of the concerned departments and particularly of the head of those departments who must own responsibility for the indifference and delays in this regard. We, therefore, direct the Chief Secretary of the State Government to issue necessary instructions to all the departments including the finance department to dispose of all the pending medical reimbursement bills within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and it is further directed that such bills when received in future should also be disposed of expeditiously but not later than three months from the date of receipt thereof by the concerned department.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">30. When Civil Writ petition No. 16570 of 1995 came before the Division Bench on 16.11.1995, the Court issued a notice to the respondents to show cause as to why a direction may not be issued to the Government to decide all pending matters of medical reimbursement. In pursuance of the order dated 16.11.1995, the learned Government counsel produced before the Court a list of cases pending in 57 departments/offices of the Government of Punjab. These lists show that over 20000 cases involving claim of medical reimbursement are pending in the various departments/offices of the Government. In some cases, the claim is for as small amount as of Rs. 10/- and as high as of Rs. 1,75,000/-. These lists also show that some cases of medical reimbursement are pending for last more than six years. In other cases, the duration of pendency is less. Reasons given in majority of the cases are absence of sanction or paucity of funds.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\">31. On our direction, learned Advocate General impressed upon the Government to enhance the medical reimbursement. Consequently, the State Government is said to enhance the amount and vide letter No.l/65/95-2FE.II/1002, dated 29.1.1996, the Government has written to the Advocate General, Punjab, that payment of pending medical reimbursement would be made before 31.3.1996. This shows that the Government has made an attempt to wash off the stigma of not being sensitive in a purely humanitarian matter.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">32. We shall now deal with individual cases, which have come before us.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">CWP No. 16570 of 1995.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">The petitioner retired from service on 28.2.1994. After retirement, he started living at Ludhiana. On 31.3.1994, he felt pain in Chest and was rushed to nearly Khosla Nursing Home. He was referred to the Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana. Angiography test was done at Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, and as a result of this &#x27;Triple Vessels Disease&#x27; was established. He was advised to undergo heart surgery. The petitioner incurred expenses of Rs. 19,097/- for Angiography. Again in May, 1994 he felt breathing trouble and acute pain in chest while he was in Delhi. He was admitted in the Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi, and was operated for heart. He is said to have incurred Rs. 1,64,137/-. The petitioner submitted application for reimbursement and after having been convinced about the futility of his efforts to persuade the authorities to reimburse the expenses incurred by him, he has knocked the doors of the Court.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">C.W.P. No. 14120 of 1995 :\n</p> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">This petition has been filed for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the petitioner for the replacement of knee joint of his wife, Smt. Rajinder Kaur. It is alleged in the writ petition that his wife remained an indoor patient at Post Graduate Institute of Medial Science and Research, Chandigarh, from 2.9.1993 to 31.10.1993 for replacement of knee joints. It is further stated that a sum of Rs. 1,33,657.25 was incurred on her treatment. The petitioner submitted his bills and by the time of filing of the writ petition, the Government had sanctioned only a sum of Rs. 40,000/-. The petitioner made representation against the denial of total medical reimbursement. During the pendency of the writ petition, learned Government Advocate made a statement that the total amount of expenses incurred by the petitioner for treatment of his wife has been sanctioned.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">C.W.P. No. 15705 of 1995:\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">While serving as Sub-Inspector (CID), the petitioner developed heart ailment. He underwent angiography at the Escort Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, in March, 1993 and was operated for by pass surgery in May/June, 1993. He submitted bill for reimbursement of Rs. 1,62,642.10 but no steps have been taken by the respondents to reimburse the medical expenses. Letter Annexure P-l dated 6.10.1994 written by the Civil Surgeon, Ferozepur, to the Senior Medical Officer Incharge, Primary Health Centre, Kot Ise Khan, shows that the Government has sanctioned his treatment only at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, and therefore, his case cannot be forwarded for reimbursement of expenses incurred for treatment taken at Escorts Heart Institute.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">C.W.P. No. 398 of 1996:\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">While he was serving as Assistant Geologist at Hoshiarpur in the Department of Agriculture, the petitioner was granted permission to go abroad (U.S.) where his brother was living. The petitioner was sanctioned leave between 9.7.1990 and 28.9.1990. Before going abroad, the petitioner got himself medically examined at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana. The petitioner underwent by pass surgery at Bakersfield, California. After return to India, he applied for reimbursement but his bill has not been sanctioned. As per the information furnished by the learned Government counsel, the case of the petitioner was processed at different levels. In its meeting held on 12.8.1993, the Medical Board recommended that ex-post facto permission be granted to the petitioner but reimbursement may be allowed at the rate of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. It has been given out that the matter is still under process.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">C.W.P. No. 959 of 1996:-\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">The petitioner retired as Under Secretary from the Punjab Vidhan Saha Secretariat on 31.12.1992. He was being treated at P.G.I. Chandigarh for heart ailment. While on a visit to New Delhi, he suffered acute pain on his chest and was admitted at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi on 10.4.1995. He applied on 14.4.1995 to the Punjab Vidhan Sabha Secretariat for expost facto sanction for the expenses incurred on angiography and for undergoing heart by pass surgery. He did not receive any communication from the respondents and due to emergency he had to undergo bypass surgery at Escorts Heart Institute on 10.5.1995. Therefore, he submitted his application for reimbursement. The Medical Board granted ex-post facto approval to the undergoing of angiography and bypass surgery, but the reimbursement has been restricted to the rates of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">C.W.P. No. 1010 of 1996:\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">While working as Professor and Head of Psychiatry Department, Medical College, Amritsar, the petitioner suffered massive attach of anterior Myocardiac infarction. The Principal, Medical College, Amritsar, Constituted a Board of three doctors and he was advised to shift to Cardiac Centre for Artery Bypass Surgery. On 7.7.1992, he was referred to the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi. On 17.7.1992, the petitioner applied through Principal, Medical College, Amritsar, to the Director, Research and Medical, Punjab, Chandigarh for approval to get angiography etc. done. His condition deteriorated and he was shifted to the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi. Angiography was done on 29.7.1992 and bypass surgery was performed on 4.8.1992. Thereafter the petitioner submitted his application for reimbursement, but vide letters Annexures P-7 and P-8, the petitioner was informed that the petitioner should have undergone surgery in any nearest Government Hospital with the facility of a coronary care unit. The petitioner applied for review of his case, but no action has been taken by the respondents.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">33. The averments made in these cases go to show that in each of these cases except in the case of Shri D.S. Sandhu, the petitioners had to undergo coronary angiography and/or heart bypass surgery. The time gap between the discovery of heart disease and the angiography and the heart bypass surgery shows that in each of these cases, the petitioners were required urgent medical treatment, At the cost of repetition, we would like to emphasise that the petitioners could not have been made to wait for treatment till the receipt of the formal approval/permission by the Medical Board. In each of these cases except of the case of Gurmail Singh Bhogal, the petitioners have undergone angiography and heart bypass surgery at the Escorts Heart Institute. In two of the cases, even ex-post facto approval has been granted but reimbursement has been ordered to be made at the rates of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. In our considered opinion, there is no reason or justification for the Government to withhold the reimbursement actually in- curred by the petitioners in the recognised hospital. Having recognised the private institute and hospitals for treatment, the Government has no legal justification to say that the expenses would be limited to the rates prescribed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. This back tracking by the Government form its own policy of recognising the private hospitals and institutes for treatment of its employees is wholly unjustified.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">34. In our opinion, in each of these cases, the petitioners are entitled to the reimbursement of actual expenses incurred by them for undertaking angiography and heart bypass surgery at Escorts and other recognised institutions. In case of Gurmail Singh Bhogal, he is also entitled to the expenses equivalent to the expenses which are normally incurred for taking similar treatment at the Escorts Heart Institute. This would be in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court in Surjit Singh&#x27;s case (supra)\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">35. Now the question which needs determination is whether the petitioners are entitled to be paid interest. In most of the cases decided earlier, this Court has awarded interest to the petitioners. This is because the Court has taken the view that the Government and its functionaries have unjustifiably withheld the reimbursement. We do not find any reason to deviate from the earlier decisions. In addition to the reasons given to the decisions to which reference has been made above, we deem it necessary to add that it is extremely agonising for a person to wait for months and years to receive reimbursement of the expenses incurred by him for treatment. The very nature of ailment like heart disease changes the life style of a human being and if he is under mental strain of paying back the amount incurred for medical treatment and the Government, it only increases risk to his life in future. Wholly unjustifiable approach on the part of the Government forcing these persons to approach the Court cannot also be ignored. One can reasonably assume that three months&#x27; time is sufficient for the Government to make an inquiry into the genuineness of the bill submitted by an employee for reimbursement. Therefore, it would be just and proper to direct the payment of interest with effect from expiry of three months&#x27; of the submission of the application for reimbursement.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">36. We also feel that after having taken note of the pendency of large number of cases involving claims of the employee for reimbursement of the medical expenses and having given notice to the Government of this issue, it would be appropriate to issue general directions to the Government to settle the pending claims of reimbursement within a specified time frame so that the employees are not compelled to move this Court for similar relief.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">37. We, therefore, allow the writ petitions and direct that:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">1. The petitioners except Gurmail Singh Bhogal and D.S. Sandhu are directed to be paid the amount of reimbursement incurred by them within a period of three months of the submission of certified copy of this order. Petitioner Gurmail Singh Bhogal is also directed to be paid amount equivalent to the amount which are normally incurred for open heart by-pass surgery at the Escorts Heart Institute, New Delhi. This payment is also to be made within three months.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">2. All the petitioners shall get interest at the rate of 15% per annum.
