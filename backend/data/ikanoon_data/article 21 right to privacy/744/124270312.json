There can be \n\nno   two­ways   about   it.     Hon&#x27;ble   Apex   Court   in   a   number   of \n\njudgements   had   incorporated   number   of   rights,   which   were \n\nconsidered as the most basic rights, to be part of the &quot;right to life \n\nand liberty&quot; of an individual.

He relying upon \n\nthe deposition of the defence witness ie.

I  have  considered  the  submissions advanced and \n\nhave perused the precedents relied upon by Ld.Defence Counsel.  In \n\nthe said judgement itself, it has been held that where the falsehood \n\nis  merely   an  embroidery  to   a  story,  that  would   not   be   enough  to \n\ndiscredit the whole of the witnesses evidence, but if the falsehood is \n\non a major point in the case or if one of the essential circumstances \n\nof   the   story   told   is   clearly   unfounded,   then   that   is   enough   to \n\ndiscredit the witness altogether.  Even otherwise, the maxim falsus­\n\nin­uno,   falsus­in­omnibus,   is   not   of   universal   application.     It   has \n\nbeen held in a number of cases by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court that it is not \n\nexpected from a witness to give the exact and concise version of the \n\nfacts observed and perceived by him.   If in the description of the \n\nactual and material facts, some embroidery has been cast around \n\nthe fabric of facts, then the whole deposition of the witness is not to \n\nbe discarded.  In the present case, the discrepancy has been pointed \n\nout only in the transcription of the tapes.   Transcriptions in itself \n\nare not the material piece of evidence, the same have  been made \n\nonly for the purposes of administrative convenience of investigations \n\nand trial,  as it is not always possible to play the recorded tapes for \n\n\n \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">   C.C.No: 01 / 2011                                                                                                                        Page No.142  of 155</span>\n                                                                                                                                   In the matter of:­\n                                                                                                                    (C.B.I.

Nothing has been \n\nbrought on record by the accused in his defence, so as to establish on \n\nrecord that funds for carrying out this operation were provided with \n\nany   particular   motive   or   intention.     Further   no   link   could   be \n\nestablished   between   the   role   of   Aniruddha   Bahal   in   the   present \n\noperation and his earnings in the form of royalty.   Consequently, I \n\ndo not find any force in this contention of Ld.Defence Counsel that \n\nthe sole motive or intention of Tehelka people behind carrying out \n\nthis operation was to make money. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_583\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_584\">234.

I do not find much waters in these contentions of \n\nLd.Defence Counsel. So far as propaganda of a particular political \n\nparty against the other is concerned, the same is beyond the scope \n\nand  purview  of the  present  adjudication.   Even  otherwise,  it  is a \n\nmatter   of   common   knowledge   that   in   any   healthy   democracy,   a \n\npolitical party raises before  the general public all the contentious \n\nissues   and   the   shortcomings   of   its   rival   party,     for   the   people   to \n\ndecide whom to vote for. The material collected on record does not \n\nsuggest any shortfall in the investigations.  It is a settled principle \n\nof   law   that   for   any   shortcoming   or   doubt   in   the   investigations, \n\nbenefit cannot be given to the accused when all other facts leading \n\nto  the  establishment   of necessary   ingredients of  the  offence,  with \n\nwhich   he   has   been   charged,   are   otherwise   proved   on   record   by \n\ncogent and consistent evidence of the witnesses. \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_588\">236.
