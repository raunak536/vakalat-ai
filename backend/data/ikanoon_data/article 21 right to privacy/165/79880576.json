Charge-sheet\n\n  was filed on 13.06.2023, bearing No. 154/2023, and the trial commenced\n\n  with the prosecutrix&#x27;s examination on 29.04.2024 and cross-examination\n\n  on 11.07.2024. Petitioner is constrained to approach this Court to\n\n  impugn and assail the action of Special Judge (Atrocities), Raipur, in\n\n  respect to case bearing No. 30/2023 (<a href=\"/doc/20575289/\" id=\"a_6\">State v/s Prahlad Rathour &amp; Anr</a>),\n\n  wherein the learned Special Judge has denied permission to defense to\n\n  open/examine the Facebook or Instagram account of the prosecutrix in\n\n  the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, as also, to play the audio\n\n  record concerning the prosecutrix and examine the prosecutrix thereof.\n\n  Therefore, the petitioner is invoking the benign jurisdiction of this Court,\n\n  as the denial of permission deprives the trial of the petitioner and the\n\n  opportunity to effectively challenge the prosecutrix&#x27;s allegations through\n\n  evidence.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2. The brief factual background of the prosecution case is that the\n\n  prosecutrix lodged an FIR against the present petitioner on 28.02.2023\n\n  under <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 294</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_8\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_9\">506</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_10\">376</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/16342935/\" id=\"a_11\">376(2)(n)</a> of the Indian Penal\n\n  Code, 1860. The allegation levelled against the petitioner are that the\n\n  prosecutrix is a Zila Panchayat Member in Baloda Bazar District. The\n\n  petitioner, who is a Food Inspector, first met the prosecutrix at Baloda\n\n  Bazar Collector Office in connection with work related to a Society\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  3</span>\n\n\n\n\nmatter. As per the allegations, the prosecutrix and the petitioner began\n\ncommunicating over calls and grew closer over time. Approximately 18-\n\n19 months later, the prosecutrix came into knowledge that the petitioner-\n\nPrahlad Rathour already married person and had two children. Allegedly,\n\nwhen the prosecutrix confronted the petitioner about concealing this fact,\n\nan argument and quarrel ensued, leading to the severance of their\n\nrelationship. For the next 5-7 months, the petitioner did not communicate\n\nwith the prosecutrix. However, it is alleged that the petitioner continued\n\nto attempt to contact the prosecutrix through various means. As alleged,\n\nthe petitioner later contacted the prosecutrix using his friend&#x27;s phone\n\nnumber and threatened her, claiming he would make obscene videos of\n\nthe prosecutrix public. According to the prosecutrix, the petitioner forced\n\nher to sit in his vehicle (Scorpio) and took her to a Lodge on Kachna\n\nRoad. The prosecutrix managed to delete 4-5 obscene videos of herself\n\nfrom the petitioner&#x27;s phone. Following this, she requested to be dropped\n\nat the bus stand. However, the petitioner refused, stating it was too late\n\nfor buses and suggested they stay at the lodge. This led to a heated\n\nargument and a physical altercation. The prosecutrix alleged that the\n\npetitioner forcibly took her to a lodge, where he blackmailed and\n\nphysically assaulted her. He is accused of tying her hands and legs,\n\ncoercing her, and restraining her until the next day. The petitioner then\n\npromised to drop her at a location but instead drove elsewhere. While\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\n   traveling, he allegedly involved others, including Anita Sahu and Pramila\n\n   Sahu, who, along with the petitioner, physically assaulted the prosecutrix\n\n   and took her belongings. Later, she was allegedly abandoned at Baloda\n\n   Bazar during the night. Later, the prosecutrix lodged an FIR on\n\n   28.02.2023 at Police Station Khamardih, Raipur. The charge-sheet was\n\n   filed by the prosecution on 13.06.2023, bearing No. 154/2023.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3. After the filing of the charge-sheet on 13.06.2023, charges were framed\n\n   against the petitioner, and the trial commenced. As part of the trial\n\n   proceedings, the prosecutrix was summoned to Court for her\n\n   examination-in-chief on 29.04.2024, during which the prosecution filed\n\n   its case and the prosecutrix recorded her statement. Subsequently, the\n\n   prosecutrix was scheduled for cross-examination on 11.07.2024.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4. During the cross-examination of the prosecutrix on 11.07.2024, the\n\n   defence sought the permission to open the prosecutrix&#x27;s Facebook and\n\n   Instagram accounts in the presence essence of the Special Public\n\n   Prosecutor and the defense counsel. This request was made to verify the\n\n   authenticity of certain photographs presented by the defense, which the\n\n   prosecutrix had denied being associated with, alleging they were edited\n\n   and sourced from her social media profiles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5. The defense also requested permission to play an audio recording\n\n   allegedly involving the prosecutrix. The intention was to confirm the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\n  authenticity of the voice in the recording and to question the prosecutrix\n\n  regarding its contents to support the defense&#x27;s case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6. The request of the defense was rejected on the premise that the\n\n  authenticity and chain of custody of the evidence presented were not\n\n  adequately established. Furthermore, the request to access the Facebook\n\n  and Instagram accounts of the victim was also rejected, as no prior\n\n  procedural steps had been taken to authenticate or obtain certified\n\n  records of the social media content in question. Additionally, regarding\n\n  the audio recording, the Court noted that the pen drive containing the\n\n  recording had not been submitted during the investigation and was not\n\n  part of the charge-sheet, rendering its origin and custody unclear. Hence,\n\n  the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that at the outset, the\n\n  petitioner has an inherent and constitutionally protected right to ensure\n\n  that the trial conducted against him does not violate the principles of\n\n  fairness and justice as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">, 19</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> of the\n\n  Constitution of India. The evidence sought to be introduced is relevant as\n\n  per the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and directly pertains to the\n\n  Issues raised during the examination-in-chief of the prosecutrix. Its\n\n  Introduction is essential for effectively challenging her testimony and\n\n  assessing her credibility. He further contended that the permission sought\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\nto access the prosecutrix&#x27;s Instagram and Facebook accounts, as well as\n\nto introduce the audio recording, is made in good faith and not to cause\n\ndelay, vexation, or prejudice to the prosecution. He further contended\n\nthat the defence undertakes to provide a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 65B</a> of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872, to ensure the admissibility and\n\nauthenticity of the electronic evidence being sought to be introduced. It\n\nis further contended that Section 351 of the BNSS, 2023 empowers the\n\ncourt to summon, examine, recall, or re-examine any person or evidence\n\nat any stage of the trial if it is essential for the just decision of the case.\n\nThe audio-video evidence sought to be introduced is directly relevant to\n\nthe facts in issue. Under <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 165</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the\n\ncourt has the authority to order the production of any evidence or\n\ndocument that it deems necessary to discover or obtain proof of relevant\n\nfacts. Under <a href=\"/doc/1039145/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 94</a> of the BNSS, the court is empowered to summon\n\nor order the production of any document or thing that it deems necessary\n\nor desirable for the purpose of a fair and just trial.

The Right to Privacy is one of these rights since the right to life in\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is flexibly defined to cover all parts of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      11</span>\n\n\n\n\n   person&#x27;s existence that make their life more meaningful. Respect for\n\n   privacy is regarded as a Fundamental Right of humans in many\n\n   international treaties. It is essential for maintaining human dignity and is\n\n   one of the fundamental components of a democracy. It upholds one&#x27;s\n\n   rights as well as those of other people. Privacy as a concept is not new.\n\n   The divisions in ancient Greece were called Polis and Oikos, or the\n\n   public or political world and the private or familial sphere, respectively.\n\n   The &quot;Right to Privacy&quot;, on the other hand, is a relatively contemporary\n\n   concept. The Right to Privacy is one of these rights since the right to life\n\n   in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is flexibly defined to cover all parts of a\n\n   person&#x27;s existence that make their life more meaningful. The concepts of\n\n   privacy and the Right to Privacy are difficult to grasp. Privacy often\n\n   relates to modern information and communication technologies and is\n\n   based on the principle of natural rights. The right to privacy refers to our\n\n   ability to protect the space around us, which includes all we own, such as\n\n   our bodies, homes, assets, ideas, feelings, secrets, identities, etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">17.The Right to Freedom should be carefully examined by the Parliament\n\n  and the Supreme Court, and a means for balancing the conflicting rights\n\n  to privacy and freedom of expression should be developed. In the digital\n\n  age, data is a valuable resource that shouldn&#x27;t be unregulated. This\n\n  situation indicates that India&#x27;s time for a robust data protection regime\n\n  has come. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> states that a person&#x27;s right to privacy is essential to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                     12</span>\n\n\n\n\n    their right to personal freedom. Rights to privacy are not unqualified.\n\n    They are subject to reasonable restrictions for the defence of crimes, the\n\n    welfare of the weak, morality, or the defence of other human rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions\n\n    advanced by the learned counsel for the parties, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n    Constitution, judgment passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and other\n\n    related materials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">19. Reverting to the factual matrix attending the instant case, perusal of the\n\n    record would show that during cross-examination of the prosecutrix, the\n\n    learned defense counsel submitted that the prosecutrix was denying the\n\n    fact that she is living with the accused-Prahlad and his family members\n\n    in all the photographs filed by them in the Court and the prosecutrix has\n\n    stated that her photo has been edited in all the above photographs, it is\n\n    possible that her photo has been taken from her Facebook or Instagram\n\n    ID and edited. Therefore, permission was sought in the Court in the\n\n    presence of the Special Public Prosecutor and the defense counsel to\n\n    open and see her Facebook or Instagram ID. Considering the facts and\n\n    circumstances of the case, the trial Court finds that it does not seem\n\n    appropriate to access and view the Facebook or Instagram account of the\n\n    prosecutrix in the Court, hence permission to access and view the\n\n    Facebook or Instagram account of the victim was not granted. In view of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                      13</span>\n\n\n\n\n    the above, in the opinion of this Court, the learned trial Court has rightly\n\n    rejected the prayer to access and view the Facebook or Instagram\n\n    account of the prosecutrix in the trial Court. If permission is granted to\n\n    examine the Facebook or Instagram account of the prosecutrix as also to\n\n    play the audio record concerning the prosecutrix, then privacy of the\n\n    victim may be compromised. The objection taken by the prosecutrix is of\n\n    violation of her right to privacy while the objection taken by the\n\n    prosecution is that the accused has no right to seek permission to\n\n    examine the Facebook or Instagram account of the prosecutrix as also to\n\n    play the audio record concerning the prosecutrix.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">20. From the above stated case laws, it is apparent that the above stated\n\n    contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be\n\n    examined by this Court. The adjudication of questions of facts and\n\n    appreciation of evidence or examining the reliability and credibility of\n\n    the version, does not fall within the arena of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n\n    482</a> of the Cr.P.C. (now Section 528 of BNSS). In view of the material\n\n    on record, it cannot be held that the impugned proceedings in Case\n\n    No.30/2023 are manifestly attended with malafide and maliciously\n\n    instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused\n\n    and with a view to spite them due to private and personal grudge.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                       14</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">   21.
