Regulation 855 provides that where  on  infor-\nmation\t the   District\t Superintendent\t believes   that   a\nparticular  individual is leading a life of crime,  and\t his\nconduct\t shows a determination to lead a life of crime\tthat\nindividual&#x27;s  name  may\t be ordered to\tbe  entered  in\t the\nsurveillance register, and he would be placed under  regular\nsurveillance.\t  Regulation   856   provides\tthat\tsuch\nsurveillance,  inter alia may consist of domiciliary  visits\nboth  by day and night at frequent but irregular  intervals.\nIt  was contended that, (1) the Regulations were not  framed\nunder any provision of the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_4\">Police Act</a>, and (2) even if\tthey\nwere  framed  tinder  s.  46(2)\t of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_5\">Police  Act</a>,\t the\nprovisions  regarding  domiciliary  visits  offended   Arts.\n19(1)(d) and 21.\nDismissing the petition,\nHELD : (1) The Regulations were framed under<a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_6\"> s. 46(2)(c)</a>  of\nthe  Police  Act and have the force of law.   The  paragraph\nprovides that the State Government may make rules  generally\nfor  giving effect to the provisions of the Act; and one  of\nthe  objects  of  the Act is to prevent\t the  commission  of\ncrimes.\t  The  provision  regarding  domiciliary  visits  is\nintended  to prevent commission of offences, because,  their\nobject is to see if the individual is at home or gone out of\nit for commission of offences. [949 F-G, H-950 A]\n(2) (a) Too broad a definition of privacy will raise serious\nquestions  about  the propriety of judicial  reliance  on  a\nright  that is not explicit in the Constitution.  The  right\nto privacy will, therefore, necessarily, have to go  through\na process of case by case development.\tHence, assuming that\nthe  right  to personal liberty. the right  to\tmove  freely\nthroughout  India  and\tthe  freedom  of  speech  create  an\nindependent  fundamental  right of privacy as  an  emanation\nfrom  them it could not he absolute.  It must be subject  to\nrestriction on the basis of compelling public interest.\t But\nthe  law  infringing it must satisfy  the  compelling  state\ninterest test. [954 B-C, H-955 B; 956 B-C]\n(b)  Drastic  inroads directly into privacy  and  indirectly\ninto fundamental right will be made if the Regulations\twere\nto be read too widely.\tWhen there are two  interpretations.\none  wide and unconstitutional, and the other  narrower\t but\nwithin constitutional bound,;, the Court will read down\t the\nover  flowing expressions to make them valid. [955 D-E;\t 956\nG]\n(c)  As the Regulations have force of law, the\tpetitioner&#x27;s\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Art. 21</a> is not violated. [955 H]\n(d)  It\t cannot\t be said that  surveillance  by\t domiciliary\nvisit-, would always be an unreasonable restriction upon the\nright  of privacy.  It is only persons who are suspected  to\nbe habitual criminals and those who are determined to lead a\ncriminal  life\tthat  are  Subjected  to  surveillance.\t  If\n&#x27;crime&#x27; in this context is confined to such acts as  involve\npublic peace or security, the law imposing such a reasonable\nrestriction must be upheld as valid. [956 C-D, F-H]\n[Legality  apart,  these  regulations  ill-accord  with\t the\nessence\t of personal freedoms and the State will do well  to\nrevise these old Police Regulations.  Domiciliary visits and\npicketing  by the police should be reduced to  the  clearest\ncases  of community security and should not  become  routine\nfollow\tup at the end of a conviction or release from  jail,\nor at the whim of a police officer.] [957 A-C]\n947\nKharak\tSingh v.
