The Office Note dated 04.08.2023 shows that the learned Trial Court&#x27;s\nrecords have arrived.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3. This is an appeal against the judgment dated 26.07.2022 passed by the\nlearned Sessions Judge, Bongaigaon in Sessions Case No.49(M)/2018 convicting\nthe appellant under <a href=\"/doc/455161/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 376(1)</a> IPC and sentencing him to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for 12 (twelve) years with a fine of Rs.50,000/-, in default to\nundergo simple imprisonment for 1 (one) year.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4. The appellant, who was 24 years old has been convicted on the ground of\nhaving raped a woman of 48 years, resulting in the birth of a child. Though the\nappellant had filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/985477/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 389</a> Cr.P.C. for suspension of the\nsentence and release of the appellant on bail, vide I.A.(Crl.) No.160/2023, this\nCourt had dismissed the said I.A.(Crl.) No.160/2023, vide order dated\n10.10.2023 by holding that unless and until a DNA test/profiling of the appellant\nwas done, it would not be proper to suspend the sentence and release the\nappellant on bail.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5. This Court had, during the pendency of I.A.(Crl.) No.160/2023, directed the\nappellant&#x27;s counsel to obtain instructions as to whether the appellant was willing\nto undergo a DNA test to verify whether he was the father of the child that had\nbeen born to the victim. However, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nhad stated on 10.10.2023 that the appellant was not willing to undergo a DNA\ntest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                                                                     Page No.# 3/17\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">6. The question that arose was whether this Court could direct the appellant to\nundergo a DNA test, to prove whether he was the father of the child born to the\nvictim and which in turn would prove as to whether he was the rapist of the\nvictim.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that this Court cannot\ncompel the appellant to undergo a DNA test without his consent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_1\">In this regard\nthe learned Senior Counsel submits that in terms of the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_3\">Goutam Kundu Vs. State of West Bengal &amp;\nOthers</a>, reported in 1993 3 SCC 418, Courts in India cannot order a blood\ntest as a matter of course. He submits that the Apex Court has held that the\nCourts have to carefully examine the consequence of ordering a blood test and\nno one can be compelled to give his/her sample of blood for analysis.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.    The learned Senior Counsel submits that the evidence adduced by the\nprosecution does not prove that the appellant was the rapist of the victim or\nthat the appellant was the father of the victim&#x27;s child. In this respect, he has\nreferred to the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, especially the\nevidence given by the victim in her cross-examination, wherein she has stated\nthat she came to know the name of the appellant only when the case was filed\nand that she had not seen the face of the person who raped her on the relevant\nnight, due to darkness. He also submits that as the FIR had been filed after 6/7\nmonths after the alleged rape had been committed, the same cast a doubt on\nthe authenticity of the contents of the FIR.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.   On the other hand, the Additional Public Prosecutor submits that the victim\nwas mentally ill and unable to recall previous incidents, as given in the\n                                                                       Page No.# 4/17\n\ntestimony of PW-1. She also submits that the victim was 48 years of age and\nthe appellant was 24 years of age. Further, though a bichar (village meeting\nunder the aegis of the elder of the village) had been held in the village on 2\n(two) occasions, due to the alleged illegal act of the appellant, the appellant did\nnot turn up in the bichar held on the 2 (two) occasions. She submits that\nthough the evidence of the prosecution witnesses proved the guilt of the\nappellant, the appellant should be subjected to a DNA test to conclusively prove\nthe said fact.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">11. The question to be decided is as to whether the appellant had raped the\nvictim and whether the child born to the victim had been fathered by the\nappellant, as it has been alleged that the child was the result of the rape. As\nstated earlier, an issue has cropped up as to whether a DNA test could/should\nbe done on the appellant and the child, so as to determine whether the\nappellant had fathered the child, besides considering the evidence that has\nalready been recorded by the learned Trial Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_2\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_4\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra), the Supreme Court was seized\nof an issue, wherein the paternity of a child between a married couple was\ndisputed. The alleged father (husband) of the child prayed for a Blood Group\ntest of the child and himself to prove that he was not the father of the child.\nThe application was dismissed on the ground that there were other methods in\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_5\">Evidence Act</a> to prove the paternity of the child and that the Blood Group\ntest could not conclusively prove the paternity of a child. The Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_6\">in\n<a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_7\">the above case</a></a> held that though a Blood Group test was a useful test to\n                                                                      Page No.# 5/17\n\ndetermine the question of disputed paternity, it could be relied upon by the\nCourts as a circumstantial evidence, which ultimately excluded a certain\nindividual as a father of the child. The Supreme <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_8\">Court further held</a> that in terms\nof <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, the presumption of legitimacy of a child,\nwith regard to the father is that a child born of a married woman is deemed to\nbe the legitimate child of a husband and would remain so, even if the child was\nborn within 280 days after dissolution of a marriage and the mother remain\nunmarried, unless it could be shown that the parties to the marriage had no\naccess to each other at any time, when the child could have been begotten.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_3\">It\nwas in the above context that the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_10\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra)\nheld that the Courts in India cannot order a blood test as a matter of course. It\nthus held as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;(1) That courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (2) Wherever applications are made for such prayers in order to have\n     roving inquiry, the prayer for blood test cannot be entertained.\n     (3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband must\n     establish non-access in order to dispel the presumption arising under\n     <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be the\n     consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it will have the effect of\n     branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste woman.\n     (5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_4\">13. The paternity test that was sought to be done by the alleged father in\n<a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_12\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) was a Blood Group test and not a DNA profiling/test,\nwherein DNA rich cells are extracted. On the other hand, Blood Group test\n                                                                       Page No.# 6/17\n\nexamines the Blood type of a person. As per the medical literature existing\ntoday with regard to DNA test and Blood test, perhaps the greatest difference\nbetween a Blood Group test and a DNA test is that a Blood Group test cannot be\nused as conclusive proof of fatherhood. It can only be used to disprove\nparentage and not to prove that the individual is the father of the child. The\nDNA test on the other hand, is a very reliable test, which is based on different\nparameters than a Blood Group test.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">14.   With the incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC w.e.f. 23.06.2006, DNA test\ncan be done to facilitate the prosecution, in proving it&#x27;s case against an accused.\nThough it may be argued that right to privacy is a part of the right to life and\npersonal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> and that <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20(3)</a> provides that nobody\nshould be compelled to give evidence against himself, we are of the view that\nthe said would not over-ride the search for the truth, as the offence of rape is\nan offence against the society at large and as the objective of a Court\nproceeding is to find out the &quot;truth&quot;. We are accordingly of the view that the\nappellant&#x27;s right under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_16\">Articles 20(3)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">&amp; 21</a> would have to give way to public\ninterest, so that the truth is laid bare for all to see.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41352099\" id=\"span_5\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/41352099/\" id=\"a_18\">Harishchandra Sitaram Khanorkar Vs.

DNA conclusively\npoints the finger of guilt towards the perpetrator of a crime. However, while\nconsidering this scientific piece of evidence, the Court is required to examine as\nto whether at any point of time, it could be said that there was the slightest\nchance of playing with the samples and/or tampering with it by anyone.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68696327\" id=\"span_7\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/68696327/\" id=\"a_20\">Mukesh Vs.

DNA technology as a part of Forensic Science and scientific\n      discipline not only provides guidance to investigation but also supplies the\n      court accrued information about the tending features of identification of\n      criminals. The recent advancement in modern biological research has\n      regularized Forensic Science resulting in radical help in the administration\n      of justice. In our country also like several other developed and developing\n      countries, DNA evidence is being increasingly relied upon by courts.

This is all the more important to\n      remember, given that even though the accuracy of DNA evidence may be\n      increasing with the advancement of science and technology with every\n      passing day, thereby making it more and more reliable, we have not yet\n      reached a juncture where it may be said to be infallible.

The above cases show that there is no bar or restriction in having a DNA\nprofiling of an accused in a case of rape. In the present case, not only is there\nan allegation of rape against the appellant, but the appellant has been accused\nof being the father of the child born due to the rape inflicted by the appellant. It\nis quite clear that DNA profiling of the appellant could prove whether the\nappellant was the father of the child born to the victim. As <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC\nallows for examination of a person accused of rape through DNA profiling on the\nrequest of a Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector, we do not find\nany bar or restriction for this Court to pass a direction for DNA profiling of the\nappellant, which would prove whether the appellant was the father of the child\nand thus further prove the question whether any rape had been committed on\nthe victim by the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">                                                                      Page No.# 14/17\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">29. Now let us see whether DNA profiling can be done in civil cases, wherein\npaternity of a child between couples is in question.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">30.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_17\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_43\">Bhabani Prasad Jena Vs. Orissa State Commission</a>\nfor Women, reported in 2010 8 SCC 633, the Supreme Court has held that\ndepending on the facts and circumstances of a case, it would be permissible for\na Court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to determine the paternity of\na child. However, the Court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the\ninterests of the parties and on due consideration whether for a just decision in\nthe matter, DNA test is needed. Thus, in a case relating to the charge by the\nhusband regarding the alleged infidelity of the wife, the same could be ordered\nby the Court depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">31. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_18\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_44\">Dipanwita Roy Vs. Ronobroto Roy</a>, reported in 2015 1\nSCC 365, the Apex Court has allowed the DNA test to be done with regard to\nthe paternity of the child born to his wife, to establish whether or not the\nhusband was the father of the child, so as to prove the alleged infidelity of the\nwife. It also held that in view of the issue involved <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_45\">in <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_46\">the above case</a></a>, <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_47\">Section\n112</a> of the Evidence Act was not strictly attracted to the case.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">32.   As can be seen even in civil cases regarding disputes with regard to\ninfidelity of the wife and paternity of a child, the Supreme Court has allowed\nDNA test to be done, after balancing the interests of the parties, keeping in view\nthe facts and circumstances of a case. The case in hand is however different, as\nit pertains to a criminal case and in the view of this Court, the right to preserve\nindividual privacy claimed by the appellant, has to give way to the object of\nfinding out the truth, otherwise the same could amount to sacrificing the cause\n                                                                      Page No.# 15/17\n\nof justice. Thus, in criminal cases, the requirement of finding out the truth\nwould over-ride the stand of the appellant, in not agreeing to undertake a DNA\ntest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">33. The present case is with regard to whether the appellant had committed a\ncrime against society, which can be proved by way of a DNA test. We are of the\nview that the principal of proportionality is also in favour of the Court resorting\nto DNA testing, to find out whether a crime had been committed by the\nappellant, keeping in view the allegation made by the victim and the fact that a\nchild has been born.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">34. A perusal of the orders passed by the Supreme Court clearly go to show\nthat DNA test/profiling is useful and helpful in coming to a decision with regard\nto identifying the perpetrator of a crime. The Supreme Court has in many cases\nas <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_48\">referred to above</a>, supported the use of DNA test/profiling. However, it is only\nin respect of civil cases where the paternity of a child is in dispute between the\nmarried couples that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has given words of caution that\nDNA test/profiling should not be done at the drop of a hat, in view of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n112</a> of the Evidence Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31929238\" id=\"span_19\">As stated in the earlier paragraphs, the Supreme Court\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/31929238/\" id=\"a_50\">Sandeep Vs. State of U.P.</a> (supra) has accepted the\nconfirmation that the accused therein was the father of the unborn child, who\nhad died during the murder of a pregnant woman, determined on the basis of a\nDNA test. In the present case, the victim has accused the appellant of raping\nher and making her pregnant. In that view of the matter, we are of the view\nthat the DNA test/profiling would conclusively prove whether the appellant had\nfathered the child and whether he had raped the victim, as he has denied raping\nher.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                                                                      Page No.# 16/17\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">35.   In view of the reasons stated above, we are of the view that additional\nevidence is required to be taken in terms of <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 391</a> Cr.P.C, as DNA test of\nthe appellant and the child born to the victim, would conclusively prove whether\nthe child has been fathered by the appellant and whether the appellant was the\nperpetrator of the rape committed on the victim. Accordingly, we direct the\nlearned Trial Court to take additional evidence under <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 391</a> Cr.PC, by\ntaking steps for ensuring that a DNA test/profiling of the appellant and the child\nof the victim alleged to have been fathered by the appellant, is undertaken,\nafter taking the samples from the appellant and the child in the presence of the\nlearned Judge of the learned Trial Court. In this regard, necessary directions\nmay be issued by the learned Trial Court to the Superintendent of the concerned\nJail to produce the appellant and also to the victim to produce the child. The\nlearned Trial Court shall ensure all precautions are taken at the time of taking of\nsamples from the above persons and making sure the samples are not\ncompromised in any manner. The learned Trial Court shall also ensure that the\npersons/institution which is going to conduct the DNA test/profiling takes all\npossible precautions so that the entire testing procedure is not compromised in\nany manner.
