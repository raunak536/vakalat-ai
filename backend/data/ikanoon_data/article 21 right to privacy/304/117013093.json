This appeal is at the instance of the original writ applicant\n\n     (father of the deceased, whose son, namely, Mohd.

It appears from the materials on record that on 15.11.2021,\n\n      there was an encounter between the militants and police at\n\n      the Hyderpora area of Budgam in Kashmir. Four militants\n\n      were shot dead including the son of the appellant herein. In\n\n      connection with the said incident, a First Information Report\n\n      No. 193/2021 was registered at the Saddar Police Station for\n\n      the offences punishable under Sections 307/120­B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>, 7/27\n\n      of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_4\">Arms Act</a> and 16, 18, 20 resply of the ULA (P) Act.\n\n      During the course of the investigation, the Investigating Officer\n\n      recovered four bullet ridden unidentified dead bodies at the\n\n      site of the encounter. The dead bodies were shifted to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   3</span>\n\f     Police Hospital at Srinagar for the medico­legal formalities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">     After conducting the post­mortem etc., the dead bodies were\n\n     identified as that of a foreign terrorist viz. Bilal Bhai @ Hyder\n\n     @ Saqlain R/O Pakistan, Aamir Latief Magrey S/O Mohammad\n\n     Latief Magrey R/O Seeripora Tehsil Gool Ramban, Altaf\n\n     Ahmad Bhat S/O Abdul Rehman Bhat R/O Old Barzulla\n\n     Srinagar and Dr. Mudasir Gull S/O Ghulam Mohammad\n\n     Rather R/O Parraypora Srinagar. All the four dead bodies were\n\n     shifted to the Handwara Zachaldara for burial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.   The material on record further reveals that the bodies of the\n\n     two out of the four persons killed in the encounter were later\n\n     exhumed and handed over to their relatives for performing\n\n     their last rites at the place of their choice. The bodies of the\n\n     other two persons killed in the encounter i.e. Bilal Bhai @\n\n     Hyder and the son of the appellant herein buried through the\n\n     Auqaf Committee, Wadder Payeen were not disinterred and\n\n     handed over to their respective family members.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">7.   It appears that so far as the deceased, namely, Bilal Bhai, a\n\n     resident of Pakistan is concerned, nobody claimed his body\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  4</span>\n\f     nor was there any demand for handing over of the dead body\n\n     from any quarter. However, it is the case of the appellant\n\n     herein that so far as the dead body of his son Amir is\n\n     concerned, he had approached various authorities with a\n\n     request to hand over the body but none listened to him and\n\n     ultimately the body of his son (deceased) was buried at the\n\n     Wadder Payeen Graveyard. It is his case that he was informed\n\n     by the Police Station at Gool on 16.11.2021 that his son Amir\n\n     had been killed in an encounter in Kashmir and that he\n\n     should   proceed   to   Kashmir    to   identify   the   body.   On\n\n     16.11.2021, the appellant along with his family members\n\n     reached the Police Station at Saddar, where he was told that\n\n     his son Amir Magrey was a militant and was killed along with\n\n     three other associates at the Hyderpora and the dead body of\n\n     Amir had been buried.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">8.   In such circumstances <a href=\"/doc/62131182/\" id=\"a_5\">referred to above</a>, the appellant herein\n\n     preferred the Writ Petition (C) No. 11 of 2022 in the High Court\n\n     and prayed for the following relief:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        “In view of the submissions made herein above and\n        those to be urged at the time of hearing, this Hon’ble\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  5</span>\n\f         Court is humbly requested to direct the respondents to\n         handover the body of Late Mohammad Amir Magray,\n         who was killed in a joint encounter by them on\n         15.11.2021 at Hyderpora area of Budgam in Kashmir to\n         the petitioner who happens to be his biological father on\n         the facts and grounds mentioned above.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">9.    A learned Single Judge of the High Court adjudicated the writ\n\n      application and allowed the same directing the respondents\n\n      herein to make necessary arrangements for the disinterment\n\n      of the body/remains of the deceased Amir Magrey from the\n\n      Wadder Payeen Graveyard in the presence of the appellant\n\n      herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">10.   The learned Single Judge while allowing the writ application\n\n      filed by the appellant herein, held as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         “15. The right of the next of kin of the deceased to have\n         their dear one cremated or buried as per the religious\n         obligations and religious belief that the dead person\n         professed during his life time, is part and parcel of right\n         to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n         India. The parents and close relations of the deceased\n         are well within their right to demand the dead body\n         of their dear one to be cremated or buried as per their\n         traditions, religious obligations and religious belief. This\n         right would also include the choice of the relatives to\n         have the dead body cremated or buried at his native\n         place. It is not uncommon that the graves of the dead\n         are maintained by their relatives and are visited by their\n         relations and close friends to pay respect and homage\n         on certain occasions.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                      6</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\f16. Without dilating much on the issue, it can be said to\nbe well settled that right to life and liberty guaranteed to\na citizen by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia includes right of the citizen to live with human\ndignity and this right to live with human dignity even\nextends after death though in a limited extent. Viewed\nthus, the right of the petitioner to claim the dead body\nof his son for performing last rites in his own way and\nin accordance with local traditions, religious obligations\nand religious faith, which the deceased professed\nduring his life time, cannot be disputed. But the question\nthat needs to be addressed in the context of present\ncontroversy is whether the State can deny this right in\nthe name of preventing law and order situation going\nout of hand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">17. It is vehemently contended by the respondents that\nthe decision not to hand over the body of the deceased\nto the petitioner for performing his last rites, was taken\nin the larger public interest and to prevent the situation\nof law and order going out of hand. It is submitted that\nrespondents have witnessed such situations in the past\nand, therefore, have decided not to handover the dead\nbodies of the terrorists killed in encounters to their next\nof kin for cremation or burial to prevent the law and\norder situation getting worsened. The respondents,\nhowever, have not come clear as to why the dead bodies\nof two of the four killed in the encounter, namely, Altaf\nAhmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul were exhumed and\nhanded over to their relatives for their last rites in the\ngraveyards of their choice and why the similar right\nclaimed by the petitioner was denied. The respondents\nhave tried to draw distinction by submitting that as per\nthe investigation conducted by the SIT, the deceased\nson of the petitioner was a confirmed terrorist whereas\nthe other two killed, namely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr.\nMudasir Gul were only associates of the terrorists. I do\nnot find any logic or sense in distinction so made by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                             7</span>\n\frespondents. It transpires that due to public pressure\nand demand by the relatives of the two deceased\nnamely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr. Mudasir Gul, the\nrespondents relented and permitted their dead bodies to\nbe exhumed and handed over to their relatives. Since\nthe petitioner was a resident of Gool, a remote village in\nJammu Province and did not much say in the Valley\nand, therefore, his request was arbitrarily turned down.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">The action of the respondents is not traceable to any\nprocedure established by law which is just, fair and\nequitable. At least none was brought to the notice of this\nCourt. The decision of the respondents not to allow the\npetitioner to take away dead body of his son to his\nnative village for last rites was per­se arbitrary and falls\nfoul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">18. Much has been said by the respondents with regard\nto the status of the body lying buried since 15.11.2021.\nWhile it cannot be disputed that the body of Amir Latief\nMagrey buried on 15.11.2021 in Wadder Payeen\nGraveyard may have putrefied by now but that alone\ncannot be a reason not to handover the remains of the\ndead body to the petitioner who is clamoring at the top\nof his voice to get even the remains of the dead body\nof his son so that he could bury him in his native\ngraveyard in the presence of relatives and after\nfollowing all religious obligations. The apprehension\nof law and order getting vitiated at this point of time\nalso appears to be illusory. When the respondents could\nmaintain the law and order situation when the dead\nbodies of two, namely, Altaf Ahmad Bhat and Dr.\nMudasir Gul were exhumed and handed over to their\nrelatives for last rites on 18.11.2021, it is not difficult for\nthe respondents to make necessary arrangements for\nexhumation of the dead body of Amir Latief Magrey, the\nson of the petitioner and transport the same in proper\nescort to Village Thatharka Seripora Tehsil Gool District\nRamban. The respondents can make appropriate\narrangements to ensure that law and order situation\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               8</span>\n\f        does not get vitiated in any manner. The petitioner, as is\n        fervently contended by his counsel, is even ready to\n        undertake that he will abide by all the terms and\n        conditions that may be imposed by the respondents\n        with regard to exhumation, transportation and\n        according of burial to the dead body.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">11.   The learned Single Judge issued the final directions in para\n\n      19, which reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        “19. For the foregoing reasons, I am inclined to allow\n        this petition of the father of the deceased Amir Latief\n        Magrey and direct the respondents to make\n        arrangements for exhumation of the body/remains of\n        the deceased Amir Latief Magrey from the Wadder\n        Payeen graveyard in presence of the petitioner. The\n        respondents shall also make appropriate arrangement\n        for transportation of the dead body to the village of the\n        petitioner for according burial in his native graveyard in\n        accordance with the traditions, religious obligations and\n        religious faith which the deceased professed during his\n        life time provided it is in deliverable state. The\n        respondents are free to impose any reasonable terms\n        and conditions in respect of exhumation, transportation\n        and burial of the dead body of Amir Latief Magrey, the\n        son of the petitioner. Since the dead body of the\n        deceased must be in advance stage of putrefaction, as\n        such, it would be desirable that the respondents act\n        with promptitude and do not waste any further time.\n        However, if the body is highly putrefied and is not in\n        deliverable state or is likely to pose risk to public health\n        and hygiene, the petitioner and his close relatives shall\n        be allowed to perform last rites as per their tradition\n        and religious belief in the Wadder Payeen graveyard\n        itself. In that situation, the State shall pay to the\n        petitioner a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs for deprivation\n        of his right to have the dead body of his son and give\n        him decent burial as per family traditions, religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                     9</span>\n\f          obligations and faith which the deceased professed\n          when he was alive.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">12. Thus, the learned Single Judge addressed himself essentially on\n\n    the following issues:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     a.     The State could not have denied the right of the appellant\n\n            to claim the dead body of his son for performing the last\n\n            rites in accordance with his religious faith on the ground\n\n            of likelihood of disturbance of public order. According to\n\n            the learned Single Judge, such right as asserted by the\n\n            father is enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     b.     Why the dead bodies out of the four killed in the\n\n            encounter were permitted to be exhumed and handed\n\n            over to their relatives for their last rites?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     c.     The action on the part of the respondents in not allowing\n\n            the appellant to take away the dead body of his son to his\n\n            native village was violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">&amp; 21</a> resply of the\n\n            Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\f13.   The Union Territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and others being\n\n      dissatisfied and aggrieved with the aforesaid order passed by\n\n      the learned Single Judge of the High Court challenged the\n\n      same by filing the Letters Patent Appeal No. 99 of 2022. The\n\n      Appeal Court disposed of the appeal holding as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        “15.

Insofar as alternative relief, pressed by respondent\nno. 1 before the Apex Court qua payment of\ncompensation as granted by the Writ Court is\nconcerned, it needs to be appreciated that appellants\nadmittedly did not provide opportunity to respondent no.\n1 and his family to associate in the burial and\nperformance of last religious rites of the deceased.\nAppellants prima facie have acted unfairly inasmuch as\nunreasonably in this regard notwithstanding the\nallegation of appellants that person of deceased was a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                            12</span>\n\f         terrorist even if it may be assumed, as such, that the\n         deceased relinquished his right to be buried after\n         performance of last rites performed by his family\n         members in accordance with the faith professed by him,\n         yet the said right of burial and performance of last\n         religious rituals of deceased available to respondent no.\n         1 and his family members could not have been denied.\n         Admittedly, respondent no. 1 and his family manifestly\n         has been subjected to emotional and sentimental\n         melancholy. Respondent no. 1 and his family have been\n         deprived by appellants of the right to perform last rites\n         and rituals of deceased by the appellants admittedly\n         without there being any policy/guideline, as such\n         cannot be endorsed in law, in that, ours is a Welfare\n         State acknowledged by the whole globe. The appellants\n         herein also could not have overlooked the background of\n         the family of respondent no. 1 and his family&#x27;s role in\n         fighting terrorism. The Writ Court having regard to the\n         aforesaid     position   has    rightly   awarded     the\n         compensation to the respondent no. 1 for such\n         deprivation and the award of said compensation\n         seemingly is appropriate.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">14.   The Appeal Court issued the following directions in para 21, as\n\n      under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">         “21. For all what has been observed, considered and\n         analysed above, and having regard to the peculiar facts\n         and circumstances of the present case, the instant\n         appeal is disposed of as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           (i) Appellants to allow respondent no. 1 and his family\n               members (maximum 10 persons) to perform Fatiha\n               Khawani (religious rituals/prayers after burial) of\n               deceased at Wadder Payeen Graveyard, on the\n               date and time to be decided in consultation with\n               respondent no. 1, subject to taking into account\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                    13</span>\n\f             security measures which may be required to be put\n             in place inasmuch as the COVID­19 guidelines.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">           (ii) Appellants to pay compensation of Rs. 5.00 Lakhs,\n               awarded by the Writ Court, to respondent no. 1 is\n               maintained.

Thus, from the aforesaid, it is evident that the Appeal Court\n\n      did not approve the decision of the learned Single Judge to\n\n      direct the respondents herein to exhume the body of the\n\n      deceased and thereby permit the family members to shift and\n\n      bury at their native graveyard in accordance with the religious\n\n      practice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">16.   The appellant (father of the deceased) being dissatisfied with\n\n      the order passed by the High Court is here before us with the\n\n      present appeal invoking <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the Appellant\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">17.   Mr. Anand Grover, the learned senior counsel appearing on\n\n      behalf of the appellant, at the outset, submitted that he would\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                    14</span>\n\f      like to confine his prayer to the extent of directing the\n\n      respondents to disinter the body so as to enable the appellant\n\n      as a father and other family members to perform the\n\n      prayers/rituals to their satisfaction. Mr. Grover submitted that\n\n      the body is now buried past almost more than eight months.\n\n      In such circumstances, the family members of the deceased\n\n      would not like to disturb the remains of the dead body and\n\n      once the prayers are offered, the body may be once again\n\n      buried. However, Mr. Grover clarified that the appellant would\n\n      like to wash the body with water and wrap it up with a new\n\n      white cloth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">18.   Mr. Grover further submitted that the Appeal Court ought not\n\n      to have disturbed the order passed by the learned Single\n\n      Judge directing the respondents to exhume the body. He\n\n      would submit that the appellant as a father still believes that\n\n      his son was not a terrorist or a militant and was killed in a\n\n      fake encounter. Mr. Grover would submit that assuming for a\n\n      moment without admitting that the deceased was a militant,\n\n      the police should have handed over the dead body to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  15</span>\n\f      family members and could not have buried the body discreetly\n\n      at the Wadder Payeen Graveyard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">19.   The entire line of argument of Mr. Grover is that the appellant\n\n      has a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\n      to perform the last rites of his dead son in accordance with the\n\n      rituals prevailing in Islam. The appellant as a father could not\n\n      have been deprived of such fundamental right. He would\n\n      submit that as the appellant was not permitted or rather given\n\n      an opportunity to perform the last rites of his dead son, there\n\n      is no other option but to pray for exhumation of the dead\n\n      body.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">20.

Exhumation involves opening up a grave (or occasionally a\n\n      vault) and removing the human remains already buried there.\n\n      Also known as ‘disinterment’, exhumation is controversial –\n\n      even if the intent is usually to rebury the displaced remains\n\n      elsewhere. Most societies and cultures that embrace burial as\n\n      a means of bodily disposal exhibit an entrenched reluctance to\n\n      disturb the dead’s earthly repose mainly for two reasons. The\n\n      first    is   public   health   concerns   around   the   potential\n\n      transmission of disease from the decaying corpses. Secondly,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                      23</span>\n\f      and more fundamentally, exhumation offends the basic moral\n\n      premise of allowing the dead to ‘rest in peace’ and is generally\n\n      regarded as a forbidden or sacrilegious act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">28.   Ordinarily, the request for exhumation would fall into two\n\n      broad categories: “public interest and personal reasons.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">29.   The lawful authority for exhumation is contained in <a href=\"/doc/267170/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n\n      176(3)</a>, CrPC, 1973. This activity is permitted for the purpose\n\n      of crime detection and other such pressing situations.\n\n      Whenever there is a suspicion of foul play like homicide,\n\n      criminal abortion, disputed cause of death, poisoning etc.\n\n      exhumation may be carried out for the purpose of post­\n\n      mortem examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">30.   In the instant case, after the deceased was killed in the\n\n      Hyderpora encounter, the authorities performed the last rites\n\n      of the deceased with all dignity with the aid of the Auqaf\n\n      Committee as per the religious beliefs and practices and\n\n      buried him in J&amp;K on 15.11.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">31.

The common theme in all\n       these Fatwas is that under Sheriat Law respecting of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                   27</span>\n\f         graves is the religious obligation of every Muslim, that\n         shifting of dead bodies after digging old graves in which\n         they are lying buried is not permissible and to do so\n         would amount to interference with their religious rights.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">         True, this position under Sheriat Law cannot be doubted\n         but as explained earlier the religious rights of every\n         person and every religious denomination are subject to\n         “public order”, the maintenance whereof is paramount in\n         the larger interest of the society. For instance, the\n         ecclesiastical edict or right not to disturb an interred\n         corpse is not absolute as will be clear from <a href=\"/doc/267170/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n         176(3)</a> of Criminal Procedure Code which permits its\n         exhumation for the purpose of crime detection and this\n         provision is applicable to all irrespective of the personal\n         law governing the dead. In fact, quoting a Hadit, one of\n         the Fatwas relied upon by the contesting respondents\n         states “unnecessary shifting of graves is also not\n         permissible”…..”\n                                               [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">34.

In Vineet Ruia (supra), the Calcutta High Court held that:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         “20. By and large, whether it is for a theist or atheist,\n         freedom of conscience and free profession and practice\n         of religion is protected under Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 25</a> of\n         the Constitution. The term “religion” in that Clause need\n         not necessarily be linked to any particular religion as is\n         understood as a religious denomination. It is a matter of\n         faith and of one&#x27;s own conscience which could trigger\n         the profession and practice of what may be religion in\n         the larger sense to a particular individual. With this\n         concept in mind, it needs to be delineated that it is not\n         the religious practices of the different religious\n         denominations which matter in such instances. It is a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     31</span>\n\fmatter of connectivity with the person who has died and\nthe near relatives may be in whatever degree of\nrelationship.    Fundamentally,       human     relationship\nbetween the parent and child, husband and wife,\ngrandparent and grandchild, etc. is not based on any\nreligious tenet. It is a matter of faith and conscience of\nevery individual. If such a person is to take recourse to\nany practice and free profession on the foundation of\nfreedom of conscience in terms of Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 25</a>\nof the Constitution of India, it could get abridged only by\nthe reciprocal covenant that such activity should be\nsubject to public order, morality and health and to other\nprovisions of Part III of the Constitution.

If we were to look at the varied practices\namong the Hindus as a whole or different\ndenominations of Hindus, one thing is clearly certain;\nthe facility to provide ritualistic offerings by way of\nwater, flowers or even certain grains are quite often\nseen as fundamentally for the satisfaction of the person\nmaking such offer to the dead before burial/cremation,\nas the case may be. Post cremation rites including,\nreceiving the mortal remains in the form of ashes and\nbones which are treated as sacred to the near relatives\nof the departed and further handling of those materials\nin accordance with faith and belief also stands accepted\nin such communities (profitable reading in this regard\ncan be had from Garuda Purana, Vishnu Purana and\nother ancient Hindu texts and scriptures). In so far as\nChristians are concerned, if one were to look at different\ndenominations, it can be seen that there are practices,\nwhich may with slight variations, generally provide for\nprayers before the dead bodies are disposed of by\nburial and by offering prayers even after disposal on\ndifferent dates and times depending upon the faith,\nbelief and practice in different Churches. A perusal of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                            32</span>\n\fcanons would show that different ritualistic processes\nare delineated for such matters.

In so far as the Muslims are concerned,\nwhatever be the difference in beliefs and practices\namong the Hanafis, who are treated as a majority group\nof Sunnis in India, on one hand, and the Shias on the\nother hand, one clear thread of connectivity is the faith\nand belief that the disposal of human remains is a must\nas well as post Kabar (Burial) rituals (Certain passages\nfrom Al­Bahr­ur­Raiq will buttress this aspect). The\nfamily also intends to have its own practices carried\nforward to the extent it relates to their faith and belief.\nWe refer to all these only to demonstrate that by and\nlarge the Indian community always has the desire for\nintricate practices in the form of rituals with the\nparticipation of near relatives of a deceased, following\nwhat      could     be    permissible      under     given\ncircumstances…..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">  xxx                     xxx                     xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">23. …..the right of the family of a Covid­19 victim to\nperform the last rites before the cremation/burial of the\ndeceased person is a right akin to Fundamental Right\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia.

The discretionary dimension is\n        considerable but that relates to the power of the court.\n        The question is whether it spells by implication, fair\n        a procedure as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21.</a> In our view,\n        it does. <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 136</a> is a special jurisdiction. It is\n        residuary power; it is extraordinary in its amplitude, its\n        limit, when it chases injustice, is the sky itself. This\n        Court functionally fulfils itself by reaching out to\n        injustice wherever it is and this power is largely derived\n        in the common run of cases from <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 136.</a> Is it merely\n        a power in the court to be exercised in any manner it\n        fancies? Is there no procedural limitation in the manner\n        of exercise and the occasion for exercise? Is there no\n        duty to act fairly while hearing a case under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 136</a>,\n        either in the matter of grant of leave or, after such grant,\n        in the final disposal of the appeal? We have hardly any\n        doubt that here is a procedure necessarily implicit in the\n        power vested in the summit court. It must be\n        remembered that <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 136</a> confers jurisdiction on the\n        highest court. The founding fathers unarguably intended\n        in the very terms of <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 136</a> that it shall be exercised\n        by the highest judges of the land with scrupulous\n        adherence to judicial principles well established by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                    41</span>\n\fprecedents in our jurisprudence. Judicial discretion is\ncanalised authority, not arbitrary eccentricity. Cardozo,\nwith elegant accuracy, has observed: [Benjamin\nCardozo : The Nature Of The Judicial Process, Yale\nUniversity Press (1921)]\n\n  “The Judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly\n  free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a\n  knight­errant roaming at will in pursuit of his own\n  ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his\n  inspiration from consecrated principles. It is not to\n  yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and\n  unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a\n  discretion informed by tradition, methodized by\n  analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to\n  ‘the primordial necessity of order in the social life’.\n  Wide enough in all conscience is the field of discretion\n  that remains.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">8. It is manifest that <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 136</a> is of composite\nstructure, is power­cum­procedure — power in that it\nvests jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, and procedure\nin that it spells a mode of hearing. It obligates the\nexercise of judicial discretion and the mode of hearing so\ncharacteristic of the court process. In short, there is an\nin­built prescription of power and procedure in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 136</a> which meets the demand of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">9.

When a motion is made for\nleave to appeal against an acquittal, this Court\nappreciates the gravity of the peril to personal liberty\ninvolved in that proceeding. It is fair to assume that\nwhile considering the petition under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 136</a> the court\nwill pay attention to the question of liberty, the person\nwho seeks such leave from the court, his motive and his\nlocus standi and the weighty factors which persuade\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                            42</span>\n\f         the court to grant special leave.

Thus, the principles of law discernible from the aforesaid are\n\n      that unless, it is shown that exceptional and special\n\n      circumstances exist; that substantial and grave injustice has\n\n      been done and the case and question presents features of\n\n      sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed\n\n      against, this Court would not exercise its overriding powers\n\n      under   <a href=\"/doc/1218877/\" id=\"a_92\">Article   136    (1)</a>    of   the   Constitution.   The   wide\n\n      discretionary power with which this Court is invested under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 136</a> is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional\n\n      cases only. Keeping these principles in mind, we need to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                      43</span>\n\f      decide whether the relief prayed for by the appellant should be\n\n      granted or not?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">\nCondition of the Body after Burial\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">51.   Even the writ court had allowed disinterment subject to the\n\n      condition that the body should be found to be in a deliverable\n\n      state. It further stated that if the body is found to be highly\n\n      putrefied then it may pose a risk to public health and hygiene.\n\n      In such a situation the family of the deceased would only be\n\n      allowed to perform the last rites in the graveyard itself.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_85\">52.   It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the\n\n      respondents themselves had disinterred the dead bodies of two\n\n      persons, who were killed along with the appellant’s son. One of\n\n      them was shot dead by a foreign militant, while the other was\n\n      killed during the crossfire and they were disinterred within two\n\n      days of burial on the directions of District Magistrate Kupwara\n\n      and handed over to their next of kin for performing their last\n\n      rites in their own way. It can be easily assumed that the\n\n      bodies must not have decomposed much in two days thereby\n\n      leaving them in a deliverable state.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                   44</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">\f53.   The appellant himself has relied on an expert, namely, Dr.\n\n      Arpad A. Vass, a Senior Staff Scientist at the Oak Ridge\n\n      National Laboratory and Adjunct Associate Professor at the\n\n      University of Tennessee in Forensic Anthropology, who has\n\n      stated that decomposition of the human body begins around 4\n\n      minutes after a person dies. The expert has said that the body\n\n      starts to liquify after one 1 month of decomposition. As each\n\n      day passes by, more putrefaction is undergone by the body.\n\n      Even the learned Single judge by order dated 27.05.2022, had\n\n      mentioned that the dead body of the deceased must be in\n\n      advanced stage of putrefaction. Almost 9 months have passed\n\n      post burial which is suggestive that the body may not be in a\n\n      deliverable state. It will be too much at this stage to disinter\n\n      the body. The dead should not be disturbed and some sanctity\n\n      should be attached to the grave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">54.   It goes without saying that the right to live a dignified life as\n\n      enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is not only\n\n      available to a living person but also to the “dead”. Even a dead\n\n      person has the right of treatment to his body with respect and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                  45</span>\n\fdignity which he would have deserved had he been alive,\n\nsubject to his tradition, culture and religion which he\n\nprofessed. These rights are not only for the deceased but, his\n\nfamily members also have a right to perform the last rites in\n\naccordance with the religious traditions. We are of the view\n\nthat it would have been appropriate and in fitness of things to\n\nhand over the dead body of the deceased to the family\n\nmembers, more particularly, when a fervent request was made\n\nfor the same. It is of course true that for any compelling\n\nreasons or circumstances or issues relating to public order\n\netc. more particularly in cases of encounter with the militants\n\nthe agency concerned may decline to part with the body. These\n\nare all very sensitive matters involving security of nation and\n\nas far as possible the court should not interfere unless\n\nsubstantial &amp; grave injustice has been done. Although, for\n\nsome reason or the other, the body of the deceased was not\n\nhanded over to the family members yet the same was buried\n\nwith respect &amp; dignity, with the help of the Auqaf Committee\n\nat the Wadder Payeen Graveyard. We are convinced of one\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                           46</span>\n\f      thing that the body was buried with dignity. There is nothing\n\n      on record to indicate that the dead body was dealt with in any\n\n      manner insulting or hurting the religious feelings of the family\n\n      members.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_89\">55.   However, what is not appealing to us is the vociferous\n\n      submission on behalf of the appellant that with a view to\n\n      remedy the wrong, as alleged, this Court should direct the\n\n      respondents to exhume the body and permit the appellant and\n\n      his family members to thereafter perform the rituals. It is for\n\n      this very wrong as alleged that the High Court has awarded a\n\n      monetary compensation of the amount of Rs. 5,00,000/­.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">56.   After a body has been buried, it is considered to be in the\n\n      custody of the law; therefore, disinterment is not a matter of\n\n      right. The disturbance or removal of an interred body is\n\n      subject to the control and direction of the court. The law does\n\n      not favour disinterment, based on the public policy that the\n\n      sanctity of the grave should be maintained. Once buried, a\n\n      body should not be disturbed. A court will not ordinarily order\n\n      or permit a body to be disinterred unless there is a strong\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                  47</span>\n\f      showing of necessity that disinterment is within the interests\n\n      of justice. Each case is individually decided, based on its own\n\n      particular facts and circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">57.   The respondents have stated on oath that the body of the\n\n      deceased was buried with all honour. The body was first\n\n      washed and thereafter wrapped in a fresh white cloth. The\n\n      prayers were also performed at the time of the burial. There is\n\n      nothing to indicate that the deceased was not given a decent\n\n      burial as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The\n\n      right to dignity and fair treatment under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n      Constitution is not only available to a living man but also to\n\n      his body after his death. We, as a court of law, respect the\n\n      emotions and sentiments expressed by the appellant as the\n\n      father of the deceased. However, the court of law should not\n\n      decide the rights of the parties considering their sentiments.\n\n      The court of law has to decide the matter in accordance with\n\n      law, more particularly, keeping in mind the doctrine of Rule of\n\n      Law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                 48</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">\f58.   We take notice of the fact that India has no legislation relating\n\n      to exhumation except <a href=\"/doc/267170/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 176(3)</a> of the CrPC. As noticed\n\n      by the Madras High Court in the case of Anandhi Simon\n\n      (supra), very few countries are having a legislation in regard to\n\n      exhumation. One such legislation available is in Ireland under\n\n      Section 46 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act,\n\n      1948 as amended by <a href=\"/doc/1555874/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 4 (2)</a> and the Second Schedule of\n\n      the Local Government Act, 1994.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">59.
