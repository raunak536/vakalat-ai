It is also submitted that continuation of\n        the rowdy sheet against the petitioner though there is no case\n        pending against the petitioners amounts to interfering with the\n                                       HAH\n\n\n                                                            WP.No.32954 of 2023   %\n\n     fundamental rights of the petitioners i.e., right to live with dignity\n     and the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 19(1)(d).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\"> 5. The learned Assistant Government Pleader representing the\n\n     respondents submits that a counter is filed and that the Police\n\n     Standing Orders 602(2) clearly mentioned that nothing precludes\n    the SP/DCP/CP from continuing a rowdy sheet on the sole\n    ground that the history/rowdy sheeter is not figuring as an\n    accused in the previous five years. It would depend upon the\n    nature of the activities of the history/rowdy sheeter for continuing\n    the suspect sheet to enable peace and tranquility in the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6. The learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for the\n    state does not dispute that there are no cases pending against\n    the petitioner; however submits that the petitioners activities\n    would require continuous surveillance for the police to maintain\n    the law and order in the state.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.

Whether the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1 )(d)</a> of\n           a Citizen is infringed upon on account of continued\n           surveillance under the guise of opening and continuing\n           history sheet ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     II.   The scope of judicial review of history sheet / rowdy\n           sheet    on    the   touchstone    of   reasonableness,\n           arbitrariness and non-application of mind ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.   It is not in dispute that the petitioner is not accused and are not\n\n     facing trial in any matters.

The Police Standing Orders do not                  have\n\n\n     statutory force. The standing orders are only administrative\n\n     instructions. It is also not in dispute that the Police Standing\n\n     Orders which are issued under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_11\">Police Act</a> would                   have\n\n\n     statutory force.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">11.

When a\n       person is convicted once Under 310(2) to 310(5) of\n       BNS (Previously <a href=\"/doc/1119707/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 395</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_15\">402</a> IPC), when a\n       person is convicted twice for house breaking or theft,                 i\n       when a person is bound over twice Under Section\n       128 of BNSS (previously <a href=\"/doc/11461/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 109</a> of the Code of\n       Criminal Procedure), and bound over once the\n       Police are empowered to open history sheet.\n       Besides these, persons who are convicted for\n       offences relating to coins and Government Stamps\n       and persons convicted twice for the offences like\n       theft and house breaking and professional prisoners\n       are also the persons against whom history sheet can\n       be automatically opened by the police,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"> b)    History sheets can also be opened even if there is\n       no conviction. But in such case the person should\n       have been known or believed to be addicted to , or\n      aid or abet the commission of a crime,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">c)    The History Sheet opened shall be continued and\n      maintained only for a period of two years and shall\n      be closed only on definite orders of Gazetted Officer.\n      The Police may however order closure of the History\n      Sheet at any time (PSO 735).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">d)    The History Sheet can be continued and maintained\n      for further period of one year till the end of\n      December, but such continuance can be on specific\n      orders of a Gazetted Officer who after considering\n      the case comes to conclusion that it is necessary to\n      continue the History Sheet and extend retention of\n      the   History   Sheet,    Annual    extensions     for\n      continuation of History Sheet can also be given from\n      January to December, (PSOs. 735 and 737).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">e)    The police may also open history sheets for\n      suspects. Suspects are those persons who          are\n\n      convicted under any section of the Bharatiya Nyaya\n      Sanhita, 2023 and who are considered likely to\n      commit crime again. Persons who are not convicted\n      but are believed to be addicted to crime are also\n      treated as suspects. In case a History Sheet is\n      opened on the ground that a person is a suspect\n      care should be taken that History Sheets are opened\n                                          //9//\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                   WP.No.32954 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n               only for persons who are likely to become habitual\n               criminals (PSO 736).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">     12. The police after opening history sheets would constantly keep\n\n           the history sheeter under their radar of surveillance.

On the facts of the present case, the continuance of rowdy sheet\n\n           against the petitioner would amount to illegal surveillances which\n\n           is an arbitrary act on part of the state.
