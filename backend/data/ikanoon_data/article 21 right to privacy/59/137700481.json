According to learned counsel for petitioner, petitioner\n\nwas acquitted in Crime No.387 of 2005 and registration of Crime\n\nNo.282 of 2020 binding over the petitioner for good conduct stands\n\nset aside in view of the judgment of this Court in Criminal Petition\n\nNo.4662 of 2020 dated 5.10.2020, therefore, as on today only two\n\ncrimes are pending against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">      7.     According to learned Assistant Government Pleader, in\n\nview of involvement of the petitioner in several criminal cases,\n\nsurveillance is necessary, whereas, according to learned counsel\n\nfor petitioner, even assuming that police are entitled to keep\n\nsurveillance, police cannot disturb the petitioner in the late night\n\nhours and cause hardship to him, which amounts to uncalled for\n\ninterference in life, liberty and privacy of the petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      8.     No statutory instrument deal with opening rowdy-\n\nsheet and keeping surveillance on a person. The Andhra Pradesh\n\nPolice Manual deals with various aspects of functioning of police\n\npersonnel which include registration of crimes, investigation,\n\nconducting of trial and opening of rowdy sheets etc. PSO 601 deals\n\nwith opening of rowdy sheet. According to Clause-A thereof, if a\n\nperson habitually commits, attempts to commit or abet the\n                                                                     PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                          WP No.18726/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommission of offences involving breach of peace, disturbance to\n\npublic order and security, a rowdy sheet should be opened and his\n\nmovements and activities are to be watched. According to Clause-B\n\nthereof, a person bound over for good conduct should be classified\n\nas rowdy and rowdy sheet can be opened and continued.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      9.    On opening the rowdy-sheet, Police keep watch on\n\nmovements of the person. According to Police, this is necessary as\n\npart of their duty to ensure law, order and peace in the community\n\nand to prevent a habitual offender from possible indulgence of\n\ncrimes affecting the society at large i.e., to prevent commission of\n\noffence. This is nothing but surveillance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">      10.   Right to life, liberty and privacy are sacrosanct to a\n\nperson. A person is entitled to lead his life with dignity and self\n\nrespect. These rights flow out of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Surveillance on person certainly infringes on his right to life,\n\nprivacy and liberty. These rights cannot be infringed except by due\n\nprocess of law. Compelling public interest may require intrusion\n\ninto privacy of a person but while doing so great care and caution\n\nhas to be observed. Thus, if Police resort to surveillance on the\n\nground that rowdy-sheet is opened on petitioner, it must show\n\njustification, impelled to ensure peace and order in the society.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1470089\" id=\"span_8\">11.

In\n\nboth these decisions it is held that PSOs are non statutory\n\nexecutive instructions and have no binding force of law.</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">          11.1. In Mohammed Quadeer and others, it is held:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;31. Opening of a rowdy sheet against a citizen is undoubtedly\n        fraught with serious consequences. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n        India guarantees right to life with dignity and the right to live, as a\n        dignified man, carries with it the right to reputation. Right to\n        reputation is an integral part of right to life guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>,\n        and such a right cannot be deprived except in accordance with the\n        procedure established by law. Such laws which authorise the Police\n        to open rowdy sheets and exercise surveillance are required to be\n        very strictly construed. Opening of the rowdy sheets and retention\n        thereof except in accordance with law would amount to infringement\n        of fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n        India. It is true that the State is duty bound at all levels to protect the\n        persons and property from the criminals and criminal activity.\n        Prevention of organised crime is an obligation on the part of the\n        State.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        Right to Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        32. Fundamental rights and civil liberties exist and can only flourish\n        in an orderly society. Civil liberties and fundamental rights are\n        intimately connected with the nature and dynamics of the Society. It\n        is the duty of the Police to deal with crime and criminals\n        expeditiously and effectively while at the same time holding to the\n        values and concepts of the fundamental rights and the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">        Both the competing interests are to be reconciled. This much is clear\n        so far as our Constitutional system is concerned that intrusion into\n        personal liberty without an authority of law is forbidden. Surveillance\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">1</span>\n    1999 (3) ALD 60\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">2</span>\n    1999 (6) ALT 249\n                                                                            PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                 WP No.18726/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\nand watching of movements of a citizen by the Police is not a matter\nof course. Such rights can be exercised by the Police only in\naccordance with law which permits such surveillance. The action in\nthis regard which is in accordance with law may result in violation of\nthe fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\nof India. Every citizen has fundamental right and entitled to indulge\nin harmless activities without observation or interference. It is a right\nto be left alone. The guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 8</a> of the European\nConvention of Human Rights that &quot;Everyone has the right to respect\nfor his private and family life, his home and has correspondence&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">reflects both the individual&#x27;s psychological need to preserve an\nintrusion-free zone of personality and family, and the anguish and\nstress which can be suffered when that zone is violated. The saying\nthat &#x27;an Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&#x27; would be 6 equally\napplicable to Indian situation and it can be said that an &#x27;Indian\ncitizen&#x27;s home is his castle.&#x27;\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">33. Therefore, I have no hesitation whatsoever to reject the plea\nthat mere surveillance and watch by the Police itself would not\ninfringe the fundamental rights of a citizen. Such surveillance\nand     watch    which    is     not   authorised   by    law   may     be\nunconstitutional. Such surveillance and watch even if it is\nauthorised by law but if it is not in accordance with that law\nwould equally be unconstitutional.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n11.2.     In Sunkara Satyanarayana, it is held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;23. Surveillance by the police makes very serious inroads into the\nlife of a person. It even grossly violates the right of persons to privacy.\nObtrusive surveillance does not leave a citizen alone. With the subtle\nmethods of telephone tapping, telescope watching, remote controlled\naudio and video recording gadgets, a citizen subjected to surveillance\ncan never have mental peace and thus his life and liberty at every\nmovement would be restricted. A person with lot of restrictions\ncannot be expected to lead a dignified life and exercise his right to\nliberty and other freedoms. A citizen&#x27;s life would become miserable.\nSuch a situation is worse than animal existence, For these reasons\ncan it be said that there is a &#x27;right&#x27; against surveillance?\n.....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                                                                             PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                  WP No.18726/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                       8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">    30............Before examining the case law as decided by this Court, it\n    is apposite to note the intention and objectives behind such\n    provisions dealing with surveillance. There cannot be two opinions\n    that police should vigorously enforce the law. It does not however\n    mean that they should rigorously violate the constitutional values\n    and constitutional rights. In enforcing the law they shall not\n    violate the Supreme law of the Nation. The police are charged\n    with responsibility of controlling crime. Control of crime\n    necessarily involve prevention of crime. To prevent crime it is\n    permissible that police should keep a person known to be\n    habitual offender or 7 known to be &#x27;trouble maker&#x27; under a\n    watch. What is most objectionable to civilized mind is the use of\n    extra legal methods by the police for prevention of crimes.\n    Surveillance of a person in an arbitrary and unreasonable\n    manner and contrary to the provisions of law, is one such extra\n    legal   method     which     cannot    be     countenanced     by   the\n    Constitutional Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">    31. Illegal surveillance makes arbitrary and obtrusive intrusions into\n    one&#x27;s right to privacy and violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of India.\n    But keeping a person under unobtrusive watch to prevent crime\n    and to maintain law and order, as authorised by law, is\n    reasonable restriction permissible under the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                                                       (emphasis supplied)\n\n     11.3.

If surveillance\n    hurts personal sensitivities, the same is not a violation, for the\n    constitution makers never intended to protect mere personal\n    sensitiveness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">      ...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">      (iv) If the action of the police is found to infringe the freedoms\n    guaranteed to the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter and violates his\n    right to privacy, in that, the surveillance is excessively obtrusive and\n    intrusive, it may seriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to\n    infringe the fundamental right to privacy and personal liberty under\n    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> as well as the freedom of movement guaranteed under\n    <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the Constitution of India and the same is\n    impermissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">      (vii) In either case-whether the regulation is statutory or non-\n    statutory-domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should be\n    reduced to the clearest cases of danger to community security, and\n    there can be no routine follow-up at the end of a conviction or release\n    from prison in every case.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      12.    In the case on hand, a rowdy-sheet was opened\n\nagainst the petitioner and the same is not under challenge.\n\nLearned counsel for petitioner also fairly submits that he has no\n\nobjection if Police keep a watch on his movements, during the day,\n\nbut cannot disturb his privacy and cannot disturb him in late\n\nnight hours. There is merit in the submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for petitioner that only on the ground that rowdy-sheet is\n\nopened, Police cannot visit the residence of the petitioner in the\n\nlate night hours and disturb him. It does amount to intruding into\n\nprivacy offending the right of the person. It is not the case of the\n\nrespondent-Police that petitioner continues to involve in criminal\n                                                                         PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                              WP No.18726/2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                     10</span>\n\n\n\n\nactivities, which can be assumed to be resulting in possible law\n\nand order problem in the society and such late night incursion was\n\nnecessary in the larger public interest.
