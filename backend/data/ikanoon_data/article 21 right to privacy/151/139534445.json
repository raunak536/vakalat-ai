Heard Sri M. Vijay Krishna Bhat, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the petitioner and Sri M.Murali Babu, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor respondent Nos.1 and 2.\n                                      5\n\n\n\nFACTUAL CANVAS:\n\n      3. The petitioner is the 3rd defendant. Respondent Nos.1 and\n\n2 who are plaintiffs 1 and 2 institute a suit for partition in\n\nO.S.No.89 of 2016. Defendants 1, 2, and 3 file their written\n\nstatement.    Issues    are    framed      by    the     concerned       Court     on\n\n11-01-2018.       Evidence    is   led    by    the    plaintiffs   in   the     suit.\n\nExamination and cross-examination happen. On 07-09-2023, after\n\ncompletion of plaintiffs&#x27; evidence, the present petitioner was\n\nexamined     as    DW-1      and    the    matter       was    posted     for     his\n\ncross-examination. At that stage, the plaintiffs file the application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">Order XXVI Rule 10A of the CPC</a> seeking DNA test of\n\ndefendants 1 and 3 to determine blood relation and paternity by\n\nway   of   scientific   examination       through      an     expert.    The     said\n\napplication comes to be allowed by the concerned Court in terms of\n\nits order dated 05-04-2025, despite vehement objections of\n\ndefendants 2 and 3. It is allowing the application that has driven\n\nthe petitioner/3rd defendant to this Court in the subject petition.\n                                   6\n\n\n\nCONTENTIONS:\n\n\nPetitioner:\n\n\n      4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contends\n\nthat defendants 1 and 2 are husband and wife. They have several\n\nmatrimonial proceedings between them. Defendant No.3 is born\n\nfrom the wedlock.         Therefore, the plaintiffs cannot file an\n\napplication questioning paternity of defendant No.3 when there is\n\nample evidence to show that marriage had happened between\n\ndefendants 1 and 2. The learned counsel further contends that the\n\nimpugned order of permitting DNA test of the petitioner is violative\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_5\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.       It is his\n\ncontention that as per <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the\n\nplaintiffs have to plead and prove non-access of defendant No.1 to\n\ndefendant No.2 at the relevant point in time. No such plea has ever\n\nbeen raised. Therefore, the order permitting DNA test ought not to\n\nhave been granted by the concerned Court and above all, it is in\n\nviolation of right to privacy of the petitioner.\n                                 7\n\n\n\nRespondents:\n\n\n      5. On the converse, the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondent 1 and 2/plaintiffs would contend that pursuant to the\n\norder of the concerned Court, the DNA test has been conducted and\n\na report is yet to be placed before the Court. It is at that stage the\n\npresent petition is moved challenging the said order and therefore,\n\nit should not be entertained.    It is his contention that defendant\n\nNo.1 is said to have undergone vasectomy in the year 1979 and the\n\nchild was allegedly born in the year 1986. He would, therefore,\n\ncontend that the 3rd defendant is not the son of defendants 1 and 2.\n\nHence DNA test, in the case at hand, was imperative. It is his\n\nsubmission that the children of defendant No.1 through his second\n\nwife/defendant No.2 is wanting to seek partition, though petitioner\n\nis a stranger to the family of the plaintiffs. In all, he would submit\n\nthat there is no warrant of interference with the order passed by\n\nthe concerned Court.\n                                  8\n\n\n\n      6. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions\n\nmade by the respective learned counsel and have perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n\n\n\nCONSIDERATION:\n\n\n      7. The afore-narrated facts and the relationship between the\n\nparties are all a matter of record including the disputed ones.       A\n\nsuit for partition is instituted by the plaintiffs in O.S.No.89 of 2016.\n\nThe issue in the lis is not with regard to the merit of the claim. The\n\n3rd defendant who is also a claimant to the joint family property is\n\nsaid to have born from the wedlock of defendants 1 and 2. Long\n\nafter the suit having progressed for over 8 years, an application is\n\nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_8\">Order XXVI Rule 10A of the CPC</a> seeking DNA test of\n\ndefendant Nos.1 and 3 - father and the son to determine paternity\n\nby way of scientific examination. The sole reason projected in the\n\napplication is the vasectomy operation undergone by the defendant\n\nNo.1 long before the birth of the petitioner/defendant No.3.\n\nTherefore, the birth itself is highly improbable. On the application\n\nfiled, defendants 2 and 3 filed their statement of objections. In the\n                                   9\n\n\n\nobjections it is contended that there are several matrimonial\n\nproceedings between defendant Nos.1 and 2 which is enough to\n\nprove the marriage. In those proceedings, the birth of defendant\n\nNo.3 from the wedlock is clearly established.          When there is no\n\ndoubt about     paternity of defendant No.3, as disclosed in the\n\ndocuments of defendants 1 and 2, the Court answers the\n\napplication in favour of the plaintiffs directing conduct of DNA test.\n\nThe reasons rendered insofar as they are germane are as follows:\n\n                                &quot;....    ....     ....\n\n            iii) It is further submitted that, 1st defendant had\n      undergone Vasectomy operation on 03.07.1979 in Kasthurba\n      Manipal Hospital and the same successful. The doctor of said\n      Hospital has also given evidence in Crl.Mis.143/1987 on the file\n      of JMFC., Court at Bhadravathi. Before leading evidence with\n      respect to conduct and result of said Vasectomy operation, the\n      1st defendant was undergone check up on 13.11.1986. 1st\n      defendant has also undergone another test on 27.10.1987. As\n      per the recent test report dated 28.02.2024 presented by 1st\n      defendant and conducted at KIMS Hospital, Bengaluru said\n      Vasectomy operation of 1st defendant was successful. In all the\n      above clinical tests, it is forthcoming that there is no any sperm\n      count found in 1st defendant.\n\n              iv) It is submitted that, if at all there is any form of\n      relationship between the defendant No.1 and 2 is illegal and\n      void-ab-initio since the mother of the plaintiffs is very much\n      alive and their marital life is subsisting. As per the fraudulently\n      created and concocted documents of defendant No.2 and 3\n      itself, the 2nd defendant is an illegitimate wife and 3rd defendant\n      is also illegitimate son to 2nd defendant. The defendants 1 to 3\n      have colluded together to knock off the joint family suit\n      properties of the plaintiffs. Till date no partition has been\n                              10\n\n\n\neffected between the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant. All these\nfacts are well within the knowledge of the defendants.\n\n       v) It is submitted that, the defendant No.2 and 3 are not\nat all related to the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant in any\nmanner or shape. The 1st defendant is addicted to bad habits\nlike drinking, gambling and illicit relationship with others\nincluding the 2nd defendant and has adopted one or the other\nfraudulent tactics and activities to waste the proceeds raised\nfrom the suit properties. Since the defendant No.1 to 3 have\ncolluded together and have got created and concocted make-\nbelieve documents and have fraudulently obtained collusive\ndecree in OS.No.66/1993.\n\n       vi) It is further submitted that, as per vital court records\nmarked at ExP.14, the 3rd defendant had got filed maintenance\npetition before the JMFC., Court at Bhadravathi in\nCrl.Mis.118/1991 and the same was dismissed after contest. By\nconsidering all the material and existing facts the partition relief\nwhich was sought for by the 3rd defendant in O.S.No.66/1993\nwas rejected by the Senior Civil Judge Court, Holenarasipura. In\nthe said suit, the birth certificate of defendant No.3 was shown\nas 19.03.1987 as per the exhibited document and observation\nmade in Page 21 and para 31 of the judgment in RA.11 and\n14/2002.\n\n       vii) It is submitted that, as per the deposition in\nC.Mis.143/1987 the birth of 3rd defendant is very much doubtful\nand unimaginable too. Behind the back of the plaintiffs and with\na view to defraud them, the defendant No.1 to 3 are indulged in\nhighhanded and illegal acts against the plaintiffs to knock of\ntheir joint family properties. All the defendants are acting hostile\nand detrimental to the right and interest of the plaintiffs. Finding\nno other alternative, the plaintiffs are constrained to get file this\nsuit for the relief of partition and separate possession.\n\n       viii) It is submitted that, the defendant No.2 and 3 have\nnot at all placed any cogent and convincing documents to prove\nthe alleged marriage of defendant No.1 and 2. They have also\nutterly failed to prove the birth of 3rd defendant as a result of\nalleged marital relationship between the defendant No.1 and 2.\nThe defendants have collusively and fraudulently obtained\npartition decree in respect of the suit properties by suppressing\n                              11\n\n\n\nthe material and existing facts and also by misleading the\nCourts behind the back of the plaintiffs and all the orders and\ndecree passed by the Courts are not binding on the plaintiffs as\nthey were not the parties to the earlier suits and proceedings.\nThe said orders and decree are obtained behind the back of\nplaintiffs and without the knowledge of the plaintiffs to the\nabove suit. The plaintiffs submit that as per the record produced\nby them are as per the birth certificate of defendant No.3 it is\nmentioned as 19.03.1987 and as per the school records\nproduced by them the date of birth is mentioned as 25.06.1986.\nThis makes the doubtfulness and suspicious regarding the\npaternity and relationship of the defendant No.1 and 3. Hence\nthe plaintiffs request the Court for the DNA test to forthwith the\ntruth and reality to the society and the fraudness played by the\ndefendant No.2 and 3 before the court and the society.\n\n       ix) The plaintiffs also submit that the defendant No.3 has\nnot made any attempts to change the date of birth and try to\nget correct date of birth before any court of law nor before any\nauthorities. The defendant No.2 in the C.Mis.No.143/1987 in her\ncross examination has answered that she does not remember\nwhether she has stated regarding giving birth to the child or\nregarding her pregnancy. The defendant No.2 and 3 have not\nproduce the hospital birth certificate before any Court of law till\ntoday. Even this makes the doubtfulness and suspicious. The\ndefendant No.2 and 3 have played fraud and have received two\ndifferent dates of birth certificates. The plaintiffs with a view to\nget protected their right and interest over the suit properties\nand also to establish the fraudulent and illegal acts of the\ndefendant No.1 to 3, it has become imperative for them to\nestablish the absence of paternity of the 1st defendant towards\nthe 3rd defendant. In view of the age oldness of the 1st\ndefendant, it has become urgent and imminent to get file this\napplication to ascertain and to establish the truth before the\nCourt for the effective and complete adjudication of this matter.\nThe plaintiffs submit that till today neither the defendant No.2\nand 3 have produced the Hospital records of the child birth or\nthe date of birth of the defendant No.3 and in which hospital he\nwas born nor in which hospital she gave birth to the defendant\nNo.3. the plaintiffs submit that the compromise petition was\nentered between the defendant No.1 and 2 on 26.06.1986 and a\nday before the defendant No.2 has stated that she has given\nbirth to the child and the doubt fullness and suspicious facts and\n                             12\n\n\n\ncircumstances create that whether giving birth to the child one\nday before can come before the court and enter to the\ncompromise petition.\n\n        x) It is further submitted that, since the defendant No.2\nand 3 are alleging marital and paternity relationship with the 1st\ndefendant and they have fraudulently obtained partition decree,\nit has become imperative for the plaintiffs to get DNA test of the\ndefendant No.1 and 3. Hence, they are constrained to get file\nthis application to disprove the alleged blood relationship of the\ndefendant No.1 and 3. Under the above circumstances, if the\nplaintiffs are permitted to prove the fraudulent relation of the\ndefendant No.1 and 3 through scientific examination by way of\nDNA test in this matter, immense hardship and un-\ncompensatatble loss will be caused to the plaintiffs and this\nmatter may not be fairly, completely and effectively adjudicated\nupon beside leading to miss carriage of justice. If the plaintiffs\nare permitted no comparative hardship will be caused to other\nside. The plaintiffs submit that if the DNA test application is not\nallowed, there could not be fairly trial and completely and\neffectively adjudication and will lead to miscarriage to the\njustice and will lead to multiplicity of proceedings.\n                      ....    ....     ....\n\n                          ORDER\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">            Application which is filed by plaintiffs under Order\n      26 Rule 10(A) R/w <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_9\">Sec.151</a> of CPC., is hereby allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_2\">             It is hereby ordered for DNA test between\n      defendant No.1 and 3 with respect to alleged blood\n      relation and both defendant No.1 and 3 are directed to\n      appear before the court on dated 25.04.2025 at 3.00\n      p.m.\n\n            The   Medical   Officer,  Government     Hospital,\n      Channarayapatna is directed to collect blood samples of\n      defendant No.1 and 3 to send the blood sample for DNA\n      test.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  13</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">                  The   Medical   Officer,  Government    Hospital,\n            Channarayapatna is directed to appear before the court\n            on dated 25.04.2025 at 3.00 p.m.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">      8.

Blood tests cannot show\npositively that any man is father, but they can show\npositively that a given man could or could not be the father.\nIt is obviously the latter aspect that proves most valuable in\ndetermining paternity, that is, the exclusion aspect, for once\nit is determined that a man could not be the father, he is\nthereby automatically excluded from considerations of\npaternity. When a man is not the father of a child, it has\nbeen said that there is at least a 70 per cent chance that if\nblood tests are taken they will show positively he is not the\nfather, and in some cases the chance is even higher;\nbetween two given men who have had sexual intercourse\nwith the mother at the time of conception, both of whom\nundergo blood tests, it has likewise been said that there is a\n80 per cent chance that the tests will show that one of them\nis not the father with the irresistible inference that the other\nis the father.&#x27;\n\n         The position which emerges on reference to these\nauthoritative texts is that depending on the type of\nlitigation, samples of blood, when subjected to skilled\nscientific examination, can sometimes supply helpful\nevidence on various issues, to exclude a particular\nparentage set up in the case. But the consideration remains\nthat the party asserting the claim to have a child and the\nrival set of parents put to blood test must establish his right\nso to do. The court exercises protective jurisdiction on\nbehalf of an infant. In my considered opinion it would be\nunjust and not fair either to direct a test for a collateral\nreason to assist a litigant in his or her claim. The child\ncannot be allowed to suffer because of his incapacity; the\naim is to ensure that he gets his rights. If in a case the\ncourt has reason to believe that the application for blood\ntest is of a fishing nature or designed for some ulterior\nmotive, it would be justified in not acceding to such a\nprayer.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                            16</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"579310\" id=\"span_8\">21.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue\n        before the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely\n        delicate and sensitive aspect. One view is that when\n        modern science gives the means of ascertaining the\n        paternity of a child, there should not be any hesitation to\n        use those means whenever the occasion requires. The\n        other view is that the court must be reluctant in the use\n        of such scientific advances and tools which result in\n        invasion of right to privacy of an individual and may not\n        only be prejudicial to the rights of the parties but may\n        have devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the\n        result of such scientific test may bastardise an innocent\n        child even though his mother and her spouse were living\n        together during the time of conception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">               22. In our view, when there is apparent conflict between\n        the right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly to\n        medical examination and duty of the court to reach the truth,\n        the court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the\n        interests of the parties and on due consideration whether for a\n        just decision in the matter, DNA test is eminently needed. DNA\n        test in a matter relating to paternity of a child should not be\n        directed by the court as a matter of course or in a routine\n        manner, whenever such a request is made. The court has to\n        consider diverse aspects including presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n        112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the\n        test of &quot;eminent need&quot; whether it is not possible for the court to\n        reach the truth without use of such test.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">                                                      (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">3</span>\n    (2010) 8 SCC 633\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  20</span>\n\n\n\nThe Apex Court observes that in a matter where paternity of\n\na child is in issue, the use of DNA test is extremely delicate\n\nand sensitive aspect. Therefore, the Court must not allow it\n\nas a matter of course, when there is apparent conflict\n\nbetween the right to privacy of a person not to submit\n\nhimself or herself forcibly to medical examination. If DNA\n\ntest is eminently needed, only then it is to be allowed,\n\nstrictly within the parameters of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 112</a> of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"62123684\" id=\"span_19\">9.4. The Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/62123684/\" id=\"a_31\">APARNA AJINKYA\n\nFIRODIA v. AJINKYA ARUN FIRODIA4</a>, has held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                                 &quot;....   ....    ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">              17. According to Sarkar on Law of Evidence, 20th\n        Edn., in the interest of health, order and peace in society,\n        certain axiomatic presumptions have to be drawn. One\n        such presumption is the conclusive presumption of\n        paternity under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n        112</a> embodies the rule of law that the birth of a child\n        during the continuance of a valid marriage or within 280\n        days (i.e. within the period of gestation) after its\n        dissolution shall be &quot;conclusive proof&quot; that the child is\n        legitimate unless it is established by evidence that the\n        husband and wife did not or could not have any access to\n        each other at any time when the child could have been\n        conceived. The object of this provision is to attach\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">4</span>\n    (2024) 7 SCC 773\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                            21</span>\n\n\n\nunimpeachable legitimacy to children born out of a valid\nmarriage. When a child is born during the subsistence of\nlawful wedlock, it would mean that the parents had\naccess to each other. Therefore, the section speaks of\n&quot;conclusive proof&quot; of the legitimate birth of a child during\nthe period of lawful wedlock. The latter part of the\nsection is with reference to proof of the non-access of the\nparents of the child to each other. Thus, the presumption\nof legitimacy of the birth of the child is rebuttable by way\nof strong evidence to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"10416883\" id=\"span_22\">18. The principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 112</a> is to prevent an\nunwarranted enquiry as to the paternity of the child whose\nparents, at the relevant time had &quot;access&quot; to each other. In\nother words, once a marriage is held to be valid, there is a\nstrong presumption as to the children born from that wedlock as\nbeing legitimate. This presumption can be rebutted only by\nstrong, clear and conclusive evidence to the contrary. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n112</a> of the Evidence Act is based on the presumption of public\nmorality    and    public   policy   vide <a href=\"/doc/10416883/\" id=\"a_36\">Sham     Lal v. Sanjeev\nKumar [Sham Lal</a> v. Sanjeev Kumar, (2009) 12 SCC 454 :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(2009) 4 SCC (Civ) 741] . Since <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 112</a> creates a\npresumption of legitimacy that a child born during the\nsubsistence of a marriage is deemed to be legitimate, a burden\nis cast on the person who questions the legitimacy of the child.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">      19. Further, &quot;access&quot; or &quot;non-access&quot; does not\nmean actual cohabitation but means the &quot;existence&quot; or\n&quot;non-existence&quot; of opportunities for sexual relationship.\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 112</a> refers to point of time of birth as the crucial\naspect and not to the time of conception. The time of\nconception is relevant only to see whether the husband\nhad or did not have access to the wife. Thus, birth during\nthe continuance of marriage is &quot;conclusive proof&quot; of\nlegitimacy unless &quot;non-access&quot; of the party who\nquestions the paternity of the child at the time the child\ncould have been begotten is proved by the said party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">       20. It is necessary in this context to note what is\n&quot;conclusive proof&quot; with reference to the proof of the legitimacy\nof the child, as stated in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. As to\nthe meaning of &quot;conclusive proof&quot; reference may be made to\n<a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 4</a> of the Evidence Act, which provides that when one\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                             22</span>\n\n\n\nfact is declared to be conclusive proof of another, proof of one\nfact, would automatically render the other fact as proved, unless\ncontra evidence is led for the purpose of disproving the fact so\nproved. A conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act,\nwith the definition of &quot;conclusive proof&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 4</a> thereof,\nmakes it amply clear that a child proved to be born during a\nvalid marriage should be deemed to be a legitimate child except\nwhere it is shown that the parties to the marriage had no access\nto each other at any time when the child could have been\nbegotten or within 280 days after the dissolution of the\nmarriage and the mother remains unmarried, that fact is the\nconclusive proof that the child is the legitimate son of the man.\nOperation of the conclusive presumption can be avoided by\nproving non-access at the relevant time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">      21. The latter part of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\nAct indicates that if a person is able to establish that the\nparties to the marriage had no access to each other at\nany time when the child could have been begotten, the\nlegitimacy of such child can be denied. That is, it must be\nproved by strong and cogent evidence that access\nbetween them was impossible on account of serious\nillness or impotency or that there was no chance of\nsexual relationship between the parties during the period\nwhen the child must have been begotten. Thus, unless\nthe absence of access is established, the presumption of\nlegitimacy cannot be displaced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">        22. Thus, where the husband and wife have cohabited\ntogether, and no impotency is proved, the child born from their\nwedlock is conclusively presumed to be legitimate, even if the\nwife is shown to have been, at the same time, guilty of\ninfidelity. The fact that a woman is living in adultery would not\nby itself be sufficient to repel the conclusive presumption in\nfavour of the legitimacy of a child. Therefore, shreds of evidence\nto the effect that the husband did not have intercourse with the\nwife at the period of conception, can only point to the\nillegitimacy of a child born in wedlock, but it would not uproot\nthe presumption of legitimacy under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                          23</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">      23. The presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 112</a> can be\ndrawn only if the child is born during the continuance of a\nvalid marriage and not otherwise. &quot;Access&quot; or &quot;non-\naccess&quot; must be in the context of sexual intercourse, that\nis, in the sexual sense and therefore, in that narrow\nsense. Access may for instance, be impossible not only\nwhen the husband is away during the period when the\nchild could have been begotten or owing to impotency or\nincompetency due to various reasons or the passage of\ntime since the death of the husband. Thus, even though\nthe husband may be cohabiting, there may be non-access\nbetween the husband and the wife. One of the instances\nof non-access despite cohabitation is the impotency of\nthe husband.

Thus, &quot;non-access&quot; has to be proved as a fact in\nissue and the same could be established by direct and\ncircumstantial evidence of an unambiguous character.\nThus, there could be &quot;non-access&quot; between the husband\nand wife despite cohabitation. Conversely, even in the\nabsence of actual cohabitation, there could be access.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_25\">25. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 112</a> was enacted at a time when\nmodern scientific tests such as DNA tests, as well as\nribonucleic acid tests (&quot;RNA tests&quot; for short), were not in\ncontemplation of the legislature. However, even the\nresult of a genuine DNA test cannot escape from the\nconclusiveness of the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 112</a> of\nthe Evidence Act. If a husband and wife were living\ntogether during the time of conception but the DNA test\nreveals that the child was not born to the husband, the\nconclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. What\nwould be proved, is adultery on the part of the wife,\nhowever, the legitimacy of the child would still be\nconclusive in law. In other words, the conclusive\npresumption of paternity of a child born during the\nsubsistence of a valid marriage is that the child is that of\nthe husband and it cannot be rebutted by a mere DNA\ntest report. What is necessary to rebut is the proof of\nnon-access at the time when the child could have been\nbegotten, that is, at the time of its conception vide <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_48\">Kamti\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                      24</span>\n\n\n\n        Devi v.

It is the burden of the person who alleges or\n\ndisputes paternity that he has not fathered the child born to his\n\nwife.

The language of the provision makes it\n     abundantly clear that there exists a strong presumption\n     that the husband is the father of the child borne by his\n     wife during the subsistence of their marriage. This\n     section provides that conclusive proof of legitimacy is\n     equivalent to paternity. The object of this principle is to\n     prevent any unwarranted enquiry into the parentage of a\n     child. Since the presumption is in favour of legitimacy,\n     the burden is cast upon the person who asserts\n     &#x27;illegitimacy&#x27; to prove it only through &#x27;non-access.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">             29. It is well-established that access and non-access\n     under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 112</a> do not require a party to prove beyond\n     reasonable doubt that they had or did not have sexual\n     intercourse at the time the child could have been begotten.\n     &#x27;Access&#x27; merely refers to the possibility of an opportunity for\n     marital relations. To put it more simply, in such a scenario,\n     while parties may be on non-speaking terms, engaging in extra-\n     marital affairs, or residing in different houses in the same\n     village, it does not necessarily preclude the possibility of the\n     spouses having an opportunity to engage in marital\n     relations. Non-access means the impossibility, not merely\n     inability, of the spouses to have marital relations with each\n     other. For a person to rebut the presumption of legitimacy, they\n     must first assert non-access which, in turn, must be\n     substantiated by evidence.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">                                                     (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe Apex Court again interprets <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence\n\nAct and holds that language of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 112</a> is abundantly clear that\n\nthere exists strong presumption that the husband is the father of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                26</span>\n\n\n\nthe child by his wife during the subsistence of marriage.

Whether a person can be compelled to\n        provide a sample for DNA in such matters can also be\n        answered considering the test of proportionality <a href=\"/doc/169684843/\" id=\"a_56\">laid\n        down in</a> the unanimous decision of this Court in K.S.\n        Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5 J.) v.

Union of India, (2019) 1\n        SCC 1], wherein the right to privacy has been declared a\n        constitutionally protected right in India. The Court should\n        therefore examine the proportionality of the legitimate\n        aims being pursued i.e. whether the same are not\n        arbitrary or discriminatory, whether they may have an\n        adverse impact on the person and that they justify the\n        encroachment upon the privacy and personal autonomy\n        of the person, being subjected to the DNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">               16. It cannot be overlooked that in the present\n        case, the application to subject the plaintiff to a DNA test\n        is in a declaratory suit and the plaintiff has already\n        adduced evidence and is not interested to produce\n        additional evidence (DNA), to prove his case. It is now\n        the turn of the defendants to adduce their evidence. At\n        this stage, they are asking for subjecting the plaintiff to a\n        DNA test.

In the yet to be decided suit, the plaintiff has led\n        evidence through sworn affidavits of the respondents, his school\n        leaving certificates and his domicile certificate. Significantly,\n        Respondent 1, who is one of the 3 siblings (defendants) had\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">6</span>\n    (2022) 1 SCC 20\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                  28</span>\n\n\n\n     declared in her affidavit that the plaintiff was raised as a son by\n     her parents. Therefore, the nature of further evidence to be\n     adduced by the plaintiff (by providing DNA sample), need not be\n     ordered by the court at the instance of the other side. In such\n     kind of litigation where the interest will have to be balanced and\n     the test of eminent need is not satisfied our considered opinion\n     is that the protection of the right to privacy of the plaintiff\n     should get precedence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">           ...                    ...                    ...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">       19. The respondent cannot compel the plaintiff to\n  adduce further evidence in support of the defendants&#x27; case.\n  In any case, it is the burden on a litigating party to prove his\n  case adducing evidence in support of his plea and the court\n  should not compel the party to prove his case in the manner,\n  suggested by the contesting party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"136570867\" id=\"span_34\">20.

When the plaintiff is\n  unwilling to subject himself to the DNA test, forcing him to\n  undergo one would impinge on his personal liberty and his\n  right to privacy.

Having recognized the diverging pathways in the\n      present analysis, it is pertinent to first address the aspect of the\n      right to privacy. At the outset, a cursory reference to the\n      decision    in K.S.     Puttaswamy       (Privacy-9J.) v. Union   of\n      India, reveals that privacy is concomitant to the right of the\n      individual to exercise control over his or her personality. Privacy\n      includes, at its core, the preservation of personal intimacies, the\n      sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home, and\n      sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone,\n      as a corollary to the safeguarding of individual autonomy and\n      the ability of an individual to control vital aspects of his life.\n      Elaborating further, this Court held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                    &quot;325. Like other rights which form part of the\n            fundamental freedoms protected by Part III, including the\n            right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a>, privacy is\n            not an absolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy\n            will have to withstand the touchstone of permissible\n            restrictions on fundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article\n            21</a> an invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis of a\n            law which stipulates a procedure which is fair, just and\n            reasonable. The law must also be valid with reference to the\n            encroachment on life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21.</a>\n            An invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the\n            threefold requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the\n            existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate\n            State aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                           30</span>\n\n\n\n      nexus between the objects and the means adopted to\n      achieve them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">      38. In this context, while permitting an enquiry into\na person&#x27;s paternity vide a DNA test, we must be mindful\nof the collateral infringement of privacy. For this, the\ncourt must satisfy itself that the threshold for the\nabovementioned three conditions is satisfied. If even one\nof these conditions fails, it is considered an unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy and consequently, of life and personal\nliberty as embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_37\">39. Similarly, when dealing with the right to\ndignity, this Court, in <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_62\">X2 v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>), held that\nthe right to dignity encapsulates the right of every\nindividual to be treated as a self-governing entity having\nintrinsic value. It means that every human being\npossesses dignity merely by being a human, and can\nmake self-defining and self-determining choices. Further,\nthis Court held that the right to dignity is intertwined\nwith the right to privacy. This means that a person can\nexercise his right to privacy in order to protect his right\nto dignity and vice-versa. Together, these rights protect\nan individual&#x27;s ability to make the most intimate\ndecisions     regarding    his    life,  including    sexual\nactivity, whether inside or outside the confines of\nmarriage.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">      40. Forcefully undergoing a DNA test would subject\nan individual&#x27;s private life to scrutiny from the outside\nworld. That scrutiny, particularly when concerning\nmatters of infidelity, can be harsh and can eviscerate a\nperson&#x27;s reputation and standing in society. It can\nirreversibly affect a person&#x27;s social and professional life,\nalong with his mental health. On account of this, he has\nthe right to undertake certain actions to protect his\ndignity and privacy, including refusing to undergo a DNA\ntest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">      41. Usually in cases concerning legitimacy, it is the\nchild&#x27;s dignity and privacy that have to be protected, as\nthey primarily come under the line of fire. Though in this\ninstance, the child is a major and is voluntarily\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                             31</span>\n\n\n\nsubmitting himself to this test, he is not the only\nstakeholder bearing personal interest in the results,\nwhatever they may be. The effects of social stigma\nsurrounding an illegitimate child make their way into the\nparents&#x27; lives as there may be undue scrutiny owing to\nthe alleged infidelity. It is in this backdrop that the\nAppellant&#x27;s right to privacy and dignity have to be\nconsidered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">       42. Moreover, the Respondent is already declared to be\nthe legitimate son of Mr. Raju Kurian. The fishing enquiry, which\nhe wants through the judicial process is seemingly, not meant to\nbring &#x27;certainty&#x27; to an uncertain event. Rather, it is\npredominantly targeted to harm the Appellant&#x27;s reputation. The\nRespondent knows well who is his &#x27;father&#x27; as per the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">       43. That apart, the courts must also remain abreast with\nthe effects such a probe would have on other relevant\nstakeholders, especially women. Casting aspersions on a\nmarried woman&#x27;s fidelity would ruin her reputation, status, and\ndignity; such that she would be castigated in society. Though in\nthis case, the Respondent&#x27;s mother is actively associated in\npropagating this vexatious litigation, one can only imagine the\nrepercussions in other cases where a child, in utter disregard to\nthe sentiments and self-respect of their mother, initiates\nproceedings seeking a declaration of paternity? The conferment\nof such a right can lead to its potential misuse against\nvulnerable women. They would be put to trial in a court of law\nand the court of public opinion, causing them significant mental\ndistress, among other issues. It is in this sphere that their right\nto dignity and privacy deserve special consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">        44. It must be noted that the law permits only a\npreliminary enquiry into a person&#x27;s private life by allowing the\nparties to bring evidence on record to prove non-access to\ndislodge the presumption of legitimacy. When the law provides\nfor a mode to attain a particular object, that mode must be\nsatisfied. When the evidence submitted does not rebut this\npresumption, the court cannot subvert the law to attain a\nparticular object, by permitting a roving enquiry into a person&#x27;s\nprivate life, such as through a DNA test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">        ...                  ...                 ...\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                   32</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">      D.1.2.2 Eminent need for a DNA test\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">            46. When dealing with the eminent need for a DNA\n      test to prove paternity, this Court balances the interests\n      of those involved and must consider whether it is\n      possible to reach the truth without the use of such a test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">            47. First and foremost, the courts must, therefore,\n      consider the existing evidence to assess the presumption\n      of legitimacy. If that evidence is insufficient to come to a\n      finding, only then should the court consider ordering a\n      DNA test. Once the insufficiency of evidence is\n      established, the court must consider whether ordering a\n      DNA test is in the best interests of the parties involved\n      and must ensure that it does not cause undue harm to the\n      parties. There are thus, two blockades to ordering a DNA\n      test: (i) insufficiency of evidence; and (ii) a positive\n      finding regarding the balance of interests.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                                                  (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThe   Apex   Court,   in   the   afore-quoted   paragraphs   of   IVAN\n\nRATHINAM, elaborates upon imminent need for DNA test and\n\nholds that DNA test should not be ordered as a matter of course.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">While so doing, the Apex Court considers entire spectrum of\n\njudgments on the issue. All those judgments are quoted by the\n\nconcerned Court to allow the application. Therefore, in that light\n\nwhat would prevail is the judgments quoted hereinabove and not\n\nthe ones quoted in the impugned order. Heavy reliance is placed by\n\nthe concerned Court on the judgment in the case of NARAYAN\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                      33</span>\n\n\n\nDUTT TIWARI which is considered by the Apex Court in IVAN\n\nRATHINAM supra.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">        12.

A coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of\n\nDAYANANDA GOWDA S.V. v. R. VENKATAPPA7, has held as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">                                     &quot;....    ....     ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">                12. The plaintiff has filed a suit for partition and separate\n        possession of all the suit schedule properties by metes and\n        bounds and to put the plaintiff in possession and enjoyment of\n        his 1/7th share in the suit schedule properties alleging that he is\n        the son of Venkatappa through his second wife Sundaramma.\n        The defendants produced number of documents to disprove that\n        he is not the son of Venkatappa through second wife. The trial\n        Court proceeded to hold that the plaintiff has specifically\n        pleaded that defendant No.2 is the legally wedded wife of\n        defendant No.1 and his mother Sundaramma was the second\n        wife. Therefore, burden is on the plaintiff to prove that his\n        mother Sundaramma was the second wife of defendant No.1-\n        Venkatappa. The plaintiff is not the biological son of defendant\n        No.1 as there is no exclusive proof regarding legitimacy as per\n        <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. Further, the trial Court held\n        that burden is on the defendants to prove that the mother of the\n        plaintiff Sundaramma was the wife of one Rama Naika.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">7</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">    W.P.No.36322 of 2017 decided on 05-04-2019\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                             34</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">        13. The plaintiff also filed an application under Section\nXXVI Rule 10-A read with <a href=\"/doc/69984823/\" id=\"a_64\">sections 75(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_65\">151</a> of CPC. The\ntrial Court has not come to a definite conclusion whether the\nplaintiff is the son of defendant No.1-Venkatappa through\nSundaramma as alleged by the plaintiff and whether the\nplaintiff&#x27;s original name is Dhudya Naika son of Rama Naika and\nSundaramma was not the second wife of defendant No.1-\nVenkatappa and she is the wife of Rama Naika. Without arriving\nat any conclusion proceeded to reject the application. In view of\ndispute with regard to relationship between the parties and the\nplaintiff has produced certain documents to show that he is the\nson of Venkatappa through second wife Sundaramma. The\ndefendants have also produced number of documents to prove\nthat he is the son of Rama Naika and Sundaramma is not the\nwife of defendant No.1-Venkatappa. There is a serious dispute\nwith regard to the said relationship. In the absence of any proof,\nin a suit for partition, the Court has to appoint a scientific\nperson to conduct DNA as sought for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_43\">14. The learned counsel for the respondents has\nrelied upon the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_66\">Goutam Kundu Vs. State of West Bengal</a>\nreported in 1993 (3) SCC 418, wherein it is held that\nnormally the courts in India cannot order blood test as a\nmatter of course and also cannot be entertained and\nunless there must be a strong prima facie case in that the\nhusband must establish non access in order to dispel the\npresumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\nAct. In the said case, maintenance was sought for against\nthe father of the child where he has disputed the\npaternity of the child. Under those circumstances, the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that the routine blood check\nup should not be allowed and ultimately, it is for the\nhusband to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_68\">Section\n112</a> of the Evidence Act. The said <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_69\">case has no application</a>\nto the facts and circumstances of the present case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">      15. In the instant case, unfortunately both\ndefendant No.1 - Venkatappa and alleged second wife\nSundaramma are dead. Now, the dispute between the\nplaintiff   and  defendants   No.2   to  4    the  legal\nrepresentatives of defendant No.1-Venkatappa is that the\nplaintiff claims to be the legal representative through\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   35</span>\n\n\n\n        second wife. In the absence of any documents, the trial\n        Court ought to have allowed the application filed by the\n        plaintiff. In the absence of any material and any\n        admission made by the defendants, in the peculiar facts\n        and circumstances of the present case, the Court in order\n        to do justice between the parties has to order for\n        appointment of Court Commissioner for DNA test as\n        prayed for. The presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 112</a> of the\n        Evidence Act would not attract in the facts and\n        circumstances of the present case. If appointment of\n        Court Commissioner for scientific investigation of DNA\n        profiling of blood samples of plaintiff and defendant No.3\n        is ordered to prove the plaintiff&#x27;s biological relationship,\n        no prejudice would be caused to the defendants.\n        Admittedly, defendant No.1-Venkatappa and alleged\n        second wife Sundaramma are also dead.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">                                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"111764919\" id=\"span_45\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n        12.2.   The   High     Court    of        Kerala   in   the   case   of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/111764919/\" id=\"a_71\">GANGADHARAN v. SREEDEVI AMMA8</a>, has held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">                                  &quot;....        ....      ....\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_46\">13. From the judgments above referred, this Court\n        notice that, there is absolutely no dearth of power for a\n        Court, be it civil, matrimonial or otherwise to direct the\n        DNA analysis, provided the outcome of the test would\n        prove/disprove one of the grounds based upon which a\n        party may either succeed or lose. However, the most\n        clinching test is the one as expatiated in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_72\">Bhabani Prasad\n        Jena</a> (supra), which is the test of &quot;eminent need&quot;. As held\n        by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in its quest to unearth the\n        truth, the Court can certainly direct to conduct DNA test.\n        However, the court has to exercise its discretion only\n        after balancing the interests of the parties and upon due\n        consideration whether the DNA test is eminently needed\n        for a just decision in the matter. The same cannot be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">8</span>\n    2024 SCC OnLine Ker 2316\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                            36</span>\n\n\n\ndirected as a matter of course or in a routine manner.\nInstead, the Court has to consider diverse aspects; the\npros and cons of such order and also as to whether it is\npossible for the Court to reach a logical conclusion\nwithout use of such test.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">       14. This Court is also impelled to observe that, the\ndesirability of having a DNA test conducted would depend\nupon the facts and circumstances in which it is sought for\nand especially in the context of the relief prayed for. The\nconsideration to be received at the hands of the court for\nan application to conduct DNA analysis differs from each\nother (i) in a case where the husband alleges adultery,\nwhere DNA analysis is sought for to prove such\nallegation/ground of adultery, (ii) in a case where the\nhusband as a defense in matrimonial matter alleges non\naccess to disown the paternity of the child, (iii) in a case\nwhere an application for DNA test is opposed disputing\nthe very existence of the marriage claimed. In Dipawita\nRoy (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in paragraph no.\n13, specifically observed that, the judgments relied on by\nthe counsel for the appellant were on the pointed subject\nof legitimacy of the child born during the subsistence of a\nvalid marriage. The situation will undergo a seachange\nwhen a valid marriage, or for that matter, a marriage\nitself is denied and disputed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_49\">This Court may wind up the\ndiscussion     by   reiterating   and    underscoring    the\nrequirement as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_73\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) and\nalso in Sharda (supra) that to exercise the power of\ndirecting the conduct of a DNA test, the applicant has to\nestablish,    not   merely    a prima   facie case   but   a\nstrong prima facie case, and there should be sufficient\nmaterial before the Court, justifying a request for DNA\nanalysis being allowed.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_95\">       15. Coming to the instant facts, although it is not\ndesirable at this stage of the suit to comment on the quality of\nthe evidence adduced, this Court is constrained to look into the\nevidence adduced to some extent, to ascertain whether the\napplicant/plaintiff had made out a strong prima facie case, so as\nto allow Ext.P3 application for a sibling DNA test. One thing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                             37</span>\n\n\n\nwhich has to be borne in mind is that, what is being enquired\ninto is not whether the plaintiff is the daughter of Kuttikrishnan\nNair. Instead, the true question to be posed is whether the\nmarriage between Kuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma is\nestablished as claimed in the plaint and further, whether the\nplaintiff is a daughter born in that wedlock. One can probe into\nthe latter question only upon establishing the former. The\nquestion is so posed since the plaintiff has no case under\n<a href=\"/doc/284588/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 16</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, as per the pleadings in\nthe plaint. Therefore, evidence as to the marriage between\nKuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma is what is essentially\nrequired to be established in order to ascertain a prima\nfacie case, or for that matter, a strong prima facie case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">        16. Having gone through the evidence adduced by PWs 1\nto 5, this Court is of the prima facie opinion that, the plaintiff\ncould not establish a strong prima facie case in proving a valid\nmarriage between Kuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma. PW1\nis none other than the plaintiff. Even in Ext.P3 application for\nconducting DNA test, her version is that, she came to know\nabout the marriage between Kuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi\nAmma, only as her mother&#x27;s version. The said knowledge of the\nplaintiff is open to criticism as hearsay evidence. Another aspect\nspoken to by the plaintiff is regarding her memory that she was\nliving with Kuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma upto the age\nof five. The veracity of that version has to be cross checked with\nthe evidence adduced by other witnesses as well. It is relevant\nto note that all other witnesses would admit in cross\nexamination that their knowledge about the marriage between\nKuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma is nothing, but hearsay.\nEven the evidence adduced by PW5, the brother of the plaintiff,\ncould not vouchsafe the plaintiff&#x27;s claim that Kuttikrishnan Nair\nmarried Madhavi Amma and that the plaintiff is the daughter\nborn in that wedlock. This Court is not elaborating much on the\nevidence adduced, as the same may have an adverse\nconsequence on the fate of the suit itself. Suffice to say that,\na prima facie case, much less a strong prima facie case, has not\nbeen borne out to order a DNA test as sought for in Ext.P3.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">       17. Another aspect which weighs with this Court to\ninterfere with Ext.P12 order is the pleadings as contained in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                             38</span>\n\n\n\nExt.P3 application to the effect that the impugned marriage took\nplace 81 years back, that no one who witnessed the marriage\nare alive and that there exists no way to prove the marriage,\nexcept through a DNA analysis. It appears that, the plaintiff is\ncompletely misconceived in seeking a DNA analysis for the\nafore-stated reasons. As already held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt, the existence of a strong prima facie case is a sine qua\nnon to seek conduct of the DNA test. Here, in Ext.P3, the\nplaintiff/applicant herself admits that there exists no evidence,\nexcept the aspect sought to be proved by DNA analysis to prove\nthat the plaintiff is the daughter of Madhavi Amma through\nKuttikrishnan Nair and consequentially, their marriage. That\napart, it is questionable as to why the plaintiff did not choose to\nraise her claim during the life time of her mother Madhavi\nAmma, though Kuttikrishnan Nair passed away in the year\n1987. The present suit was instituted when the plaintiff was\naged 74 and therefore, none else can be blamed for dearth of\nevidence through those persons, who according to the plaintiff\nhad witnessed the so-claimed marriage. At any rate, the\nresultant situation cannot be propounded as a reason to seek a\nsibling DNA test.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_98\">       18. It is of seminal important to note that, DNA analysis,\neven if allowed, will not establish the marriage between\nKuttikrishnan Nair and Madhavi Amma. At best, it may prove\nthat the plaintiff is the daughter of Kuttikrishnan Nair. The proof\nof the same, by itself, would not carry the plaintiff anywhere.\nThe prayer is one for partition. The claim is that, Kuttikrishnan\nNair married Madhavi Amma and plaintiff is their daughter. The\nfurther claim is that, during the subsistence of the marriage,\nKuttikrishnan Nair maintained relationship with Lakshmi Appissi,\nin which relation the defendants are born. The above aspect is\nhighlighted only to point out that, the plaintiff has no claim even\nunder <a href=\"/doc/284588/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 16</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, as per the\npleadings. Now, assume for a moment, that such a plea is\npermitted to be taken as an alternative one. Still, the existence\nof a ceremonious/customary marriage is again a sine qua non to\nmaintain a claim under <a href=\"/doc/284588/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 16</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nSee in this regard, a Division Bench Judgment of this court\nin Jayachandran v. Valsala [(2016) 2 KLT 81].\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                     39</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">               19. In the light of the above discussion, this Court finds\n        that Ext.P12 order cannot be sustained. This court finds that,\n        one cannot seek DNA test to be done only in his/her attempt to\n        fish out evidence in support of his case. Unless and until the\n        applicant makes out a strong prima facie case, such an\n        application is not liable to be allowed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_53\">In arriving at the above\n        conclusion, this Court also considers the devastating effect [as\n        pointed out in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_77\">Bhabani Prasad Jena</a> (supra)] on the children of\n        Lakshmi Appissi (the defendants in the suit), more so, when all\n        the witnesses - except the plaintiff - would admit that Lakshmi\n        Appissi is believed to be the legally wedded wife of Kuttikrishnan\n        Nair by the people in the locality. This Original Petition\n        succeeds. Ext.P12 order is set aside. The trial court will now\n        proceed with the matter, in accordance with law, untrammelled\n        by any of the observations contained in this judgment.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">                                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24554625\" id=\"span_54\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\n        12.3. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh then in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/24554625/\" id=\"a_78\">MEDIDA VEERAIAH @ VEERA REDDY v. MEDIDA VIJAYA\n\nNARASIMHA RAO9</a> has held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">                                    &quot;....    ....    ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">               27. On consideration of the judgements <a href=\"/doc/24554625/\" id=\"a_79\">referred above</a>, it\n        is obvious that a DNA test can be ordered in appropriate cases\n        where there is necessity. It is also clear that a DNA test cannot\n        be ordered in a routine manner. The facts and circumstances\n        of each case have to be taken into consideration for\n        ordering DNA test. The parties have to bring their prima\n        facie evidence on record to show their relationship. If the\n        court is not satisfied with the prima facie evidence, then\n        the court may order DNA test in appropriate cases by\n        following the <a href=\"/doc/24554625/\" id=\"a_80\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/24554625/\" id=\"a_81\">laid down in</a></a> the judgements <a href=\"/doc/24554625/\" id=\"a_82\">referred\n        above</a>. The court cannot merely order DNA test on mere\n        asking of the parties to decide the relationship. Generally\n        in criminal cases, and matrimonial offences, DNA test is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">9</span>\n    2018 SCC OnLine Hyd 380\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                              40</span>\n\n\n\nbeing ordered. In cases like partition and civil disputes,\nCourts are slow in ordering DNA test; the reasons being\nthat there is a presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_83\">section 112</a> of Indian\nEvidence Act with regard to the paternity. The petitioner\nhas to come forward with specific denial of his paternity,\nand his prima facie case to prove his paternity, and then\nonly he can ask the court for a DNA test. There are\ndisadvantages in ordering DNA test in some cases. The DNA test\nasked in this case by the petitioner who claims to be son of\nrespondent No. 1. This is a case where the petitioner is raised\nabout 35 years. There must be prima facie some material to\nconnect the relationship with the petitioner and the\n1st respondent. It is obvious that the trial Court has not\nconsidered any prima facie case brought by the petitioner on\nrecord. There is no discussion with regard to the relationship\nbetween the petitioner and respondent No. 1 basing on any\ndocuments. The trial Court has merely passed an order stating\nthat as there is a dispute between the petitioner and respondent\nNo. 1 with regard to paternity, the DNA test is ordered. In the\nlight of the above decisions of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that\na DNA test cannot be ordered in a routine manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">       28. This is a case where the trial Court has very casually,\nin a routine manner, ordered DNA test, without considering the\nprime facie case of the petitioner, without discussing the\nmaterial placed before the Court, and the contents of the\npleadings therein. It is also pertinent to note that the trial Court\nhas not appointed a Commissioner for the said purpose as per\nthe provisions under Order XXVI Rule 10, or <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_84\">Rule 10A of CPC</a>.\nThere are no specific directions to the Commission as to what he\nhas to do for conducting a DNA test. There are no reasons given\nfor allowing the petition filed for seeking DNA test. The order\npassed by the trial Court is not based on any plausible\nreasoning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">      29. It is also pertinent to note that the personal liberty of\nan individual is at stake in cases of ordering DNA testing. The\nconsent of the party whose blood samples are to be drawn is\nrequired. The court may not, in all cases, direct taking of blood\nsamples from the respondent without his consent. At this\njuncture, it is appropriate to see the standard of proof that is\nrequired in each case. In a criminal case the standard of proof is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                             41</span>\n\n\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. In a civil case, it is preponderance of\nprobabilities. Therefore, the standard of proof in a criminal case\nis different from the standard of proof in a civil case. As far as\nthe ordering of DNA test is concerned, in my opinion, the Court\nhas to see the requirement of standard of proof; in civil cases,\nthe standard of proof being preponderance of probabilities.\nWhen there is a presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 112</a> of Evidence Act,\nthe parties have to produce evidence to prima facie show that\nthe presumption can be invoked. The parties may lead evidence\nto rebut the said presumption as the presumption is a\nrebuttable presumption. At this juncture the reference of\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act assumes importance. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n112</a> of Evidence Act reads as under;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">            Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of\n      legitimacy.--\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">            The fact that any person was born during the\n      continuance of a valid marriage between his mother\n      and any man, or within two hundred and eighty\n      days after its dissolution, the mother remaining\n      unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the\n      legitimate son of that man, unless it can be shown\n      that the parties to the marriage had no access to\n      each other at any time when he could have been\n      begotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">       30. To prove paternity, there is a presumption in\nfavour of the person who is claiming paternity. The\npetitioner has to bring on record the material to raise the\nsaid presumption. In case the petitioner fails to bring any\nmaterial prima facie to show that there is a nexus\nbetween the respondent No. 1 and the petitioner&#x27;s\nmother, there is no point in ordering a DNA test. A\nstranger who is not having a connection cannot be\ndirected to undergo a test. Therefore, the petitioner has to\ncome out with a prima facie case that there is a marriage\nbetween his parents, or that there is a relationship between his\nparents which led to his birth. In the instant case, there is no\nmaterial considered by the trial Court as to the nature of\nrelationship between the petitioner&#x27;s mother and the\n1st respondent. The 1st respondent is denying his relationship\nwith the mother of the petitioner; and in such a case the burden\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                   42</span>\n\n\n\n      is on the petitioner to show that there is prima facie evidence to\n      rebut the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">             31. In the instant case, the petitioner is raised\n      about 35 years. There must be lot of material available to\n      him to prima facie show that he is the son of the\n      1st defendant. The trial Court ought to have considered all\n      the material to come to a conclusion that there is prima\n      facie relationship between the petitioner&#x27;s mother and\n      the respondent No. 1 before ordering DNA test. Without\n      there being any formal proof of relationship or connection\n      between the parties, it does not appear that there is any\n      reason for ordering a DNA test. In such cases if DNA test\n      is ordered without there being any prima facie proof of\n      her relationship between the parties in a case like this\n      where the petitioner claims that he&#x27;s 35 years old,\n      without producing any record that he is related to the\n      defendant No. 1, it is not appropriate to order a DNA\n      test.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">                                                (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">      13. On a blend of the judgments rendered by the Apex Court\n\nand different High Courts, what would unmistakably emerge is, the\n\ncaution of the Apex Court followed by other High Courts that\n\ncompelling such tests without imminent need, imperils not only the\n\nsanctity of marriage, but legitimacy of the child and also becomes\n\nviolative of the fundamental rights to privacy and dignity, as\n\nobtaining under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                43</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_111\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115378200\" id=\"span_60\">14. The learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs places\n\nreliance upon a judgment rendered by the coordinate Bench, which\n\naffirms DNA Test being allowed by the concerned Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/115378200/\" id=\"a_90\">MOHAMMED REFEEQ v. S. MOHAMMED FAIROZ AHAMED</a>\n\nrendered in W.P.No.52855 of 2019 decided on 10-01-2024. The\n\nperson whose blood sample was sought to be taken for DNA test\n\nhad voluntarily filed an application to know the biological root. The\n\nsaid judgment is distinguishable without much ado, as defendants 1\n\nand 3 have objected to the application before the concerned Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">       15. In the light of the foregoing analysis, the following\n\nconclusions would emerge:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">   •   <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act is steeped in\n       the maxim pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant - the\n       father is he whom the marriage indicates, which would\n       mean the presumption of legitimacy of a child born\n       during lawful wedlock.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">   •   The blood test - DNA test must be permitted only in\n       terms of the rigor of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act,\n       which would be a demonstrable non-access during the\n       period of birth of the child, as the presumption under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                  44</span>\n\n\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 112</a> is rooted in public morality and societal\n       peace.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">   •   The Court answering an application must bear in mind the\n       interwoven delicate balance between the test, right to\n       privacy and dignity, as ordained in the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">   •   The concerned Court must not for the asking permit DNA\n       test, unless the condition stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 112</a> is fulfilled,\n       which would be pleading and proving of non-access at the\n       relevant point in time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">   •   In the case at hand, plethora of marital disputes existed\n       between defendants 1 and 2 for ages. The child is born from\n       the said wedlock. The concerned Court has blissfully ignored\n       this fact.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">   •   Therefore, the Courts answering the application shall strictly\n       adhere to the law, as narrated in the course of the order.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">       16. Tested on the anvil of the preceding analysis, the\n\nconcerned Court ignores every tenet; there was no imminent need\n\nfor conducting a DNA test; the order ignores the purport of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_95\">Section\n\n112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and presumption of paternity is\n\ngiven a go-bye.     No material is placed before the Court depicting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                   45</span>\n\n\n\nnon-access at the time of birth. In the absence of any pleading of\n\nthe kind, the concerned Court has treated the DNA test as a\n\nfrolicsome act and ordered as a matter of course. Right to privacy\n\nand dignity is lost sight of.          Therefore, on all the aforesaid\n\ncircumstances, the order of the concerned Court is rendered\n\nunsustainable and unsustainability would lead to its obliteration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">      17.
