It is further asserted\n                    that it was only upon discovering that the impugned series was based\n                    on contents of the Book authored by defendant Nos. 4 and 5 that he\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                    Page 5 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    purchased a copy of the same on 08 January 2023 and upon reading\n                    the same, discovered that it was replete with false and libellous\n                    statements. These facts and assertions are evident from a reading of\n                    paragraph 81 of the plaint. In paragraph 81, the plaintiff further\n                    asserts that the aforesaid events are causing and will cause loss of\n                    reputation, humiliation, stigmatisation and irreparable injury. It is\n                    further asserted that if the web series were to be published, it would\n                    also have a deleterious effect on the outcome of the revision petitions\n                    which are pending before this Court and arise out of the evidence\n                    tampering case. In the plaint, the plaintiff asserts in paragraph 26 as\n                    follows: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                               ―26. It is a matter of record that the impugned series is\n                              purportedly based on the Impugned Book. It is stated that the\n                              Book was published and released in 2016 i.e. at the time when\n                              the review petitions re: Main Uphaar case were still pending\n                              before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India.

It is further asserted that\n                    while the plaintiff was ultimately convicted for the offence of causing\n                    death by negligence referable to <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC, the Book\n                    carries various defamatory statements including allegations that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                           Page 6 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    plaintiff is a murderer and a killer. According to the plaintiff, a series\n                    which is based on the Book would necessarily result in infringing the\n                    right of privacy guaranteed to the plaintiff quite apart from causing\n                    irreparable harm to his reputation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                    9.     Appearing for the plaintiff, Mr. Agarwal, learned senior counsel\n                    had while taking the Court through some of the extracts of the Book\n                    contended that since it contains libellous statements and allegations\n                    against the plaintiff, it is manifest that the web series would follow an\n                    identical tenor and thus clearly establishing the allegation of\n                    defamation that has been levelled by the plaintiff. It was submitted\n                    that the manner in which the entire incident has been portrayed in the\n                    Book is clearly at variance with the facts which came to be recorded\n                    in the course of trial and that a reading of its contents would establish\n                    that they have been made in reckless disregard of the concurrent\n                    findings which came to be returned against the plaintiff in the course\n                    of the criminal trial. Mr. Agarwal laid emphasis on the fact that the\n                    trailer of the series had already garnered approximately 1.5 million\n                    views and is being widely shared on various online platforms. Learned\n                    senior counsel argued that the reach and impact of the visual medium\n                    has always been recognised as being far greater than that of a written\n                    work. Mr. Agarwal contended that the Court must necessarily take\n                    into consideration the impact which the web series is likely to have\n                    and cause irreversible harm and prejudice to the plaintiff.   It was thus\n                    urged that an immediate and a pre-broadcast injunction is clearly\n                    warranted.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                  Page 7 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">15:48:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">                    10.    Referring to the description of the series as appearing on the\n                    official web page of defendant No. 3, it was submitted by Mr.\n                    Agarwal that the reference to a ―25 year long battle‖ clearly\n                    demonstrates that the web series is likely to negatively impact and\n                    prejudice the trial of the evidence tampering case also. It was in that\n                    context that it was asserted that the streaming of the impugned series\n                    would not only cause reputational damage to the plaintiff but also\n                    unfairly prejudice its case in the pending revision petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                    11.    Appearing for defendant No. 3, Mr. Nayar and Mr. Sibal,\n                    learned senior counsels, submitted that the production of the web\n                    series which is to be ultimately aired on 13 January 2023 was a fact\n                    which was duly publicised right from 18 December 2019. Learned\n                    senior counsels have placed for the consideration of the Court various\n                    press releases and articles which had appeared at the relevant time and\n                    alluded to the production of the web series based on the Book written\n                    by defendant Nos. 4 and 5. Mr. Nayar had also referred to various\n                    articles which had been published in leading newspapers in this\n                    respect. It was further pointed out that the trial and conviction of the\n                    plaintiff was a fact which had been widely reported in various\n                    newspapers during the course of the criminal proceedings. It was\n                    further pointed out that the fact that the Supreme Court had ultimately\n                    provided no jail term, except the term already undergone, to the\n                    plaintiff and other convicts and had merely imposed a fine were facts\n                    which were also widely reported and available in the public domain.\n                    Learned senior counsel had also drawn the attention of the Court to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                  Page 8 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    various articles which appeared in leading newspapers reporting the\n                    conviction of the plaintiff in the evidence tampering case. These\n                    newspaper articles had been published way back in November 2021.\n                    It was then pointed out that defendant No. 3 had on 14 December\n                    2022 itself disclosed its intent to broadcast the impugned web series\n                    on its OTT platform with effect from 13 January 2023. The aforesaid\n                    announcement by defendant No. 3 was also reported in leading\n                    newspapers. The submission in essence was that the plaintiff was\n                    clearly not entitled to ad-interim injunction having chosen to approach\n                    the Court at the last minute. Learned senior counsel further referred to\n                    the Disclaimer to be carried as part of the web series and submitted\n                    that it had been duly clarified that the web series was inspired by the\n                    Book authored by defendant Nos. 4 and 5 and that since it was a work\n                    of fiction, any resemblance or similarity of characters was purely\n                    unintentional and co-incidental.

It would be appropriate to first consider the portions which\n                               have been extracted by the respondent in her plaint as derogatory\n                               and defamatory. It is not seriously disputed before us on behalf of\n                               learned counsel for the respondent that as mentioned in the chart,\n                               other than the three passages complained of, the others had\n                               already been commented upon and published in previous\n                               magazines and books. We have considered the submissions of\n                               learned counsel for the respondent that the languagte for\n                               expressing the subject matter gives a different connotation than\n                               what was published earlier. We are unable to agree with the said\n                               submission advanced on behalf of counsel for the respondent. The\n                               words may not be exact but the concept and meaning sought to be\n                               conveyed are more or less same, if a comparison is made of the\n                               passages complained of and the publications in India Today of\n                               April 15, 1982, April 30, 1982, Pupul Jaykar&#x27;s and Ved Mehta&#x27;s\n                               book. In so far other three passages are concerned the author has\n                               owned up to the statements on the basis of either the information\n                               which he has or as his own views and comments. The question\n                               thus to be considered is the effect of such prior publications on\n                               the claim made by the respondent in respect of these publications.\n                               There is force in the submission of the learned counsel for the\n                               appellants that not only was there wide publicity about these\n                               aspects in view of the same relating to the then first family of the\n                               nation but the respondent possibly drew strength from the media\n                               to put forth her point of view against what she claimed was the\n                               injustice meted out to her by her late mother-in-law. Thus the\n                               controversy in question which is being commented upon did not\n                               really remain in the four walls of the house but drew wide\n                               publicity and comments even to the extent of poll surveys being\n                               carried out in respect of the controversy in question.

The controversy in question related to the\n                            disputes between the respondent and her late mother-in-law, the\n                            then Prima Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi. The respondent did not\n                            make grievance about the reporting of their disputes in the press.\n                            The nature of controversy was more or less the same as is now\n                            sought to be published by appellant No. 1 in his autobiography\n                            and thus the respondent cannot make a grievance of the same\n                            matter now being published so as to seek prevention of the\n                            publication itself.

Needless to add that the\n                            remedy of damages against the appellant is still not precluded in\n                            so far the respondent is concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                            60.

The interim order\n                            granted by the learned single Judge is a pre-publication\n                            injunction. The contents of subject matter had been reported\n                            before and the author stands by the same. In view of this we are of\n                            the considered view that the respondent cannot make a grievance\n                            so as to prevent the publication itself when the remedy is\n                            available to her by way of damages.

It would not be appropriate to do so for us at this\n                            stage but what we do observe is that the statements are not of such\n                            a nature as to grant injunction even from publication of the\n                            material when the appellants are willing to face the consequences\n                            in a trial in case the same are held to be defematory and the pleas\n                            of the appellants of truth are analysed by the trial Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                            61.

However, the question is not of\n                            the documents being public documents but the subject matter\n                            being in the ambit of public domain in terms of there being prior\n                            reporting of the matter in controversy and the comments on the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                         Page 11 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                            same. It may be useful at this stage to consider the judgment\n                            in Phoolan Devi&#x27;s case (supra) rendered by learned single Judge\n                            of this Court. On a careful reading of the judgment it is apparent\n                            that the matter in question was peculiar as it related to the rights\n                            being claimed to show a woman being raped and gang-raped if\n                            the concerned woman was alive and did not want this to be made\n                            public. It was in those circumstances that the order was passed\n                            though we may add that subsequently on an apparent settlement\n                            the same was made public and the plaintiff therein was\n                            compensated in terms of the mutual settlement. In fact the learned\n                            single Judge specifically dealt with this aspect and observed that\n                            the display and the graphic details of being paraded nude, raped\n                            and gang raped does not only hurt the feelings, mutilate the soul,\n                            denigrate the person but reduce the victim to a situation of\n                            emotional abandonment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                            62. An important aspect to be examined is the claim of right of\n                            privacy advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent to\n                            seek the preventive injunction. This aspect was exhaustively dealt\n                            with in the case of Auto Shankar reported as R. Rajagopal&#x27;s\n                            case (supra). The Supreme Court while considering these aspects\n                            clearly opined that there were two aspects of the right of privacy.\n                            The first aspect was the general law of privacy which afforded\n                            tortuous action for damages from unlawful invasion of privacy. In\n                            the present case we are not concerned with the same as the suit for\n                            damages is yet to be tried. The second aspect, as per the Supreme\n                            Court, was the Constitutional recognition given to the right of\n                            privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful\n                            governmental action. This also is not the situation in the present\n                            case as we are concerned with the inter se rights of the two\n                            citizens and not a governemntal action. It was in the context of the\n                            first aspect that the Supreme Court had given the illustration of\n                            the life story written. Whether laudatory or otherwise and\n                            published without the consent of the person concerned. The\n                            learned counsel for the respondent Mr. Raj Panjwani, sought to\n                            draw strangth from this aspect i.e. the lack of consent of the\n                            respondent to publish her life story in the autobiography written\n                            by appellant No. 1. However, this will give rise to tortuous action\n                            for damages as per the Supreme Court since this is the aspect\n                            which is concerned with the first aspect dealt with by the Supreme\n                            Court in respect of the invasion of privacy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                            64. It is also relevant to state that the Supreme Court in R.\n                            Rajagopal&#x27;s case (supra) was concerned with the preventive\n                            action sought for by governmental authorities.

The remedy would\n                            thus be by way of damages and not an order of restraint.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                            67. We are unable to accept the contention advanced on behalf of\n                            the respondent by Mr. Raj Panjwari that if the statements relate to\n                            private lives of persons, nothing more is to be said and the\n                            material must be injuncted from being published unless it is with\n                            the consent of the person whom the subject matter relates to. Such\n                            pre-censorship cannot be countenanced in the scheme of our\n                            constitutional framework. There is also some force in the\n                            submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the prior\n                            publication having occurred much prior to the suit being filed, the\n                            principle denying the relief for interlocutory injunction where the\n                            plaintiff has been dilatory in making the application, as observed\n                            in the Indian Express Newspaper&#x27;s case (supra) would also apply\n                            to the present case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                            69.

There is no doubt that even\n                            what may be the private lives of public figures become matters of\n                            public interest. This is the reason that when the controversy had\n                            erupted there was such wide publicity to the same including in the\n                            two editions of India Today. As observed in Silkin v. Beaverbrook\n                            Newspapers Ltd.

In the present case the first plea is that the statement is not\n                            defamatory apart from the fact that it has been published and\n                            commented upon in the past.

We are,\n                               however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency\n                               [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule,\n                               viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\n                               abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to\n                               the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n                               press/media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">                               (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above --\n                               indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In\n                               the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or\n                               for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply\n                               not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to\n                               the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where\n                               the publication is based upon facts and statements which are\n                               not true, unless the official establishes that the publication\n                               was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for\n                               truth.

Mr. Sethi, learned counsel appearing for the production house,\n                    the defendant Nos. 1 and 2 here, submitted that the role attributed to\n                    the plaintiff and the facts which ultimately led to their conviction\n                    constitutes material which has always remained and existed in the\n                    public domain and therefore, the prayer for grant of ad interim reliefs\n                    is misconceived. Referring to the findings as returned by the Supreme\n                    Court in its final judgment in Sushil Ansal vs. State5, Mr. Sethi drew\n                    the attention of the Court to the scathing observations and findings\n                    that had come to be returned and recorded against the plaintiff. This,\n                    according to Mr. Sethi, is evident from the following passages of the\n                    aforesaid decision: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                 &quot;122. The question then is whether the negligence of the Ansal\n                                brothers, the occupiers of the Cinema, was so gross so as to be\n                                culpable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 304-A</a> IPC. Our answer to that question\n                                is in the affirmative. The reasons are not far to seek:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                                122.1. In the first place the degree of care expected from an\n                                occupier of a place which is frequented every day by hundreds\n                                and if not thousands is very high in comparison to any other\n                                place that is less frequented or more sparingly used for public\n                                functions. The higher the number of visitors to a place and the\n                                greater the frequency of such visits, the higher would be the\n                                degree of care required to be observed for their safety. The duty\n                                is continuing which starts with every exhibition of\n                                cinematograph and continues till the patrons safely exit from the\n                                cinema complex.

The need\n                            for high degree of care for the safety of the visitors to such\n                            public places offering entertainment is evident from the fact that\n                            Parliament has enacted the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_17\">Cinematograph Act</a> and the Rules,\n                            which       cast     specific       obligations      upon      the\n                            owners/occupiers/licensees with a view to ensuring the safety of\n                            those frequenting such places. The annual inspections and the\n                            requirements of no-objection certificates to be obtained from the\n                            authorities concerned is yet another indicator of how important\n                            the law considers the safety of the patrons to be. Any question as\n                            to the nature and the extent of breach must therefore be seen in\n                            the backdrop of the above duties and obligations that arise both\n                            under the common law and the statutory provisions alike.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">                            122.2. Judged in the above backdrop it is evident that the\n                            occupiers in the present case had shown scant regard both for\n                            the letter of the law as also their duty under the common law to\n                            care for the safety of their patrons. The occupiers not only\n                            committed deviations from the sanctioned building plan that\n                            heightened the dangers to the safety of the visitors but continued\n                            to operate the Cinema in contemptuous disregard for the\n                            requirements of law in the process exposing the patrons to a\n                            high degree of risk to their lives which some of them eventually\n                            lost in the incident in question. Far from taking any additional\n                            care towards safety of the visitors to the Cinema the occupiers\n                            asked for permission to place additional seats that further\n                            compromised the safety requirements and raised the level of\n                            risks to the patrons.

It was submitted that the contents\n                    thereof was based on the perception of two parents who had lost their\n                    teenaged children in the tragedy and how, according to them, the\n                    justice system itself had failed to punish the guilty adequately.

Mr. Pahwa\n                    submitted that the plaintiff is in any case not entitled to the grant of\n                    injunctive or equitable reliefs since the suit itself is based on a\n                    concealment of a material fact, namely, of the plaintiff having\n                    complete knowledge of the publication of the Book way back in 2016\n                    itself.

Mr. Pahwa drew\n                    the attention of the Court to paragraph 3 of the said application in\n                    which it was alleged that as per media reports, the plaintiff was on the\n                    verge of fleeing the country and disposing off his assets. It was\n                    pointed out that the aforesaid assertion was based on reports which\n                    had been published in the Tehelka Magazine in its issue dated 15\n                    December 2016. It becomes relevant to note that in the said article, a\n                    reference was specifically made to the Book authored by defendant\n                    Nos. 4 and 5 and how the entire story was based on their opinion of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                               Page 18 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    the system having woefully failed them at all times. In view of the\n                    above, it was contended by Mr. Pahwa that it would be wholly\n                    incorrect for the plaintiff to assert that he derived knowledge of the\n                    aforesaid Book only on or about 08 January 2023.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">                    16.    Ms. Bhandari, learned counsel appearing for the publishing\n                    house, submitted that from the contents of paragraph 26 and 28 of the\n                    plaint, it is manifest that the plaintiff was fully aware of the Book\n                    which has been in circulation right from 2016. It was contended that\n                    the impugned Book is liable to be appreciated and viewed bearing in\n                    mind the experience of the two parents who had lost their teenaged\n                    children in the tragedy. According to Ms. Bhandari, the contents of\n                    the Book were liable to be duly published and disseminated in order to\n                    enable the public to derive complete knowledge of all aspects relating\n                    to the ghastly incident which had led to 59 innocent persons losing\n                    their lives. Ms. Bhandari had also placed for the perusal of the Court\n                    a series of articles which had come to be published in all leading\n                    newspapers in respect of the Uphaar Cinema Tragedy and the\n                    unrelenting fight of the parents for justice. The Court was also shown\n                    articles which appeared in leading newspapers carrying reviews of the\n                    Book authored by defendant Nos. 4 and 5 as well as various\n                    interviews which were conducted and which had chronicled their\n                    unflinching fight to obtain justice. Those articles, according to Ms.\n                    Bhandari, constitute irrefutable evidence of the Book being in\n                    circulation since 2016 and its theme and content being matters of\n                    public knowledge. This according to learned counsel clearly\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                               Page 19 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">15:48:14</span>\n                                         Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    disentitles the plaintiff from the grant of any ad interim relief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"94574896\" id=\"span_116\">17.       It was then contended that the only statements which are alleged\n                    to be defamatory and form part of the contents of the Book are those\n                    which are set forth in the plaint. In view of the aforesaid, it was her\n                    submission that the plaintiff cannot possibly be permitted to rely upon\n                    any other passages or extracts of the said Book in support of his\n                    allegation that he had been defamed. As a defendant, according to Ms.\n                    Bhandari, the publishing house would be obliged only to respond to\n                    various allegations and averments which are made in the plaint.\n                    According to learned counsel, a defendant is neither obliged nor\n                    expected to reply to documents that may be filed in the suit. Ms.\n                    Bhandari argued that the allegation of defamation is thus liable to be\n                    tried only in respect of the extracts which have been set out in the\n                    plaint. Those, according to learned counsel, cannot possibly be\n                    construed as being defamatory.

At the outset, it would be apposite to recall the fundamental\n                    precepts which govern the grant of ad interim injunctive relief. Apart\n                    from the often repeated trinity test of prima facie case, balance of\n                    convenience and irreparable injury, courts are also bound to weigh in\n                    consideration whether the issuance of the injunction would cause\n                    greater harm and perpetuate injustice, the time when the plaintiff first\n                    derived knowledge of the offending material, whether the plaintiff, if\n                    not having acquiesced, remained inert or failed to take proactive\n                    action for protection of its rights and whether it has approached the\n                    Court in good faith. These aspects assume greater significance when\n                    what is sought is a pre-publication or broadcast injunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">                    19.    A pre-publication or broadcast injunction would essentially be\n                    sought at a stage when the offending material is either unavailable to\n                    be comprehensively reviewed and assessed or where it is alleged that\n                    there is a grave, imminent and immediate possibility of violation of\n                    rights. In such a situation the following factors would clearly be\n                    entitled to be accorded primacy- the promptitude with which the\n                    plaintiff approaches the Court, its obligation to establish, at least\n                    prima facie, that the impending publication/broadcast is completely\n                    divorced from the truth, replete with falsehood, or evidences an\n                    imminent vilification of the individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                    20.    If the Court finds that the plaintiff has either failed to initiate\n                    action with promptitude or approached the court at the first available\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                   Page 21 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    opportunity, that would be a circumstance which would weigh heavily\n                    against the grant of an ad interim injunction. Further, if the court were\n                    to find that the material which is likely to be broadcast or published\n                    already exists in the public domain and has existed as such for a\n                    considerable period of time without an objection having been raised,\n                    that too would detract from the right of the plaintiff to seek ad interim\n                    injunctive relief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                    21.    On a more fundamental plane, the Court would also take into\n                    consideration the imperatives of striking a balance between the\n                    aspects of freedom of speech and expression, the dissemination of\n                    information amongst the public at large on the one hand and the injury\n                    likely to be caused to the individual. It is in the above context that\n                    courts have formulated the ―high pedestal‖ test when it comes to the\n                    grant of a pre-publication or broadcast injunction. Courts have\n                    deliberately formulated the high threshold test because the injunction\n                    would essentially be sought at a stage when the offending material is\n                    either not available to be evaluated and examined or where it is\n                    impracticable to arrive at even a prima facie conclusion whether the\n                    content is defamatory or libelous. Courts at that stage are essentially\n                    left to grapple at straws, called to base their decisions on\n                    unsubstantiated and unproven allegations and essentially asked to\n                    issue a restraint on the assumption that what would be published or\n                    broadcast would be defamatory, slanderous or amounting to libel.\n                    Such a tenuous approach cannot possibly be countenanced when a\n                    court of law is called upon to grant injunctive or equitable relief.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                  Page 22 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">15:48:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                    22.      It is in light of the aforesaid that it is imperative that the\n                    plaintiff be held to be bound and obliged to establish a strong prima\n                    facie case as a critical and essential pre-condition. Secondly, such a\n                    plaintiff must be held bound to establish that what is about to be\n                    published or broadcast is fundamentally removed from the truth,\n                    denigratory or slanderous. In the absence of the aforesaid tests being\n                    met, an injunction would justifiably be refused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">                    23.      When the aforesaid basic precepts are applied to the facts of the\n                    present case, the Court finds itself unable to hold in favour of the\n                    plaintiff for reasons which follow.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                    24.      The Court at the outset notes that the web series in question is\n                    yet to be aired. It has thus had no occasion to view the same in its\n                    entirety. It would be wholly inappropriate to grant injunctive reliefs at\n                    the ad interim stage even before the fictional work is viewed and\n                    properly examined in its entirety. In the absence of the aforesaid\n                    material being available to be viewed or examined it would also be\n                    inexpedient to even venture to return prima facie findings with respect\n                    to the allegation of the plaintiff that the series would carry defamatory\n                    and vilifying statements. The Court also takes into consideration the\n                    Disclaimer which is proposed to preface the web series and which\n                    merely claims to be &quot;inspired&quot; by the Book authored by defendants 4\n                    and 5.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                    25.      If the claim for ad interim relief were to be considered\n                    therefore, solely on the basis of the contents of the Book, then too the\n                    plaintiff would clearly not be entitled to ad interim reliefs for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                 Page 23 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    following reasons. Undisputedly the work authored by defendants 4\n                    and 5 was published way back in 2016. This is clearly evident from\n                    the various newspaper articles and media reports which have been\n                    placed for the perusal of the Court. The plaintiff chose, for reasons\n                    best known to him, not to initiate any injunctive action in respect of\n                    the said work when it came to be originally published on 19\n                    September 2016. A slothful or sluggish plaintiff seeking an injunction\n                    of the nature which is sought in these proceedings cannot be allowed\n                    to claim such reliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                    26.    Undisputedly, the horrific incident which occurred on 13 June\n                    1997 has been the subject matter of public debate and discussion since\n                    then. The unimaginable tragedy which unfolded on that date had made\n                    a nation bow its head in shame. The negligent conduct of the plaintiff\n                    is well documented and also fell for adverse comment by our Supreme\n                    Court as would be evident from the extracts of its decision reproduced\n                    hereinabove. Paragraph 122 of <a href=\"/doc/94574896/\" id=\"a_22\">the said decision</a> is an iteration of\n                    avarice and greed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">                    27.    The Court must also necessarily bear in mind at this stage that\n                    the work on which the web series is based has been penned by parents\n                    who had lost teenaged children in the unfortunate incident. It is a story\n                    which alleges a systemic failure, manifests a cry of anguish against the\n                    manner in which the incident was prosecuted and tried. It essentially\n                    represents their perspective and opinion. A fictional rendition of their\n                    trials and tribulations cannot, prima facie, be presumed to be\n                    defamatory. More fundamentally, their personal experience and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                Page 24 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    perception of the incident or the culpability of the plaintiff would\n                    remain their belief, impression and understanding of the entire\n                    episode. Ultimately it would be for a reasonably informed individual\n                    acting upon contemporary standards to form his/her opinion. In any\n                    case and prima facie the Court finds itself unconvinced to record or\n                    arrive at the conclusion that the narrative penned by defendant Nos. 4\n                    and 5 could be said to be wholly fantastical or deprived of a\n                    semblance of the truth as conceived.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                    28.    The Court further finds that information and reportage with\n                    respect to the tragedy which unfolded has remained in circulation for\n                    the past 26 years. Commencing from the date when the First\n                    Information Report came to be recorded and right up to the ultimate\n                    conviction of the plaintiff, the press as well as social media platforms\n                    have consistently tracked and reported developments relating to the\n                    said crime. This material was always available in the public domain.\n                    Prior to the institution of the present proceedings, the plaintiff neither\n                    alleged nor asserted that his right to a fair trial was or had been\n                    prejudiced. This Court is thus of the prima facie opinion that the right\n                    of defendant Nos. 4 and 5 to narrate their tragic journey through\n                    police precincts and court halls far outweighs the asserted and yet\n                    unsubstantiated loss of reputation of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                    29.    Regard must also be had to the fact that the Book itself had\n                    come to be published at a time when the review petitions were\n                    pending before the Supreme Court. It was also in circulation at the\n                    time when the Supreme Court ultimately proceeded to dismiss the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                 Page 25 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    review petitions and while the plaintiff was facing trial in the evidence\n                    tampering case. The plaintiff stood convicted <a href=\"/doc/94574896/\" id=\"a_23\">in that case</a> on 08\n                    October 2021. He chose not to seek any injunctive relief in respect of\n                    the aforesaid Book even at that stage. The Court consequently finds\n                    no justification to consider the grant of an ad interim injunction based\n                    on something which came to be published way back in 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                    30.     The Court also finds itself unable to countenance the\n                    submission of Mr. Agarwal that since a web series is likely to have a\n                    wider circulation and a greater impact than a written work, the grant\n                    of an injunction should be considered at this stage. This since the\n                    plaintiff chose to remain indolent and took no pre-emptive steps in\n                    respect of the said work at the first available opportunity. The Court\n                    consequently finds that there exists no justification to grant ad interim\n                    relief to the plaintiff even after he failed to take appropriate steps for\n                    injunctive reliefs in respect of the Book authored and published in\n                    2016.    As was noted hereinabove, a grant of injunction at an ad\n                    interim or ex parte stage must necessarily be weighed bearing in mind\n                    whether the plaintiff has chosen to approach the Court for relief with\n                    due promptitude. The case of the plaintiff woefully fails on this score.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">                    31.     The Court is also constrained to observe that prima facie the\n                    plaintiff clearly appears to have concealed material facts and practiced\n                    misrepresentation while asserting that he became aware of the\n                    contents of the Book only on or about 08 January 2023. The\n                    disclosures which were made in the application moved by the review\n                    petitioner before the Supreme Court and which was referred to by Mr.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                 Page 26 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">15:48:14</span>\n                                      Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    Pahwa clearly establishes that the work penned by defendants 4 and 5\n                    had been specifically noted and referred to in the article which came\n                    to be published in Tehelka Magazine and formed part of the record of\n                    the said application. The plaintiff stood duly served with the said\n                    application and also appeared through counsel before the Supreme\n                    Court when the same came to be disposed of on 06 December 2016.\n                    In fact, and as the order passed by the Supreme Court on that occasion\n                    would bear out, the plaintiff through its counsel furnished a statement\n                    that they would not leave India till the disposal of the review petitions.\n                    Despite having been duly apprised of the Book which had been\n                    authored by defendant Nos. 4 and 5, the plaintiff, for reasons and\n                    motives unknown, chose not to initiate any action. Prima facie the\n                    Court is of the opinion that the assertion that he came to know about\n                    the contents of the said work only on 08 January 2023 is implausible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                    32.    That then takes the Court to consider whether a pre-broadcast\n                    injunction is liable to be granted in the facts of the present case. As the\n                    Division Bench in Khushwant Singh had noticed and observed, the\n                    right to publish and disseminate information is liable to be treated as\n                    sacrosanct. It had found in the facts of that case that the contents of\n                    the Book in respect of which an injunction had come to be granted and\n                    the various allegations made therein in respect of a public personality,\n                    had been in the public domain and thus clearly disentitled the plaintiff\n                    to the grant of any pre-publication injunction. It had further observed\n                    that the various publications which had referred to incidents and\n                    which had also been alluded to in the offending work clearly indicated\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                  Page 27 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">15:48:14</span>\n                                         Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                    that the material in respect of which an objection had been taken\n                    already existed and was a matter of public knowledge. It was thus\n                    emphasised that while a prior publication may not qualify as a public\n                    document what is important to be borne in mind is whether the subject\n                    matter itself was in the public domain. On applying the aforesaid test\n                    to the facts which obtain here, the Court comes to conclude that the\n                    narrative of the authors was available in the public sphere right from\n                    2016. This clearly disentitles the plaintiff from the grant of ad interim\n                    reliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                    33.       While dealing with the balancing of public interest and the right\n                    of privacy and reputation that may be claimed by an individual it had\n                    been observed by the Court that while considering the aforesaid, a\n                    claim for damages for defamation would be a remedy more suited\n                    than a preventive action for injuncting the publication itself. In\n                    Khushwant Singh, the Division Bench had again reiterated the\n                    imperative of the plaintiff approaching the Court with due dispatch\n                    and on the first available opportunity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117407633\" id=\"span_166\">34.

New technology undoubtedly\n                           poses new challenges. This challenge highlights the necessity of the\n                           Court&#x27;s duty to balance the rights rather than to dilute them. Dr.\n                           Shashi Tharoor (supra) dealt with this aspect, in the light of all the\n                           relevant case law, including the judgment of the High Court of\n                           Australia in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v. O&#x27;neill, 2006\n                           HCA 46.

Undoubtedly, the new age media, especially the electronic media\n                           and internet posts greater challenges. That per se ought not to dilute\n                           valuable right of free speech which, if one may say so, is the\n                           lifeblood of democracy. The salutary and established principle in\n                           issues that concerned free speech are that public figures and public\n                           institutions have to fulfil a very high threshold to seek injunctive\n                           relief in respect of alleged libel or defamation [see <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_26\">R.\n                           Rajagopal</a> (supra)].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1449949\" id=\"span_175\">Also, the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1449949/\" id=\"a_27\">Kartar Singh v.

This court is also of the opinion that the mere frame of\n                           the relief - of permanent injunction does not alter the principle. The\n                           cause of action which the plaintiffs base their suit upon, is alleged\n                           defamation. Therefore, the ordinary principles of injunctive relief, at\n                           the ex parte stage, having regard to the nature of the subject matter,\n                           i.e. restraint of speech, would be the same. Another interpretation\n                           would mean that the plaintiff can at will change the governing\n                           principles, by the mere device of claiming a different relief and\n                           arguing that if refused, the suit would be defeated. It is not\n                           uncommon that in a suit for permanent injunction, the plaintiff is\n                           unable to secure temporary injunction. That per se would not\n                           disentitle the plaintiff, if otherwise entitled, to any relief. Much\n                           depends on what is actually proved.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                           23.

The\n                              possibility of judicial intrusion on that responsibility at the\n                              interlocutory stage had to await another 60 years. As Lord\n                              Coleridge CJ pointed out in Bonnard v Perryman [1891] 2 Ch\n                              269 at 281, [1891-4] All ER Rep 965 at 968 it was not until the\n                              enactment of the Common Law Procedure Act in 1854 that\n                              common law courts acquired the power to grant injunctive relief.\n                              And courts of equity still could not do so because they had no\n                              jurisdiction to adjudicate in libel matters. They had to wait until\n                              the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 when they became the\n                              Chancery Division of the High Court and were thus invested with\n                              power to exercise their traditional injunctive role in the field of\n                              defamation as well as in other actions of tort.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                                 From the earliest days of the courts&#x27; consideration of their\n                              power to grant interlocutory relief in libel cases they seem to have\n                              been guided by two associated notions, one of high principle and\n                              one of principle and practicality. The first is the importance of\n                              protecting the individual&#x27;s right to free speech. The second is an\n                              acknowledgement that the judges should not, save in the clearest\n                              case, usurp the jury&#x27;s role by restraining at the interlocutory stage\n                              publication of a statement that the jury might later find to be no\n                              libel or true or otherwise defensible. Sometimes the second notion\n                              is expressed in the form that a judge should not interfere at the\n                              interlocutory stage unless the evidence before him so clearly\n                              establishes a culpable libel that he is confident that he would have\n                              to set aside a contrary verdict of the jury as perverse.\n                                 It is instructive that Blackstone in his Commentaries on the\n                              Laws of England long before any court of common law\n                              considered the problem, set the scene in the following ringing\n                              tones for the first of those notions, one which was to guide the\n                              grant of interim injunctive relief in libel actions in later years, at\n                              least against the press:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                    9</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                        (1998) 1 All ER 853\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                    CS(OS) 20/2023                                                              Page 31 of 39</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">By:NEHA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">Signing Date:12.01.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">15:48:14</span>\n                                       Neutral Citation Number : 2023/DHC/000205\n\n\n                                    ‗In this, and the other instances which we have lately\n                              considered, where blasphemous, immoral, treasonable,\n                              schismatical, seditious, or scandalous libels are punished by\n                              the English law, some with a greater, others with a less degree\n                              of severity; the liberty of the press, properly understood, is by\n                              no means infringed or violated. The liberty of the press is\n                              indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in\n                              laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in\n                              freedom from censure for criminal matter when published.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                              Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments\n                              he pleases before the public: to forbid this, is to destroy the\n                              freedom of the press: but if he publishes what is improper,\n                              mischievous or illegal, he must take the consequence of his\n                              own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a\n                              licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the\n                              revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the\n                              prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and\n                              infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion,\n                              and government.

To justify the Court in\n                              granting an interim injunction it must come to a decision upon\n                              the question of libel or no libel before the jury decided whether\n                              it was a libel or not.

The right of free\n                              speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals\n                              should possess, and, indeed, that they should exercise without\n                              impediment, so long as no wrongful act is done; and, unless an\n                              alleged libel is untrue, there is no wrong committed; but, on\n                              the contrary, often a very wholesome act is performed in the\n                              publication and repetition of an alleged libel. Until it is clear\n                              that an alleged libel is untrue, it is not clear that any right at all\n                              has been infringed; and the importance of leaving free speech\n                              unfettered is a strong reason in cases of libel for dealing most\n                              cautiously and warily with the granting of interim injunctions\n                              ...
