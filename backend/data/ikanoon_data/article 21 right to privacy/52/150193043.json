That is the Hamletian dilemma of\n\nAnoop, the appellant. He has chosen to drink. He rails at the rules\n\nthat obstruct his passion for the pint, his right to choose, to be let\n\nalone, to privacy, and, of all, his right to life. He claims that the laws\n\nprohibiting alcoholic drinks fall foul of the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed to a citizen, to him. Do they? Our answer: No.\n\nFacts:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      2. Anoop M.S., the appellant, has a profession: he taps rubber\n\ntrees and extracts latex. He taps about 400 trees a day. For this he\n\nworks from 6 in the morning till 2 in the afternoon. Anoop has a\n\nhabit: given what he calls it to be his&quot;hectic work schedule&quot;,he finds\n\nhis solace in &quot;consuming small quantities&quot; of liquor purchased from\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           2</span>\n\nthe retail outlets of Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) and\n\nKerala State Co-operative Federation; that is, the second and third\n\nrespondents. Liquor is his &quot;daily diet.&quot; This daily diet makes Anoop\n\n&quot;rejuvenated,relaxed,&quot; and even &quot;physically fit,&quot;as if it were the elixir\n\nof his life. Anoop is KSBC&#x27;s loyal consumer, so to say.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Grievance:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      3. Before 2014-15, when the Government introduced a new\n\nAbkari Policy (&quot;the New Policy&quot;), Anoop took his daily diet from the\n\n&quot;bar hotels&quot;. Because of the New Policy, now he could not have\n\naccess to bar-hotels but is constrained to buy liquor from the\n\nGovernment outlets. It costs him more!\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      4. According to the Policy, the Government has decided to shut\n\ndown the retail outlets in a phased manner--10% of retail outlets to\n\nbe closed annually as per Clause 2 of the Policy. Clause 2, Anoop\n\naccuses, was introduced with no &quot;specific or scientific study.&quot; Though\n\nthe consumption of liquor is not prohibited in Kerala, the Policy\n\nindirectly prohibits the consumption. The State cannot prohibit a\n\nlawful thing &quot;by introducing a policy.&quot; It ought to be effected only by\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016             3</span>\n\na positive legislative enactment. The Policy is bad in law.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      5. The Government has monopolized the liquor trade. The\n\nState is &quot;enriched by the sale of liquor.&quot; Though KSBC levies\n\nexorbitant taxes and duties on liquor, it provides no quality services\n\nto the customers. The retail outlets closed in a phased-manner, the\n\nremaining outlets struggle to cater to the customers. The queue\n\nlengthening, the consumers must spend over two hours &quot;in\n\nunhealthy and unworthy circumstances&quot; to purchase liquor. The\n\npolicy, in fact, is against the KSBC&#x27;s objectives.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      6. Anoop sanctifies liquor: alcohol has &quot;historical and religious\n\nimportance&quot; in Kerala. It is used in some temples and rituals of\n\nHindu Community, so closing outlets will affect the religious\n\nsentiments of the Hindus who follow &quot;Puliyampulli&#x27;&#x27;, a ritual observed\n\namong some sects within the Hindu community in Kerala to worship\n\nGoddesses Shakhty. Remediless, Anoop has filed W.P. No.33709 of\n\n2015 to have the New Policy quashed.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Writ Outcome:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      7. Through a judgment, dated 6th August 2016, this Court, per a\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           4</span>\n\nlearned Single Judge, dismissed the writ petition: The courts, up to\n\nthe apex level, have upheld the policy; so, the policy needs no\n\ninterference.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">Appeal:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      8. Resolute and resilient, Anoop, the rubber-tree tapper, has\n\nfiled this Writ Appeal, reiterating the same contentions that earned\n\nrejection earlier.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Submissions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Appellant&#x27;s:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      9. Sri Legith T. Kottakkal, the learned counsel for the appellant,\n\nhas passionately argued that the Government has misused its\n\ndominant position by introducing the policy, though it has no\n\nauthority to prohibit a lawful activity, and indirectly at that. According\n\nto him, <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_1\">Abkari Act</a> (&quot;the Act&quot;) has no provision to empower the\n\nGovernment to prohibit liquor. The liquor prohibition, even in a\n\nphased manner, is outside the purview of <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_2\">Abkari Act</a>.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      10. State cannot dictate to the individuals what they should eat\n\nand what they should drink, the counsel contends. Reasonable\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           5</span>\n\nrestrictions can only be imposed but only by a statute. The New\n\nPolicy does not restrict the liquor sale; on the contrary, it prohibits\n\nthe liquor. It militates against <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">Clause 2 of the Policy, according to the learned counsel, is irrational\n\nand has no nexus to the objectives sought to be achieved. Clause 2\n\nof the Policy is ultra vires because it offends the distribution of\n\nLegislative Power under <a href=\"/doc/237570/\" id=\"a_4\">Constitution of India and Act</a> 65 of 1951.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"560071\" id=\"span_5\">11. The learned counsel contends that consumption is a\n\npersonal choice, a facet of right to privacy and right to be let alone,\n\nas has been enshrined under the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_6\">19(1)(a)</a> of\n\nConstitution of India. To support his contention, Anoop relies on\n\n<a href=\"/doc/560071/\" id=\"a_7\">Hinsa Virodhak Sangh Vs. Mirzapur Mou Kuresh Jamat1</a></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">      12. Given the change of Government, the Hon&#x27;ble Governor in\n\nhis speech under <a href=\"/doc/1093471/\" id=\"a_8\">Art.176</a> on the floor of the Assembly has observed\n\nthat the New Policy has &quot;not yielded the desired positive impact.&quot;\n\n(para 214 of the Address). Mr. Legith also submitted that, on\n\n30.06.2016, the Government on the floor of the Assembly that the\n\nNew Policy is a failure; the policy resulted in the rampant abuse of\n\n1 AIR 2008 SC 1892\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           6</span>\n\ndrugs and ganja in the society. Even after admitting that the policy\n\nhas failed, the Government, complains, Anoop, is not rolling it back--\n\nofficially.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">      13. Faced with numerous precedents on the same issue,\n\nthough concerning liquor trade, Sri Legith asserts that the issue of\n\nright to choose or of privacy is sub silentio in those cases. Sri Legith,\n\nduring his submissions, has cited a plethora of precedents, apart\n\nfrom relying on some international covenants. They will be referred\n\nto by and by if the need arises. Eventually, the learned counsel urges\n\nthe Court to quash the New Policy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">The Respondents&#x27;:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">      14. The learned Government Pleader, on the other hand, has\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner has brought a frivolous cause before\n\nthe Court; he has no other intention than hogging the limelight by\n\nwasting precious judicial time. According to him, already many\n\nrounds of challenge were laid against the New Policy but were all\n\nsuccessfully repelled, up to the level of the Supreme Court. So the\n\nwrit petition, as rightly dismissed, is hit by constructive res judicata,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016            7</span>\n\nasserts the learned Government Pleader.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Issue:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">      15. A self-proclaimed hardworking individual takes liquor on a\n\ndaily-basis and claims that he thus finds his relaxation. The\n\nGovernment, in 2015, introduced a New Liquor Policy to usher in\n\nprohibition in a phased manner, though. It has decided to close the\n\nliquor retail outlets, a State&#x27;s monopoly, at 10% annually. Does the\n\nNew Policy infringe on the petitioner&#x27;s right to choose, right to\n\nprivacy, or right to life?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">Discussion:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">Setting the Tone:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">      16. &quot;Our rulers will best promote the improvement of the\n\npeople by strictly confining themselves to their own legitimate duties\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">--by leaving capital to find its most lucrative course, commodities\n\ntheir fair price, industry and intelligence their natural reward,\n\nidleness and folly their natural punishment--by maintaining peace,\n\nby defending property, by diminishing the price of law and by\n\nobserving strict economy in every department of the State.

Governance, according to the United Nations3, is the\n\nexercise of political, economic, and administrative authority to\n\nmanage a nation&#x27;s affairs. It involves complex mechanisms,\n\nprocesses, relationships, and institutions through which citizens and\n\ngroups articulate their interests, exercise their rights and obligations,\n\nand mediate their differences. Governance encompasses every\n\ninstitution and every organization in the society, from the family to\n\nthe State; it embraces all methods--good and bad--that societies\n\nuse to distribute power and manage public resources and\n\nproblems. Good governance, a subset of governance, manages the\n\npublic resources effectively, efficiently to cater to critical needs of\n\nsociety. True, effective democratic forms of governance rely on\n\npublic participation, accountability, and transparency.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">        18. <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 37</a> in Part IV on Directive Principles of State Policy\n\n\n2 (Selections from the Edinburgh Review, 1835, Vol.III, 134)\n3    Engendering    Economic   Governance,    United     Nations Fund For Women (UNIFEM),\n  http://www1.aucegypt.edu/src/engendering/good_governance.html\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016                    9</span>\n\nuses the expression `governance of the country.&#x27; But good\n\ngovernance is writ large and implicit in several provisions of the\n\nConstitution, argues Madhav Godbole, a former civil servant\n\nespousing the cause of administrative reforms.

There may be jurisprudential justification for viewing the\n\nconstitutional commands and statutory stipulations through a moral\n\nprism. But there is little legal justification for conflating morals with\n\nlegislation and pontificating the adjudicatory process.

An inherent dignity of an individual and the inviolable\n\nintegrity of his or her personality give rise to the notion that certain\n\nhuman rights are immutable and not negotiable. The multi-\n\ndimensional morality of human rights transcends the enumerated\n\nfundamental rights; it imperceptibly, inexorably chips away at the\n\nlegislative limits of the rights. It sends from its ranks the rights,\n\ninitially hazy and nebulous, to stand by the peripherals of the\n\nenumerated rights--to the status of penumbral rights. With the\n\njudicial winds in their sails, they slowly travel towards the core of the\n\nconstitutional rights, as we call them `fundamental rights&#x27;, one day.\n\nThe New Policy:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"150011352\" id=\"span_11\">21. <a href=\"/doc/27952771/\" id=\"a_10\">The Abkari Act, 1077</a> was introduced, as noted in <a href=\"/doc/150011352/\" id=\"a_11\">Kerala\n\nBar Hotels Association v State of Kerala5</a>, in the erstwhile State of\n\nCochin in 1902 and, in 1967, came to be extended throughout the\n\nState of Kerala.

In Kerala, the land of coconuts as the name very suggests,\n\nneera and toddy have held their place, first, culturally; later,\n\neconomically. The nature of social consumption of alcohol in the 19th\n\ncentury reflected the societal pattern: there was none of the social\n\nstigma attached to alcohol consumption. But 20th century saw\n\nchange. Varun Panickar in his article &quot;State-Sponsored Alcoholism in\n\nKerala&quot;7 has profiled the problem graphically. Here we draw from his\n\nresearch.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      25. The change in societal response to liquor has led to two\n\ndistinct trends: the increasing incursion of the Excise Department\n\ninto the toddy trade; and the growth of social reform and\n\ntemperance campaigns. New taxation policies caused the illicit trade\n\nof alcohol to flourish in rural areas. In the decade from 1915 to\n\n1925, the levels of licit sale of toddy fell to record levels with illicit\n\nsales rising by 25%. The rise of social mores connected with alcohol\n\nabuse resulted in the conception of social reform movements. The\n\nmost prominent among these movements was the one started in\n\n7  EPW, Vol. 50, Issue No. 23, 06 Jun, 2015\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           14</span>\n\nsouthern Kerala by Narayana Guru.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      26. The proliferation of arrack shops in Kerala well up to the\n\nearly 1980s had given rise to sale of spurious alcohol causing serious\n\npublic health concerns. On the recommendation of a judicial inquiry\n\ncommission, set up to recommend a mechanism against spurious\n\nalcohol, the Government in 1984 set up Kerala State Beverages\n\nCorporation (KSBC). It has to procure spirit, blend, bottle, and\n\ndistribute Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL). KSBC ran 337 liquor\n\nshops across the state till 2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      27. The availability of liquor at prices much lower than those\n\noffered in other states is said to have induced a drinking culture in\n\nKerala which has had telling consequences on social behaviour and\n\ninstitutions. By 2013, Kerala had emerged as the State with the\n\nhighest alcohol consumption rate per person: 8.3 litres. It accounted\n\nfor 16% of the total national alcohol sales.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">      28. The 1980s signalled the revival of the Kerala economy by\n\nway of tourism and the KSBC. The most recent estimates place the\n\nshare of KSBC close to one-fifth of the state revenues. Between 2006\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           15</span>\n\nand 2010 the revenue from the KSBC showed a phenomenal 100%\n\nrise, year after year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">      29. The most prominent outcomes of the intense alcohol\n\nconsumption practices in Kerala, it is believed, have been the rise of\n\nmental illnesses, declining economic productivity, and the rise in\n\ndivorce rates. In 2011 the State recorded the second highest suicide\n\nrate in the country. A survey conducted in 2010 put alcohol abuse as\n\nthe cause for 80% of divorces in the State. In the period 2008 to\n\n2009 nearly 4000 deaths were caused by road accidents where at\n\nleast one of the parties involved was driving under the influence of\n\nalcohol.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">      30. The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) in\n\nThiruvananthapuram has found that nearly 57% to 69% of crimes in\n\nKerala were alcohol-induced. The other concern is the increased\n\nhospitalisation of alcohol drinkers, which has hit family incomes and\n\nemployee productivity adversely. The ADIC found that nearly 19% to\n\n27% of hospital beds in the State were occupied by patients\n\nsuffering from alcohol-related problems.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016          16</span>\n\nThe Policy Legitimacy:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">      31. In Kerala Bar Hotels Assosn., the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\nhas dealt with the issue elaborately. We need not recogitate for it\n\nbinds us. The Apex Court, among other things, observes that so far\n\nas the trade in liquor is concerned, <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution\n\nplaces a responsibility on every State Government to at least contain\n\nif not curtail consumption of alcohol. The impugned Policy, therefore,\n\nis to be encouraged and is certainly not to be struck down or\n\ndiscouraged by the Courts. How this policy is to be implemented,\n\nmodified, adapted or restructured is the province of the State\n\nGovernment and not of the Judiciary. Banning pubic consumption of\n\nthis inebriate cannot be constrained as not being connected in any\n\nmanner with the effort to control consumption of alcohol.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">      32. Kerala Bar Hotels Assosn., also observes that vulnerable\n\npersons, either because of age or proclivity towards intoxication or\n\nas a feature of peer pressure, more often than not, succumb to this\n\ntemptation. Banning public consumption of alcohol, therefore, cannot\n\nbut be seen &quot;as a positive step towards bringing down the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016              17</span>\n\nconsumption of alcohol, or as preparatory to prohibition.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">       33. As to the judicial interference into policy decisions, Kerala\n\nBar Hotels Assosn., observes that judicial review is justified only if\n\nthe policy is arbitrary, unfair, or violative of fundamental rights.\n\nCourts must be loath to venture into an evaluation of State policy;\n\nthe policy must be given a reasonable time to pan out. If it proves to\n\nbe unwise, oppressive, or mindless, the electorate has been quick to\n\nalert the Government of its folly. The Apex Court has found no\n\nillegality or irrationality with the intention of the State to clamp down\n\non public consumption of alcohol.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">Alcohol - The Evolutionary Essence:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">       34. Scientists speculate that the human ancestors&#x27; ability,\n\nacquired millions of years ago, to break down alcohol likely helped\n\nthem make the most out of rotting, fermented fruit that fell onto the\n\nforest floor. One may wonder how innocuously the habit started, as\n\nusual, as part of our evolutionary mission: the survival. Alcohol is at\n\nbest an acquired taste. Pernicious as it is, some scholars have\n\nattributed to alcohol the credit of advancing civilization, though we\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           18</span>\n\ncannot be sure what &quot;civilization&quot; they meant. The ripest fruit is the\n\nsweetest, the most calorific; the sweetest fruit is the closest to\n\ngetting rotten, fermented. So, the tell-tale scent of fermentation was\n\nthe surest way to a food at its most calorific. That is how the journey\n\nbegan. Man has gone past the calorie count; an evolutionary device\n\nhas outlived its utility; and, perhaps, reached a pernicious stage of\n\nfutility.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">Utility v Futility:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">       35. One of Anoop&#x27;s principle contentions is that the liquor trade\n\nis the money-spinner; it generates enormous revenue. Prohibition,\n\naccording to him, affects the State&#x27;s economy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">       36. A welfare State is multidimensional. Apart from its regular\n\nsovereign functions, it undertakes economic activities, too--with a\n\nprofit motive, at that. It has a corporate persona. It competes, if\n\nnecessary, like any other trader, but, of course, standing on ethical\n\nfoundations. Sometimes, given the pernicious nature of a particular\n\nprofession or trade, it may monopolize it, not that it has the sole\n\nprerogative to distribute evil but to contain the contagion. There are,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016                      19</span>\n\nin fact, some necessary evils the State must contend with--liquor\n\nbeing a case in point. As a sovereign, State taxes and exacts\n\nrevenue. With limitless demands on its limited resources, State has\n\nto augment: it carries on trade. Liquor is the foremost trade\n\nundertaken, sometimes exclusively, given its pernicious nature and\n\nits potential, too.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(a) Utilitarian&#x27;s View:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">       37. Professor Michael J. Sandel of Harvard University in Justice,\n\nWhat&#x27;s The Right Thing To Do8, his popular lecture series, discusses\n\nBentham&#x27;s utilitarianism, adding a touch of irony. He observes that\n\nthe doctrine of utilitarianism has only limited utility, under limited or\n\ncontrived circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">       38.       Jeremy        Bentham,      the 19th century English moral\n\nphilosopher, who founded the doctrine of utilitarianism, scoffed at\n\nthe idea of natural rights that held sway during his time. He called it\n\n&quot;nonsense upon stilts.&quot; Conceptually, utilitarianism is a calculus of\n\npain and pleasure: the highest principle of morality is to maximize\n\nhappiness--pleasure over pain. The essence of utilitarianism is its\n\n8  Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2010\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016                       20</span>\n\nconsequentialism. It therefore looks to the future. Bentham arrives at\n\nhis principle by the following line of reasoning: We are all governed\n\nby the feelings of pain and pleasure. They are our &quot;sovereign\n\nmasters.&quot; They govern us in everything we do and also determine\n\nwhat we ought to do. The standard of right and wrong is &quot;fastened\n\nto their throne.&quot; The doctrine, in fact, exerts a powerful hold on the\n\nthinking of policy-makers, economists, business executives, and\n\nordinary citizens to this day.9\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">        39. To expose the ugly underbelly of statistical application of\n\nutilitarianism, Prof. Sandel10 cites the economic analysis undertaken\n\nby Philip Morris, the tobacco multinational, on what it barbarously\n\ncalled `the benefits of lung cancer.&#x27; The tobacco company does big\n\nbusiness in the Czech Republic, where cigarette smoking remains\n\npopular and socially acceptable. Worried about the rising health-care\n\ncosts of smoking, the Czech government considered raising taxes on\n\ncigarettes. In a hope to fend off the tax increase, Philip Morris\n\ncommissioned a cost-benefit analysis of the effects of smoking on\n\nthe Czech national budget. The study found that the government\n\n9  Raymond Wacks&#x27;s Understanding Jurisprudence, 256, 2nd Ed.

The cost-benefit analysis, of course, proved to be a public\n\nrelations disaster for Philip Morris. Faced with public outrage and\n\nridicule, Philip Morris apologized.

We have observed that a constitution of\n\nany republic, however steeped in antiquity, is not the tyrannical\n\ncommand of the dead past. It is a live instrument--organic. It is a\n\ncollection of ideas and ideals for all times, deliberately designed to\n\nbe amorphous and malleable, capable of adopting itself to suit the\n\ncrisis it is called upon to address and redress. Thus the adept hand\n\nof the nation&#x27;s polity adopts it to changing circumstances. We have,\n\nas a truism, acknowledged that the society is complex, diverse, and\n\nchanging, so shall its response be to the issues these changes bring\n\nin.

So, with strong winds of individual dignity, personal\n\nintegrity, and inviolability, privacy may no longer be confined to the\n\nconstitutional crevices: it is real and regnant as a right. Its time has\n\ncome, perhaps. But can it bulldoze all other constitutional canons if\n\nat all any of those rights, perceivably, conflicts with the right to\n\nprivacy? So, to answer it, we need to examine the interplay between\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016          25</span>\n\nthe Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">The Interplay between <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 47:</a>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     45. It brooks no contradiction that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> is pregnant with\n\nmeaning and, therefore, exponentially expansive in its scope and\n\ncontent. The constitutional courts have time and time declared that\n\nthe provision is the cornerstone of our constitutional edifice. Its\n\nreach extends far beyond the limits the provision is semantically or\n\nsyntactically permitted to travel. Almost all other fundamental rights\n\nget vitalized by and imbued with the spirit of this provision. The\n\nprovision mocks at interpretational limitations. Nor does it leave any\n\nroom for controversy as to its sweep: the provision is never static; as\n\nthe society matures and progresses, rights not thought of earlier also\n\nget consecrated as core constitutional rights.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     46. <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 37</a> contextualises the principles which otherwise\n\nremain mere pious wishes: constitutional morals or righteous\n\nexhortations.

If Fundamental Rights are the Citizen&#x27;s Charter;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">Directive Principles are Legislative&#x27;s Charter. In other words, if the\n\nFundamental Rights are individual-centric, the Directive Principles are\n\nsociety-centric. It is very rare, if ever, that one can successfully\n\nmaintain a claim--as the appellant attempted here--that the directive\n\nprinciples come in a person&#x27;s way his enjoying his fundamental\n\nrights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">      47. <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 47</a> ordains the Legislature to regard as its primary\n\nduty raising the people&#x27;s living standards, nutrition and public health\n\ninclusive.

Nutrition and public health are two of the numerous facets\n\nof better living standards. To achieve this objective, the State may\n\nadopt myriad methods. But the constitution pins the State to one\n\nparticular method, besides all others. Prohibit the consumption of\n\nintoxicating drinks and also drugs which are harmful to health.\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           27</span>\n\nCategoric is the constitutional mandate that the endeavour is\n\ntowards prohibiting consumption of intoxicating drinks.

Of the two evils, intoxicating drinks, as a whole, face the\n\naxe, while only those drugs harmful to health get outlawed, for\n\n`drugs&#x27; is employed generically and followed asyndetically with the\n\nrelative qualifier `harmful to health.&#x27; The Constitution, therefore,\n\npresumes that any drink intoxicating is harmful. In other words,\n\n`intoxicating drinks&#x27; does not get qualified by `harmful to health.&#x27; The\n\ncanon of construction, we suppose, applicable is that of the last\n\nantecedent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">      50. The Rule of the Last Antecedent, as per the Black&#x27;s Law\n\nDictionary, is an interpretative principle by which a court determines\n\nthat qualifying words or phrases modify the words or phrases\n\nimmediately preceding them and not words or phrases more remote,\n\nunless the extension is necessary from the context or the spirit of the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016                       28</span>\n\nentire writing.

As with any canon of statutory interpretation, the rule of\n\nthe last antecedent, of course, &quot;is not an absolute and can assuredly\n\nbe overcome by other indicia of meaning. Further, it is a\n\nfundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a\n\nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in\n\nthe overall statutory scheme14.

M. P. Jani in Indian Constitutional Law18 examines the\n\ninter-relationship between Chapters III and IV. The learned author\n\nobserves that the question of the relationship between the Directive\n\nPrinciple and the Fundamental Rights has caused some difficulty, and\n\nthe judicial attitude has undergone transformation on this question\n\nover time. The judicial view has veered round from irreconcilability to\n\nintegration between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles\n\nand, in some of the more recent cases, to giving primacy to the\n\nDirective Principles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">      55. Initially, the Courts adopted a strict and literal legal position\n\nin this respect. The Supreme Court adopting the literal interpretative\n\napproach to Art. 37 ruled that a Directive Principle could not override\n\na Fundamental Right, and, that in case of conflict between the two,\n\n\n18 1411-12, LexisNexis, 7th Ed.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016                      31</span>\n\nthe Fundamental Right would prevail over the Directive Principle. In\n\ncourse of time, a perceptible change came over the judicial attitude\n\non this question. The Supreme Court came to adopt the view that\n\nalthough Directive Principles, as such, were legally non-enforceable,\n\nnevertheless, while interpreting a statute, the Courts could look for\n\nlight to the `&#x27;lodestar&#x27;&#x27; of the Directive Principles.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">       56.

The message ofKesavananda Bharati20 is clear. The\n\ninterest of a citizen or section of a community, howsoever important,\n\nis secondary to the interest of the country or community as a whole.\n\nFor judging the reasonability of restrictions imposed on fundamental\n\nrights the relevant considerations, according to <a href=\"/doc/101278772/\" id=\"a_31\">State of Gujarat v.\n\nMirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat21</a>, are not only those as stated\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 19</a> itself or in Part III of the Constitution: the directive\n\nprinciples stated in Part IV are also relevant. Changing factual\n\nconditions and State policy, including the one reflected in the\n\nimpugned enactment, have to be considered and given weightage to\n\nby the courts while deciding the constitutional validity of legislative\n\nenactments. A restriction placed on any fundamental right, aimed at\n\nsecuring directive principles will be held as reasonable and\n\nhenceintra vires subject to two limitations: first, that it does not run\n\n20 (1973) 4 SCC 225\n21 (2005) 8 SCC 534, 564\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           33</span>\n\nin clear conflict with the fundamental right, and second, that it has\n\nbeen enacted within the legislative competence of the enacting\n\nlegislature under Part XI Chapter I of the Constitution.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">      59. From the above discussion, we may safely hold that the\n\nprecedential proclivity is towards according the Directive Principles a\n\npride of place.

Its content is\n\ncapacious, and its scope enormous. But a right, however entrenched\n\nit is, is never unrestrained, much less unregulated. As with all other\n\nrights, right to privacy--if right to take intoxicating drinks were one--\n\nalways subject to reasonable restrictions. More compelling is this\n\nconclusion not only because of Clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 19</a> but also\n\nbecause of the sweep of <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 47</a> of the Constitution. The judicial\n\ndictum is emphatic in <a href=\"/doc/675008/\" id=\"a_66\">Indian Handicrafts Emporium, Krishan\n\nKumar Narula and Khoday Distilleries Ltd.</a> (supra).</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">       81. But, before parting with the matter, we acknowledge that\n\n&quot;the times they are a-changing.&quot; What is today morally reprehensible\n\nand socially unacceptable may not be so tomorrow. Anoop, the\n\nappellant, may still have hope, but he seems to have raised his voice\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">W.A.No.1823 of 2016           45</span>\n\nrather prematurely. We conclude with the lines of Bob Dylan, the\n\nNobel laureate:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">&quot;[A]nd don&#x27;t speak too soon\nFor the wheel&#x27;s still in spin\nAnd there&#x27;s no telling who that it&#x27;s naming\nFor the loser now will be later to win\nCause the times they are a-changing&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">Result:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      We, therefore, hold that the writ appeal should fail, and it\n\nfailed. The appeal is dismissed. No order on costs.\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                                    P.R.RAMACHANDRA MENON,\n                                              Judge.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">\n                                    DAMA SESHADRI NAIDU,\n                                              Judge.\n</blockquote>\f\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">\n\n\n          </blockquote>","numcites":36,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Kerala High Court","citetid":150193043,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"good governance","formInput":"good%20governance"},{"value":"utilitarianism","formInput":"utilitarianism"},{"value":"directive principles fundamental right","formInput":"directive%20principles%20fundamental%20right"},{"value":"directive principles","formInput":"directive%20principles"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"article 47","formInput":"article%2047"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"reasonable restriction","formInput":"reasonable%20restriction"},{"value":"LIQUOR PROHIBITION","formInput":"LIQUOR%20PROHIBITION"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"retail outlet","formInput":"retail%20outlet"},{"value":"Kerala state beverages corporation ","formInput":"Kerala%20state%20beverages%20corporation%20"},{"value":"intoxication ","formInput":"intoxication%20"},{"value":"article 37","formInput":"article%2037"},{"value":"standard of living","formInput":"standard%20of%20living"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
