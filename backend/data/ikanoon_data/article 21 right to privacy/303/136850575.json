Whether the information sought i.e. details of assets, wealth and\n      income of all Ministers and their families is disclosable;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">   2. Which Public Authority holds this information particularly in light of the\n      letter of Shri Kamal Dayani, Director, PMO of 19-5-08 addressed to the\n      Cabinet Secretariat.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">              Shri Amit Agarwal, CPIO, PMO readily clarified Issue 2\n   submitting that there had been considerable confusion with regard to the\n   Public Authority that holds the information. In many cases information had\n   been submitted to the Cabinet Secretariat and in others to the PMO.\n   Thanks to the RTI request from appellant Shri S.C. Agrawal, it has been\n   decided by orders in the PMO of 14-11-08 that this information will be held\n   in the PMO. Accordingly, CPIO, Cabinet Secretariat has transferred the\n   matter to the PMO which has, in turn, responded to the appellant through\n   CPIO&#x27;s order of 17-12-08.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">          On the question of disclosing the information so held CPIO, Shri Amit\n   Agarwal referred to the Lok Sabha Declaration of Assets and Liabilities\n   Rules, Rule 4 (4) of which lays down that such information is to be treated\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       4</span>\n    as confidential and disclosed only under specific orders of the Speaker,\n   Lok Sabha.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">       He, however, admitted that with regard to response to the transfer of\nRTI application from the PMO of 19-5-08 appellant Shri S.C. Agrawal had not\nbeen informed of the decision contained in letter of 19-5-08 addressed by the\nCPIO, PMO to the CPIO, Cabinet Secretariat.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_5\">Learned counsel for appellant Ms. Kamini Jaiswal submitted that in\ncase of information sought to be exempted from disclosure both<a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_9\"> u/s 8 (1) (e)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">8 (1) (j)</a> public interest overrides exemption. She then contended firmly\nthat it is very much in the public interest to know of the assets of the Ministers\nholding public office and particularly, what property they may have acquired\nafter the declaration of their assets before the Election Commission of India\nbefore whom during the process of seeking election is under court orders,\nspecifically the decision of Apex court in (2003) 4, People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_11\">Civil\nLiberties (PUCL) &amp; Another vs. UOI and another</a> required not only to be\nheld by the Election Commission of India but placed in the public domain.\nShe also invited our attention to the letter of PMO to the Cabinet Secretariat of\n19-5-08 and specifically the following sentence:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">       &quot;The undersigned is desired to request that the Cabinet\n       Secretariat may kindly furnish the information to the applicant\n       under RTI.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_6\">Ms. Jaiswal, therefore, contended that the PMO had, in fact, directed\nthe Cabinet Sectt. to disclose the information sought to appellant Shri S.C.\nAgrawal, but later reversed its decision She then went on to quote from the\ndecision of the apex court on 13.3.2003 in (2003) 4, SC 399, People&#x27;s Union\nfor <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_12\">Civil Liberties (PUCL) &amp; Anr vs. UOI &amp; Anr.</a> as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       &quot;47. From the aforesaid observations learned Solicitor General\n       Mr. Raval and learned Senior Counsel Mr. Jaitley contended\n       that rights which are derivatives would be subject to reasonable\n       restriction. Secondly, it was sought to be contended that by\n       insisting for declaration of assets of a candidate, right would\n       have right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21.</a> The Court itself has\n       carved out the exceptions and restrictions on absolute right of\n       privacy. Further, by declaration of a fact, which is a matter of\n       public record that a candidate was involved in a various criminal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        5</span>\n       cases, there is no question of infringement of any right of privacy.\n      Similarly, with regard to the declaration of assets also, a person\n      having assets or income is normally required to disclose the\n      same under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_14\">Income Tax Act</a> or such similar fiscal legislation.\n      Not only this, but once a person becomes a candidate to acquire\n      public office, such declaration would not affect his right of\n      privacy. This is the necessity of the day because of statutory\n      provisions of controlling widespread corrupt practices as\n      repeatedly pointed out by all concerned including various reports\n      of the Law Commission and other committees as stated above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1107385\" id=\"span_8\">Learned counsel also argued that what constitutes public interest has\nalso been clearly defined by the apex court in <a href=\"/doc/1107385/\" id=\"a_15\">Ashok Kumar Pandey vs.\nState of West Bengal</a> (2004) SC 349; Nov 18 2003as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;5.   It is necessary to take note to the meaning to the expression\n      &quot;public interest litigation&quot;. In Stroud&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary, Vol. 4,\n      4th Edn. &quot;public interest&quot; is defined thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      Pubic Interest-(1) A matter of public or general interest does not\n      mean that which is interesting as gratifying curiosity or a love of\n      information or amusement but that in which a class of the\n      community have a pecuniary interest, or some interest by which\n      their legal rights or liabilities are affected.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">6.          In Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 6th Edn., &quot;public interest&quot; is\n      defined as follows:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      Public interest-Something in which the public, the community at\n      large, has some pecuniary interest, or some interest by which\n      their legal rights or liabilities are affected. It does not mean\n      anything so narrow as mere curiosity, or as the interests of the\n      particular localities, which may be affected by the matters in\n      question. Interest shared by citizens generally in affairs of local,\n      State or national Government.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">7.           In Janata Dal case this Court considered the scope of\n      public interest litigation. In para 53 of the said judgment, after\n      considering what is public interest, the Court has laid down as\n      follows (SSC p. 331)\n\n      &quot;53. The expression &#x27;litigation&#x27; means a legal action including all\n      proceedings therein, initiated in a court of law with the purpose\n      of enforcing a right or seeking a remedy. Therefore, lexically the\n      expression &#x27;PIL&#x27; means a legal action initiated in a court of law\n      for the enforcement of public interest or general interest in which\n      the public or a class of the community have pecuniary interest or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                        6</span>\n            some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are\n           affected.&quot;1\n\n          In his response CPIO Shri Amit Agrawal, Director PMO submitted that\nreturning the RTI application to Cabinet Secretariat by Director PMO was not\na result of exercise of judgement on the disclosability of the information\nsought but only conveying of a decision as to which public authority should\nhold the information thus assigning responsibility to respond to a request for\naccess to such information. It cannot constitute reversal of any decision\n\n\n                                        DECISION NOTICE\n\n\n           In the matter of declaration of assets this Commission has made\nseveral decisions with particular reference to property returns of govt servants.\nIn CIC/AT/A2006/00134 of 10-7-06 this Commission has held as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">           11.       However, all public authorities are urged that in order to\n                    open the property returns of all public servants to public\n                    scrutiny, the public authorities may contemplate a new\n                    and open system of filing and retention of such returns.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                    The public servants may be advised in advance that\n                    their property returns shall be open and no more\n                    confidential.

These steps may bring the\n                    curtain down on the rather vexed question of how\n                    private is the information given in &quot;property returns&quot; or\n                    that it is a public information, which is not private at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">           In an appeal disposed of in file no.

The right to know about\n     the candidate who intends to become a public figure and\n     a representative of the people would not be effective and\n     real if only truncated information of the assets and\n     liabilities is given.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">The judgment goes on to dwell at length not only with the\nrequirement of disclosure of the property of candidates foe\nelections but to conclude that &quot;It cannot be denied that the family\nrelationship and social order in our country is such that the\nhusband and wife look to the properties held by them as\nbelonging to the family for all practical purposes, though in the\neye of law the properties may distinctly belong to each of them.\nBy and large, there exists a sort of unity of interest in the\nproperties held by spouses. The property being kept in the name\nof the spouse benami is not unknown in our country. In this\nsituation, it could be said that a countervailing or paramount\ninterest is involved in requiring a candidate who chooses to\nsubject himself/herself to public gaze and scrutiny to furnish the\ndetails of assets and liabilities of the spouse as well.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">Appellant Shri Upadhyaya has argued that when such rigorous\nnorms are fixed for candidates for elections, who are in service\nfor only the limited term of their office, the government servants,\nengaged in life long service cannot be exempt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">We moreover find that this Commission has, in Shri Roshan Lal\nvs. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghathan, Appeal Nos.\nCIC/OK/A/2007/01493 &amp; CIC/OK/A/2008/00027 dated 20th\nMarch, 2008 also ruled on the question of disclosure of property\nreturns wherein respondents had denied disclosure on the\nground of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Sec. 8(1) (j)</a>. In these cases Information\nCommissioner Dr. O.P. Kejariwal has held as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">       &quot;The Bench, however, holds that Annual Property\n       Returns by government employees are in the public\n       domain and hence there seems to be no reason why they\n       should not be freely disclosed. This should also be\n       considered as a step to contain corruption in government\n       offices since such disclosures may reveal instances\n       where property has been acquired, which is\n       disproportionate to known sources of income. The\n       Commission, therefore, directs the Respondents to\n       provide copies of property returns asked for by the\n       Appellant to him by 10th April, 2008.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                8</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">    Under the circumstances, we see no reason to uphold\n   exemption from disclosure sought.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">        It will be seen from the above that even in what may appear to be\ncontrary decisions by this Commission, what should be made clear is that\nthe Commission has directed/advised that every public authority should\nmove towards making such information public in terms of Government\nservants. In the present case, we have gone beyond the question of\nGovernment servants, but to argue a fiduciary relationship in submission\nof such statements to PMO, when such statements have in any case\nunder law also to be made available at t the time of election before the\nElection Commission of India, is not in our view a valid argument.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">     On the other hand we agree with CPIO that the note of 19.5.&#x27;08 sent\nby PMO to Cabinet Secretariat is only a forwarding note and not a\ndirection, nor indeed an advisory in terms of the information sought by\nappellant Shri Agrawal. Nevertheless, at the time that Cabinet Secretariat\nreceived this reply from PMO, it was for that public authority to respond or\ngive to appellant a reason for delay in response. There has therefore been\na failure by CPIO Shri Sunil Mishra Director, Cabinet Secretariat, to fulfil\nhis responsibility under Sec 7 of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">RTI Act</a> 2005. Since Cabinet\nSecretariat was not party to this appeal, no further action is proposed in\nthis regard. However Cabinet Secretariat is advised to take note of this\nobservation\n\n\n        For the above reasons, the appeal of Shri S.C. Agrawal is\nallowed. But it is clear that the information sought, as is recognised by\nthe Lok Sabha rules quoted above, is held in confidence, thus warranting\nof reference to third party<a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_20\"> u/s 11(1)</a> before proceeding with any disclosure.\nHowever, because under the Lok Sabha Rules cited above such\ninformation is not disclosable except with the permission of the Speaker,\nthe matter will be referred to Shri Somnath Chatterjee, Speaker of the Lok\nSabha for disclosure of such information as relates to those Members of\nthe Council of Ministers who are Members of the Lok Sabha. If there is\nany equivalent Rule with regard to the Rajya Sabha, this may also be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   9</span>\n   exercised, although, we were not told of existence of any such Rules\n  during the hearing. If no such rules in fact exist, the matter will be referred\n  to the third parties concerned as per the process mandated u/.s 11 sub-\n  section (1) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_21\">RTI Act</a> 2005. This process may be completed within\n  thirty working days of the date of issue of the Decision Notice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">           Reserved in the hearing this decision is announced on Monday,\n  the 16th March, 2009.
