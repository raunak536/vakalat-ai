The right of a woman for reproductive decisions\n\nand    personal      choices    having       been   recognized   as   a\n\nconstitutional         right,     there      are     instances   where\n\nsingle/unwed women choose to have child through Assisted\n\nReproductive Technologies (ART). In the year 2005, the\n\nMinistry for Health and Family Welfare, Government of\n\nIndia, issued guidelines with regard to functioning of\n\nART clinics in India. It is titled, &quot;National Guidelines for\n\nAccreditation, Supervision and Regulation of ART Clinics in India&quot;. The\n\nguidelines were formulated by the Indian Council of\n\nMedical Research (ICMR) and National Academy of Medical\n\nSciences (NAMS). The relevant portion of paragraph 3.5.2\n\nof the guidelines reads thus :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">            &quot;3.5.2 There would be no bar to the use of ART\n            by a single woman who wishes to have a child,\n            and no ART clinic may refuse to offer its services\n            to the above provided other criteria mentioned in\n            this document are satisfied. The child thus born\n            will have all the legal rights on the woman or the\n            man.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> W. P.

Smt.S.Krishna, the learned Central Government\n\nStanding Counsel pointed out that, the said regulations\n\nare not being effectively implemented as such though it\n\nhas not been expressly withdrawn. She brought to the\n\nnotice of this Court that, on the subject, a Bill has\n\nbeen introduced in the Lok Sabha titled, &quot;The Assisted\n\nReproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020&quot;. A copy of the\n\nBill has been made available to the Court. A reading of\n\nthe Bill indicates that it also recognizes the right of\n\na woman of legal age of marriage to approach the ART\n\nclinic and avail ART procedure. The duty to maintain\n\nconfidentiality of the donor etc. as was there in the\n\nguidelines is maintained in the Bill. Though it is yet\n\nto become a statute, it was adverted to by me only to be\n\nconvinced that, as of now the rights of a single woman\n\nand the aspect of confidentiality is being maintained.\n\nSuffice to notice that, rights of a single woman to\n\nconceive      through        ART   procedure   is   recognized   and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> W.

As noticed\n\nfirst above, the identity of the donor is not disclosed\n\nto the petitioner. Under the circumstances, there is no\n\nrhyme or reason in requiring the petitioner to, provide\n\nthe name of the father in the form prescribed for\n\nregistration        of        birth     and      death.   Requiring   the\n\npetitioner to leave the column regarding the details of\n\nfather as blank, the issuance of a certificate of birth\n\nor   certificate         of    death     leaving    the   space   provided\n\ntherein regarding the details of the father as blank,\n\nnecessarily affects the right of dignity of the mother\n\nas well as the child.

The vision of the Founding\n            Fathers was enriched by the histories of suffering\n            of those who suffered oppression and a violation\n            of dignity both here and elsewhere. Yet, it would\n            be difficult to dispute that many of the problems\n            which contemporary societies face would not\n            have been present to the minds of the most\n            perspicacious         draftsmen.       No       generation,\n            including the present, can have a monopoly over\n            solutions or the confidence in its ability to foresee\n            the   future.    As     society      evolves,    so     must\n            constitutional doctrine. The institutions which the\n            Constitution has created must adapt flexibly to\n            meet the challenges in a rapidly growing\n            knowledge economy. Above all, constitutional\n            interpretation is but a process in achieving\n            justice, liberty and dignity to every citizen.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> W.

It was further held that, interpretation of the\n\nConstitution         cannot          be     frozen        by     its        original\n\nunderstanding            that   it        must    evolve       with     the    felt\n\nnecessities         of     time,     to     meet       the     aspirations      and\n\nchallenges of the present and future. The concept of\n\nconceiving through ART has been foreign to this country\n\na few decades back till the first &quot;test tube baby&quot; was\n\nborn. By the passage of time, evolution of techniques,\n\nchange in life style and personal choices recognized by\n\nthe    Rule    of    Law,       appropriate            modifications/changes/\n\nadditions/alterations need to be made in Statutes, Rules\n\nand the forms prescribed thereunder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      21.

As is\n\nalways, the &quot;rights&quot; are quite often misused. To settle\n\nscores in the &#x27;in-family&#x27; feuds, registration in such\n\nforms would be sought for. This could be resolved by\n\nrequiring the applicants to furnish an affidavit that\n\nshe is a single parent/unwed mother conceived through\n\nART procedure and produce along with the same a copy of\n\nmedical record in support thereof.
