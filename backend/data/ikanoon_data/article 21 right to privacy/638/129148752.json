It is also stated that WhatsApp has made many changes to its\n\n               privacy policy for the first time from the time Facebook\n\n               acquired it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           c. All the changes in the privacy policy resulted into the social\n\n               network join to keep enjoying the services of WhatsApp. Such\n\n               changes in privacy policy is an abuse of dominant position\n\n               enjoyed by the group in the matter and such changes are thus\n\n               in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 4(2)</a> of the Act.

As per the Appellant, WhatsApp has dominance established\n\n               in the Indian market and as stated that it is installed on 95%\n\n               of Indian Android Devices. To add further, it has got clear\n\n               market domination in 109 countries and grabbing 55.6% of\n\n               the world. He has also stated that WhatsApp holds substantial\n\n               market share in India with more than 70 Million Users.\n\n           f. It has also stated that new privacy policy of commenced on\n\n               25.08.2016 after take over by the Facebook of WhatsApp and\n\n               Facebook becoming the WhatsApp parent company. As a\n\n               result, the WhatsApp has forced to share their user accounts\n\n               details and other information available on WhatsApp to the\n\n               Facebook. His allegation is that now Facebook &amp; WhatsApp\n\n               can connect user accounts on both the places and a fear has\n\n               been pumped in by the Appellant that Facebook might start\n\n               having insight in consumer uses of the App and target ads\n\n               accordingly. The only way for the people in Indian who do not\n\n               want to use WhatsApp to opt out of the services within 30\n\n               days leading thereby the customer/the people of India to\n\n               accept the new terms and conditions without having any other\n\n               remedy and, therefore, the consent is not real as the consent\n\n               is under pressure. He has also alleged that the Facebook\n\n               manipulates the public opinion to achieve consent.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                Page 4 of 58</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">            g. They have stated that Predatory Pricing is conspiracy\n\n               speculative in nature, where conspirators sustain substantial\n\n               loss in present to reap uncertain gains in future. It was held\n\n               in Brooke Group Ltd Vs. Brown &amp; Willamson Tabacco Corpn,\n\n               it was held that Predatory price conduct consists in a business\n\n               rival pricing its product in an unfair manner with an object to\n\n               eliminate or retard competition and thereby gaining and\n\n               exercising control over prices in the relevant market. The\n\n               Plaintiff must prove:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                   •   That the price complained of is below an appropriate\n\n                       measure of its rival&#x27;s costs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                   •   That the competitor had reasonable prospects of\n\n                       recouping its investment in below-cost price.\n\n           h. WhatsApp dropped of subscription fee it previously charged\n\n               users and become fully free in Jan.2016. Previously it used to\n\n               charge 0.99$ per annum subscription fees after one year of\n\n               free trial, and IOS users were charged one off charge for\n\n               lifetime. The same removal of charges was confirmed by the\n\n               official blog of WhatsApp.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           i. The subscription amount was the source of income for\n\n               WhatsApp which was to the tune of $10.8 million before\n\n               Facebook acquisition, with that gone their remained no source\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                  Page 5 of 58</span>\n                of income for the group, and had to depend on Facebook i.e.\n\n               parent company (with huge financial as well as other\n\n               resources) to maintain its business. The number of users of\n\n               WhatsApp also increased from 450 Million to over 1 billion\n\n               people. Thus, it is asserted that the WhatsApp while removing\n\n               the fees of subscription, actually provided the service below\n\n               the cost, largely sourcing the remaining funds from parent\n\n               company that is Facebook and the same helped it increase the\n\n               customer base substantially.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           j. The WhatsApp group has been able to enlarge the user base\n\n               substantially      with   removal   of   subscription   fees   after\n\n               acquisition by Facebook, now using the data base of user for\n\n               advertising can easily fetch the group huge chunk of fortune\n\n               as has been predicted by Barron&#x27;s than 20 percent climb in\n\n               Facebook Inc share is expected owning its increase to\n\n               advertisement        revenue   among      its   platforms.     Thus,\n\n               recoupment of profits after suffering loss for small period of\n\n               time is evident from the acts and methodology employed by\n\n               the group, thus the said practice can be said to be Predatory\n\n               Pricing. Thus, the new privacy policy as employed by\n\n               WhatsApp is &#x27;Contrary to Public Interest&#x27; as well as &quot;predatory\n\n               Pricing&quot; methods are also employed this could be seen as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                     Page 6 of 58</span>\n                &#x27;Abuse of Dominant Position&#x27; by the group.

The Commission notes that as per <a href=\"/doc/594114/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2(r)</a> of the\n\n                Act, &#x27;relevant market&#x27; means the market which may be\n\n                determined by the Commission with reference to the\n\n                &#x27;relevant product market&#x27; or the &#x27;relevant geographic\n\n                market&#x27; or with reference to both the markets. In regard to\n\n                the relevant product market, the Commission notes that\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27;,       an     instant   communication   app    for\n\n                smartphones using standard cellular mobile numbers, is a\n\n                platform for communication through texting, group chats\n\n                and voice and video calls. It is noted that instant\n\n                communication apps cannot be compared with the\n\n                traditional electronic communication services such as text\n\n                messaging, voice calls etc. as provided by various\n\n                telecommunication operators. It is so because unlike\n\n                traditional modes of communication, instant messaging\n\n                using communication apps are internet based and provide\n\n                additional functionalities to the users. For example, users\n\n                of communication apps can see when their contacts are\n\n                online, when they are typing or when they last accessed\n\n                the application. Further, instant communication apps can\n\n                be used through smartphones only whereas traditional\n\n                electronic communication services can be used through any\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                    Page 19 of 58</span>\n                 mobile phone. There are also differences in the pricing\n\n                conditions in both the above said modes of communication.\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27;       is      a   free   to   download   communication\n\n                application which does not charge any fee from its users for\n\n                providing the services and just uses internet connection on\n\n                the device to send instant messages, connect voice calls etc.\n\n                Further, text messaging through traditional modes can be\n\n                done between people who do not use the mobile service of\n\n                the same service provider, whereas instant messaging\n\n                services typically require you and your contacts to be on the\n\n                same communication application platform. Thus, the\n\n                Commission is of the view that the relevant product market\n\n                in this case may be considered as &#x27;the market for instant\n\n                messaging services using consumer communication apps\n\n                through smartphones&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                12. With regard to the relevant geographic market, the\n\n                Commission observes that the functionality provided by\n\n                consumer communication apps through smartphones is\n\n                inherently cross-border. As consumers are free to install\n\n                any app they want, the geographic scope for either demand\n\n                or supply of consumer communication apps is not limited to\n\n                any    particular        area   where     the   consumers   acquire\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                          Page 20 of 58</span>\n                 connectivity to his/ her device. Moreover, the developers\n\n                distribute similar products to all of their customers\n\n                regardless      of       their   geographic   location.     Further,\n\n                functionality of consumer communication apps through\n\n                smartphones does not differ depending on the region or\n\n                country concerned, either in terms of price, functionalities,\n\n                platforms or operating system. This is consistent with the\n\n                fact that all consumers with access to internet are in\n\n                principle free to download and install any app they want,\n\n                irrespective of their geographic location anywhere in the\n\n                world.     However,         competitive   conditions,     regulatory\n\n                architecture and players may vary in different countries/\n\n                regions. Since in the present matter, the allegations of the\n\n                Informant pertain to the alleged anti-competitive conduct of\n\n                &#x27;Whatsapp&#x27; within the geographic boundary of India and\n\n                the conditions of competition in the market for instant\n\n                messaging services using consumer communication apps\n\n                through smartphones is homogeneous throughout India,\n\n                the Commission is of the view that the geographic area of\n\n                &#x27;India&#x27; may be considered as the relevant geographic\n\n                market in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                        Page 21 of 58</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                 13.

On the issue of dominance of the OP in the relevant\n\n                market as defined supra, the Commission notes that in\n\n                India a number of other players such as Apple with\n\n                iMessage, BlackBerry with BBM, Samsung with Chat ON,\n\n                Google with Google Hangouts and Microsoft with Skype are\n\n                providing consumer communication apps and are also\n\n                active in the provisions of smartphone hardware and\n\n                operating     systems.    Besides,   many     other   consumer\n\n                communication apps providers such as Hike, Viber,\n\n                WeChat and Snapchat are also active in market. As per the\n\n                information available in the public domain, globally\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; is having a billion monthly active users and\n\n                within India, it is having 160 million monthly active users.\n\n                According to a study of &#x27;Jana and mCent&#x27;, 97% of the\n\n                smartphone users in India use a communication app daily\n\n                and the most popular is &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27;, which is installed on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                      Page 22 of 58</span>\n                 96% of devices and has more daily active users than any\n\n                other communication app in India. As per the said report,\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; is installed in 2.3 times more devices than\n\n                home-grown messaging app Hike. According to a study\n\n                conducted by &#x27;TNS/TNC Connected Life Study 2015&#x27;, 56%\n\n                of the internet users in India use &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; and 51% use\n\n                &#x27;Facebook&#x27; every day. Further, amongst India&#x27;s internet\n\n                users, &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; tops the list of instant messaging apps.\n\n                Further, citing a study conducted by Global Web Index, the\n\n                Informant has submitted that 64% of mobile users in India\n\n                use &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; which is the largest as compared to any\n\n                other mobile messaging app usage. Based on the the above,\n\n                the Commission is of the opinion that the OP is in a\n\n                dominant position in the relevant market as defined under\n\n                para 13 above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">                15.

Be that as it may, since the terms of service of\n\n                &quot;WhatsApp&quot; are not traceable to any statute or statutory\n\n                provisions, it appears to us that the issue sought to be\n\n                espoused in the present petition is not amenable to the writ\n\n                jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                19. However, we have taken note of the fact that under the\n\n                Privacy Policy of &quot;WhatsApp&quot;, the users are given an option\n\n                to delete their &quot;WhatsApp&quot; account at any time, in which\n\n                event, the information of the users would be deleted from\n\n                the servers of &quot;WhatsApp&quot;. We are therefore, of the view\n\n                that it is always open to the existing users of &quot;WhatsApp&quot;\n\n                who do not want their information to be shared with\n\n                &quot;Facebook&quot; to opt for deletion of their account.......&quot;\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                     Page 26 of 58</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                 17. In the said order the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi had\n\n                also ruled that if the users opt for completely deleting\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; account before September 25, 2016, the\n\n                information/ data/ details of such users should be deleted\n\n                completely from &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; servers and the same shall not\n\n                be shared with &#x27;Facebook&#x27; or any one of its group\n\n                companies. However, against the aforesaid order of the\n\n                Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi, an appeal was preferred before\n\n                the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and the matter is still pending\n\n                before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. In the above backdrop,\n\n                the Commission is of the view that the allegations of breach\n\n                of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_15\">IT Act, 2000</a> do not fall within the purview of\n\n                examination under the provisions of the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">                18. Further, the Informant has alleged that by not charging\n\n                any subscription fee since January, 2016 from its users,\n\n                the OP is indulging in predatory pricing. In this regard, the\n\n                Commission        observes   that   there   are   several   other\n\n                applications available in the relevant market which do not\n\n                charge any fee from the users for availing their services for\n\n                instance, Hike, Messenger and Viber are also available for\n\n                free. It appears to be the standard practice in the industry/\n\n                business that all consumer communication apps are not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                      Page 27 of 58</span>\n                 charging any fee from the users. The Commission observes\n\n                that &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; was previously charging subscription fee\n\n                from its users which was subsequently scrapped. This may\n\n                be due to the presence of many other service providers who\n\n                are offering the services for free of cost. Furthermore, from\n\n                the submissions of the OP, the Commission notes that the\n\n                revenue model of the OP is like other players in the\n\n                industry/ business and it is still evaluating the various\n\n                modes that can be used to earn revenues from its services\n\n                by providing value to its customers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                19. The Commission also observes that there are no\n\n                significant costs preventing the users to switch from one\n\n                consumer communication apps to another. It may be due to\n\n                the following reasons: (i) all consumer communication apps\n\n                are offered for free of cost or at a very low price (mostly\n\n                free), (ii) all consumer communication apps are easily\n\n                downloadable on smartphones and can co-exist on the\n\n                same handset (also called &#x27;multi homing&#x27;) without taking\n\n                much capacity along with other apps, (iii) once consumer\n\n                communication apps are installed on a device, users can\n\n                pass on from one app to its competitor apps in no-time,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                   Page 28 of 58</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                 (iv)   consumer          communication    apps     are   normally\n\n                characterised by simple user interfaces so that costs of\n\n                switching to a new app are minimal for consumers, and (v)\n\n                information about new apps is easily accessible given the\n\n                ever    increasing        number   of    reviews   of    consumer\n\n                communication apps on apps store like google play store\n\n                etc. Furthermore, the expansion of Hike Messenger to\n\n                nearly 100 million user base within three years of\n\n                launching their services into the aforesaid market reflects\n\n                that in this market, there are no significant barriers to entry\n\n                and consumers appear to be price sensitive. Based on the\n\n                above, the Commission is of the view that even though\n\n                &#x27;WhatsApp&#x27; appears to be dominant in the relevant market,\n\n                the allegations of predatory pricing have no substance and\n\n                the OP has not contravened any of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n\n                4</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">                20. In the light of the above analysis, the Commission finds\n\n                that no prima facie case of contravention of the provisions\n\n                of <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 4</a> of the Act is made out against the OP in the\n\n                instant matter.

The R2/WhatsApp LLC has no access to user chat contents\n\n               as technically messages are end to end encrypted.\n\n           b. Since end-to-end encryption means no other than the\n\n               sender and recipients, not even WhatsApp can read or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                 Page 30 of 58</span>\n                otherwise      access     message/   all   content.   Technically\n\n               encryption offers a secrecy and it can be read only by those\n\n               to whom it is addressed and this is a reason that it is widely\n\n               prevalent and being used by the Banks/e-commerce sites\n\n               and other devices manufacturing etc. What it was stated\n\n               by the Ld. Sr. Counsel that 2016 update allowed WhatsApp\n\n               to collect and share limited information with Meta and\n\n               other 3rd parties for specific purposes. He went on to\n\n               submit that WhatsApp only collects limited information\n\n               from its users as per its 2016 privacy policy and a user is\n\n               required to provide their mobile number and users are only\n\n               required to enter at least some characters in the name field\n\n               and they are not required to provide a real name. Since\n\n               WhatsApp is not verifying user name and so is the case\n\n               with sharing of other information including profile photo is\n\n               optional.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           c. It was submitted by the Ld. Sr. Counsel that WhatsApp\n\n               with Meta under the 2016 update, but the data sharing\n\n               for Meta&#x27;s own use was to achieve three specific purposes\n\n               (as also recognized by R1): (i) business analytics (for\n\n               example, assessing how may WhatsApp users were also\n\n               users of Meta); (ii) administrative, operational, and security\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                      Page 31 of 58</span>\n                purpose (such as preventing spam, abuse, infringement,\n\n               understanding services use); and (iii) improving Meta ads\n\n               and services (for example, giving Meta users better friend\n\n               suggestions and more relevant advertisement).\n\n           d. WhatsApp cannot and would not access or share user&#x27;s\n\n               chats with third parties. It is also submitted that WhatsApp\n\n               completed the implementation of end-to-end encryption in\n\n               2016 for all messages on WhatsApp. All types of WhatsApp\n\n               messages (including chats, group chats, images, videos,\n\n               voice messages and files) are protected by end-to-end\n\n               encryption. WhatsApp&#x27;s end to end encryption system\n\n               ensures that messages exchanged between WhatsApp\n\n               users cannot be decrypted and viewed by anyone other\n\n               than the sender and recipient of the message through their\n\n               WhatsApp applications. Since WhatsApp does not have\n\n               access to the messages (including videos, photos etc.)\n\n               shared between its users, the question of sharing such\n\n               messages with third parties does not arise. In other words,\n\n               neither WhatsApp nor any third party, including Facebook\n\n               can read messages exchanged on WhatsApp. WhatsApp\n\n               cannot and does not share the content of communications\n\n               with anybody. Without prejudice to the fact that the R2 is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                 Page 32 of 58</span>\n                not dominant, it is submitted that no document of R2 can\n\n               be said to be abusive, or in any manner in contravention\n\n               of <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 4</a> of the Act. It is worth noting that, whilst the\n\n               Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court has upheld the validity of the\n\n               Update, Respondent No.1 has also rejected the allegations\n\n               of the Update being unfair. No Indian court or authority\n\n               has found any element of unfairness or illegality in the\n\n               update. In the case of DLF Limited Vs. CCI (Appeal No. 20\n\n               of 2011 dated 19th may, 2014, which involved an alleged\n\n               violation of <a href=\"/doc/716328/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 4(2)(a)</a> of the Act. the COMPAT held that\n\n               unless there is an &#x27;imposition&#x27; of unfair or discriminatory\n\n               condition there will be no breach of <a href=\"/doc/716328/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 4(2)(a)(i)</a> of the\n\n               Act. Further where acts have been voluntarily conducted\n\n               (such as in the present case), there can be no &#x27;imposition&#x27;\n\n               as &#x27;imposition&#x27; has an element of compulsion. Therefore,\n\n               before arriving at a finding of an abuse under <a href=\"/doc/716328/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n\n               4(2)(a)</a> of the Act, the Appellant is required to establish that\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">               (a) the Update was &#x27;imposed&#x27; on users, and (b) the Update\n\n               was &#x27;unfair&#x27; and the Appellant has filed to meet either of\n\n               these requirements.

At the outset, it is important to note that the 2012 Privacy\n\n               Policy of R2 specifically allowed it to (i) amend its privacy\n\n               policy , (ii) share user information with a third party service\n\n               provider &quot;to the extent that is reasonably necessary to\n\n               perform, improve or maintain the WhatsApp Service&quot; and\n\n               &quot;to protect the security or integrity of the WhatsApp site or\n\n               our servers, and to protect the rights property or personal\n\n               safety of WhatsApp, our users or others&quot;, and (iii) in case\n\n               of an acquisition or merger       of R2 with a third party,\n\n               transfer or assign the information collected from users to\n\n               such third party. These are standard provisions, which\n\n               reserve the commercial rights of any service provider.\n\n               Though the 2012 Privacy Policy allowed R2 to update its\n\n               privacy policy without seeking further user consent, R2\n\n               went above and beyond what was required under the\n\n               Privacy Policy. R2 ensured that all users received clear and\n\n               prominent notice of the Update, including the revised\n\n               Privacy Policy, and an opportunity to consent to the\n\n               Update, if they so choose, by affirmatively accepting the\n\n               Update. Existing users were given thirty days to decide\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                   Page 34 of 58</span>\n                 whether to consent voluntarily to the Update by clicking\n\n                &quot;Agree&quot;, and new users similarly had to click &quot;Agree\n\n                &amp; Continue.&quot; In addition, Respondent No. 2 implemented a\n\n                control that gave existing users the further choice not to\n\n                have their account information used by Facebook, Inc. to\n\n                improve      their    Facebook advertisements   and   product\n\n                experiences. It is, therefore, humbly submitted that since\n\n                the Update cannot be said to have been &quot;imposed&quot; by\n\n                Respondent No. 2 on its users, there can be no violation of\n\n                <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 4(2)(a)</a> of the Competition Act, and this allegation\n\n                should be dismissed on this basis alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">           f.   That <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 4</a> of the Competition Act deals with only ex\n\n                post violations of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_26\">Competition Act</a> and not with\n\n                theoretical prospective violations that have no basis in fact.\n\n                Therefore, in the absence of evidence of existing effects or\n\n                likely adverse effects on competition, there can be no\n\n                finding of an imposition of an unfair term or condition.\n\n                Further, there is no allegation that the Update excluded or\n\n                foreclosed      any      other   consumer     communications\n\n                application, or that there was any harm to consumers /\n\n                users of consumer communications applications, or, for\n\n                that matter, any harm to users of WhatsApp, or otherwise\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                      Page 35 of 58</span>\n                restricted competition in any relevant market in India.\n\n               Without even these most basic elements of an alleged\n\n               violation of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_27\">Competition Act</a>, the present Appeal\n\n               should not be entertained. Without prejudice to the\n\n               submissions that the users had a clear choice to opt out\n\n               and          switch       to     alternate       consumer\n\n               communications applications, it is submitted that the\n\n               mere lack of an option to opt out of sharing any\n\n               information whatsoever and continue to use WhatsApp\n\n               ipso facto cannot be unfair or abusive. The supposed\n\n               lack of choice must lead to a competitive harm in order to\n\n               be cognizable under the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_28\">Competition Act</a> - i.e. there must\n\n               be foreclosure of competition shown; there also needs to be\n\n               a demonstration of such a harm. All end-user license\n\n               agreements (EULA) in the software markets are standard\n\n               &#x27;take it or leave it&#x27; agreements, without any option to\n\n               reserve any one portion. If the mere lack of an option\n\n               to reject or reserve any portion of the terms of use / EULA\n\n               is considered to be abusive, as is alleged by the Appellant,\n\n               then any and all such terms / EULAs of an allegedly\n\n               dominant enterprise would be in contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n               4</a> of the Competition Act. This would severely infringe an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                 Page 36 of 58</span>\n                enterprise&#x27;s rights to enter into contractual relationships\n\n               under      terms      it   considers      reasonable.       Therefore,\n\n               the allegation of the Appellant that the Update was unfair\n\n               is baseless and against competition law principles, and\n\n               ought to be dismissed. The Appellant also alleges that the\n\n               &quot;assurance&quot;       given    earlier     through official     blogs    by\n\n               Respondent         No.     2    that       the     collected        user\n\n               information would not be used for commercial purposes\n\n               was &quot;unfairly&quot; withdrawn by the update. The Appellant has\n\n               completely misconstrued the postings by Respondent No.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">               2. This post is irrelevant in the present case, as the\n\n               proposed business model of charging users a fee was never\n\n               implemented in India except for a short duration to\n\n               iPhone users. In any event, the post merely sought to\n\n               explain     Respondent No.       2&#x27;s    then     proposed      revenue\n\n               generation model of charging a fee rather than generating\n\n               revenue through advertisements / ads. It is submitted that\n\n               the 2012 Privacy Policy of Respondent No. 2 and Update\n\n               are wholly consistent with standard industry practice\n\n               with respect to the collection and use of information to\n\n               provide and improve the services.

A rule that precluded such integration\n\n               and data sharing efforts would damage investment and\n\n               discourage acquisitions in India&#x27;s technology industry, as\n\n               any acquirer would face the prospect that changes to the\n\n               target&#x27;s data sharing practice (post acquisition / merger)\n\n               could be viewed as anti-competitive conduct under the\n\n               provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_30\">Competition Act</a>.&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">           g. The R2 has submitted that                several industries such\n\n               as technology,            e-commerce,       media,           energy,\n\n               telecommunications, insurance, banking and transport\n\n               rely on the collection and use of data to improve the\n\n               experience for its users. Similarly, sharing of limited data\n\n               by Respondent No. 2 with Facebook, Inc. was intended to\n\n               (as recognised by Respondent No. 1), among other\n\n               things, improve user experience, for example, by more\n\n               effectively    fighting spam    and     abuse,    and   by    giving\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                         Page 38 of 58</span>\n                Facebook users an improved products and ads experience.\n\n               Further,     the     Update     clearly   informed users     of     the\n\n               information         and   the     purposes     for   which        user\n\n               information would be shared with Facebook, Inc. if they\n\n               consented to the Update. The privacy policies of other free\n\n               consumer communications applications such as WeChat,\n\n               Viber, Hike, Line, and Snapchat contain almost identical\n\n               language as Respondent No. 2&#x27;s with respect to the\n\n               collection and use of data to improve the user experience,\n\n               including      by    providing     targeted   advertising.     It    is\n\n               further important to note that information shared with\n\n               Facebook, Inc. is not shared onto Facebook or any of the\n\n               other family of applications for others to see. In any event,\n\n               Respondent No. 2 provided its existing users with a control\n\n               that went above and beyond the law and industry\n\n               standard, enabling those users to decide whether or\n\n               not Facebook, Inc. may use their account information to\n\n               improve their Facebook advertisements and products\n\n               experience. Further,          several      governments       owned\n\n               companies, including the State Bank of India, and the\n\n               Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited,\n\n               also collect and use customer information in similar ways\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                        Page 39 of 58</span>\n                see https://www.onlinesbi.com/sbijava/PrivacyStatemen\n\n               t.html: https://www.services.irctc.co.in/beta_htmls/term\n\n               _termsrc.html. As is evident from the above, Respondent\n\n               No. 2 submits that collection of data is a common practice\n\n               among online market participants, and it is important for\n\n               improving the customer experience and quality of services.\n\n               The mere collection and use of data by a business cannot\n\n               be held to be unfair. Users benefit from the improved\n\n               quality of services and products that result from the use of\n\n               this data, and those products and services are often\n\n               provided at no cost for the user. The Appellant has not\n\n               provided any evidence or reasoning as to how such\n\n               collection and usage of user information has damaged him\n\n               or any other user of WhatsApp. In fact, the sharing of\n\n               information has in no way diminished, but to the contrary\n\n               has improved, the quality of services offered. Further, if the\n\n               Appellant&#x27;s theory were to be accepted, then when any of\n\n               the technology companies named above or any other\n\n               company operating in India changes its Privacy Policy to\n\n               better serve its users, such a change would constitute an\n\n               unfair act by resulting in a change to the user experience.\n\n               Such a result would, of course, be absurd, and would only\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                   Page 40 of 58</span>\n                serve    to   harm        Indian   users   of   these   services   by\n\n               die incentivizing innovation and change. This further\n\n               shows why the Appellant&#x27;s allegation that the change to the\n\n               Privacy Policy was unfair should be rejected.\n\n           h. WhatsApp is not dominant in any relevant market, and\n\n               consequently, cannot be said to have abused its dominant\n\n               position; Respondent No. 2 humbly submits that the\n\n               definition of relevant market can be left open in the instant\n\n               case as there is no abuse that can be established; this has\n\n               been unequivocally held by Respondent No. 1 in the\n\n               detailed Impugned Order. In fact, in the absence of\n\n               any abuse, there is no requirement to assess whether\n\n               Respondent No. 2 enjoys a dominant position. Accordingly,\n\n               Respondent No. 2 reserves its right to make detailed\n\n               submissions       on relevant market and assessment of\n\n               dominant       position. Without      prejudice    to   the   above,\n\n               assuming without accepting the relevant market to be as\n\n               defined by Respondent No. 1, i.e., &quot;the market for instant\n\n               messaging services using consumer communications apps\n\n               through smartphones in India&quot; (Consumer Communications\n\n               Applications), it is humbly submitted that Respondent No.\n\n               2 cannot be said to be dominant.

Explanation (a) to <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 4</a> of the Act sets out the\n\n               test for dominance and states that for an enterprise to\n\n               enjoy a dominant position, it must be in a position of\n\n               strength that enables it to act independently of competitive\n\n               forces prevailing in the market or affect competitors,\n\n               consumers or the relevant market in its favour. This is not\n\n               the case here, and the Appellant has failed to provide\n\n               any comparative analysis or provide any evidence that\n\n               Respondent        No. 2     acts   independent           of   competitive\n\n               constraint        from        other      providers            of consumer\n\n               communications            applications       active     in    India   such\n\n               as Google Hangouts, iMessage, Viber, Hike, Line, imo,\n\n               Messenger, Snapchat, or the SMS services offered by every\n\n               telecommunications operator in India.

First, the percentage of phones that have\n\n               downloaded a particular app does not indicate how\n\n               frequently such an app is used or its share of a market in\n\n               any meaningful sense. Indeed, the evidence that is in the\n\n               record         indicates    that         other       consumer\n\n               communications applications have entered successfully\n\n               and grown rapidly. Hike, for example, has over 100 million\n\n               users and is only one of many such services. Second,\n\n               Respondent No. 2 submits that market shares in and\n\n               of themselves, do not establish dominance. In a technology\n\n               driven market that is dynamic and constantly evolving,\n\n               such as the market under consideration in the present\n\n               case, market shares tend to fluctuate drastically and are\n\n               not sufficient to show dominance. This is also recognized\n\n               by the EC in Facebook/WhatsApp where it held that &quot;the\n\n               consumer       communications   sector    is   a   recent   and\n\n               fast growing sector which is characterised by frequent\n\n               market entry and short innovation cycles in which large\n\n               market shares may turn out to be ephemeral.&quot; Respondent\n\n               No. 1 has recognized this in its recent decision in the Ola\n\n               Case, where it acknowledged the dynamic nature of\n\n               innovation driven markets, and expressed its hesitation to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                    Page 43 of 58</span>\n                interfere     where       such interference      poses     a    risk    of\n\n               prescribing       sub-optimal        solutions      to nascent         and\n\n               developing       markets.       Considering      factors       such     as\n\n               rapid market expansion, low entry barriers and effective\n\n               entry of competitors, countervailing forces in the market,\n\n               and the nature of competition in the dynamic innovation\n\n               driven markets, Respondent No. 1 held the mobile\n\n               application based taxi aggregator - &#x27;Ola Cabs&#x27; - not to be\n\n               dominant. It is submitted that similar factors exist in the\n\n               Consumer Communications Applications market as well,\n\n               and, like in the Ola Case, high market shares are\n\n               irrelevant. As the EC found, short innovation cycles are\n\n               present in the Consumer Communications Applications\n\n               Market. When Viber was among the few (along with the\n\n               erstwhile Google Talk, not Hangouts) to offer the option of\n\n               voice calls, it was one of the widest used consumer\n\n               communications applications. When other applications\n\n               began       offering      similar   services,    usage     shifted      to\n\n               other applications fairly quickly especially to those that\n\n               offered a better product.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">           i.

He stressed that WhatsApp has no\n\n               access to user chats content, as messages are end to end\n\n               encrypted. Even on query by the Bench he went on to confirm\n\n               through his submission that WhatsApp messages including\n\n               chats, group chats, videos, files etc are end to end encrypted\n\n               and nobody other than the sender and recipients can illicit\n\n               any information out of that even not WhatsApp or any third\n\n               party. Encryption is technical a widely used programme by\n\n               the Banks, e-commerce site etc.\n\n           g. It was also confirmed by the learned Sr. Counsel that the\n\n               WhatsApp has collected only mobile number of the user and\n\n               some characters in the name field which may not be a real\n\n               name and sharing of all other information was optional.\n\n           h. He has stressed that the coverage of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 4(2)(a)</a> of the Act\n\n               requires to prove by the Appellant that it has imposed directly\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                 Page 48 of 58</span>\n                or indirectly unfair or discriminatory conditions in services.\n\n               The Appellant has failed to prove with any data or any\n\n               reasoning other than that inbuilt system has provided the\n\n               user with the option to accept the update or disconnect from\n\n               WhatsApp site.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">           i.

It is also very much clear that the 2012 Privacy Policy of\n\n               WhatsApp, allowed WhatsApp to amend its privacy policy and\n\n               share user&#x27;s information with a third-party service provider to\n\n               the extent it is reasonably necessary to maintain or improve\n\n               the WhatsApp service and to protect the security or integrity\n\n               of the WhatsApp site or servers. WhatsApp has not also\n\n               washed off its hands for keeping the users unaware in case of\n\n               data breach, if it comes to their notice as was confirmed by\n\n               the Ld.

As far as the issue of &#x27;predatory pricing&#x27; is\n\n               concerned, there is no cost being charged by WhatsApp\n\n               messaging at the moment and hence, directly we cannot\n\n               confirm that it is predatory prices as R1/Commission has\n\n               rightly observed that there are no significant costs preventing\n\n               the users to switch from one consumer communication Apps\n\n               to another as also almost all consumer communication Apps\n\n               are offered free of costs or at a very low price (mostly free) and\n\n               available normally by simple user interfaces.

Hence,\n\n               based on all these discussions, we do not find even the\n\n               allegations of &#x27;predatory pricing&#x27; has any substance.\n\n           t. As far as reliance on foreign proceedings pointed out by the\n\n               Appellant is concerned, what we observed in certain foreign\n\n               jurisdiction the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_38\">Indian Competition Act</a> and\n\n               those foreign jurisdiction, <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_39\">Competition Act</a> have different\n\n               connotation e.g. Italian Competition Authority under <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_40\">Article\n\n               20</a><a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_41\">, 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_42\">&amp; 25</a> of the Italian Court provisions do not related to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Competition Appeal (AT) No. 13 of 2017                   Page 54 of 58</span>\n                abuse of dominance or any Anti-Competitive Behavior which\n\n               are prohibited under the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_43\">(Indian) Competition Act</a> 2002 vide\n\n               Section 4.
