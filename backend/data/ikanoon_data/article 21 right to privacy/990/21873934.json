To elaborate further, a few wins in the start may entice the player\n\n                  to play with more money and naturally becomes addictive which may\n\n                  eventually allow himself to be lost in the game.

In a Country like ours, which is still\n\n                  progressing, where we are yet to attain 100% literacy and the different\n\n                  categories of economic and social backgrounds from which people come, it\n\n                  would be impossible to expect every individual accessing the game to have\n\n                  100% knowledge about the consequences or risks that is involved. It is only\n\n                  in recent time that there is a widespread access to internet and\n\n                  smartphones enabling people to access an assortment of online\n\n                  entertainment/games/trade. Moreover, playing rummy or poker games\n\n                  online is a relatively new ballgame for our people, as more often these\n\n                  games were played offline only against fellow humans who the player gets\n\n                  to observe and play the cards taking into consideration even the slightest\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                  Page No.42/57</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                ( Uploaded on: 03/06/2025 11:33:52 am )\n\f                                                      W.P.Nos.6784, 6794, 6799, 6970, 8832 and 13158 of 2025\n\n                  hand movements and body languages and other facial reactions exhibited.\n\n                  But when played through online mode, the cards are often dealt by the\n\n                  gaming platform and there is no scope to take note of these and the player\n\n                  may not even know against whom the game is played.

Also there is a sense of discipline involved in terms of playing\n\n                  games physically. Be it games like cricket or chess, there is a certain game\n\n                  discipline and players are more professional in their approach towards the\n\n                  game. Though Winning is the goal, it is not just confined to that. The nature,\n\n                  mode and ethics of playing the game is equally important.

But the\n\n                  online RMGs do not seem to possess such level of discipline or\n\n                  professionalism. It is played more for the thrill of winning and a certain level\n\n                  of addiction sets in after a point.

A State should work towards the welfare of the people and the\n\n                  comparison that only online RMGs are regulated, other online activities are\n\n                  not regulated is not justifiable. Every such activity which is inconsistent with\n\n                  the welfare of the people must stand regulated by the State. The decibel\n\n                  level of right to privacy or personal autonomy granted across different\n\n                  countries may fluctuate based on the social, economic and cultural\n\n                  backgrounds in each country. To each their own. Our country is built on a\n\n                  social and cultural fabric which is distinct from the rest of the world. A\n\n                  random comparison with the rights or laws prevalent in other countries\n\n                  cannot be blindly applied here. An empirical approach must be adopted\n\n                  before applying laws from other countries. India is unique, multi cultural,\n\n                  multi linguistic, socially and culturally well built with a strong democratic\n\n                  structure.

Protecting rights of the people is first and foremost as\n\n                  derived from our Constitution.

In the eyes of this Court, the submission put forth by the State is\n\n                  not restricted to just paternalism but goes a step beyond in ensuring the\n\n                  physical, mental and financial well being of its citizens which is its\n\n                  incumbent duty to protect. Though personal autonomy ought to be given\n\n                  utmost importance as given in many other countries across the world, that\n\n                  cannot be a sole deciding factor. Other aspects including the impetus on\n\n                  health and welfare of the citizens also form the spine of our Constitution.\n\n                  More often than not, the first right that is pleaded for in cases such as this is\n\n                  right to privacy as upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Puttaswamy&#x27;s\n\n                  case.
