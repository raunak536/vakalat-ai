The petitioner has challenged a Memo dated 11th March, 2022 issued by the\n\nAssistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) disclosing certain documents under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">The\n\nRight to Information Act, 2005</a>, with reference to an ongoing police case. The\n\ndocuments in question are a series of WhatsApp chats between one Rashika Jain\n\n(since deceased) and Abhishek Padia from 26th November, 2014 -22nd July, 2019.\n\nThe documents also include photographs of Rashika Jain and Abhishek Padia.\n\nThe petitioner is the father of the deceased Rashika Jain and seeks a restraint on\n\nthe disclosure of the WhatsApp chats between his late daughter and her friend\n\nAbhishek Padia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The reference made above to an ongoing P.S Case is relevant for a more\n\ncomplete appreciation of the concerns of the parties before the Court. The\n\npetitioner&#x27;s daughter Rashika Jain and Kushal Agarwal (son of respondents\n\nNaresh and Nilam Agarwal) were married on 9th February, 2020. Rashika Jain died\n\non 16th February, 2021 under mysterious circumstances. The Jains and the\n\nAgarwals thereafter filed criminal proceedings against each other. The petitioner\n\nlodged a complaint with the Alipore P.S on 17th February, 2021 against Kushal\n\nAgarwal and his parents (the Alipore P.S. Case). The Agarwals lodged a case in the\n\nKalighat P.S on 22nd July, 2021 against the petitioner and his wife for removal of\n\njewellery belonging to Rashika Jain from the locker of the Axis Bank (the Kalighat\n\nP.S Case). The petitioner was granted anticipatory bail by this Court on 21st June,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                           3</span>\n\n\n2022. Kushal Agarwal, the husband of late Rashika Jain, is presently in custody\n\nand an application for bail has recently been rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.    The contention of learned senior counsel Mr. Kalyan Bandhopadhyay,\n\nappearing for the petitioner, Mahendra Kumar Jain, being the father of the\n\ndeceased Rashika Jain, is that the WhatsApp chats between the petitioner&#x27;s late\n\ndaughter and Abhishek Padia could not have been disclosed under the provisions\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">RTI Act</a>. Counsel submits that the information is required to be kept secret\n\nsince the investigation in the Alipore P.S Case against the Agarwals is continuing.\n\nCounsel relies on Regulation 71 (g) of Chapter V of the Police Regulations, Calcutta\n\n1968 where the contents of a case diary and statements of witnesses are regarded\n\nas privileged information. Counsel submits that the authority acted in breach of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a> of The Constitution of India. Counsel urges that in the present\n\ncase, the information was supplied without due regard to the requirements under\n\nthe aforesaid sections.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Mr. Joydip Kar, learned senior counsel appearing for the Agarwal family\n\n(respondent nos. 7 to 9), submits that the information furnished was required for\n\nthe ongoing investigation under the Kalighat P.S. Case with regard to removal of\n\njewellery from the concerned Bank. Counsel submits that there is no provision\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a> which bars disclosure of information which is required as\n\nevidence for corroborative purposes. Counsel further submits that the information\n\nwas in the public domain on the date of furnishing of the information by the police\n\nauthorities. It is also submitted that the right to privacy is subject to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                             4</span>\n\n\nqualifications provided under the law. Counsel urges that the respondents have a\n\nright to self-defence against the charges brought by the Jains and that the\n\ninformation is required for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">5.    Mr. Pranab Kumar Dutta, learned senior counsel appearing for Rahul\n\nAgarwal (respondent no. 6), being the defacto complainant in the Kalighat P.S Case\n\nand a cousin of Kushal Agarwal (husband of late Rashika Jain) submits that an\n\nRTI application was made by Rahul Agarwal to the SPIO on 2nd March, 2022.\n\nCounsel relies on a progress report dated 6th February, 2022 in the Kalighat P.S\n\nCase which reflects the name of Abhishek Padia as having emerged from the\n\nstatements of witnesses. Counsel stresses that <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">section 8(1)(j)</a> has to be read in\n\nconjunction with <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_7\">section 11</a> of the RTI Act on the point of voluntary disclosure.\n\nCounsel supports the case sought to be made out by the Agarwals and urges that\n\nthe information in question is necessary for the ongoing investigation.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">6.    Mr. Amitesh Banerjee, learned senior standing counsel for the State clarifies\n\nthe ongoing criminal investigations in the two P.S Cases, namely, Alipore P.S Case\n\n(where the Agarwals are the accused) and Kalighat P.S Case (where the Jains are\n\nthe accused). It is submitted that the documents are regarded to be in the public\n\ndomain from the time they are disclosed to the police authorities. Counsel submits\n\nthat the information hence loses the character of private information. Counsel\n\nsubmits that the police are independent authorities and have no leaning towards\n\nor against any of the parties before the Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                   5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">7.    The contentions of the parties can be grouped under the following sub-\n\nheads. The decision is structured accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">A. The Right to Information Act</a>, 2005\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">8.    The petitioner seeks to rely on two provisions of the Act to stop any further\n\nsteps being taken in the disclosure of the WhatsApp messages of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nlate daughter and Abhishek Padia. The first of the provisions is <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_9\">section 8(1)(h)</a> of\n\nthe Act by which the designated authorities under the Act shall not be under any\n\nobligation to give any citizen, information which would impede the process of\n\ninvestigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. It is doubtful whether\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_10\">section 8(1)(h)</a> would come to the assistance of the petitioner since the case sought\n\nto be made out is the reverse. The petitioner urges that the information disclosed\n\nor in the process of being further disclosed, is wholly unnecessary to the ongoing\n\ninvestigation in the Alipore and Kalighat P.S. cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">9.    The second provision, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_11\">section 8(1)(j)</a> however fits the parameters of the\n\nargument made and is set out below;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;8.(1) ...................\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               (j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which\n       has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause\n       unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public\n       Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority,\n       as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure\n       of such information.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                              6</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">Unlike the other clauses under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_12\">section 8(1)</a>, clause (j) covers the space of personal\n\ninformation and the right to privacy. In essence, the clamp on disclosure of\n\ninformation, unlike the object of transparency of the 2005 Act, travels from\n\nnational security issues, parliamentary privilege, sanctity of court orders,\n\ninternational relations and settles in the corner of the private space of an\n\nindividual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">10.   <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_13\">Section    8(1)(j)</a>   contemplates     personal    information       which    is   wholly\n\nunnecessary to any public interest. The exception to non-disclosure of such\n\ninformation is where the CPIO/SPIO (Central Public Information Officer/State\n\nPublic Information Officer) is satisfied that unlocking the disclosure of such\n\ninformation is     necessary    for   the   larger   public   interest.    The    satisfaction\n\nrequirement brings with it a duty to engage with the relevant facts and come to a\n\nspecific view or opinion upon due application of mind and an assessment of the\n\ncircumstances attending the disclosure. There must hence be a definite opinion\n\nexpressed on the link between the personal information sought for and the larger\n\npublic interest justifying the departure from protection of privacy of such\n\ninformation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">11.   <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act which relates to third-party information cannot\n\ncome to the rescue of the respondents. This section contemplates a situation\n\nwhere CPIO/SPIO intends to disclose any information on the request made under\n\nthis Act and which has been supplied by a third party and has also been treated\n\nas confidential by that third party. In such cases, the CPIO/SPIO shall give a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                           7</span>\n\n\nwritten notice to such third party of the request and the fact that the Officer\n\nintends to disclose the information. The Officer must also invite the third party to\n\nmake a submission in writing or orally as to whether the information should be\n\ndisclosed. Even if Abhishek Padia is treated as the &quot;third party&quot; for the purpose of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_15\">section 11</a>, the case reflects that Abhishek Padia was not the only &quot;third party&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">who treated the information as confidential. The procedure to be followed in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_16\">section 11</a> would have to cover every third party whose information was confined\n\nto the private sphere.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">12.   In the present case, the information was disclosed on an application made\n\nunder the Act by one Rahul Agarwal on 2nd March, 2022 for the documents\n\ncollected from Abhishek Padia as mentioned in the progress report filed before the\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore. The information was disclosed by the SPIO and\n\nAssistant Commissioner of Police on 11th March, 2022 to Rahul Agarwal. The\n\ndocuments show that there was an obvious absence of any independent\n\nassessment by the SPIO and ACP as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_17\">section 8(1)(j)</a>. The\n\nrespondent simply gave the information applied for. There was neither any enquiry\n\nmade as to whether the information was necessary for the larger public interest or\n\nwhether the disclosure of personal information was justified in the circumstances.\n\nIn essence, the impugned act of disclosing the WhatsApp messages between the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s deceased daughter and Abhishek Padia falls clearly foul of the fetter on\n\ndisclosing personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                8</span>\n\n\nB. Information emanating from the private space\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">13.   The concept of privacy and private information underpins the constitutional\n\nguarantee of freedom of thought and associations. It includes the right to be free\n\nfrom interference and intrusion, whether from the prying eyes of a neighbour or\n\nthe eavesdropping ears of an associate or even the intrusive camera of a\n\nphotographer. Private information also includes the following inalienable - and\n\noften indefinable - characteristics;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">          (i) Private information is a part of the private space of an individual\n\n          where the individual retains full agency on controlling the space and its\n\n          boundaries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">          (ii) Information   which   relates   to   personal   choices,   relationships,\n\n          intimacies, sexual preferences and orientation, home, family life; in\n\n          essence any thought or idea which a person does not wish to be made\n\n          known to the world or even beyond the confines of the person\n\n          himself/herself or a group chosen by the persons, is private information.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">          (iii) The information-creator remains in the driver&#x27;s seat and exercises\n\n          complete cruise-control on the movement and destination of the\n\n          information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">          (iv) It necessarily emanates from a source; namely of a person who\n\n          preserves information for private consumption and enjoyment between\n\n          two or more persons forming the periphery of the limits of access to the\n\n          information exchanged among themselves.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                   9</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">(v) It is information which is protected from surveillance whether by\n\nanother individual, a group or the society at large. &quot;Information privacy&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">is also about protection of information which says who we are, what we\n\ndo and what we believe in.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(vi) The concept of personal space and information also carries with it\n\nthe right to be forgotten. Any information shared with another or put in\n\nthe public domain does not mean that the information of the source\n\nmust remain in public memory for all times to come. In other words,\n\nconcomitant to the right of private information, is the right to be erased\n\nfrom public memory.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(vii) The presumption is of control and agency where the person putting\n\nout the information remains the master of what he/she has put out, who\n\nshould have access to it and for how long. The control does not pass\n\nfrom the disseminator to the receptor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(viii) Sharing of private information with another carries with it an\n\nimplicit pact of confidence. The originator of information has a legitimate\n\nexpectation that the other party will not make the information public.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">This would entail that the other person would only disclose the\n\ninformation to a third party upon the consent of the originator.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">(ix) The right is informed with the overriding characteristic of consent.\n\nThe originator of information must agree to the information being\n\ndisseminated   beyond    the   boundaries    of   consensual   sharing   of\n\ninformation.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             10</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">         (x) The right is exercisable against the world at large; a right in rem so to\n\n         speak. An unsuspecting person who is filmed or photographed by a\n\n         journalist in a street has the right to seek injunction against the\n\n         publication of that photograph regardless of whether there is an\n\n         understanding between the person photographed and the photographer.\n\n         To use another analogy, a person who picks up a diary containing\n\n         personal notes belonging to another has the obligation not to make the\n\n         contents of that diary public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">         (xi) As a logical extension even if a person ventures into the public, he or\n\n         she does not relinquish his/her claims to the private sphere.\n\n\nThe above pointers sharpen and invigorate the right to life and personal liberty\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It also reinforces the freedoms under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19</a> including the freedom to choose who we want to associate with and live\n\nour lives by our personal choices without interference in that private realm.\n\n\nC. The concept of public domain\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">14.   The expression &quot;public domain&quot; is broadly used for an information-space\n\nwhere anybody and everybody can access information. Information which is put\n\nout for the consumption, use and enjoyment of one and all is said to be in the\n\npublic domain. By the act of sharing the information in the public sphere the\n\ndisseminator relinquishes the right to preserve the information within the private\n\nspace. Social media, with the newly introduced privacy settings (Group Firewalls),\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         11</span>\n\n\nis an instance where the information shared assumes the character of private\n\ninformation. The assumption of privacy is also evident from the &quot;end-to-end\n\nencrypted&quot; security assurance of the WhatsApp messaging system.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">15.   In the present context, it is relevant to trace the journey of the information\n\n(in the form of WhatsApp messages and photographs) for understanding whether\n\nthe information can be treated as being in the public domain and thus losing the\n\ncharacter of private information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">16.   The records show that Abhishek Padia was mentioned in the Progress\n\nReport dated 6.2.2022 before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Alipore Court. The\n\nProgress Report states that Abhishek Padia had given a statement under section\n\n161 of The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_21\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 after which documents and\n\nphotographs were collected from the said Abhishek Padia. It was on this basis that\n\nRahul Agarwal filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_22\">section 6</a> of the RTI Act seeking the\n\ndocuments which had been collected from Abhishek Padia. The information was\n\nthereafter disclosed by the impugned letter of the SPIO and ACP to Rahul Agarwal\n\non 11.3.2022. The chain of events makes it clear that the WhatsApp messages\n\nbetween the petitioner&#x27;s daughter (Rashika Jain) and Abhishek Padia was not in\n\nthe public domain before the same was disclosed by Abhishek Padia to the\n\nconcerned authorities. The disclosure of the information by Abhishek Padia cannot\n\nbe treated as a voluntary act of disclosure where the person had the ability to\n\nexercise his informed choice in the matter. It can safely be presumed that the\n\ndisclosure was made under duress and may even have been for self-preservation.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           12</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">17.   Further, the disclosure of information by Abhishek Padia lacked the\n\nconsent-criterion of the other party to the chats, namely, Rashika Jain. A chat\n\nnecessarily includes more than one party and colours the conversation with the\n\nhue of privacy. The concept of a chat-room even in the internet-space gives a sense\n\nof virtual privacy where people intending to chat with one another are provided\n\nwith a virtual private-room for such exchanges. Hence, without the consent of the\n\nother party to the conversation, furnishing of the WhatsApp messages by Abhishek\n\nPadia breached the obligation to keep the WhatsApp chats private and restricted\n\nbetween himself and Rashika Jain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">D. Breach of confidence\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">18.   The concept of &quot;breach of confidence&quot; or a non-consensual violation of the\n\nlimits of private space is the strongest contender for protection of privacy. It is an\n\nequitable principle developed from English cases where first, the information must\n\nhave the necessary quality of confidence; second, the information must have been\n\nimparted in circumstances embodying an obligation of confidence; and third, there\n\nmust have been an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the\n\nother party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">19.   Breach of confidence traditionally fastens on the conscience of one to\n\nenforce equitable duties which arises out of his/her relationship with the other.\n\nSimply put, confidential information which comes to the knowledge of a person in\n\ncircumstances where he is put on notice or is held to have agreed that the\n\ninformation is confidential, carries with it the equitable principle that the person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                           13</span>\n\n\nreceiving the information should be precluded from disclosing the information to\n\nothers. It may also be useful to stretch the borders of confidentiality to make a\n\npoint against automatic sharing of information just because the information is in\n\nthe public space. There may be unique ways in which information obtained from\n\nthe public domain is used to sully a person&#x27;s image and reputation or ridicule a\n\nperson&#x27;s identity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">E. Respect for the dead\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">20.   There is another factor which simply cannot be ignored in the present case.\n\nThe marriage of Rashika Jain to Kushal Agarwal was solemnized after the\n\nWhatsApp messages were exchanged between Rashika Jain and Abhishek Padia.\n\nThe subsequent death of Rashika Jain transforms the case from an investigation\n\nsimpliciter to one with moral underpinnings with an obligation to respect the dead.\n\nThe obligation assumes a higher moral ground since the deceased cannot defend\n\noneself against any such unwarranted intrusion into her private space. After all,\n\nthe right to privacy draws within its fold, the right to be left alone (or with others)\n\nand the right to treat one&#x27;s intimacies, relationships, beliefs and associations as\n\ninformation which is to remain within the private domain. It is also about the\n\nbelief that a person should be allowed to carry his/her secrets to the grave.\n\nF. The argument of the right to self-defence\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">21.   The respondent Agarwals seek to justify the disclosure of the WhatsApp\n\nmessages and photographs between the late Rashika Jain and Abhishek Padia on\n\nthe ground that the information serves as corroborative evidence and can be used\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                           14</span>\n\n\nto verify the contradictory evidence given by the witnesses in the Alipore P.S Case.\n\nThis also means that the information which was furnished against the RTI\n\napplication of Rahul Agarwal in connection with the Kalighat P.S Case dealing with\n\nremoval of jewellery by the Jains, is now being intended to be used to defend the\n\ncharges in the Alipore P.S Case. Apart from the questionable intention of the\n\nAgarwals in making the information public and using it for self-serving reasons,\n\nthe disclosure of the information is confronted by built-in-restrictions in the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_23\">RTI\n\nAct</a> itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">22.    <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8</a> of the Act is an exception to the mandate of the Act namely for\n\ncitizens to secure access to information under the control of public authorities and\n\nfor ensuring transparency and accountability in the work of every public authority.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8</a> hence is a pronounced departure from the object of the Act and provides\n\nfor a specific enumeration of information which is not to be disclosed to any\n\ncitizen. The statutory-restriction is clothed in comparatively softer terms - &quot;... there\n\nshall be no obligation to give any citizen ...&quot;. The gamut of prohibition covers\n\nnational security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation\n\nwith foreign States, parliamentary privilege, trade secrets, fiduciary relationship,\n\nphysical safety of individuals, ongoing investigations and invasion of privacy. The\n\nrespondents must hence ascertain that the information applied for does not fall\n\nwithin <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_26\">section 8(1)(a)</a>-(j).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">23.    It is not the respondents&#x27; case that the information is not private information\n\nbetween two individuals or ceased to retain that character at any point of time.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                          15</span>\n\n\nWhat the respondents say is that the information was carried to the public domain\n\non disclosure of the same by Abhishek Padia. There is an essential difference\n\nbetween the two. The content of the information is the determinative factor and\n\nwould signify whether an information is personal or private. The conversation of\n\ntwo or more persons becomes private where the persons in that conversation\n\nintend the exchange to remain within their personal circle and not be divulged to\n\nthe world at large. The act of Abhishek Padia furnishing WhatsApp messages and\n\nphotographs to the police authorities does not transform the nature or the content\n\nof the messages from private to non-private.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_14\">24.   Further, the determination as to whether the information crosses over the\n\nprivate-public boundary is a determination which is to be made by the concerned\n\nOfficer under the Act. The concerned Officer must come to an independent\n\nassessment as to whether the hold of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_27\">section 8(1)(j)</a> can be unlocked by a larger\n\nissue of public interest. To add, the right to privacy must be harmonised with the\n\noverwhelming need to disclose the information on public interest considerations\n\n(Ref. Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_28\">India vs. Subhash\n\nChandra Agarwal</a>; (2020) 5 SCC 481). There cannot be an automatic assumption\n\nthat an application for information made by a party interested in an ongoing\n\ninvestigation would naturally entitle such party to receiving that information\n\nwhere the information has the unmistakable character of a private information\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_29\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The argument of self-defence builds on the position\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                           16</span>\n\n\nof this automatic entitlement and discounts the safeguards in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_30\">section 8</a> against\n\nthe disclosure of such information.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">25.   The related argument of the right to privacy being subject to qualifications is\n\nalso fallacious in the context of what <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_31\">section 8</a> of the RTI Act entails. As stated\n\nabove, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_32\">section 8</a> is the lone swimmer against the tide of transparency closely\n\ncradling certain kinds of information from being swept into the sea of public\n\nscrutiny. The qualifications to the privacy-privilege must clearly be spelt out and\n\nparticularised in the relevant statute. The argument that a person&#x27;s right over\n\nhis/her personal information can be compromised in certain cases cannot be read\n\ninto the statute unless the situations warranting disclosure of such information\n\nare specifically provided for. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_33\">The RTI Act</a> does not provide for any such clear\n\nanswers or statutory clarifications which would justify diluting the <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_34\">section 8(1)(j)</a>\n\nbar or qualify the prohibition against the disclosure of private information.\n\n\nG.

The present case brings to the fore the significance of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_45\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of The\n\nRight to Information Act where the unhindered right to information is checked by\n\nkeeping certain information out of reach from the public eye. The Information\n\nOfficer is given the onerous task of determining whether the information should\n\nremain in the private domain or is required to be disclosed in the larger public\n\ninterest. The Information Officer is hence under an obligation to satisfy the\n\naforesaid test. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_46\">The Act</a> also affirms that preservation of private space is sacrosanct\n\nand any disclosure of information emanating from that space must be voluntary\n\nand without compulsion.
