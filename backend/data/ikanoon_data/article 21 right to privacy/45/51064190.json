Out of this wedlock, a baby girl was born on 11/10/2017. The\n                          husband has filed a suit for dissolution of marriage under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 13</a> of\n                          Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, on the ground of cruelty.

The wife has filed her written statement and denied the allegations\n                          made in the plaint. It is also borne out from the records that she has also\n                          filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act seeking\n                          restitution of conjugal rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                          5.    When the suit was at the stage of husband&#x27;s evidence, he sought to\n                          exhibit the WhatsApp chats, to which the wife raised an objection. The\n                          learned Family Court has rejected the wife&#x27;s objection and has allowed the\n                          husband to exhibit the WhatsApp chats. Being aggrieved by this order of the\n                          Family Court, the instant misc. petition has been filed by wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"94698255\" id=\"span_7\">6.

The Judicial Committee\n                                  held that the evidence was rightly admitted. The reason\n                                  given was that if evidence was admissible it matters not how\n                                  it was obtained.

Under of Constitution, probably, no values are\n                                  absolute. All important values, therefore, must be qualified\n                                  and balanced against other important, and often competing,\n                                  values. This process of definition, qualification and\n                                  balancing is as much required with respect to the value of\n                                  freedom of expression as it is for other values. Consequently,\n                                  free speech, in appropriate cases, has got to correlate with\n                                  fair trial.

While a\n                          litigating party certainly has a right to privacy, that right must yield to the\n                          right of an opposing party to bring evidence it considers relevant to court, to\n                          prove its case. It is a settled concept of fair trial that a litigating party gets a\n                          fair chance to bring relevant evidence before court. It is important to\n                          appreciate that while the right to privacy is essentially a personal right, the\n                          right to fair trial has wider ramifications and impacts public justice, which is\n                          a larger cause. The cause of public justice would suffer if the opportunity of\n                          fair trial is denied by shutting-out evidence that a litigating party may wish\n                          to lead, at the very threshold. Saying otherwise, would negate the specific\n                          statutory provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 14</a> of Family Courts Act, which\n                          says that evidence would be admissible, whether or not the same is\n                          otherwise admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_73\">Evidence Act</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">                          21.

Considering the above object and the intention of\n                                  the legislature, in providing for a departure, from the\n                                  normal rules of evidence under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_90\">Evidence Act</a>, in my\n                                  opinion, there was no embargo for the learned Judge of the\n                                  Family Court to accept and exhibit the documents as sought\n                                  by the petitioner-wife. Ultimately, it is the absolute power\n                                  and authority of the Family Court either to accept or\n                                  disregard a particular evidence in finally adjudicating the\n                                  matrimonial dispute.

The judgments cited by learned counsel for the petitioner now needs\n                          to be discussed. The judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/94698255/\" id=\"a_94\">National\n                          Lawyers Campaign</a> (supra), was a case where a writ of mandamus was\n                          sought directing Police and CBI to register an FIR based on a suicide note\n                          which was circulated on WhatsApp platform of which the source was not\n                          disclosed. The petitioners also could not justify their locus to file such a\n                          petition. Thus, this judgment is of no help to the petitioner for the reason\n                          firstly that it does not deal with <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 14</a> of Family Courts Act and\n                          secondly, the judgment is passed on facts of particular case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"195720592\" id=\"span_91\">28.   Another judgment cited by petitioner&#x27;s counsel is the case of <a href=\"/doc/195720592/\" id=\"a_96\">Vibhor\n                          Garg</a> (supra), wherein the husband sought to bring on record a CD and\n                          transcriptions of conversations with his wife, recorded in memory cards/\n                          chips of mobile phones. The Court observed firstly that there is no mention\n                          of such conversation in petition and in affidavit evidence. The same was not\n                          allowed by the Court in view of breach of fundamental right of privacy of\n                          wife. In view of discussion made in earlier part of this order, this Court\n                          respectfully disagree with this view of P&amp;H High Court as the same would\n                          entirely frustrate the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 14</a> of Family Courts Act as also that\n                          of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 122</a> of Evidence Act. Pertinently, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 122</a> of Evidence Act\n                          was not even cited before P&amp;H High Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1058685\" id=\"span_92\">29.

Further, in this case, the Trial Court directed for comparing admitted\n                          voice of respondent with the disputed portion of conversation. The court\n                          held that the act of tapping of conversation without the consent of spouse\n                          was illegal and infringement of the right of privacy of wife. For the reasons\n                          already stated hereinbefore, this Court respectfully disagrees with this view\n                          of Andhra Pradesh High Court also.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100893069\" id=\"span_99\">30.   There are certain judgments of this Court also on the issue which\n                          needs to be referred. The first judgment in the line is in the case of <a href=\"/doc/100893069/\" id=\"a_103\">Anurima\n                          @ Abha Mehta vs. Sunil Mehta</a> reported in 2016(1) MPLJ 333.

This court held that the\n                          conversation is recorded without the knowledge and permission of wife and\n                          is thus infringes her right of privacy.

What value or weightage is to be given to such\n                          evidence is the discretion of the judge, when finally adjudicating the\n                          dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">                          37.
