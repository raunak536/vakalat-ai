The first respondent Selvi.  J.Jayalalitha is the Chief Minister\nof the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu.    She  is  also  the General Secretary of the\npolitical party, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (A.I.A.D.M.K.).  The\nsecond respondent Tmt.N.  Sassikala is a close friend of the first  respondent\nand is  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  first  respondent.    In all 24\npublications made in 21 issues of \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014 are the subject matter  of  the\npresent proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">        2.   The  respondents  filed a suit for injunction and damages against\nthe appellants  in  their  capacity  as  Editor,  Printer  and  Publisher  and\nAssociate Editor  of  \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014  respectively.  In the plaint, it is stated\nthat the first appellant was  arrested  by  the  police  under  <a href=\"/doc/1778/\" id=\"a_1\">Prevention  of\nTerrorism  Act, 2002</a> on 12.04.2003 and has been detained in prison ever since.\nFrom the said date, the magazine \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014, which is being published  as  a\nbi-weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays of the week (now Thursdays and Sundays), has  \nbeen  carrying  a  vilification  campaign  against  the  respondents  in their\nmagazine by printing false and defamatory articles  on  the  title  page  with\nbanner  headlines  as  well  as  on  the  cover page, apart from featuring the\nphotographs of either the first or the second respondent or both.  None of the\narticles published against the respondents  has  been  found  to  be  true  or\npublished in  good  faith  after  prior  verification.    In  fact,  the first\n\nappellant  has  always  been  indulging  in  character  assassination  of  the\nrespondents, and as a matter of fact, an earlier suit for damages filed by the\nrespondents against the first appellant is pending in this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">        3.   It  is stated that the respondents are protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India to live peacefully without being defamed with  false\nand vituperative  articles  without  any proof therefor whatsoever.  There are\nenough legal precedents available to prevent the appellants from printing  and\npublishing such defamatory articles and if at all there was something relating\nto  the  respondents  which  required  to  be published, the appellants may be\ndirected to verify with the respondents the veracity of the material  received\nby them  apropos  of  the  activities  of  the respondents.  It is stated that\nfreedom of press does not mean that the appellants can pick and choose persons \nout of personal or political animosity, or monetary inducements with the  sole\nidea of  defaming  them.   It is further stated in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the\nplaint as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        \u001320.  The freedom of speech in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19(1)</a> of  the  Constitution  of\nIndia  cannot  be  taken  to  mean absolute freedom to say or write whatever a\nperson chooses recklessly  without  regard  to  another  person\u0012s  honour  and\nreputation.   The  right  guaranteed  by the Constitution, it must be borne in\nmind, applies equally to every citizen.  Every right correspondents to a  duty\nto the  other  and  is  also  to  be judged.  The right guaranteed is always a\nqualified one.  Indeed, every  right  has  got  its  own  natural  limitation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">Holding  a  public  position does not mean that one should be at the receiving\nend of attacks day-in-and-day-out nor it can be said that it is  an  appendage\nto that office.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">        21.   It  is  not  a  question  of  mere ignorance about making vulgar\ncriticisms and hurting abuses against the plaintiffs, but  when  the  same  is\nbeing  ceaselessly  done, beyond a reasonable period as a matter of right, the\nplaintiffs have no reason to keep quite as if they are helpless in the matter.\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India does not give a free hand,  under  the\nguise  of  free expression and freedom of press, the right to go on publishing\ndefamatory  matters  and  articles  issue  after  issue  without   any   basis\nwhatsoever.\u0014\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   It is stated that the balance of convenience is not only in favour of the\nrespondents, but it  is  also  absolutely  necessary  to  prevent  such  false\npublications which  tend  to bring disrepute to the respondents.  It is stated\nthat the loss of reputation of the respondents and the mental agony caused  to\nthem cannot  be  compensated  by  payment  of  damages alone.  The respondents  \nprayed in  the  suit  for  a  restraint  order  against  the  appellants  from\npublishing   in   future  publications,  articles,  caricatures,  news  items,\ncartoons, etc., defamatory or derogatory in nature,  in  the  Tamil  bi-weekly\n\u0013Nakkheeran\u0014  or  in  any  special editions thereof or any publications of the\nappellants without prior verification with the respondents.    The  claim  for\ndamages has  been  quantified at Rs.2 Crores and one thousand.  Along with the\nplaint an application (O.A.No.599 of 2003) for interim relief under  Order  39\nRule  1  and  2  was  also filed praying for issuance of an order of temporary\ninjunction in the same terms.  The  respondents  were  granted  a  limited  ad\ninterim order restraining the appellants from publishing about private life of\nrespondent No.1 without prior verification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.  The  appellants filed a counter affidavit to the O.A.  and also prayed for\nvacation of the ad interim order.  In the counter affidavit, it is stated that\nin a libel action it is obligatory on the plaintiff to state in the plaint the\nactual defamatory words (together with innuendo or defamatory meaning  thereof\nwhere necessary)  in  specific  terms.  The respondents, however, have not set\nout in the body of the plaint the alleged defamatory remarks contained in  the\nimpugned  publications  and thereby, the appellants are denied the opportunity\nof knowing what was the nature of the imputations which are  objected  to  and\nwhat was the meaning understood by the respondents of such imputations.  It is\nstated  that  what  is  stated  in the articles relating to the respondents is\ncorrect and the truth of the statement will be justified at the trial.  It  is\naverred that in the discharge of their journalistic duties, sometimes, some of\nthe  fair  and  accurate  news  item  published in their magazine happen to be\nunpalatable to persons in public positions and such public  persons  react  in\nanger  and  disappointment  and  the  present  suit  is  an  outcome  of  such\nintolerance.  It is stated that there was nothing defamatory in those articles\nand the same were published in good faith and for public good.  It is  averred\nthat  the  claim  of the respondents is not supported by any material to prove\nany of the publications in \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014 as false  or  defamatory.    Both  the\nrespondents  are public persons and all their activities are matters of public\ninterest, because the first respondent is the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and\nleader of one of the  largest  political  parties  in  the  State.    She  has\nsubjected  herself to many public controversies and she has been always in the\nmedia highlight.  So, all her  words  and  movements  are  matters  of  public\ninterest,  as  the  people  of  Tamil  Nadu  have  a  right  to know about her\nactivities.  It is further stated that during the period  1991  to  1996,  the\nappellants  exposed  many  of  the  misdeeds  of the respondents, A.I.A.D.M.K.\nMinisters  and  several  officials  and  as  a  consequence,   many   criminal\nproceedings were initiated, which also ended in conviction.  It is stated that\nverification  of  facts  with  the  person concerned cannot be the criteria in\ndeciding a matter as libel or defamatory.  Law does not recognize verification\nof matter with the persons concerned.  It is customary  among  journalists  to\nverify  the  facts with the person concerned and publish the matter along with\nthat person\u0012s version, but however, failure to do so is  not  unlawful.    The\nplea  of  the  respondents  that  the appellants publish articles against them\nwithout verification and, therefore, they must be  prevented  from  publishing\nanything against  the  respondents  is  unsustainable  in  law.  It is further\nstated that the  appellants  have  always  tried  to  verify  the  facts  with\nrespondents,  but the respondents are beyond the reach of the reporters of the\nappellants.  In fact, when one of the reporters of  \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014  visited  the\nhouse of  the then A.I.A.D.M.K.  Supremo in Tuticorin District, he was invited\ninside the house and there, he was brutally attacked by A.I.A.D.M.K.  men.  In\nthis background, it is stated that though the appellants  very  much  want  to\nverify   the   facts  with  the  respondents,  the  reporters  of  \u0013Nakkheeran\nPublications\u0014 will not get audience with the respondents.  In any event, it is\nsubmitted that there is no provision in law to compel the appellants to verify\nthe matter with any one as long as the matter is based on truth, touching upon\npublic interest and is honestly believed to be true by the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.  The learned single Judge after hearing the learned counsel for the parties\nallowed the application of the respondents and granted  a  blanket  injunction\nrestraining  the  appellants  from publishing in future publications articles,\ncaricatures, news items, cartoons, etc., defamatory or derogatory in nature in\nthe Tamil bi-weekly \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014 or any special editions  thereof  or  in  any\npublications of the appellants till the disposal of the suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.   The  learned  single Judge was of the view that though the appellants are\ninvestigative journalists and the first  respondent  is  in  public  life  and\ntherefore,  in  respect  of  the  decisions taken by the first respondent, the\nappellants are entitled to make a criticism, the law would require  that  such\ncriticism should  be  fair  and  should not exceed the bounds and limits.  The\nlearned single Judge referred to the issue of  \u0013Nakkheeran\u0014  dated  20.05.2003\ncontaining the following article:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\u0013Even the  people  in Garden are also asking this question.  There is a secret\nreason why \u0011J\u0012 is showing  such  consideration  to  her  friend.    Though  in\npolitics no big political party is presently having a tie-up with \u0011J\u0012, several\ndiseases are having a tie-up in J\u0012s body.  That is why, she is taking 4500 Mg.\nof tablets everyday.  When the doctors have restricted her from taking certain\nthings  while she is taking the tablets, she is consuming those things without\nany restriction.  It is only Sasikala who gives the tablets and  other  things\nto \u0011J\u0012.\u0014\nAccording  to  the  learned  single Judge, a very reading of the above article\nwould not only reflect the character assassination  of  the  respondents,  but\nalso indicates that the appellants have exceeded their limits.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">        8.   The  appellants,  aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the learned\nsingle Judge, have preferred the present appeal.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        9.  We have heard Mr.P.T.Perumal, learned counsel  appearing  for  the\nappellants  and  Mr.N.Jothi,  learned counsel appearing for the respondents at\nlength and have perused the records in the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.  Mr.P.T.Perumal, learned counsel for the appellants, has contended  before\nus  that  the  impugned  injunction order is against the settled principles of\nlaw.  No  blanket  injunction  can  be  granted  restraining  the  press  from\npublishing anything  of  defamatory  nature  in  the future.  Such an order is\nclearly violative of the  freedom  of  speech  and  expression  guaranteed  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>  of the Constitution of India.  Mr.Perumal has contended that\nthe interim relief sought for  was  not  to  publish  articles  without  prior\nverification  with  the  respondents,  whereas  the  learned  single Judge has\ngranted an order of injunction in a blanket manner, much more  than  what  was\nprayed for  by  the respondents.  Mr.Perumal has contended that the appellants\nhave categorically affirmed and stood by what they  had  published  by  making\nsuch an  averment  in  the counter affidavit.  In such a situation, Mr.Perumal\ncontends, that there could have been no action at all for any injunction,  and\nthe relief,  if  any,  is  by  way  of damages.  Learned counsel has drawn our\nattention to the relief claimed in the plaint where damages have in fact  been\nclaimed.  He has further contended that there is no defamation if the impugned\narticles are analysed and in any case once the appellants stand by them, truth\nwould be  available  as  a  defense  to  defamation.  Learned counsel has also\nsubmitted that the respondents are public figures and such public figures  are\nsubject  to  public  gaze including in respect of their private life at times.\nHe has contended that in law the position of public figures is  different  and\nin  case  of  violation  of  right  of  their privacy the remedy is action for\ndamages and not of preventive injunction which would amount to  precensorship.\nHe  has also contended that the justification or claim of truth is an absolute\ndefense and there is no right of privacy available to an individual in such  a\ncase.   He  has contended that the first respondent is the Chief Minister of a\nState and General Secretary of an important political party in the  State  and\neverything  which  happened within or outside of her household was of interest\nto public and thus the appellants have a right to comment and write about  the\nsame.   He  has  submitted  that insofar as public figures and politicians are\nconcerned their lives are  day-in-and-day-out  brought  under  microscope  and\ncommented upon.    There  cannot be segregation of private life of such public\nfigures from their public life, as both are intertwined.   It  is,  therefore,\ncontended  that by the very nature of being a public figure such person\u0012s life\nis entitled to be scrutinized, whether in respect of their public function  or\ntheir private  life.    As regards the article dated 20.05.2003 referred to in\nthe order of the learned single Judge learned counsel has contended  that  the\nimputation  contained  in  that  article  has  not  been set out in the plaint\ntogether  with  the  alleged  innuendo  or  defamatory  meaning  thereof,  and\ntherefore, no  relief  can  be  based  on  the  said  article.   In any event,\naccording to Mr.Perumal the Court can at best direct  the  publishers  not  to\nrepeat  publishing  the said article, but a blanket injunction restraining the\npublishers  from  publishing  any  article  in  future  runs  counter  to  the\nfundamental  right  to  freedom  of speech and expression enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.  Mr.Perumal relied  upon  a  number  of\ndecisions  of  the  Supreme Court as well as High Courts and also decisions by\nAmerican and English Courts to which we shall shortly refer to.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.  Mr.N.Jothi, learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand,  made\nsubmissions  for  sustaining  the impugned interim order of the learned single\njudge and contended that the reputation of an individual and his/her right  to\nprivacy  are both protected and it is apparent from the impugned articles that\nsuch rights of the respondents were sought to be violated  by  the  appellants\nwith impunity.    In  such a situation, Mr.Jothi contended that the remedy was\navailable both by way of damages and by way of injunction.  He contended  that\nwhat is implicit in the article dated 20.05.2003 is that the second respondent\nis  giving  liquor  to first respondent although she had been forbidden by the\ndoctors from taking any such thing.  According to him the article is malicious\nand beyond all limits of decency and consequently, no fault can be found  with\nthe order  of  injunction.    Mr.Jothi submitted that there were two competing\ninterests which had to be balanced i.e., right  of  the  press  to  write  and\npublish,  and  right  of an individual against invasion of his/her privacy and\nthreat of defamation.  Eventhough, the appellants were standing by  what  they\nhad written,  the truth and veracity of the same is yet to be established.  On\nthe other  hand,  the  right  of  the  individual  for  privacy  is  far  from\nsacrosanct.  Mr.    Jothi contends that no one has a right to publish anything\nconcerning personal private matters without  consent  \u0016  whether  truthful  or\notherwise, whether  laudatory  or critical.  He contends that since admittedly\nno consent of the respondents had been taken by the appellants to write  about\ntheir  private  life,  this  was  a  clear  case of invasion of privacy of the\nrespondents, and in such a situation, it is not necessary that one  must  wait\nfor  the  publication  and  then claim damages, but a preventive action can be\ntaken so that the respondents\u0012 right to privacy is not violated.  He submitted\nthat the courts have always protested against the notion that  they  ought  to\nallow  a wrong to continue simply because the wrongdoer is able and willing to\npay for the injury he may inflict.    The  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and\nexpression,  he  contends,  cannot be taken to mean absolute freedom to say or\nwrite whatever a person chooses recklessly and without  regard  to  the  other\nperson\u0012s honour  or  reputation.    He contends that the plea of justification\nwould be available where truth was pleaded and it was in public interest.   In\ncase  of  a  public  figure,  he contends, that it may apply to performance of\npublic duties by the public figures and it does not give a licence to go  into\nthe private  life  of  such  public  figures.    In the alternative, it is the\nsubmission of the learned counsel that having regard  to  the  fact  that  the\nappellants  were  indulging  in character assassination the least they must be\nasked to do  is  to  seek  prior  verification  from  the  respondents  before\npublishing  any  articles  and  also  publish  the  denial,  if  any,  of  the\nrespondents.  Mr.Jyoti also referred to a number of decisions of  the  Supreme\nCourt and High Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12.   We  have duly considered the elaborate submissions and a large number of\ndecisions cited at the bar by the learned counsel for the parties.  The matter\nwas heard in depth, as the decision in this case would have direct bearing  on\nthe  claims  of right of privacy by public figures as against the right of the\npress to publish and write about such public figures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">13.  We may mention at this stage that we  have  been  taken  through  all  24\nimpugned articles  published  in  the appellants\u0012 magazine Nakkheeran.  At the\noutset we may mention that none of the articles other than the  article  dated\n20.05.2003,  referred  to  in  the  order of the learned single Judge, and the\narticle published on 06.06.2003 can be said to be  relating  to  the  personal\nlife of the first respondent.  The article dated 06.06.2003 is about the first\nrespondent  taking  advice  from  an astrologer in respect of certain criminal\ncase pending against her.  The rest of the  articles  are  about  her  actions\npertaining to  official  and  public  function.  In some of the articles it is\nalleged that the first respondent is behaving  in  a  dictatorial  manner  and\nusing police  to  suppress  dissent and had been likened with Hitler.  In some\nthere are allegations of misdeeds and misdemeanor in official duties.  Out  of\n24  articles  the  name  of  the second respondent appears only in 5 articles.\nNone of the articles/imputations are reproduced in the plaint.  In paragraph \u0016\n9 of the plaint it is merely stated that the respondents are  restricting  the\ndescription  of  such  defamatory  articles  since they are fully indicated in\nDocument No.1 filed along with the plaint.  Document No.1  is  compilation  of\nthe 24  publications which are said to be defamatory.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1487010\" id=\"span_1\">It is nowhere stated in\nthe plaint that in what way the articles and the materials in the articles are\ndefamatory and if they are not per se defamatory the innuendo implied  in  the\narticles is  also  not  set  out.    It is well settled that in a libel action\ndefamatory words must be set out in the plaint where the words are per  se  or\nprima  facie defamatory, and where the defamatory sense is not apparent on the\nface of the words, the defamatory meaning as it is technically known  in  law,\nthe innuendo  must  also  to be set out in a clear and specific terms.  In the\nabsence of these necessary averments the plaint would be liable to be rejected\non the ground that it does not disclose any cause of  action.    (See  Brijlal\nPrasad Vs.

With  these preliminary observations, we may now proceed to deal\nwith the appellants\u0012 submissions based on the right of freedom of  speech  and\nexpression guaranteed  under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.  Though the\nIndian Constitution does not use the expression \u0013 freedom of press\u0014 in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_9\">Article\n19</a>, but it is included as one of the guarantees in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  The  law\non  this  aspect  has been adverted to in the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/223504/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Express Newspapers ( Pvt.) Ltd.  Vs.  Union of India</a> (1985 (1) SCC 641)\nwhere Venkataramaiah, J.  referred to the importance of freedom of press in  a\ndemocratic society  and the role of courts.  The freedom of press, as noted by\nVenkataramaiah, J., is  one  of  the  items  around  which  the  greatest  and\nbitterest  constitutional  struggles  have  been  waged in all countries where\nliberal constitutions prevail.  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19</a> of  the  Universal  Declaration  of\nHuman Rights, 1948 declares the freedom of press and so does <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19</a> of the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966.  <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 10</a> of the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, provides as follows:  -\n\u0013Article 10.

Hill, 385 US 374 and like cases has laid down that\nthe  defense  of  truth  is constitutionally required where the subject of the\npublication is a public official or public figure.  What is more, the  defamed\npublic  official  or public figure must prove not only that the publication is\nfalse, but that it was knowingly so or was circulated with reckless  disregard\nfor its  truth  or  falsity.  Similarly where the interest at issue is privacy\nrather than  reputation  and  the  right  claimed  is  to  be  free  from  the\npublication of false or misleading information about one\u0012s affairs, the target\nof  the  publication  must  prove  knowing  or  reckless  falsehood  where the\nmaterials published, although  assertedly  private,  are  \u0013matters  of  public\ninterest\u0014.

Allowance of\nthe defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not\nmean that only false speech will be deterred.    Even  courts  accepting  this\ndefense  an  adequate  safeguard  have recognised the difficulties of adducing\nlegal proofs that the alleged libel was true in all its  factual  particulars.\nSee, e.g., Post Publishing  Co.    V.    Hallam,  59  F.530,  540  (C.A.   6th\nCir.1893); see also Noel, Defamation of Public  officers  and  Candidates,  49\nCol.L.Rev.  87 5, 892 (1949).  Under such a rule, would-be critics of official\nconduct  may  be  deterred  from  voicing  their  criticism, even though it is\nbelieved to be true and even though it is  in  fact  true,  because  of  doubt\nwhether  it  can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so.\nThey tend to make only statements which  \u0013steer  far  wider  of  the  unlawful\nzone\u0014.  Speiser V.    Randall, supra, 357 U.S., at 526.  The rule thus dampens\nthe vigor and limits the variety of public debate.  It  is  inconsistent  with\nthe First and Fourteen th Amendments. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits\na  public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating\nto his official conduct unless he proves that  the  statement  was  made  with\n\u0013actual  malice\u0014  \u0016 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless\ndisregard of whether it was false or not.\u0014\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">        17.  It will be useful also to refer to the  observations  of  Justice\nBrennan in Time, Inc.  v.  Hill, 385 US 374\n\u0013  The  guarantees  for  speech  and  press  are not the preserve of political\nexpression or comment upon public affairs, essential as those are  to  healthy\ngovernment.  One need only pick up any newspaper or magazine to comprehend the   \nvast  range  of  published  matter  which exposes persons to public view, both\nprivate citizens and public officials.  Exposure of  the  self  to  others  is\nvarying degrees  is  a concomitant of life in a civilized community.  The risk\nof this exposure is an essential incident of life in a society which places  a\nprimary value  on  freedom of speech and of press.  \u0013Freedom of discussion, if\nit would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues\nabout which information is needed or appropriate  to  enable  the  members  of\nsociety to cope with the exigencies of their period.\u0014\n        As  James  Madison said, \u0013Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the\nproper use of every thing; and in no instance is this more true than  in  that\nof  the  press\u0014 4 Elliot\u0012s Debates on the Federal Constitution 571 (1876 ed.).\nWe create a grave risk of serious impairment of the indispensable service of a\nfree press in a free society if we saddle the press with the impossible burden\nof verifying to a certainty the facts associated in  news  articles  w  ith  a\nperson\u0012s  name, picture or portrait, particularly as related to non-defamatory\nmatter.  Even negligence would be a most elusive standard, especially when the\ncontent of the speech itself affords no warning of prospective harm to another\nthrough falsity.  A negligence test would place on the press  the  intolerable\nburden  of  guessing how a jury might assess the reasonableness of steps taken\nby it to verify the  accuracy  of  every  reference  to  a  name,  picture  or\nportrait.\u0014\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">        18.  In  Cox  Broadcasting  Corporation  v.    Cohn,  420  US 469, the\nidentity of a 17 year old deceased rape victim was obtained  by  a  television\nnewsman from  official  court  records  open  to  the  public.  In response to\ntelevision newscasts in which the victim was identified by name, the father of\nthe victim brought an action against the newsman and the television station in\nthe Superior Court  of  Fulton  County,  Georgia,  for  invasion  of  privacy,\ngrounding  his  cause  of  action  on  a  Georgia criminal statute making it a\nmisdemeanor to publish or broadcast the name or identity of any  rape  victim.\nIn  an opinion by White, J expressing the view of six members of the Court, it\nwas held that \u0013 protection of freedom of press under the First and  Fourteenth\nAmendments  barred the state from making the defendant\u0012s television broadcasts\nthe basis of civil liability when  there  was  no  contention  that  the  rape\nvictim\u0012s  name  had been obtained in an improper fashion or that it was not on\nan official court document open to public inspection\u0014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">        19.  In Derbyshire County Council v.  Times Newspaper Limited, 1993 (1\n) All.ER page 1011), it was held by House of Lords that  under  common  law  a\nlocal  authority  did not have the right to maintain an action for damages for\ndefamation as it would be contrary to the public interest for  the  organs  of\nthe government,  whether  central  or local, to have that right.  Not only was\nthere no public interest favouring the  right  of  government  organs  to  sue\nlibel,  but  it  was of the highest public importance that a governmental body\nshould be open to uninhibited  public  criticism,  and  a  right  to  sue  for\ndefamation would  place  an  undesirable  fetter on freedom of speech.  It was\nheld that the propositions endorsed by the US Supreme Court in New York  Times \nCo.  V.    Sullivan  (supra)  though related directly to the provisions of the\nAmerican Constitution concerned with securing freedom of  speech,  the  public\ninterest  considerations  which  underlaid  them  are  no  less  valid in this\ncountry.  What has been described as the  \u0013Chilling  Effect\u0014  induced  by  the\nthreat of civil action for libel is very important.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">        20.  In  Hector  v.   A-G of Antigua and Barbuda, (1990) 2 All ER, 103\nthe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that  a  statutory  provision\nwhich  made  the  printing  or  distribution  of any false statement likely to\nundermine public confidence in  the  conduct  of  public  affairs  a  criminal\noffence  contravened  the provisions of the constitution protecting freedom of\nspeech.  Lord Bridge of Harwich observed:  -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">\u0013In a free democratic society it is almost too obvious to  need  stating  that\nthose  who  hold  office  in  government  and  who  are responsible for public\nadministration must always be open to criticism.  Any  attempt  to  stifle  or\nfetter  such  criticism  amounts to political censorship of the most insidious\nand objectionable kind.  At the same time it is no less obvious that the  very\npurpose  of  criticism leveled at those who have the conduct of public affairs\nby their political opponents  is  to  undermine  public  confidence  in  their\nstewardship  and  to  persuade  the electorate that the opponents would make a\nbetter job of if than those presently holding office.  In the light  of  these\nconsiderations their Lordships cannot help viewing a statutory provision which\ncriminalizes  statements  likely to undermine public confidence in the conduct\nof public affairs with the utmost suspicion.\u0014\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_6\">21.  We may now refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in celebrated  case\nof <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_21\">R.  Rajagopal  @  R.R.    Gopal  vs.   State of Tamil Nadu</a> [(1994) 6 S.C.C.\n632].  The said case dealt with the right  of  privacy  of  citizens  of  this\ncountry  and the parameters of the right of the press to criticize and comment\non acts and conduct of public officials.  The  case  related  to  the  alleged\nautobiography  of  Auto  Shankar  who was convicted and sentenced to death for\ncommitting six murders.  In the autobiography, he had commented on his contact\nand relations with various police officials.  It was the stand of  the  police\nthat the  autobiography  was not authored by Auto Shankar.  It was stated that\nneither Auto Shankar nor his wife were made parties before the  Supreme  Court\nin the writ petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.  The right of\nprivacy  of citizens was dealt with by the Supreme Court in paragraph 9 in the\nfollowing terms:  -</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        &quot; The right to privacy  as  an  independent  and  distinctive  concept\noriginated  in  the  field  of Tort law, under which a new cause of action for\ndamages resulting from unlawful invasion of  privacy  was  recognised.    This\nright  has  two  aspects  which  are  but two faces of the same coin \u0017 (1) the\ngeneral law of privacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting  from\nan  unlawful  invasion of privacy and (2) the constitutional recognition given\nto the right to privacy  which  protects  personal  privacy  against  unlawful\ngovernmental invasion.    The  first aspect of this right must be said to have\nbeen violated where, for example, a person\u0012s name or likeness is used, without\nhis consent, for advertising \u0017 or  non-advertising  \u0017  purposes  or  for  that\nmatter,  his  life  story  is  written  \u0017 whether laudatory or otherwise \u0017 and\npublished without his consent as explained  hereinafter.    In  recent  times,\nhowever, this right has acquired a constitutional status.  We shall proceed to\nexplain how?  Right to privacy is not enumerated as a fundamental right in our\nConstitution but has been inferred from Article 21\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005   \n        There are  two  possible theories for protecting privacy of home.  The\nfirst is that activities in the home harm others only to the extent that  they\ncause  offence  resulting  from  the  mere  thought  that individuals might be\nengaging in such activities and  that  such  \u0011harm\u0012  is  not  constitutionally\nprotectible by  the  State.    The  second is that individuals need a place of\nsanctuary where they can be free from societal control.    The  importance  of\nsuch  a  sanctuary  is  that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while\nfrom projecting on the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves,\nan image that may reflect the values of their peers rather than the  realities\nof their natures.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_7\">The  right  to  privacy  in  any  event  will necessarily have to go through a\nprocess of case-by-case development.  Therefore, even assuming that the  right\nto  personal  liberty,  the  right  to move freely throughout the territory of\nIndia and the freedom of speech create an independent right of privacy  as  an\nemanation  from  them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we do\nnot think that the right is absolute.\u0014\n\nThe Supreme Court, thereafter, proceeded to refer to various decisions of  the\nIndian  Courts starting with the first decision of the Supreme Court in Kharak\nSingh vs.  State of Uttar Pradesh  [A.I.R.    1963  S.C.    1295],  which  was\nsubsequently elaborated  in  <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_23\">Gobind  vs.    State  of Madhya Pradesh</a> [(1975) 2\nS.C.C.  148].  The right to privacy as enunciated by the Courts of the  United\nStates and  England were also discussed in great depth.  The Supreme Court was \nof the view that the principles enunciated in the various  <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_24\">judgments  <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_25\">referred\nto  above</a></a>  were  applicable  to public figures and they often played a crucial\nrole in regulating an orderly society and the citizens had  a  legitimate  and\nsubstantial interest  in the conduct of such persons.  Thus, the Supreme Court\nwas of  the  opinion  that  the  freedom  of  Press  extends  to  engaging  in\nuninhibited  debate  about  the involvement of public figures in public issues\nand events.  The Supreme Court felt that a proper balance of  the  freedom  of\npress  as  well  as  the right of privacy and defamation has to be struck in a\ndemocratic way of life as contemplated by our Constitution.  The Supreme Court\nconcluded that the State or its officials have no authority in law to impose a\nprior restraint upon publication of materials, defamatory of the State  or  of\nits officials.</span>    The Supreme Court quoted, with approval, the observations in\nNew York Times vs.  United States to the  effect  that  any  system  of  prior\nrestraints  of  freedom  of  expression  comes  to  this Court bearing a heavy\npresumption against its constitutional validity and that in  such  cases,  the\nGovernment &quot;carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition\nof  such  a  restraint.&quot;  The  Supreme  Court  thus  held  that  the remedy of\nthe public figure would arise only after the publication is made and would  be\ngoverned by the principles indicated in the judgment and that there was no law\nunder  which they could prevent the publication of a material on the ground of\nsuch material being likely to be defamatory of them.  Even in that  case,  the\nremedy was  only  after  the publication.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_8\">In paragraph 26 of the report in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_26\">R.\nRajagopal</a>&#x27;s case, the broad principles summarized  by  the  Supreme  Court  as\nunder :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;  (1)  The  right  to  privacy  is  implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21.</a>  It is a  \u0013right  to\nbe let alone\u0014.  A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\nfamily,  marriage,  procreation,  motherhood, childbearing and education among\nother matters.  None can publish anything concerning the above matters without\nhis consent \u0017 whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">If he does so, he would be violating  the  right  to  privacy  of  the  person\nconcerned and  would  be  liable  in  an  action  for  damages.  Position may,\nhowever,  be  different,  if  a  person  voluntarily  thrusts   himself   into\ncontroversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n(2)  The  rule  aforesaid  is  subject  to the exception, that any publication\nconcerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if  such  publication\nis based  upon public records including court records.  This is for the reason\nthat once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy  no\nlonger  subsists  and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and\nmedia among others.  We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests  of\ndecency  [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\nfemale who is the victim of a sexual assault,  kidnap,  abduction  or  a  like\noffence  should  not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the\nincident being publicised in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above \u0017 indeed, this  is\nnot an exception but an independent rule.  In the case of public officials, it\nis  obvious,  right  to  privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for\ndamages is simply not  available  with  respect  to  their  acts  and  conduct\nrelevant to the discharge of their official duties.  This is so even where the\npublication  is based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\nofficial establishes that the publication was made  (by  the  defendant)  with\nreckless disregard  for  truth.    In  such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant ( member of the press or media) to  prove  that  he  acted  after  a\nreasonable  verification  of  the  facts; it is not necessary for him to prove\nthat what he has written is true.  Of course, where the publication is  proved\nto  be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would\nhave no defence and would be liable for damages.  It is equally  obvious  that\nin  matters  not  relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official\nenjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1)  and  (2)\nabove.   It  needs  no  reiteration  that judiciary, which is protected by the\npower to  punish  for  contempt  of  court  and  Parliament  and  legislatures\nprotected  as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_30\">104</a> respectively of the\nConstitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">(4)  So  far  as  the  Government,  local  authority  and  other  organs   and\ninstitutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain\na suit for damages for defaming them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">(5)  Rules  3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_31\">Official Secrets Act, 19</a> 23, or\nany similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not  bind  the\npress or media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">(6)  There  is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to\nimpose a prior restraint upon the press/media.\u0014\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">        22.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1449949\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/1449949/\" id=\"a_32\">Kartar Singh v.

Thus  law  is  well  settled  that  so  far as Government, local\nauthority and other organs and institutions exercising governmental power  are\nconcerned, they  cannot maintain a suit for damages for defaming them.  In the\ncase of public officials, the remedy of  action  for  damages  is  simply  not\navailable  with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\ntheir official duties and this is so even where the publication is based  upon\nthe  facts  and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\nthat the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless  disregard  for\ntruth.   In  such  a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the\npress or media) to prove he acted  after  a  reasonable  verification  of  the\nfacts;  it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true.\nIn respect of private matters, none  can  publish  such  matters  without  his\nconsent, but the position would be different if he voluntarily thrusts himself\ninto controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">        24.   In  the  instant  case,  the  appellants  have  taken  a plea of\njustification and the effect of such justification plea has been considered in\nseveral judicial pronouncements.  The first of such cases is Fraser vs.  Evans\n[(1969) 1 All E.R.  8], where Lord Denning has observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        &quot; The Court will not restrain the  publication  of  an  article,  even\nthough it is defamatory, when the defendant says that he intends to justify it\nor to  make  fair  comment  on  a  matter  of  public interest.  That has been\nestablished for many years since  Bonnard  v.    Perryman  (1).    The  reason\nsometimes given is that the defences of justification and fair comment are for\nthe  jury,  which  is  the constitutional tribunal, and not for a judge; but a\nbetter reason is the importance in the public interest that the  truth  should\nbe out.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">25.  The  next  is the decision in Harakas vs.  Baltic Mercantile and Shipping\nExchange Ltd.  [(1982) 2 All E.R.  701], again Lord Denning observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        &quot; This cases raises a matter of  principle  which  must  be  observed.\nThis  Court  never grants an injunction in respect of libel when it is said by\nthe defendant that the words are true and that he is going  to  justify  them.\nSo  also,  when  an  occasion  is protected by qualified privilege, this Court\nnever grants an injunction to restrain a slander or libel, to prevent a person\nfrom exercising that privilege, unless it is shown  that  what  the  defendant\nproposes  to say is known by him to be untrue so that it is clearly malicious.\nSo long as he proposes to say  that  he  honestly  believes  to  be  true,  no\ninjunction should  be granted against him.  That was made clear in Quartz Hill\nConsolidated Gold Mining Co.  v.  Beal, (1882) 20 Ch I) 501.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">26.  The same view has been adopted by the Division Bench of the  Bombay  High \nCourt  in  Appeal  No.464  of 1989 from Notice of Motion No.48 of 1989 in Suit\nNo.3907 of 1988 in the case of Dr.   Yashwant  Trivedi  vs.    Indian  Express\nNewspapers (Bombay) Pvt.  Ltd.  decided on 29.6.1989 and the ratio in the case\nof Harakas vs.    Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange Ltd.  (supra) and in\nparticular, the portion quoted above has been approved.   The  Division  Bench\nalso observed :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        &quot;  The  crux  of  the  matter  is  that  when in a libel action at the\ninterlocutory stage the defendant raises plea of justification and, as in this\ncase, mentions evidence by which he might substantiate his case, the Court  is\nunlikely  to  grant  an interlocutory injunction in favour of the plaintiff to\nrestrain further publication of the alleged libel.\u0014\nIn the said judgment, the passage appearing  in  the  Treatise  on  Libel  and\nSlander  by Gatley Eighth Edition, has been cited with approval, which is also\nquoted hereinbelow :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        &quot; 1574.  Justification:  When the defendant swears  that  he  will  be\nable  to justify the words \u0016 unless the Court is satisfied that he will not be\nable to do so.  The validity of a justification, if pleaded,  is  eminently  a\nmatter to  be  determined  by a verdict of a jury.  When once a defendant says\n\n\nthat he is going to justify the words complained of, there is an  end  of  the\ncase  so  far as an interim injunction is concerned, although in a proper case\nit may be that the Court will intervene on the ground of breach of confidence\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_11\">27.  Finally we may refer to the decision of the Supreme Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_35\">S.\nRangarajan v.  P.Jagajivan Ram</a>, (1989) 2 SCC 574 where the Court held that the\nfreedom of speech and expression should not be suppressed unless the situation\ncreated  by  allowing  the  freedom are pressing and the community interest is\nendangered, and it is not simply a case of balancing of two  interests  as  if\nthey are  of equal weight.  In this connection, the observations in paragraphs\n41 to 45 of <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_36\">the said judgment</a> are  relevant  and  accordingly  are  reproduced\nbelow:  -</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">\u001341.   \u0013When  men  differ  in  opinion,  both  sides ought equally to have the\nadvantage of being heard by the public.\u0014  (Benjamin  Franklin).    If  one  is\nallowed  to  say  that policy of the government is good, another is with equal\nfreedom entitled to say that it is bad.  If one  is  allowed  to  support  the\ngovernmental scheme, the other could as well say, that he will not support it.\nThe different views are allowed to be expressed by proponents and opponent not\nbecause  they  are  correct,  or  valid  but  because there is freedom in this\ncountry for expressing even differing views on any issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">42.  Alexander Meiklejohn perhaps the foremost American philosopher of freedom\nof expression, in his wise little study neatly explains:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\u0013When men govern themselves, it is they \u0017 and no one  else  \u0017  who  must  pass  \njudgment upon  unwisdom and unfairness and danger.  And that means that unwise  \nideas must have a hearing as well  as  wise  ones  unfair  as  well  as  fair,\ndangerous as well as  safe,  unAmerican as well...  American.  ...  If then on\nany occasion in the United States it is allowable, in that situation,  to  say\nthat  the  Constitution  is  a  good document it is equally allowable, in that\nsituation, to say that the Constitution is  a  bad  document.    If  a  public\nbuilding  may  be  used  in  which  to  say,  in  time of war, that the war is\njustified, then the same building may be used in which to say that it  is  not\njustified.   If  it  be publicly argued that conscription for armed service is\nmoral and necessary, it may likewise be publicly argued that it is immoral and\nunnecessary.  If it may be  said  that  American  political  institutions  are\nsuperior  to those of England or Russia or Germany, it may with equal freedom,\nbe said that those of England or Russia  or  Germany  are  superior  to  ours.\nThese  conflicting views may be expressed, must be expressed, not because they \nare valid, but because they are relevant....  To be afraid of ideas, any idea,\nis to be unfit for self-government.\u0014\nHe argued, if we may say so correctly,  that  the  guarantees  of  freedom  of\nspeech  and  of  the  press are measures adopted by the people as the ultimate\nrulers  in  order  to  retain  control  over  the  government,  the   people\u0012s\nlegislative and executive agents.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">43.  Brandies,  J.,  in  Whitney  v.   California propounded probably the most\nattractive free speech theory :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\u0013...  that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert  people  ;  that  public\ndiscussion is a  political duty ;.  ..  It is hazardous to discourage thought,\nhope and imagination ; that the path of safety  lies  in  the  opportunity  to\ndiscuss  freely  supposed  grievances  and  proposed  remedies  ; and that the\nfitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones.\u0014\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">44.  What Archibald Cox said in his article though  on  &quot;First  Amendment&quot;  is\nequally relevant here:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">\u0013Some propositions  seem true or false beyond rational debate.  Some false and\nharmful, political and religious doctrine gain wide public acceptance.   Adolf\nHitler\u0012s brutal  theory of a \u0013master race\u0014 is sufficient example.  We tolerate\nsuch foolish and sometimes dangerous appeals not because they may  prove  true \nbut because freedom of speech is indivisible.  The liberty cannot be denied to\nsome ideas and  saved  for  others.   The reason is plain enough :  no man, no\ncommittee,  and  surely  no  government,   has   the   infinite   wisdom   and\ndisinterestedness  accurately  and  unselfishly  to separate what is true from\nwhat is debatable, and both from what is false.  To license one to impose  his\ntruth  upon dissenters is to give the same licence to all others who have, but\nfear to lose, power.  The judgment that the risks of suppression  are  greater\nthan  the  harm  done by bad ideas rests upon faith in the ultimate good sense\nand decency of free people.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">45.  The problem of defining the area of freedom of expression when it appears\nto conflict with the various social interests enumerated under  <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_37\">Article  19(2)</a>\nmay briefly  be  touched upon here.  There does indeed have to be a compromise\nbetween the interest of freedom of expression and special interests.   But  we\ncannot simply  balance  the two interests as if they are of equal weight.  Our\ncommitment of freedom of expression  demands  that  it  cannot  be  suppressed\nunless  the  situations  created  by allowing the freedom are pressing and the\ncommunity interest is endangered.    The  anticipated  danger  should  not  be\nremote, conjectural or far-fetched.  It should have proximate and direct nexus\nwith the  expression.    The  expression  of  thought  should be intrinsically\ndangerous to the public interest.  In other words, the  expression  should  be\ninseparably  locked  up  with the action contemplated like the equivalent of a\n\u0013spark in a power keg\u0014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_12\">28.  The right to publish and the freedom of  press  as  enshrined  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India  are  sacrosanct.  The only\nparameters of restriction are provided in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19(2)</a> of  the  Constitution.\nAs observed by Mudholkar,  J.    in <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_40\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.  Vs.  Union of India</a>\n(AIR 1962 SC 305) the courts must be ever vigilant in  guarding  perhaps  this\nmost precious  of all the freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution.  The reason\nfor this is obvious.  The freedom of speech and expression of  opinion  is  of\nparamount  importance  under a democratic constitution which envisages changes \nin the composition of legislatures and governments and must be preserved.  The\ninterim order granted by the learned single Judge  is  a  blanket  injunction.\nThe order  virtually  amounts  to  a  gag  order or censorship of press.  Such\ncensorship  cannot  be  countenanced  in  the  scheme  of  our  constitutional\nframework.  Even assuming that the articles published by the appellants amount\nto  character  assassination of the respondents, there is no justification for\ngranting a blanket injunction restraining the appellants from  publishing  any\narticles, in  future.    It  would  not  be  appropriate for us to examine the\narticles at this stage on the touchstone of defamation, but what we do observe\nis that they are not of such a nature warranting a restraint order, especially\nwhen the appellants are willing to face the consequences in a  trial  in  case\nthe same are held to be defamatory, and the plea of the appellants of truth is\nyet to be analysed by the Court.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">        29.   The  fundamental right of freedom of speech is involved in these\nproceedings and not merely the right of liberty of the press.  If this  action\ncan  be  maintained  against  a  newspaper, it can be maintained against every\nprivate citizen who ventures to criticise the ministers  who  are  temporarily\nconducting the  affairs of the government.  In a free democratic society those\nwho  hold  office  in  government  and  who   are   responsible   for   public\nadministration must  always  be  open  to criticism.  Any attempt to stifle or\nfetter such criticism amounts to political censorship of  the  most  insidious\nand objectionable  kind.    As  observed  in  Kartar  Singh\u0012s Case (supra) the\npersons holding public offices must not be thin-skinned with reference to  the\ncomments  made  on  them  and  even  where they know that the observations are \nundeserved and unjust, they must bear with them and submit to be misunderstood \nfor a time.  At times public figures have  to  ignore  vulgar  criticisms  and\nabuses  hurled  against  them  and  they  must restrain themselves from giving\nimportance to the same by prosecuting the person responsible for the same.  In\nthe instant case, the respondents have already chosen  to  claim  damages  and\ntheir claim  is  yet  to  be  adjudicated  upon.  They will have remedy if the\nstatements are held to be defamatory  or  false  and  actuated  by  malice  or\npersonal animosity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">        30.   As  observed  in R.Rajagopal\u0012s Case (supra) the right to privacy\nhas two aspects which are but two faces of the same coin.  First  the  general\nlaw  of  privacy  which  offers  a  tort  action for damages resulting from an\nunlawful invasion of privacy  and  secondly,  the  constitutional  recognition\ngiven to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against unlawful\ngovernment invasion.    Though  the right to privacy can be characterized as a\nfundamental right, as held in R.  Rajagopal\u0012s  Case  it  is  not  an  absolute\nright.  In Time,  Inc Vs.  Hill (385 U.  S.374) it was pointed out that in the\ncase of public officials, insofar as their official function is involved, they\nare substantially without a right to privacy and  factual  error  and  content\ndefamatory  of  official reputation or both, are insufficient for the award of\ndamages for false  statements  unless  actual  malice  \u0016  knowledge  that  the\nstatements are false or reckless disregard of the truth is alleged and proved.\nIn a democratic set up a close and microscopic examination of private lives of\npublic men  is  the natural consequence of holding of public offices.  What is\ngood for a private citizen who does not come within the public gaze may not be\ntrue of a person holding public office.  What a person holding  public  office\ndoes  within  the  four  walls  of his house does not totally remain a private\nmatter.  We agree with Mr.Jothi that the scrutiny of public figures  by  media\nshould  not  also  reach  a stage where it amounts to harassment to the public\nfigures and their family members and they must be permitted to live  and  lead\ntheir life in peace.  But the public gaze cannot be avoided which is necessary\ncorollary of their holding public offices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">        31.   We  are  also  unable  to  accept the submission advanced by Mr.\nJothi that the appellants should be asked to seek prior verification from  the\nrespondents  before publishing any articles and publish the denial, if any, of\nthe respondents.  According to Mr.Jothi rule of  prior  verification  is  laid\ndown in  R.Rajagopal\u0012s Case (supra).  We are afraid that the submission of the\nlearned counsel is based on total misinterpretation of the observations of the\nSupreme Court.    The  Supreme  Court  has  not  laid  down  that  the   prior\nverification of  the  facts  is  must in all such cases.  All that the Supreme\nCourt indicated is that the proof that the member of the press or media  acted\nafter a reasonable verification of the facts would be sufficient.  However, at\nthe  same  time, it must be noted that the Supreme Court in R.Rajagopal\u0012s Case\nhas clearly held that a citizen has a right to safeguard the  privacy  of  his\nown,   his  family,  marriage,  procreation,  motherhood,  child  bearing  and\neducation, among other matters, and none can publish anything in reference  to\nthe  above  matters  without  his/her consent \u0016 whether laudatory or critical.\nTherefore, if an article is purely relating to the personal life of  a  public\nofficial,  it  would  be  necessary  for  the  member of the press or media to\npublish such article only after a reasonable verification of the facts.    The\nposition  may, however, be different if a person voluntarily thrust himself or\nherself into a controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.  In\nthe circumstances, we direct the appellants  that  whenever  they  propose  to\npublish any article purely concerning personal life of the first respondent or\nthe  second  respondent  or  both,  the appellants shall forward their queries\nand/or the gist of the proposed article, as the case may be, to the fax number\nfurnished by the learned counsel appearing for the  respondents.    The  first\nrespondent or the second respondent or both, as the case may be, shall respond\nto  the queries of the appellants in relation to their proposed article to the\nfax number of the appellants.  However, if there is no response to the queries\neither from the first respondent or the second respondent within 36 hours from\nreceiving such queries, the appellants will be entitled to proceed to  publish\nthe proposed  article in their bi-weekly.  It is true that the press cannot be\ncompelled to also publish the version of the official, about whom the  article\nis written,  with  reference  to  the  article published against him/her.  We,\nhowever, feel that it is expected of any responsible member of  the  press  to\nalso indicate the version of the official concerned in their proposed article.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">        32.   With  the  above observations, we vacate the order of injunction\npassed by the learned single Judge.  The O.S.A.  is  accordingly  disposed  of\nwith no order as to costs.  Consequently, C.M.P.No.4534 of 2006 is closed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">ab/sm/pv \n\u001a</p>","numcites":23,"numcitedby":27,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":769478,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"freedom of speech and expression","formInput":"freedom%20of%20speech%20and%20expression"},{"value":"defamation","formInput":"defamation"},{"value":"freedom of press","formInput":"freedom%20of%20press"},{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"article 19(2)","formInput":"article%2019%282%29"},{"value":"rape ","formInput":"rape%20"},{"value":"jayalalitha","formInput":"jayalalitha"},{"value":"freedom of speech","formInput":"freedom%20of%20speech"},{"value":"innuendo","formInput":"innuendo"},{"value":"auto shankar","formInput":"auto%20shankar"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"prior restraint","formInput":"prior%20restraint"},{"value":"blanket injunction  ","formInput":"blanket%20injunction%20%20"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"j jayalalitha","formInput":"j%20jayalalitha"},{"value":"libel","formInput":"libel"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"invasion of privacy ","formInput":"invasion%20of%20privacy%20"},{"value":"rape victim","formInput":"rape%20victim"},{"value":"character assassination","formInput":"character%20assassination"}],"cats":[{"value":"free-speech","formInput":"tag:free-speech"},{"value":"freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions","formInput":"tag:freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
