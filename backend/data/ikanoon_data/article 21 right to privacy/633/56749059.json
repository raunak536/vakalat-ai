The relevant portion of\nthe order is reproduced hereunder for ready reference and\nanalysis:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;The assessee as well as Revenue is in cross appeal for the\n       assessment years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08, whereas, the\n       assessee is in appeal for A.Y. 2004-05, against the impugned\n       orders all dated 17/01/2013 of the ld. First Appellate Authority,\n       Mumbai.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       2.       First, we shall take up the appeal of the assessee (ITA\n       No.2183/Mum/2013) confirming the order framed by the ld.\n       Assessing Officer<a href=\"/doc/144280341/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s 143(3)</a> r.w.s. 153<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_5\">A of the Act</a>. In this appeal,\n       the assessee has challenged execution of warrants and also\n       whether valid search was initiated in this case. However, since,\n       validity of search has been challenged, therefore, the outcome of\n       this appeal will be applicable to the impugned appeals.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   4</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                                    M/s Salasar Developers\n                                              ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n 2.1.           During hearing, the ld. counsel for the assessee,\n Shri Manish Sanghvi, strongly advocated that panchnama does not\n contain the name of the assessee for which our attention was\n invited to the panchnama, prepared in the name of &#x27;Shri Manoj\n Punamiya &amp; Group&#x27;, by asserting that under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_6\">Income Tax Act,\n 1961</a>, there is no concept of group. It was canvassed that the\n inventory of accounts, books, etc, prepared on 24/12/2009, and\n prohibitory orders<a href=\"/doc/741280/\" id=\"a_7\"> u/s 132(3)</a> of the Act were also only in the name\n of Shri Manoj Punamiya alone and not the present assessee. It was\n clarified that the assessee has no nexus with the premises\n searched/surveyed by the Department. It was empathetically\n contended that none of the documents, claimed to be seized,\n belongs to the assessee. It was asserted that no search was ever\n conducted upon the assessee, hence, the proceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_8\"> u/s 153A</a> of\n the Act are bad in law and void. The ld. counsel for the assessee\n took us to various pages of the paper book and also the copy of\n panchnama drawn by the Department. The ld. counsel also invited\n our attention to the finding contained in the impugned order (as\n mentioned at page-4), wherein, the assessee in response to letter\n dated 18/08/2011 asked the authorities to provide the assessee, the\n copy of the search warrant, if any, issued against the assessee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"> 2.2.             On the other hand, Shri N. P. Singh, ld. CIT-DR,\n strongly defended the case of the Revenue by contending that\n search and seizure operation was validly carried out by the\n Department and the search warrants were also executed. The case\n was heard at length on 17/02/2016. At this stage, since the\n jurisdictional issue was raised by the assessee, the ld. CIT-DR\n sought time to seek comments from the Assessing Officer. At the\n time of hearing on 03/03/2016, the ld. CIT-DR filed a reply dated\n 01/03/2016, duly signed by the DCIT, Central Circle-7(1)(Mumbai),\n wherein, it has been replied as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">   &quot;In this connection, this is to inform you that, I have\n   verified from my office record and it is seen that the above\n   documents are not available. The only material available is\n   pertaining to the survey action<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_9\"> u/s 133A</a> of the I.T. Act on\n   the assessee on 31/10/2009.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">2.3.             However, the ld. CIT-DR contended that warrants were\nissued against the assessee. In reply, the ld. counsel for the assessee\nreiterated that issue is whether valid search was initiated against the\nassessee. It was also clarified from page 58 of the paper book that the\nauthorization is with respect to flat no.504 (page-59 of the paper book)\nwhich belongs to Shri Manoj Punamiya and not the assessee. Again\nquery was raised by the Bench whether search was conducted at the\nbusiness premises of the assessee? The ld. CIT-DR stick to the reply\nof the ld. Assessing Officer dated 01/03/2016, by asserting that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    5</span>\n                                                      M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nwarrants were issued to the assessee also, therefore, the search is\nvalid. In reply, the ld. counsel for the assessee challenged the\nassertion of the ld. CIT-DR by explaining that even it is presumed,\nthough not admitted that warrants were issued by the Department\nagainst the assessee, that warrant, if any, neither was executed to the\nassessee nor any search was initiated against the assessee, pursuant\nto such warrant, and further the panchnama does not contain the name\nof the assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">2.4.             We have considered the rival submissions and perused\nthe material available on record. The facts, in brief, are that the\nassessee company, at the relevant time, was engaged in the business\nof trading/manufacturing recycled plastic grinding, recycled plastic,\nagglomerates, platinum bars, silver Ignots, Gold bar, Gold jewellery, cut\nand polish diamonds, recycled plastic granules, etc. The assessee\ndeclared income of Rs.4,325/- in its return filed on 20/10/2004,\naccompanied by audited statement of accounts, which was accepted\nby intimation<a href=\"/doc/184741818/\" id=\"a_10\"> u/s 143(1)</a> of the Act dated 01/07/2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">2.5.            An action<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_11\"> u/s 132</a> of the Act was carried out at the\nresidential premises of one Shri Manoj Punamiya (in his\nindividual/personal capacity) on 31/10/2009 and thereafter on\n24/12/2009, wherein, seventeen papers, were claimed to be found and\nseized. The copy of panchanama along with inventory of papers, found\nand seized, is matter of record. Pursuant to said action, notice<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_12\"> u/s 153A</a>\nwas issued on 27/12/2010. The assessee challenged the initiation of\nproceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_13\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act. It is noteworthy that as abundant\ncaution, the assessee filed return in response to notice<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_14\"> u/s 153A</a> on\n24/08/2011, declaring total income at Rs.4,325/-, as was originally\ndeclared in return of income filed<a href=\"/doc/98717479/\" id=\"a_15\"> u/s 139(1)</a> of the Act. The\nassessment was completed purportedly<a href=\"/doc/144280341/\" id=\"a_16\"> u/s 143(3)</a> r.w.s. 153A on\n29/12/2011 making certain additions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">2.6.             The validity of initiation of proceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_17\"> u/s 153A</a> of the\nAct were challenged before the ld. Commissioner of Income Tax\n(Appeals) by contending that 153A notice can be issued only in the\ncases, where action 132 is initiated and/or where books of accounts etc\nare requisitioned<a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_18\"> u/s 132A</a> of the Act. The stand of the assessee was\nthat, neither any search action was initiated against the assessee nor\nany books of accounts, etc were requisitioned<a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_19\"> u/s 132A</a> of the Act,\ntherefore, proceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_20\"> u/s 153A</a> may be dropped. However, the ld.\nCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) affirmed the stand taken in the\nassessment order. The assessee is in further appeal before this\nTribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">2.7.           At the beginning of the hearing, the ld. counsel for the\nassessee took a preliminary objection that warrants were never\nexecuted against the present assessee. The ld. CIT-DR sought time to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                     6</span>\n                                                                            M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                                    ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n       reply to the preliminary objection raised by the assessee.

We have\n     carefully perused the documents produced before us and we have\n     observed that the warrant of authorization<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_26\"> u/s 132</a> of the Act read\n     with Rule 112 (1) of The Income Tax Rules, 1962 (hereinafter the\n     &quot;Rules&quot;) was duly prepared by the DIT(Inv.)-II, Mumbai on 31-10-\n     2009 which carries the name of the assessee company and is placed\n     at page 58-59 of paper book and was executed on 31-10-2009 . The\n     said search warrant is executed on the premises Flat No. 504, Wing\n     A, Vardhman Heights , Byculla(East), Mumbai which is residential\n     premises of Mr Manoj B Punamia . The said search warrant carries\n     the name of the assessee company. The said search warrant was\n     seen by Mrs Lata Punamia on 31-10-2009 who is wife of Mr. Manoj\n     B. Punamia and was not director of the assessee company on the\n     date of search . The search commences with the execution of search\n     warrant and concludes with the drawing of Panchnama. However, we\n     have observed that Panchnama were not drawn in the name of the\n     assessee company as it carries the name of &#x27;Manoj B. Punamia &amp;\n     Group&#x27; which are placed at paper book page 9-19. Search is a\n     serious invasion in the life of the tax-payer and cannot be concluded\n     in a casual manner. The Revenue has drawn search warrant in the\n     case of the assessee company as set out above, but conclusion of\n     the search is reflected by the Panchnama, which has not been drawn\n     against the assessee. The Revenue has drawn Panchnama against\n     &#x27;Manoj Punimia and group&#x27; while there is no concept of &#x27;group&#x27; under\n     the provisions of the Act .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">     2.9.

             ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nDepartmental Circular No.7 of 2003 dated 05/09/2003. <a href=\"/doc/142122701/\" id=\"a_45\">The Finance Act,\n2003</a> has provided that the provisions of this chapter shall apply where a\nsearch is initiated<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_46\"> u/s 132</a> or books of account, other documents or any\nasset are requisitioned<a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_47\"> u/s 132A</a> after 31/05/2003 by inserting a new\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_48\">section 153A</a> in the Act. It is pertinent to mention here that the word used\nin <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 153A</a> of the Act which confers jurisdiction to issue notice and\nframe assessment, is &#x27;initiated&#x27;. Of course, it means a valid initiation, with\nwhich there can be no quarrel inasmuch as the warrant of authorization\nstands already executed by the competent authority and bears the name\nof the assessee-company among the persons to be searched. The new\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_50\">section 153A</a> provides the procedure for completion of assessment, where\na valid search is initiated<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_51\"> u/s 132</a>. In such cases, the Assessing Officer\nshall issue notice to such person requiring him to furnish within such\nperiod as may be specified in the notice, return of income in respect of six\nassessment years immediately preceding the Assessment year relevant to\nthe previous year in which search was conducted<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_52\"> u/s 132</a> or requisition\nwas made<a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_53\"> u/s 132A</a> of the Act. Thus, it can be said that the provision of\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_54\">section 153A</a> of the Act makes it clear that in the case of a person on\nwhom a valid search is initiated<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_55\"> u/s 132</a> or books of accounts or other\ndocuments or any asset are requisitioned<a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_56\"> u/s 132A</a>, the Assessing Officer\nshall issue a notice upon such person. The expression clearly relates to a\nperson in respect of whom search<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_57\"> u/s 132</a> has been initiated or as <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_58\">section\n153A</a> after 31st day of March 2003. The ratio laid down in Ramesh D. Patel\n(2014) 362 ITR 492(Guj.) supports our view. In that event the Assessing\nOfficer shall:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\"> (a) issue notice to such person requiring him to furnish within such period,\nas may be specified in the notice, the return of income in respect of each\nassessment year falling within six assessment years referred to in clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(b), in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and\nsetting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed and the\nprovisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if such\nreturn were a return required to be furnished under <a href=\"/doc/43144358/\" id=\"a_59\">section 139</a>;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(b) assess or reassess the total income of six assessment years\nimmediately preceding the assessment year relevant to the previous year\nin which such search is conducted or requisition is made.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">2.11.             From the aforesaid provision, it is clear that the first\nrequirement is valid initiation of search. The Revenue has executed\nwarrant of authorization in the name of the assessee company on 31-10-\n2009 which is placed at paper book page 58-59. The panchnama was\nprepared in the name of Shri Manoj Punamiya &amp; Group, prohibitory order<a href=\"/doc/741280/\" id=\"a_60\">\nu/s 132(3)</a> was also in the name of Shri Manoj Punamiya alone, no\nmaterial was unearthed by the department linking the assessee with the\npremises so searched by the department and no document was seized\nfrom the flat of Shri Manoj Punamiya which belongs to the assessee\ncompany.

Before us, the assessee has claimed that nothing\npertaining to the assessee was recovered from the premises of Shri\nManoj Punamiya, searched by the Revenue.

In the\nlight of the foregoing discussion, it is evidently clear that an\nassessment u/s 153A is different from regular assessment. The\nsection can be invoked only when a valid search is initiated u/s 132 or\nbooks of accounts, other documents or any assets are requisitioned\nu/s 132A after 31/05/2003. The provision of section 153A should be\nread in conjunction with the provision contained in section 132(1), the\nreason being that the later deals with search and seizure and the\nformer deals with assessment in case of search, thus, the two are\ninextricably linked with each other, which implies that existence of\nbooks of accounts, incriminating documents, or unaccounted assets is\nor are sine qua non for making the additions in the assessments under\nthis provision. Therefore, if nothing is found during the course of\nsearch, the additions in the assessment or reassessment u/s 153A is\nnot only erroneous but also serves no purpose. It can be précised that\nthe assessment or reassessment u/s 153A arises only, when a valid\nsearch has been initiated and conducted. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/191265324/\" id=\"a_101\">section\n153A</a> of the Act makes it clear that only in the case of a person on\nwhom, a valid search is initiated, u/s 132 or books of accounts or other\ndocuments or any assets are requisitioned u/s 132A after 31/05/2003,\nthe Assessing Officer shall after issuing notice assess or reassess the\ntotal income of such person for six assessment years immediately\npreceding the assessment year relevant to previous year, in which\nsuch search is conducted or requisition is made.

The\nHon&#x27;ble High Court held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">  &quot;8. Section 132 prescribes that the competent authorities are\n  empowered to permit the authorized officers to enter, search,\n  break open, seize, place marks of identification and take other\n  steps as contemplated under sub-clauses (i) to (v). However, such\n  powers can be exercised against a person upon fulfilment of\n  certain conditions. Firstly, the competent authority must have\n  information in its possession and, secondly, on the basis of such\n  information it must have reason to believe that the conditions as\n  stipulated in sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_103\">section 132(1)</a> of the\n  Income-tax Act, 1961 exist. Sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) of section\n  132(1) speak of any person. Search and seizure cannot be\n  sustained unless it is clearly shown that it was done by the\n  authority duly authorized, and all the conditions precedent in\n  relation thereto existed. Thus, before issuance of search warrant\n  in order to take recourse under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_104\">section 132</a> of the Income-tax Act,\n  1961, the authority competent to issue search warrant must be\n  satisfied that search under section 132(1) is needed in respect of\n  a definite person. Satisfaction required under section 132(1) of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              19</span>\n                                               M/s Salasar Developers\n                                         ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nAct 1961 is qua the person whose name appears in the warrant of\nauthorization. If search as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_105\">section 132</a> of the\nIncome-tax Act, 1961 is conducted in the premises of a person\nwithout any warrant of authorization in the name of the person\nsearched, or on the basis of a warrant of authorization in the\nname of some other persons, that would be a clear case of non-\napplication of mind of the empowered income-tax authorities and\nsuch a search cannot be held to be valid. It is so, because the\nbelief which forms the foundation of search relates to a definite\nperson who is to be subjected to search. If the contrary is the fact\nsituation, the same would amount to serious lapses and would be\nin clear violation of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_106\">section 132(1)</a> of\nthe Income-tax Act, 1961, as it does not stand the test of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_107\">section\n132</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Accordingly, the Assessing Officer is required\nonly to find out the date when the last panchnama with reference to\nlast authorisation is drawn and nothing beyond that.

The panchnama is a document which is prepared in the\n   presence of panchas (respectable local witnesses) containing the items\n   found and seized in the course of search. So the Assessing Officer\n   must satisfy himself for the purpose of calculating the period limitation\n   that document in question is in reality a panchnama. There may be a\n   case where inventory is prepared in respect of books of account or\n   valuable articles found in the course of search but taking of or removal\n   of such books of account or valuable article is not practicable. The\n   authorized officer may issue a restraint order under the proviso to\n   <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_175\">section 132(1)</a>. Such restraint is deemed to be a seizure as per the said\n   proviso. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"939261\" id=\"span_49\">Hence, in such a case, the preparation of inventory and\n   panchnama would be relevant and any action of the authorized officer\n   lifting the restraint order would, in our opinion, be irrelevant. The\n   reason is that whatever the search partly was required in law to do\n   had been done and nothing more was required. The restraint order is\n   passed not because anything was to be done but because it was not\n   practicable to take physical possession and remove the material to a\n   safe place at the relevant time. As held by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High\n   Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/939261/\" id=\"a_176\">CIT v. Mrs. Sandhya P. Naik</a> [2002] 253 ITR 534,\n   the authorized officer cannot keep the search proceedings in operation\n   by passing a restraint order under <a href=\"/doc/741280/\" id=\"a_177\">section 132(3)</a> so as to circumvent\n   the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/741280/\" id=\"a_178\">section 132(3)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/1498345/\" id=\"a_179\">section 132(5)</a>.\n   However, the situation would be different where a prohibitory order\n   under <a href=\"/doc/741280/\" id=\"a_180\">section 132(3)</a> is issued because such order, unlike- a restraint\n   order, does not amount to seizure as per sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_181\">section 132</a>.\n   Such orders are issued where it is not practicable to seize. So an act of\n   seizure remain to be performed and, therefore, search cannot be said\n   to be concluded. Hence, in such case, search would be concluded when\n   the prohibitory order is lifted and the books of account/valuable\n   articles are actually seized and the panchnama is prepared. In such\n   case, it is this panchnama (if it is the last one) which is relevant for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                     24</span>\n                                                        M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                  ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n     calculating the period of limitation. Accordingly, we hold that the\n     Tribunal can examine the record of search with a view to find out the\n     factum of last panchnama as discussed above.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\"><a href=\"/doc/118728415/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 153B</a> of the Act as applicable to the relevant year stipulate that time\nlimit for completion of the assessment<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_183\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act shall be computed\nbased on the conclusion of the search as recorded in the last of the\npanchnama drawn as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">     &quot;153BTime-limit for completion of assessment under <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_184\">section 153A</a>\n\n        &#x27;***\n        (2) The authorisation referred to in clause (a) and clause (b) of sub-\n     section (1) shall be deemed to have been executed,--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">     (a) in the case of search, on the conclusion of search as recorded in the\n           last panchnama drawn in relation to any person in whose case the\n          warrant of authorisation has been issued;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">2.17.

These provisions demonstrate that a search and\n     seizure under the said Act has to be carried out in the\n     presence of at least two respectable inhabitants of the\n     locality where the search and seizure is conducted. These\n     respectable inhabitants are witnesses to the search and\n     seizure and are known as &#x27;panchas&#x27;. The documentation of\n     what they witness is known as the panchnama. The word\n     &#x27;nama&#x27;, refers to a written document. Its type is usually\n     determined by the word which is combined with it as a\n     suffix. Examples being, nikah-nama (the written muslim\n     marriage contract), hiba-nama (gift deed, the word hiba\n     meaning - gift), wasiyat-nama (written will) and so on. So\n     a panchnama is a written record of what the panch has\n     witnessed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"706523\" id=\"span_57\">In <a href=\"/doc/706523/\" id=\"a_193\">Mohan Lal v.

A panchnama, as we\n        have seen is nothing but a document recording what has\n        happened in the presence of the witnesses (panchas). A\n        panchnama may document the search proceedings, with or\n        without any seizure. A panchnama may also document the\n        return of the seized articles or the removal of seals.

Clearly, if a panchnama does\n        not, from the facts recorded therein, reveal that a\n        search was at all carried out on the day to which it\n        relates, then it would not be a panchnama relating\n        to a search and, consequently, it would not be a\n        panchnama of the type which finds mention in the\n        said Explanation 2(a) to <a href=\"/doc/1422717/\" id=\"a_198\">section 158</a> BE.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"486318\" id=\"span_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89236604\" id=\"span_62\">Incidentally in the instant appeal , there is no panchnama drawn by the\nRevenue against the present assessee which is an admitted position.\nKeeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of\nconsidered view that the search proceedings in the case of present\nassessee got vitiated due to non-preparation of the panchnama in the\nname of the assessee which evidences conclusion of the search and\nwhich effectively decides against whom the Revenue has conducted\nsearch so much so further actions are required to initiate assessment\nproceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_199\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act for the last six years against the person\nso searched within the time stipulated<a href=\"/doc/118728415/\" id=\"a_200\"> u/s 153B</a> of the Act. Even Hon&#x27;ble\nDelhi High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/89236604/\" id=\"a_201\">MDLR Resorts Private Limited</a>(supra) has\nquoted relevant extract from decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/486318/\" id=\"a_202\">CIT v.

Thus, in the absence of panchnama being drawn\nagainst the assessee, no incriminating material having been found\npertaining to the assessee and also the premises searched did not\nbelonged to the assessee, it could be concluded based on the cumulative\neffect of all the above-stated relevant facts that no valid search was\nconducted against the assessee and the assessment<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_204\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act\nis bad in law hence liable to be quashed.

The search was initiated on 31-10-2009\nand hence the period with in which Revenue could have issued notice<a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_208\"> u/s\n143(2)</a> of the Act to frame assessment under <a href=\"/doc/144280341/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 143(3)</a> of the Act\nhas already expired and hence the assessment for the impugned\nassessment year is a concluded assessment as stipulated<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_210\"> u/s 153A</a> of\nthe Act on the date of search on 31-10-2009. Thus, as per mandate of\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 153A</a> of the Act the concluded assessment can be re-opened for\nframing assessment<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_212\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act provided there is an\nincriminating material found during the course of search.

These provisions demonstrate that a search and\nseizure under the said Act has to be carried out in the\npresence of at least two respectable inhabitants of the\nlocality where the search and seizure is conducted. These\nrespectable inhabitants are witnesses to the search and\nseizure and are known as &#x27;panchas&#x27;. The documentation of\nwhat they witness is known as the panchnama. The word\n&#x27;nama&#x27;, refers to a written document. Its type is usually\ndetermined by the word which is combined with it as a\nsuffix. Examples being, nikah-nama (the written muslim\nmarriage contract), hiba-nama (gift deed, the word hiba\nmeaning - gift), wasiyat-nama (written will) and so on. So\na panchnama is a written record of what the panch has\nwitnessed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"706523\" id=\"span_73\">In <a href=\"/doc/706523/\" id=\"a_229\">Mohan Lal v.

We have examined the meaning of the word\npanchnama in some detail because it is used in\nExplanation 2(a) to <a href=\"/doc/1851425/\" id=\"a_232\">Section 158BE</a> of the said Act although\nit has not been defined in the Act. A panchnama, as we\nhave seen is nothing but a document recording what has\nhappened in the presence of the witnesses (panchas). A\npanchnama may document the search proceedings, with or\nwithout any seizure. A panchnama may also document the\nreturn of the seized articles or the removal of seals. But,\nthe panchnama that is mentioned in Explanation 2(a) to\n<a href=\"/doc/1851425/\" id=\"a_233\">section 158BE</a> is a panchnama which documents the\nconclusion of a search. Clearly, if a panchnama does\nnot, from the facts recorded therein, reveal that a\nsearch was at all carried out on the day to which it\nrelates, then it would not be a panchnama relating\nto a search and, consequently, it would not be a\npanchnama of the type which finds mention in the\nsaid Explanation 2(a) to <a href=\"/doc/1422717/\" id=\"a_234\">section 158</a> BE.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                         31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">                                                           M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                    ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n2.4.

So far as, legal\nissue/jurisdictional issue is concerned, we are of the view\nthat the case of the assessee squarely covered in its favour\nby the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal, therefore, we find\nno merit in the appeals of the Revenue.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">3.             So far as, the merits of the case is concerned, the\ncase of the assessee is squarely covered by the decision of\nthe Tribunal of Delhi Bench in the case of ACIT vs M/s CHD\nDevelopers           Ltd.       (ITA         No.2902/Del./2010             and\n4694/Del./2010)             order    dated     26/09/2012,         which        is\nreproduced hereunder for ready reference and analysis:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">       &quot;The revenue is aggrieved by the impugned order dated 23rd March\n       2010 by the order of the ld.

Since the facts and the issues are common, both these\n       appeals were heard together.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">       Therefore, these can be disposed off by a common order, more so\n       when both the appeals pertain to the same assessee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">       2. First we shall take up the appeal of the Revenue (A.Y. 2006-07),\n       wherein first ground raised is that the ld. first appellate authority\n       erred on facts and in law in allowing additional evidence filed during\n       first appellate stage contravening rule 46A of the Rules.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                   32</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">                                                      M/s Salasar Developers\n                                               ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n2.1. The crux of arguments on behalf of the Revenue is that\nopportunity was not granted to the Assessing Officer to go through the\nadditional evidence filed before the ld. CIT(A), therefore, it is\nviolation of the Rules. On the other hand, learned counsel for the\nassessee defended the conclusion drawn in the impugned order, by\ninviting our attention to pages 37 &amp; 38 of the paper book, evidencing\nthat if common area of staircase is excluded from the total built up\narea, such area remains to the extent of 1386.03 sq. ft. only.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">2.2. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the\nmaterial available on record. The facts in brief are that the assessee\nclaimed deduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_237\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a> amounting to Rs. 1,86,02,270/- on\nthe total sum of Rs. 7,88,82,014/-. The assessee filed profit and loss\na/c, balance-sheet and audit report in form no. 10-CCB for claiming\nsuch deduction for Krishna Lok project. The assessee was also asked\nto furnish such information as contained in pages 1 &amp; 2 of the\nassessment order. The assessee vide reply dated 10-12-2008 furnished\nthe submissions and the documents filed by the assessee were\nexamined. We further find that in the impugned order, there is no\nmention of the fact that such additional documents were filed by the\nassessee which were not filed before the Assessing Officer. Therefore,\nthe assertion of the ld. Sr. DR that the is violation of Rule 46A is\nwithout any basis. Even otherwise, the ld. CIT(A) has co-terminus\npower that of the Assessing Officer. As per Sub-section (4), the CIT(A)\nbefore disposing off any appeal may make any inquiry as he thinks fit\nor may direct the Assessing Officer to make further inquiry and report\nthe result of the same to him. It is not the case that the ld. CIT(A) is\nnot empowered to decide the appeal without consulting/ confronting\nthe Assessing Officer . It is not the case that any new evidence was\nadmitted by the ld. CIT(A). The evidence in the form of computation of\nbuilt up area was furnished during assessment proceedings itself and\nthe ld. DR has not specifically pointed out as to which was the\nadditional evidence filed before the ld. first appellate authority.\nTherefore, we find no justification to interfere with the conclusion\ndrawn by the ld. CIT(A) and further find no justification in the\nassertion of the Revenue that there is any violation of Rule 46A.\nTherefore, this ground of the revenue is based on assumption and\npresumption, consequently dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">3. Next ground pertains to deletion of addition of Rs. 77,18,098/-\nmade on account of disallowance of deduction claimed<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_238\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a>,\nallegedly ignoring the plan submitted by the assessee to the Mathura\nVarindavan authority and the total built up are of type &quot;A&quot; flat being\nmore than 1500 sq. ft. The assertion of the ld. Sr. DR Shri R.B. Meena\nis identical to the ground raised by submitting that the built up area of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                    33</span>\n                                                       M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                 ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\ntype &quot;A&quot; flat is more than 1500 sq. ft., therefore, the assessee is not\nentitled to deduction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">3.1. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the assessee took us to\nvarious pages of the paper book, including sanction plan approved by\nCompetent Authority by further submitting that the common area to\nthe tune of 8.172 sq. mts. Which pertains to stair case is not part of the\nbuilt up area of the flat as the same is used by all the residents, being\nthe common area, and if this area is reduced from the total area it\ncomes below the prescribed limit of 1500 sq. ft.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">3.2. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the\nmaterial available on record. We have also perused the sanction plan\nand area of each unit like bed rooms, toilet, kitchen, drawing room,\nbalcony, power room and store etc. We find that if the total area as\nper approved plan is examined, it comes to 1386.03 sq. ft. (as per\nsanction plan), and the total saleable area/ super area is 1492.43 sq.\nft., which in all fairness is below the prescribed limit of 1500 sq. ft. So\nfar as the common area or stair case is concerned, it cannot be\nincluded in the built up area of an individual unit as the same is to be\nused by all the residents/ inhabitants. If the definition of &quot;built up\narea&quot; as mentioned in sub-clause (a) of sub-section (14) of <a href=\"/doc/22773764/\" id=\"a_239\">Section\n80-IB</a>, is analyzed, it speaks about the inner measurement of the\nresidential unit at the floor level, including the projections and\nbalconies, as increased by the thickness of the walls but does not\ninclude the common area shared with other residential units. The stair\ncase definitely comes under the common pool used by all the\ninhabitants, therefore, it cannot be included in the built up area. Even\notherwise the Assessing Officer noted from the details submitted by\nthe assessee that three types of flats were sold by the assessee and in\nthe type &quot;A&quot; category the area is 1386.03 sq. ft., whereas in type &quot;B&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">the total area is 1122.48 sq. ft., and in type &quot;C&quot; flat, the total area is\n811.84 sq. ft. per flat. These details were submitted by the assessee\nvide letter dated 12-12-2008 before the ld. CIT(A) and earlier before\nthe Assessing Officer. Such details have been reproduced at page 4 of\nthe impugned order. There is a factual recording that stair case is\ncommon area between the two adjacent flats measuring 8.172 sq. mts.\nand if this area is reduced from the total area of the unit then certainly\nit comes below the prescribed limit of 1500 sq. ft. This being the first\nyear of claiming deduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_240\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a> of the Act, wherein the\nAssessing Officer himself noted that assessee&#x27;s 48 units of Type-A\nflats; 90 units of Type-B &amp; Type-C units were under construction, the\nAssessing Officer himself computed the built up area by including the\nstair case area, therefore, it exceeded the prescribed limit. Such\nfactual finding recorded in the impugned order was not controverted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                   34</span>\n                                                      M/s Salasar Developers\n                                               ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nby the Revenue by bringing any positive material on record. In view of\nthese facts we are of the considered opinion that the assessee is\nclearly entitled for such deduction. Therefore, we find no justification\nto interfere with the conclusion drawn in the impugned order, which is\naffirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">4. The next ground pertains to deletion of addition of Rs. 60,58,419/-\nmade on account of apportionment of expenses in the ratio of turn\nover to different units. The crux of the arguments on behalf of the\nRevenue is that no part of the head office expenses pertaining to\nmanagement were debited to Krishna Lok Unit. In nut shell the\nassessment order was defended on the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">4.1. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the assessee took us to\nvarious pages of the paper book by submitting that the expenses were\nbooked separately in the books of account, which are audited one.\nOur attention was also invited to page 36 wherein break up of the\nexpenses has been given. A query was raised by the Bench whether\nsuch break up was submitted before the Assessing Officer. It was\nuncontrovertedly explained that this break up was very much\navailable before the Assessing Officer .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">4.2. We have perused page 36 which is part of the synopsis as per\nwhich (Schedule &quot;J&quot;), the administrative and other expenses pertains\nto head office. Krishna Lok a/c and remaining has been duly\nexplained. Whereas in Schedule &quot;K&quot; the selling expenses, which\ninclude advertisement and publicity; sales promotion &amp; booking; and\nselling expenses have been bifurcated, whereas in Schedule &quot;L&quot;,\nfinancial expenses like bank interest and collection charges, interest\nand others have been mentioned, Therefore, the contention of the\nRevenue that these expenses were not bifurcated is without any basis.\nEven from the assessment order (page 6), there is a categorical\nfinding that the assessee company has not taken any loan secured or\nunsecured for Krishna Lok and the ledger print out of the current\naccount maintained with Oriental Bank of Commerce and Punjab\nNational Bank were furnished during assessment proceedings which\nclearly indicates that the total receipt from Krishna Lok project sale is\nutilized for the purpose of meeting expenses of Krishna Lok and none\nof the loans from Head Office were transferred to Krishna Lok. There\nis a further finding that there is no question of transfer any financial\nexpenses to Krishna Lok and further the administrative and other\nexpenses which include salary, bonus other perquisites, employees\nwelfare and the rates and taxes, general expenses, news paper and\nperiodicals, legal and professional expenses, postage &amp; telephone\ncharges, power fuel and water charges, printing &amp; stationery, vehicle\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                    35</span>\n                                                       M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nrepair &amp; maintenance expenses etc. are incurred separately and\ndebited separately to Krishna Lok restaurant and other projects. Such\nexpenses are business specific and not commonly incurred. On careful\nscrutiny of allocated expenses, we find that the expenses in the nature\nof &quot;audit fee&quot; and &quot;director remuneration&quot; are for the assessee as a\nwhole and not specific to the business. Consequently, the expenses of\nRs. 33,660/- and Rs. 58,630 respectively are allocated to Krishna\nProject, therefore, addition to the extent of Rs. 2,92,290/- is sustained.\nThe deletion of addition of balance expenses of Rs. 57,66,129/- is\nupheld. This ground is, therefore, allowed partly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">5. The last ground pertains to deletion of addition of Rs. 7,425/- made\non account of extra depreciation on computer peripherals/ accessories\nignoring that the rule only allows for computer and computer software\nfor such depreciation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">5.1. Ld. Sr. DR defended the conclusion drawn in the assessment\norder, whereas the learned counsel for the assessee defended the\nimpugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">5.2. We have considered the rival submissions and found that the\nassessee claimed Rs. 16,500/- to fixed assets in the block of computers\nand computer peripherals which as per the assessee are depreciable\n@ 60%, which was denied by the Assessing Officer . We find that the\nld. CIT(A) considered the issue in a justified manner and deleted the\naddition of Rs. 7425/-. We find no justification to interfere with the\nsame as nothing contrary was brought to our notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">6.

Finally, the appeal of the revenue is partly allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_87\">8. Now we shall take up the appeal of the assessee (ITA no.\n4694/Del/10 for A.Y. 2007-08). Though the assessee has raised as\nmany as seven grounds of appeal, but if all the grounds are\nsummarized, the only ground remains which pertains to the\ndisallowance of deduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_241\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a>. Learned counsel for the\nassessee also fairly explained that the issue pertains to only 80-IB\n(10) and the remaining grounds are only argumentative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_88\">8.1. The crux of argument on behalf of the assessee is that the vide\nletter dated 5-11-2008 the assessee had applied for completion\ncertificate but the completion certificate was not issued to the assessee\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                   36</span>\n                                                      M/s Salasar Developers\n                                               ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nwhich is beyond the control and power of the assessee. Our attention\nwas also invited to page 22 of the paper book containing a certificate\nsigned by the Architect of the assessee i.e. Candid Design Consortium\nPvt. Ltd., in which the total area of the Type-A flat has been\nmentioned at 1492.43 sq. ft. Ld. counsel submitted that for A.Y. 2006-\n07 deduction was allowed to the assessee and it is the same sanction\nplan which could not be denied for the next year. It was\nempathetically argued that the total built up area is below the\nprescribed limit of 1500 sq. ft. and there is no violation of the Act. It\nwas also pleaded that the project was approved on 16-3-2005 which is\nwell before 1-4-2005 and the assessee was to complete the project on\nor before 31-3-2009. The ld. counsel also relied on the decisions of\nVisakhapatnam &amp; Delhi Benches of the ITAT as also the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court, which we will discuss while coming to a\nparticular conclusion. The crux of the argument is that requirement of\ncompletion certificate was merely directory and not mandatory.\nReliance was placed upon the decision dated 29-2-2012 of Hon&#x27;ble\nKarnataka High Court (ITA no. 138 of 2010) to the effect that it is\nprospective in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">8.2. On the other hand, ld. Sr. DR took us to various pages of the\nassessment order by submitting that the case laws relied upon by the\nassessee are not applicable to the facts of the present appeal and even\nno such certificate was issued to the assessee till date, therefore,\ndeduction was rightly denied to the assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_90\">8.3. In reply, the learned counsel for the assessee contended that for\nA.Y. 2006-07 on identical facts deduction was granted to the assessee\non some of the flats, therefore, for the sake of consistency no &quot;U turn&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">is permissible for the next year, specially when the facts are same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">8.4. We have considered the rival submissions and perused the\nmaterial available on record. The facts in brief are that the assessee\ndeclared taxable income of Rs. 5,97,15,620/- in its return filed on 31-\n10-2007. The case of the assessee was selected for scrutiny. The\nassessee claimed deduction of Rs. 5,19,92,472/- u/s 80-IB(10). The\nAssessing Officer asked the assessee to give justification for claiming\nsuch deduction. Ld. Assessing Officer denied the claim on two counts-\nfirstly, the built up area of the unit is above prescribed limit of 1500\nsq. ft. and secondly for earlier assessment order identical deduction\nwas claimed by the assessee and the assessee violated the conditions\nstipulated<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_242\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a> in Type -A flats. Ultimately, the ld. Assessing\nOfficer denied such deduction to the assessee. The assessee filed\nvarious documents before the Assessing Officer and the same were\nexamined by her. Finally the ld. Assessing Officer concluded that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                   37</span>\n                                                      M/s Salasar Developers\n                                               ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nconditions laid down<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_243\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a> were not satisfied, therefore, the\nclaim of deduction could not be allowed to the assessee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\"> 8.5. On appeal before the ld. CIT(A) the claim of the assessee was\nexamined and ultimately the assessment order was upheld. The\naggrieved assessee is in appeal before this Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">8.6. If the totality of facts available on record and the assertion made\nby the ld. respective counsels are kept in juxtaposition, broadly the ld.\nCIT(A) is influenced by the sale transactions with Rajasthan Global\nSecurities Ltd., wherein pursuant to summons<a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_244\"> u/s 131</a> issued to\nRajasthan Global Securities Ltd., it was confirmed that the amount of\nRs. 5,36,89,920/- was paid to the assessee as advance for purchase of\n37 flats in Krishnalok project. However, what it may the moot issue to\nbe adjudicated by us pertains to <a href=\"/doc/1502697/\" id=\"a_245\">sec. 80-</a> IB(10). We further find that\nas contained in para 1.2 (page 5) of the impugned order, the ld.\nCIT(A) has examined the submissions of the assessee and the reason\nof denial of deduction to the assessee by the ld. Assessing Officer. The\nrelevant portion from the impugned order is reproduced hereunder:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">  &quot;It was further submitted that Addl. CIT wrongly tries to prove\n  that sale with M/s. Rajasthan Global Securities Ltd. (RGSL) are\n  not accounted for properly and undue profit has arisen on\n  account of 80-IB whereas these are normal business transactions\n  undertaken by assessee company with M/s Rajasthan Global\n  Securities Ltd. having no mutual relation whatsoever. The\n  Assessing Officer has objected to the issue of preferential shares\n  and its valuation. The assessee company has issued preferential\n  shares to various persons as per SEBI guidelines and approval\n  of Bombay Stock Exchange. The assessee company is a listed\n  company and does not ah any discretion about the issue price\n  and require to issue shares through preferential allotment only\n  at the rate as per SEBI guidelines and approved by stock\n  exchange. During the year the assessee company has calculated\n  average market price as per general meeting, certification by\n  statutory auditor etc., has submitted to Bombay Stock Exchange\n  and has issued the preferential share after getting approval from\n  Bombay Stock Exchange. These are normal business\n  transactions because these are issued as per SEBI and Stock\n  Exchange guidelines. These shares are issued to a number of\n  companies and individuals and not only to RGSL. Valuation of\n  these shares are done as per SEBI and Stock Exchange\n  guidelines which were as per average market rats and approved\n  by Board of Directors and General Meeting of CHD, statutory\n  auditor and Bombay Stock exchange approval. There is no close\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                 38</span>\n                                                   M/s Salasar Developers\n                                             ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nor remote nexus between CHD and RGSL. There is no common\nrelation among the directors or major share holders. Since CHD\nis listed company it has no control over market rate or\nguidelines of SEBI and Stock Exchange. It is immaterial for\nCHD what its shareholder does with their investments. As regard\nAssessing Officer &#x27;s observation that the assessee has booked\nsubstantial sales with respect to non 80-IB project and has\nbooked substantial sales with respect to 80-IB project, it was\nsubmitted that these are normal business transactions which\nCHD has undertaken during this year for earning profits in 80-\nIB project as well as non 80-IB projects.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">8.7. If the aforesaid is analyzed, we find that the grievance of the\nrevenue is that the sales made to M/s Rajasthan Global\nSecurities Ltd. are not properly accounted for and undue profit\nhas arisen on account of <a href=\"/doc/22773764/\" id=\"a_246\">sec. 80-IB</a>, whereas the claim of the\nassessee is that it is a normal business transaction and the\nassessee has no mutual relation what-so-ever with M/s\nRajasthan Global Securities Ltd. So far as the built up area is\nconcerned, as has been alleged by the revenue that it is beyond\nthe prescribed limit of 1500 sq. ft., we have perused the sanction\nplan, submissions before the Assessing Officer as well as before\nthe ld. CIT(A) and the break up dimensions adduced by the\nassessee. Such break up even has been reproduced at pages 7 &amp;\n8 of the impugned order, as per which the total area has been\nclaimed by the assessee at 1492.43 sq. ft.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">8.8. Another point mentioned in the assessment order for\ndenying deduction by the Assessing Officer is that the assessee\ndid not file the bifurcation. However, we find that such\nbifurcation was duly filed by the assessee that too room-wise of\nall the units. Still the deduction was denied on the presumption\nthat the basis of arriving at such figure was not adduced by the\nassessee. We are not in agreement with the finding of the\nAssessing Officer on two counts- firstly, the approval was\ngranted by the Competent Authority; and secondly such\nbifurcation is as per sanctioned plan which was filed before the\nAssessing Officer. Uncontrovertedly such bifurcation was filed\nduring assessment stage, first appellate stage and even before\nus. It is also not in dispute that the approval was granted by the\nCompetent Authority to the assessee on 16-3-2005 meaning\nthereby the project was approved before the amendment\ninserted/ substituted by <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_247\">Finance (No.2) Act</a> of 2004, w.e.f. 1-4-\n2005. Prior to its substitution, sub-section (10), as amended by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                 39</span>\n                                                   M/s Salasar Developers\n                                             ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/18383251/\" id=\"a_248\">Finance Act, 2000</a>, w.e.f. 1-4-2001 and <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_249\">Finance Act</a> 2003\nwith retrospective effect from 1-4-2002, read as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">&quot;(10) the amount of profits in case of an undertaking developing\nand building housing projects approved before the 31st day of\nMarch, 2005 by a local authority, shall be hundred per cent of\nthe profits derived in any previous year relevant to any\nassessment year from such housing project if, -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">(a) such undertaking has commenced or commences\ndevelopment and construction of the housing project on or after\nthe 1st day of October, 1998;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">(b) the project is on the size of a plot of land which has a\nminimum area of one acre; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">(c) the residential unit has a maximum built-up area of one\nthousand square feet where such residential unit is situated\nwithin the cities of Delhi or Mumbai or within twenty-five\nkilometers from the municipal limits of these cities and one\nthousand and five hundred square feet at any other place.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">8.9. If the aforesaid position of law existing at the time when the\nplan was sanctioned/ approval was granted to the assessee is\nanalyzed , there was no condition like production of complete\ncertificate. This is a settled legal proposition of law that the law\nexisting at the particular point of time will be applicable unless\nand until it is specifically made retrospective by the legislature.\nThe substitution so made, is therefore, applicable prospectively\nand not retrospectively. There is an uncontroverted fact that\napproval was granted to the assessee on 16-3-2005,\nconsequently the assessee was expected to complete the project\non or before 31-3-2009. Now the question arises whether the\nproject was completed by the assessee within time. As is evident\nfrom the letter of the assessee dated 5-11-2008 addressed to the\nVice Chairman Mathura Vrindavan Development Authority, on\nwhich the seal and signature of the concerned authority is\naffixed (page 28 of the paper book), it has been specifically\nrequested that the construction has been completed and further\nrequest has been made for grant of completion certificate of\nPhase-I, meaning thereby, if not earlier, the project was\npresumed to be complete as on 5-11-2008 because the concerned\ndevelopment authority has neither said that the project was not\ncomplete nor completion certificate was issued to the assessee.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                 40</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">                                                    M/s Salasar Developers\n                                              ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nIn the absence of any variation or allegation if such certificate is\nnot issued to the assessee, whether the assessee can be penalized\nfor the act of an authority on which it has no control, the obvious\nreply is that for the fault of others anybody should not be\npenalized, more specifically when the project was approved on\n16-3-2005. Therefore, the law applicable as on date will be\napplicable to the assessee. It is not expected that the assessee\nwill demolish the construction work which is already in progress\nand again comply with the direction of the law which was\ninserted on a later date which is prospective in nature. If the\nintention of the legislature would have been to make it effective\nfrom retrospective effect, nothing prevents the legislature to do\nso.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">8.10. If the issue is analyzed in the light of case laws cited before\nus, we find that the Hon&#x27;ble Karnataka High Court vide\njudgment dated 29th February 2012 in the case of CIT &amp;\nanother Vs. M/s Anriya Project Management Services Pvt. Ltd.\n(ITA no. 138 of 2010), considered the decision like CIT &amp; ors.\nVs. G.R. Developers (ITA no. 355/2009) and held that definition\nof built up area was inserted by <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_250\">Finance (No.2) Act</a> of 2004,\nwhich came into effect from 1-4-2005, is prospective in nature\nand has no application to the housing projects which were\napproved by local authority prior to that date, strongly supports\nthe case of the assessee. It was held by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court\nthat the assessee was entitled to hundred per cent benefit of <a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_251\">sec.\n80-IB(10)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">8.11.

In that case\nalso, completion certificate was not filed before the Assessing\nOfficer and the proof of municipal tax assessment of various flat\nowners establishing that the housing project was completed\nbefore September 2008 was filed. Since there was no practice of\nissuing the project completion certificate, therefore, it was held\nthat it was not a condition precedent of filing the completion\ncertificate for allowing deduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_252\"> u/s 80-IB(10)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">8.12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"3044320\" id=\"span_86\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/3044320/\" id=\"a_253\">CIT Vs.

Finally, the appeal of the revenue is allowed in part and that\n      of the assessee is allowed.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_103\">     In the aforesaid order, the Tribunal made an elaborate\ndiscussion, considering the legal position as well as various\ncase laws and then reached to a particular conclusion. This\ndecision of the Tribunal was challenged by the Revenue\nbefore Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court, wherein, vide order dated\n22/01/2014, the same was affirmed (2014) 43 taxman.com\n2049 (Del.) ; (2014) 362 ITR 177 (Del.). If the aforesaid order\nis kept in juxtaposition with the facts of the present appeal,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                     43</span>\n                                                       M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                 ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\nwe find that the assessee obtained approval from the local\nauthority, being Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation\n(MBMC) on 28/05/2003. The assessee accordingly claimed\ndeduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_266\"> u/s 80IB(10)</a> of the Act in its return. The\nassessment was completed<a href=\"/doc/144280341/\" id=\"a_267\"> u/s 143(3)</a> of the Act rejecting\nthe claimed deduction. The assessee got substantial relief\nfrom the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeal) and the\norder was challenged by the Revenue before the Tribunal. In\nthe meantime, search and seizure action took place at the\nresidential premises of the partners of the assessee firms,\nwithout taking similar action at the business premises of the\nassessee firm. There is no dispute to the fact that the project\nof the assessee was approved on 28/05/2003 by the\ncompetent authority and the amendment of the built up\narea of the unit was brought on the statute book at a later\nstage, meaning thereby, the project was approved before the\namendment inserted/substituted by the <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_268\">Finance (No.2) Act</a>\nof 2004, w.e.f. 01/04/2005. Prior to substitution, sub-\nsection (10) as amended by the <a href=\"/doc/18383251/\" id=\"a_269\">Finance Act, 2000</a>, w.e.f.\n01/04/2001 and <a href=\"/doc/142122701/\" id=\"a_270\">Finance Act, 2003</a> with retrospective effect\nfrom 01/04/2002 reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      &quot;(10) the amount of profits in case of an undertaking developing\n      and building housing projects approved before the 31st day of\n      March, 2005 by a local authority, shall be hundred per cent of the\n      profits derived in any previous year relevant to any assessment\n      year from such housing project if, -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      (a) such undertaking has commenced or commences development\n      and construction of the housing project on or after the 1st day of\n      October, 1998;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                      44</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">                                                         M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                  ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">       (b) the project is on the size of a plot of land which has a\n       minimum area of one acre; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">       (c) the residential unit has a maximum built-up area of one\n       thousand square feet where such residential unit is situated within\n       the cities of Delhi or Mumbai or within twenty-five kilometers\n       from the municipal limits of these cities and one thousand and five\n       hundred square feet at any other place.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">3.1.        Even otherwise, we are of the considered opinion\nthat the assessee is expected to complete the project as per\nthe approved plan at a particular point of time and the\nassessee is not expected to do or to fulfill the conditions\nwhich were not in existence at the relevant point of time or\nmade compulsory after making some amendment in the Act\non a later date. Since the project of the assessee was\napproved by the competent authority on 28/05/2003,\naccordingly completed within the specified time and made\nclaim of deduction<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_271\"> u/s 80IB(10)</a> of the Act, therefore, the\nassessee is not expected to fulfill the conditions, which were\ninserted in the Act on a later date. The assessee was\nexpected to construct/develop the project according to the\napproved plan. The assessee cannot dream that at a later\nstage, amendment will be brought into the Act and\naccordingly the assessee shall fulfill the conditions, which\nwere even not in existence, when the plan was approved,\ntherefore, on merits also, the assessee is having a good case\nin its favour. The assessee has already produced the\ndocumentary evidences in support of its claim before the\nAssessing Officer. The assessee had fulfill all the conditions\nas specified<a href=\"/doc/41593560/\" id=\"a_272\"> u/s 80IB(10)</a> of the Act, thus, on merit also, we\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                         45</span>\n                                                             M/s Salasar Developers\n                                                       ITA No.4511 TO 4513/Mum/2014\n\n\n   find no infirmity in the order of the Ld.
