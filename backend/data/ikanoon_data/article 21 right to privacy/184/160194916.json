Furthermore, the FAA while dismissing the\nFirst Appeal in a mechanical and unreasoned manner failed to discharge the\nduties imposed on him as per the guidelines of the MHA dated 14.02.2014.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Explaining that the information sought did not impinge on the security,\nsovereignty, integrity or interest of the state, the Appellant stated that the FAA\nwas duty bound to explain how or in what context , the exemption<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_5\"> u/s 8 (1) (a)</a>\nwas applicable. Referring to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8 (1)</a>( f), it was stated that no part of the\ninformation sought pertains to any sort of intergovernmental correspondence\nbetween the Government of India and the Government of United States of\nAmerica and that it pertained to intra-governmental correspondences within\nthe MEA. The FAA failed to take into consideration, the observations of the\nCommission in numerous cases wherein similar requests pertaining to inter\ndepartmental correspondence within the Central Government have been\nallowed (Afroz Alam &quot;Sahil&quot; vs. PIO, Foreign Ministry, Government of\nIndia).Explaining that mere existence of an investigation process cannot be a\nground for refusal of information, the Appellant stated that even if an inquiry\nwas pending before a competent court, it was unclear as to why exemption<a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_7\"> u/s\n8 (1) (h)</a> was claimed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1617451\" id=\"span_2\">A reference was made to the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt of Delhi in <a href=\"/doc/1617451/\" id=\"a_8\">B.S.

He further stated that information\non points 3 and 4 of the RTI application constitutes official documents as the\nsame constitutes acts or record of acts of Sovereign Authority i.e., Ministry of\nExternal Affairs and hence the CPIO was duty bound to provide the\ninformation. The present matter pertains to a case of alleged fraud in the USA\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                         Page 2 of 11</span>\n and such information is of great significance to the society at large. Further,\nthe information regarding arrest in Mumbai and enquiry proceedings pending\nin Delhi is available on websites and various public domains suggest that the\nfugitive is undergoing extradition enquiry proceedings at Patiala House Courts,\nNew Delhi though he was taken into custody in Mumbai. Thus, it is unclear as\nto why furnishing such information clarifying the position of the government\ndepartment and steps taken in relation to the said enquiry are not subject to\nscrutiny under the RTI given that the same would help elaborate on the official\nsteps taken by the MEA in relation to the said enquiry. It was further stated\nthat the information regarding the decision taken as per rules and regulations\nshall be made freely accessible and that the FAA failed to take into account the\nmandate provided under <a href=\"/doc/223525/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 4 (1) (d)</a> which casts an obligation upon a\npublic authority to provide reasons for administrative or quasi judicial\ndecisions.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_4\">He also referred to the decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_10\">Bihar Public Service Commission vs. Sayed Hussain Abbas Rizvi and Anr.</a>[2012\n13 SCC 61]. In view of the above, it was prayed to direct the concerned CPIO to\nfurnish the documents/ information sought in the RTI application.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">A written submission has been received from the CPIO and Director (CPV) vide\nletter dated 24.11.2020 wherein explaining the reasons for denying the\ninformation<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_11\"> u/s 8 (1) (a)</a>, (f) and (h), it was stated that an extradition is a law\nenforcement process between two sovereign countries for handing over of an\naccused or convict under a formal treaty. The process requires communication\nof dossiers, evidence and other material containing detailed information about\nnot only the accused/ convict but also may include many others involved in\nthe case including foreign authorities, witnesses, etc. The information received\nfrom a foreign country is thus treated as &quot;information received in confidence&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">not to be divulged publicly. The information obtained/supplied could also\ninclude private facts (mobile number, email Ids, addresses, bank details, etc)\ndisclosure of which may have implications for the supplying foreign authority\nunder the privacy laws of that state. Hence, conveying such private facts to a\nthird party could be considered as an undesirable/ irresponsible act. As the\nstringency of privacy laws differ from country to country, it was stated that in\ntheir considered view, it is better to avoid such disclosures so as not to\nadversely impact relations with a foreign country. The extradition records also\nreflect the stages of various investigations going on at a given point of time. A\ndetrimental effect on the process of investigation by sharing such information\nwith a third party cannot be ruled out. The CPIO/FAA has no way to determine\nif greater public interest will be served by supplying such information to a third\nparty about an ongoing extradition process. The court proceedings and final\noutcome of the process is anyway made public.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">In order to ensure social distancing and prevent the spread of the pandemic,\nCOVID-19, audio hearings were scheduled after giving prior notice to both the\nparties.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                        Page 3 of 11</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> The Appellant&#x27;s representatives Shri Siddharth Satija, Advocate and Shri Nikhil\nPillai, Advocate participated in the hearing on being contacted on their\ntelephone. Reiterating the contents of the RTI application and referring to their\nwritten submission, the Appellant&#x27;s representative stated that the information\nsought in points no. 1 and 2 pertained to the internal functioning of the\nMinistry of External Affairs hence could not be denied<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_12\"> u/s 8 (1) (a)</a>, (f) and (h) of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act</a>.

Roychaudhuri, Advocate through audio conference. Shri Sharma\nstated that in points 1 and 2, the Appellant has sought complete file No. T-\n413/95/2015 alongwith copy of the reasons of satisfaction recorded by the\nUnder Secretary(Extradition), Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) before passing\norder dated 11.10.2017, other intra-office communications, process notes and\nfile notings pursuant to which order dated 11.10.2017 was passed. He stated\nthat the file contains dossiers, evidence and other material contains detailed\ninformation about not only the accused/convict but also may include many\nothers involved in the case including foreign authorities, witnesses, etc. The file\nmay also contain personal details of third parties such as their mobile number,\nemail ids, addresses, bank details, etc. Thus, it will be difficult on the part of\nthe Respondent Public Authority to severe any information and provide the\nsame to the Appellant. However, with regard to points 3 and 4, the Respondent\nagreed to relook into the matter to ascertain if information may be disclosed to\nthe Appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">DECISION- INTERIM\nHaving heard both the parties and on perusal of the available records, the\nCommission notes that the instant matter requires careful examination of the\nfacts of the case, the judicial/quasi judicial pronouncements cited by the\nAppellant and ensuing contentions necessitate a further hearing of parties\nbefore the Commission can arrive at a final decision. Several written\nsubmissions have been filed by both the parties including a written submission\nby the Appellant&#x27;s representative, a day prior to the instant hearing which\nrequires further examination. Therefore, in view the above, the Commission\ndirects the Registry of this bench to fix another short date of hearing in the\nmatter requesting both the parties to appear before the Commission through\nvideo conferencing mode arranged within the CIC premises or in person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">The Respondent may also submit their response, if any, to the Commission\nwith a copy to the Appellant against the additional written submissions filed by\nthe Appellant, at least 7 days prior to the next date of hearing fixed by the\nCommission.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                          Page 4 of 11</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"> Facts emerging in Course of Hearing: 17.02.2021\nIn order to ensure social distancing and prevent the spread of the pandemic,\nCOVID-19, video hearings were scheduled after giving prior notice to both the\nparties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">Both parties were duly represented by their respective counsels and heard at\nlength through video conference.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68081013\" id=\"span_7\">The Respondent pointed out that the present litigation seems to be in the\nnature of proxy litigation because the RTI applicant has not demonstrated any\ncogent reason for seeking information about extradition of a third party, viz.\nShri Salim Abbas Karimi, a US national. The information sought by the\nAppellant which appears unconnected to him, obviously is of value to the\naccused who has been arrested on charges of committing fraud in the USA.\nHowever, no connection has been established by the Appellant for seeking\ninformation pertaining to the enquiry proceedings, underway in Delhi about\nShri Salim Abbas Karimi. It has further been contended by the Respondent\nthat if the RTI applicant was seeking information on his own, then it was\nincumbent upon him to disclose his interest in seeking such personal\ninformation related to a third party to ascertain his bonafide as establish the\nlarger public interest in disclosure of such information. The Respondent\nfurther contended that information sought is barred from disclosure under\n<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_16\">8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, while placing reliance on the\ndecision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/68081013/\" id=\"a_17\">Union of India v.

Jayachandran [WP (C</a>) 3406/2012\ndated 19.02.2014], by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi wherein it was held that\npassport details, copies of birth certificate and copies of records of educational\nqualification are personal information, the disclosure of which is generally\nbarred since it would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of individuals\nunless there was an overbearing public interest in favour of disclosure.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115151017\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1617451\" id=\"span_9\">In rebuttal of the Respondent&#x27;s contention, it was submitted by the Appellant&#x27;s\ncounsel that a fresh exemption clause i.e. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> cannot be raised at\nappellate stage of proceedings and any argument to support the order of the\nCPIO should be confined to the stand taken by the CPIO. The counsel for the\nAppellant further submitted that as per the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">RTI Act</a> he is not\nobliged to disclose the reasons behind seeking the information and therefore\nthe question of the Appellant&#x27;s bonafide cannot be questioned by the\nRespondent only because he has not disclosed his interest in obtaining such\ninformation. The counsel for the Appellant placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1617451/\" id=\"a_20\">B.S. Mathur vs.\nPIO, Delhi High</a> Court; Bhagat Singh vs. CIC and <a href=\"/doc/115151017/\" id=\"a_21\">Adesh Kumar vs. Union of India\nand Ors.</a> to corroborate his argument that: &quot;..Merely, citing that the\ninformation is exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)(h)</a> of the Act would not absolve the\npublic authority from discharging its onus as required to claim such\nexemption...&quot; and emphasised that due process of law must be followed while\ndenying access to information by providing supportive arguments for such\ndenial and public authority is obliged under the Act to provide reasons for\nadministrative or quasi judicial decisions.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                        Page 5 of 11</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"> Decision: 25.03.2021\nUpon examining the facts of the case alongwith the detailed contentions placed\nforth by both the parties, the Commission takes note of the Appellant&#x27;s\ncontention that fresh ground for denial of information i.e. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> cannot\nbe raised at appellate stage if the PIO had not cited such exemption in his\nresponse. It is also unquestionable that merely citing of any provision of law\ndoes not suffice for denial of information, unless duly supported by appropriate\nreasons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">Having discussed the above position, dealing with the merits of the case, the\nCommission notes that though Respondent was granted time and opportunity\nto file written submissions in support of their arguments, no such submission\nhas been submitted by the Respondent, except the oral averments during\nhearing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Therefore, the Commission shall decide the case on the basis of records\navailable. Though the Commission is in agreement in principle with some of the\narguments put forth by the Appellant as noted in the paragraph above, but\nwhile deciding the matter at hand in a holistic manner, each aspect shall be\nconsidered in detail. From the above discussion, it is noted that information\nhad been denied initially by the CPIO vide letter dated 17.07.2018 invoking\nprovisions under <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8 (1) (a)</a>, (f) and (h) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">RTI Act, 2005</a>. In this\nregard, it is worthwhile to note that all three exemptions claimed by the PIO, in\nthis case are such that it casts no obligation on the public authority to provide\ninformation exempt under these provisions. This position of law has been\nelucidated by the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench while deciding a case\nPIO, CM&#x27;s Office, Civil Secrtariat, Govt. of UP vs. State Information Commission\nand Others as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">    &quot;...The perusal of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> reveals that there are\n    certain information contained in sub-clause (a),(b),(c),(f),(g) and (h), for\n    which there is no obligation for giving such an information to any citizen,\n    whereas information protected under sub- clauses( d),( e) and( )j are\n    though protected information, but on the discretion and satisfaction of the\n    competent authority, that it would be in larger public interest to disclose\n    such information, such information can be disclosed...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">Having noted the above, it cannot be overlooked that every denial of\ninformation should be adequately supported by reason, which the PIO has\nfailed to do in his reply dated 17.07.2018.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">For the sake of convenience, the contents of <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8(1)(a)</a>, (f), (h) and (j) of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">RTI Act</a> 2005 are reproduced hereunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">   8.

The <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8(1)(h)</a> of the RTI Act as noted above exempts\ndisclosure of information which would impede the process of investigation or\napprehension or prosecution of offenders, the Act, does not define either the\nterm &quot;investigation&quot; or &quot;process of investigation&quot;. Information sought in this\ncase pertains to the extradition enquiry which is governed by the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_30\">Code of\nCriminal Procedure</a>, which makes a distinction between an &quot;investigation&quot;,\n&quot;inquiry&quot; and &quot;trial&quot; and all the three terms denote three different stages of a\ncriminal case. The first stage is reached when a police officer investigates into a\ncase. After completing the investigation, when the case is sent to a Magistrate,\nthe next stage begins, which is either an inquiry or a trial. It is pertinent to note\nthat the Apex Court in the <a href=\"/doc/1013766/\" id=\"a_31\">Directorate of Enforcement Vs. Deepak Mahajan</a> (AIR\n1994 SC 1775), has held that the word &quot;investigation&quot; cannot be limited only to\npolice investigation but includes the &quot;investigation&quot; carried on by any agency\nwhether he be a police officer or empowered or authorized officer invested with\nthe power of investigation. The expression &quot;inquiry&quot; as defined under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_32\">Code\nof Criminal Procedure</a> is of wide import and thus, the term &quot;investigation‟ used\nin <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 8(1)(h)</a>, in the context of this Act should be interpreted broadly and\nliberally, wherein the term &quot;investigation&quot; would mean all actions of law\nenforcement, disciplinary proceedings, enquiries, adjudications and so on.\nLogically, no investigation could be said to be complete unless it has reached a\npoint where the final decision on the basis of that investigation is taken, i.e.\nonly after the final decision has been arrived at after the matter has gone\nthrough all the stages of appeals and revisions as well as a final decision about\nprosecuting or not prosecuting that person has been taken by an appropriate\ncompetent authority. Therefore, no infirmity is found with denial of information\nabout a case which is pending investigation before a Court and to which the\nAppellant is not a party.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                          Page 7 of 11</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1355531\" id=\"span_14\">The query 1 raised by the Appellant is clearly exempt from disclosure as has\nbeen discussed in the Apex Court decision of <a href=\"/doc/1355531/\" id=\"a_34\">Khanapuram Gandaiah vs.\nAdministrative Officer &amp; Ors</a> [dated 4 January, 2010] in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">    &quot;...... an applicant under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 6</a> of the RTI Act can get any\n    information which is already in existence and accessible to the public\n    authority under law.

The ratio as recorded in the two\n    concurring judgments of 26 (2017) 10 SCC 1 the learned judges (R.F.\n    Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul, JJ.) are similar. It is observed that\n    privacy involves a persons right to his physical body; right to\n    informational privacy which deals with a persons mind; and the right\n    to privacy of choice which protects an individuals autonomy over\n    personal choices. While physical privacy enjoys constitutional\n    recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a>, personal\n    informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a> and right to privacy of\n    choice is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_48\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25 of the\n    Constitution. In the concurring opinion, there is a reference to The\n    Right to Privacy by Samuel Warren and Louis D. Brandeis on an\n    individuals right to control the dissemination of personal information\n    and that an individual has a right to limit access to such\n    information/shield such information from unwarranted access.\n    Knowledge about a person gives another power over that person, as\n    personal data collected is capable of effecting representations in his\n    decision making process and shaping behaviour which can have a\n    stultifying effect on the expression of dissent which is the cornerstone\n    of democracy. In the said concurring judgment, it has been further\n    held that the right to protection of reputation from being unfairly\n    harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only against falsehood but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                        Page 9 of 11</span>\n     also against certain truths by observing: 623. An individual has a\n    right to protect his reputation from being unfairly harmed and such\n    protection of reputation needs to exist not only against falsehood but\n    also certain truths. It cannot be said that a more accurate judgment\n    about people can be facilitated by knowing private details about their\n    lives people judge us badly, they judge us in haste, they judge out of\n    context, they judge without hearing the whole story and they judge\n    with hypocrisy. Privacy lets people protect themselves from these\n    troublesome judgments...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_21\">After a detailed discussion on the aspect of privacy of an individual, which is\nsought to be protected under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, the Apex Court in\nthe same decision of CPIO, Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_50\">Of India vs. Subhash Chandra\nAgarwal</a> held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">    &quot;59.
