The respondents were the defendants in the suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\t\t2. The plaintiff filed the suit in  C.S.No.157 of 2001  for claiming  damages of Rs.10,00,001/- and for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from repeating or   publishing further libel against the plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\t\t3.  The brief case of the plaintiff is as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\t(i) According to the plaintiff, the second defendant is a publication said to be focussing on business and economics  and the first defendant is the Editor of the second  defendant; that in the issue for the period from 30.8.2000 to 14.9.2000, the first defendant falsely and maliciously printed and published about the plaintiff, his family and his profession.   According to the plaintiff, the said  article purporting to be a comment on the affairs of the company viz., M/s.Addisons Paints &amp; Chemicals Limited, but, in substance it defamed the plaintiff and his family members and  it had injured and lowered his reputation and the members of his family.   On  29.9.2000, the plaintiff had sent a letter  calling upon the defendants to publish the said letter, but there was no response.   Therefore, the plaintiff  issued a lawyer&#x27;s notice dated 3.11.2000  calling upon the defendants to tender unconditional apology for the defamatory allegations published in the edition for the period from 30.8.2000 to 14.9.2000 and also to publish the letter. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t\t(ii) According to the plaintiff, the defendants had made further defamatory allegations against the plaintiff in the issue dated 3.11.2000 for which the  plaintiff sent a rejoinder   reiterating that the allegations made against the plaintiff are defamatory in nature. Further, according to the plaintiff, the intention of the defendants is not to make any fair comment on the performance of the company, but a deliberate attempt to injure the reputation of the plaintiff and his family members and the defendants are aware that the article would  not only lower the esteem and reputation of the plaintiff among the general public, particularly, the people in the corporate sector, but also would cause anguish and mental suffering to him.   In these circumstances,  the plaintiff   filed the suit claiming for damages   and for permanent injunction.\n</blockquote>\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\t\t4. The brief case of the defendants are as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t\t (i) According to the defendants, there is no cause of action for filing the suit;  that the plaintiff failed to  clarify as to which part of the article was defamatory or injured his  reputation.  Further, according to the defendants, the plaintiff had not objected as to what the defendants has stated in the article, but his grievance was that the comment ought to have been made against the Board of Directors.   \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t\t(ii) According to the defendants,  they never attacked the plaintiff personally or caused injury to him and  that the  said article is a fair comment on the poor performance of a 50 years old reputed company that pioneered the production of paints in the country.  The said article was published only after thorough investigation made by the defendants.  The said article did not attack the capacity  or the character of the plaintiff and it only pointed to the management the lacunae that resulted in poor growth of M/s.Addisons Paints &amp; Chemicals Limited and there was no malicious intention to publish the   article.  In these circumstances, the defendants prayed for dismissal of the suit.\t\n</blockquote>\t\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">\t\t5.  In the suit, on the side of the plaintiff, he was examined  as P.W.1 and 5 documents  Exs.P-1 to P-5 were marked and on the side of the defendants, first  defendant  was examined as D.W.1 and one S.Nagarajan was examined as D.W.2 and 10 documents Exs.D-1 to     D-10 were marked.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\t\t6.  The learned single Judge, after taking into consideration the oral and documentary evidences of both sides, dismissed the suit.  Aggrieved over the judgment and decree passed in C.S.No.157 of 2001, the plaintiff has filed the above appeal.\n</p>  \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t\t7. Heard  Mr.Ravi  learned counsel  appearing for the appellant and  Mr.C.Ramakrishna,  learned counsel appearing for the  respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\t\t8. On a careful consideration of the materials available on record and  the  submissions made by both  the  counsels, the points that emerge for consideration in this appeal are whether the publication effected by the defendants on 30.8.2000 and 30.11.2000 amount  to libel or  it is a fair comment that are true in substance and in fact, the opinion or comment expressed regarding the performance of the  companies was done in good faith based on facts and the information received and believed to be true and there was no intention to harm the reputation of the plaintiff and that it is a fair  comment made  by the defendants to serve the   public interest.  Since the points that arose for consideration in this appeal are based on the publication  effected by the defendants on 30.8.2000 and 30.11.2000, it is relevant  to extract the publication( as extracted in the plaint), which reads as follows:- \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\tThe publication effected on 30.8.2000 reads as follows:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t&quot;There are other headaches for Sivasailam and his family.  These relate to the legal battle waged by a section of shareholders of the Amalgamation Group - the progeny of Sivasailam&#x27;s Sister Kalyani Sundaram.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\tShankar Sundaram, nephew of Sivasailam, worked for a few years as Executive Assistant to Sivasailam.  His father K.S.Sundaram,  brother-in-law of Sivasailam, was given the charge of Addisons  Paints &amp; Chemicals Ltd (APC), one of the earliest manufacturing units of the  Amalgamations Group that celebrated its golden jubilee in 1998.  Sundram and his family members have been managing APC and having not been associated with the other unit companies, several  of which have been growing rapidly.  Both Shanker and his sister Lakshmi, have had the benefit of good education but have not been utilized effectively by Sundaram in expanding APC.  In the Fifties and the Sixties, the Spartan brand of paints produced by APC was on the top.   APC had enjoyed excellent custom among Industrial and Domestic Consumers of paints, ahead of Asian Paints and even ICI.  While other pain companies grew by leaps and bounds improving on technology, introducing new products and focusing on high quality management, APC just languished.   Imagine a 50 year old company which had all the advantages of the first comer and a good brand image, not even building a turnover of Rs.50 crore over 50 years!  Poor attention was paid to technology and marketing.  Inbreeding was also witnessed by Sundaram setting paint manufacturing units on his own.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\tReichhold Chemicals was imaginatively conceived by founder Anantharamakrihnan as a unit allied to APC that would produce resins.  It was expected  to build strengths in the field of chemicals, but became a drag and was sold off to the Mallayas in the Eighties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\tThe Sundarams are staking a claim for a higher share in the management and control of the Amalgamations Group.  But corporate, like other democratic institutions, are governed by the 50 plus 0.1 per cent control that is crucial determinant.  With the other principal share-holders of the family, Sivasailam, Krishnamoorthy and Seetha Venkataramani remaining together, the Sundarams have have to be content with the dividends on their share of holdings.  And this is not inconsiderable, looking at the flourish of most of the unit companies.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The publication effected on 30.11.2000 reads as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t&quot; We commented on the poor  performance of Addison&#x27;s paints and Chemicals (Spartan  non-shine, IE 30 August 2000) and concluded that a demoralized workforce, a listless dealer network and poor public relations did not win for the Sundrams much support form vital quarters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\tWe forget to include in this another vital factor: in diferent or even hostile media relations.  K.S.Sundaram, who has been functioning as the Chief Operating Officer of APC, has helped us correct this omissions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\tSundaram has been known for his penchant for litigation.  He has  been merrily instituting proceedings against all the sundry, including the Chairman of the Holding Company, Amalgamations!\n\n\tA Yen for vituperation and litigation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\tA landlord \u0016 turned businessman, Sundaram also has a yen for vituperation.  In a rejoinder to our comments, he has bad-mouthed not just us it is an occupational hazard that a Newspaper is subjected to and so nothing unusual but also illiberally the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Company of which APC is a part.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\tHe blames the Board for on-performance. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">\tSundaram has been employed by APC for over four decades; he had been the director and General Manager during 1970-90 and has been the Chief Operating Officer since, entrusted  with the responsibilities of managing the company.  Yet he disclaims any responsibility for the dismal performance of the Company under his charge for three decades!\n\t\n\tWe do admit that a Board is responsible for direction, supervision and control of operations; but we also believe that a fabulously paid Chief Executive  who has enjoyed handsome salaries, parks and other privilegs associated with the Post of a Chief Executive of a corporate unit (which we gather, include paid holidays in India and abroad for himself and his family). Cannot  so glibly wash his hands off the responsibility for results.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\tWhen the accomplished Chief executive of Tata Chemicals, D. Manu Seth, led the Company  into much reduced levels of performance , he had  no alternative  to quitting.  This, despite the esteem earned by his father Darbari Seth who took the Company to great heights in his long tenure.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\tBut blood is thicker than water.  It should be the only explanation for Chairman Sivasailam to have permitted Sundaram to continue to hold office, despite the dismal record.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\tLook at the performance, after 50 long years.  APC reached a turnover  of rs.38 crore with meagre profits, poor public image and dismal customer orientation.  In spite of being the neighbor to Tractors and Farm Equipment (TAFE) another unit company of the same group, TAFE has not been a regular customer of APC.  Quite significantly, the large cluster of automobile manufactures in tamil Nadu do not use APC paints for their original finish. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\tLook at Asian Paints, Goolass Nerolac...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">\tFor what real growth can be, look at APC&#x27;s contemporary.  Asian Paints; Sales for 1999-2000 Rs.1342 crore after tax profit Rs.97.34. Crore net worth Rs.357.40 crore.  Over a dozen units operate overseas. Employer remunerationd and benefits extended during the year were clsoe to Rs.60 crore.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\tOr look at the other paint major, Goolass Nerolac Paints, which and sales of Rs.605 Crore for 1999-2000 on which it earned Rs.30 crore as after tax profit.  Employee remuneration and benefits were close to Rs.35 crore or nearly the total turnover of APC.   Noteworthy was at Rs.186 crore.  The gearing was ow with loan funds accounting for just Rs.54 Crore.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\tSundaram  lists various successes, despite severe constrains.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\t* From 1970 onwards, the group was ravaged by violent and disruptive labour unrest by which a highly competitive Company like Addison&#x27;s paints could to retain the share of the market for roe than a decade he states.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\tWhile strained industrial relatiosn did affect perfromance in the early Seventies, the group has been free from disruption to work from IR problems for over 25 years.  And other unis of the group like TAFE Simpsons, India Pistons ... bound by common IR  Polices had recorder spectacular growth during this period.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t*That Sundaram and his team have been actively engaged in this period of inactivity in computerisation of the systems.  Sundaram claims that even today the extent to which computer applications had been made productive in APC is unparalleled with  any other Company in the group!\n\tBut such wonderful work done doesn&#x27;t seem to be reflected in the performance of the Company? - \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\tSundaram should share this  success story, a well kept secret, for the benefit of the units of the group ad the industry.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t*From 835 employees at the time Sundaram took   as director and general manger, he workforce has been reduced steadily to 385 at present.  Proposals were given to cut this down further to 93 without impairing the productive capacity but would ensure substantial profits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\tDownsizing has been the inexorable accompaniment of the pressures of productivity increases.  The reduction in emplyee strength has been massive in other unit companies like Simpsons, India Pistons as indeed at other engineering units in India and abroad. Done for sheer survival. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"> \tSundaram did make his own contribution by way of making the life miserable for some of the senior  managring a few to his own units.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t*Sundaram claims: Asian paints achieved 1.7447 time funds employed for sales achieved.  Whereas Addisons Paints achieved 2.3765 time funds employed for the turnover reached.  Sundaram should ask Omkar Goswami, who recently made a brilliant analysis in the Business Standard on the performance of the top four companies in the paint industry.  Of course, APC was nowhere in reckoning.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">Sundram resents even the comparison with TAFE.  He accuses Sivasailam of abusing his position as Chairman of the group to plough several crores into TAFE but spending only a small fraction on APC.  Of course, TAFE is a vehicle manufacturer and the sales and profits earned by it bear no comparison to the less sophisticated low technology units of the APC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">A ludicrous claim...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">Sundaram also makes the ludicrous claim that the wages paid by Addisons paints has been kept almost more than twice those of Asian Paints in any year.  We do not know of any senior management professional at the helm at APC receiving fat salaries.  But the annual report of Asian Paints for 1999-2000 lists 131 names who were in receipt of remuneration of not less than Rs.600,000 per year (or Rs.50,000 per month).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">Sundaram has no compunction in decrying some  of his senior managers: &quot;the expertise available from chief chemist P.K..S.Mani (who was a respected manager for years), was not sufficient; export of paint products made to a Yugoslavian tractor company had to be taken back at a considerable loss as the product failed to meet the specification. ..\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;Business from Hindustan Motors came to a grinding halt, due to imperfection of goods supplied. . The formulation for synthetic washable distemper met with a total failure&quot; states Sundaram.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">Do you have many instances of a chief executive so facilely blaming  his lieutenants for his company&#x27;s failures?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Of course Sundaram also points  to he &#x27;few silver-linings such as the appreciation received on the quality of paint supplied to the Ford truck project&#x27;.   He points with pride: &quot; our paint products that are not complained off even today!&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">Sundaram know the chequered history of the Ford truck project of Simpsons.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">For one, it was again a captive custom, provided courtesy Sivasailam. Secondly, the order was too meagre to attract competition; 3000 trucks assembled and sold over a decade.  We had the parallel in Standard Motors assembling Gazel cars in the late seventies: after making advance from a couple of dozen clients, the company would go about buying parts and paints from the  market.  The volume was too small to source directly from a large manufacturer. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">... and he is so modest\nSundarm also gives himself kudos for the glittering  export performance in 1999-2000  the company  earned Rs.19.82 lakhs from exports  on a turnover of Rs.38 crore.  He didn&#x27;t mention the expenditure incurred on winning such handsome custom built over 50 years of leadership.  And the several foreign trips made to win such large custom.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">Sundaram also refers to the constraints under which his  son Shankar had to perform.  Significantly, the unit  put under the charge of Shjanker Madras Hi-tech Circuits for the production of printed circuit boards for exports, at MEPZ was sick right at birth and remains  closed.  Reichhold Chemicals that pioneered production of synthetic resins in the state, was put under the charge of Shankar.  It did not flourish and was  later sold off to UBPP.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">Sundaram did set up other units ;on his own.  Tamarabarani Surface Coating (TSC) was set up in Pondicherry to produce paints.  The infrastructure of APC was liberally used for technology, market support and even finance.  It remains closed.  Another unit Aditya Paints, was set up by the family and of course, ti competes with APC:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">When he had full control ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">Sundaram&#x27;s family had bigger ambitions.  Tamarabarani Dies and Tools Ltd (TDT)  was founded as a company to make fine cutting tools.  An investment of around Rs.5 crore was made.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">The unit was set up with Japanese plant and machinery.  IDBI was the principal lender.  The equipment suppliers also liberally sold tools and dies estimated  to be required for the first 10 years. The capacity created is stated to be much more than total requirements of India!  The company had not been able to produce tools and dies to quality and at costs that are competitive.  Suppliers from Ludhiana have been able to win custom at much lower prices.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">Admittedly the technology i sophisticated.  Wafer thin, hard diamond tools must have fine holes to rigid specifications that would permit the drawing of wires to strict standards.  Applications such as production  of filaments, demand micron-finish profiles.  The failure to make the tools and dies to such rigid specifications has burdened the company with dozens of such dies and tools as idle inventory. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">The company tried to develop export markets in Germany.  But the Germans found the quality poor.   Left with no alternative to use the capacity the company offered to supply semi-finished tools and  dies.  But the German importers liberally deducted the German cost of finishing these from the rock bottom prices quoted!  This effectively meant the company not recovering even the cost.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">Desperate to keep production going, he company accepted he low prices.  Obviously, the specifications  were highly technical and tight and the management was not equal to dealing with the importer with expertise and global experience.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">This experience is common for several industrial units putting money in manufacturing capabilities without employing quality manpower to tackle technical issues and not having adequate resources to invent continuously in technology.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">Today, TDT is sick and remains closed and has been brought before the BIFR.  The Board, after detailed enquiries, has directed the winding up of TDT.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">The management has filed a petition before the Appellate tribunal requesting for a revision of the order.  The promoters have extended personal guarantees.  With eh threat of financial institutions revoking the personal guarantees, the promoters have been desperately trying to claim insurance reliers.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">... but  it failed in every aspect. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">TDT failed in every aspect; of bad project  preparation, machinery, quality, pricing and marketing. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">Amalgamations did set up a  unit, L.M.Van\nMoppes Diamond Tools India Ltd, for the manufacture of diamond cutting tools.  The group also runs Addison and Company  that manufactures  twist drills and other cutting tools.  Neither of these units has been flourishing  on a sustained basis.  Like most of the other units of the group, These have been modest-sized operations meeting some specific orders, Sundarams should have known the limitations  of the industry and the level of sophistication demanded.  How strange they should have rushed into an industry where others with better resource, both financial and technical, feat to tread!\t\n\n\tAfter all Sundarams had similar experience in regard to Madras Hi-tech Circuits going to the BIFR: for he same mistakes-equipment inadequacies, lack of familiarity with technology and poor marketing capabilities.\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">\tSurely the Sundarams  had all he freedom to perform with no constraints of an unhelpful board.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">When leadership is thrust on family members ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">\tUnfortunately, in many family owned-businesses, there is so much of overlapping of ownership and management functions.  Plum posts are  routinely thrust on scions of the family or close relatives, often without concern for managerial or leadership capabilities.    In a controlled economy, with limited production capacities and limited  competition and a big leeway for pricing, here has no been much of a demand for high professional calibre.  There was place in any sector for the big, the efficient, the small and even the inefficient ones.  Look at a Dyanora or a Solidaire which could survive and even flourish for  some 15 years with nothing more than a screw driver technology!&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">\t\t9. As per the article dated 30.8.2000,  M/s.Addisons Paints &amp; Chemicals Limited (&#x27;APC&#x27;)  which is wholly owned subsidiary                 of  the Amalgamations Limited,  which was started by late              Shri. AnanthaC.Ramakrishna is one of the earliest manufacturing units of the Amalgamations Group  that celebrated golden jubilee in the year 1999 and that it was managed by  the appellant/plaintiff and his family members.  It is commented that  in spite of    good education,  they have not been utilized effectively by the appellant/plaintiff in expanding &#x27;APC&#x27;.  According to the author, the reason for  the  poor performance of  the company  is lack of attention to technology and marketing and inbreeding,  as the appellant/plaintiff   had set up a separate paint manufacturing units of his own.   Further,  it is commented that the other principal shareholders of the family viz.,  A.Sivasailam, brother-in-law of the appellant/plaintiff, Krishnamurthy and Seetha Venkataraman had remained together and the appellant/plaintiff had to   content with the dividends on their share   holdings.    It is also stated  that  the Indian Companies, operating in a controlled environment, especially in the south, never had a customer orientation and refers to the narration of experience purported to have been made by a prominent dealer of paints who had said that they never had an occasion to meet the top brass of Addisons Paints  and the dealer meets are rare.  Further, it is   commented that  demoralized work force,   listless dealer network and poor public relations are the reasons for the poor performance of &#x27;APC&#x27;.   According to the appellant/plaintiff, the entire article published on 30.8.2000 is  defamatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">\t\t10. Mr.Ravi, learned counsel appearing for the appellant/plaintiff further submitted that the  personal allegations  made against  the appellant/plaintiff are  defamatory and the alleged comments on the performance of the company does not reflect the fair comment and only touches upon the character and capacity of the plaintiff as Managing Director and his family members. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">\t\t11. After the publication  on 30.8.2000, the appellant/plaintiff sent Ex.P-2 reply dated 29.9.2000 calling upon the respondents/defendants to publish the same.   The reply sent by the appellant/plaintiff was not published and further,  there was no response on the side of the respondents/defendants.   Since there was no response from the respondents, the appellant sent a  legal notice dated 3.11.2000  calling upon the respondents/defendants to tender unconditional apology.  In spite of the said  notice, the respondents/defendants published another article marked as Ex.P-4 on 30.11.2000, which is extracted above.   According to the appellant, by publishing both the articles it would clearly show that the respondents were bent upon in attacking the appellant/plaintiff personally thus causing injury to him.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">\t\t12. The learned counsel appearing  for the appellant/plaintiff   contended that by the publication of  the articles, the estimation in the mind of the people about the plaintiff  has lowered.  The learned counsel appearing  for the appellant in support of his contention, relied upon the following judgments: \n</p>\t \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1676091\" id=\"span_1\">(i) 1910 ILR 37 CAL 760   (<a href=\"/doc/1676091/\" id=\"a_1\">The Englishman, Ltd. v.

No doubt the fair and accurate report of a speech made in Parliament is privileged, even though it contains facts defamatory to the plaintiff.

Further, the  Bench held that in order to give effect  to the threshold of seriousness, they preferred definition of a &quot;defamatory&quot; publication was one which affected in an adverse manner the attitudes of people  towards the claimant, or had a tendency so to do. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1778766\" id=\"span_4\">(v)  In 1909 ILR 36 CAL 1883  (<a href=\"/doc/1778766/\" id=\"a_4\">Lajpat rAi v.

The doctrine of fair comment is based on the hypothesis  that the publication question  is one which, broadly speaking, is true in fact, and is not made to satisfy a personal vendetta; and further that the facts stated therein are such as would go to serve the public interest.  In England the law of fair comment has been stated thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\tThe defence of fair comment requires that the material fact or facts on which the comment or criticism is based should be rule stated and be a matter of public interest, the comment on  fact or facts should be fair within the wide limits which the law allows; ...

In so far as he does that he serves a social purpose for  by exposing the evils of the community or its servants to the public  gaze he seeks to create a climate of opinion for their eradication.

Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>)  wherein  the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court held as follows:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">&quot;28. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21.</a> It is a \u0013right to be let alone\u0014. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent \u0017 whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above \u0017 indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_10\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_11\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions to this rule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">(4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and institutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain a suit for damages for defaming them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">(5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_12\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or any similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the press or media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">(6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_8\">(v)  AIR 1962 SC 305    (<a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_13\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v.

Further, according to the defendants, the Industrial Economist, a responsible magazine is concerned with the inconsistent performance of the corporate.

DW.2 has stated  that the appellant    took over as Managing Director of  the company in the year 1968 and  he exhibited undue hostility towards the  employees  and that  various incidents had crept in, which resulted in passing of an award by the labour court in favour of the employees.  D.W.2 further stated that only after 1968 the company was in a  deterioration mode  due to the poor  management.  Further, most of the senior technical staff, who were back bone of the unit, left the company, during his tenure.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">\t\t18. According to D.W.2,  the Company Law Board objected the contention of the Company for the appellant&#x27;s  re-appointment as Managing Director after 1990 holding that he has failed to pass the growth performance test and that he was not a fit and proper person to hold the post in public interest, however, just before the receipt of the order, the appellant/plaintiff got himself appointed as President of the company and since then there has been no Managing Director. D.W. 2  had also stated that the  company rated as one among the top three units in the country in the 1960s and the company  had gradually deteriorated under the leadership of the appellant and the article published by the respondents/defendants had brought about  the real facts about the appellant/plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">\t19. According to the respondents,   the articles published in  the magazine  are  fair and bonfide comment in the interest of the public.  Though the appellant had extracted the  publication made by the defendants in the magazine on 30.8.2000 and 30.11.2000 in the plaint, he has not pointed out any particular passage or word  that is said to be defamatory.  In fact, he  had admitted in  the proof affidavit that the article published by the respondents is a comment made by them on the affairs of the Company.   In the text book Gatley on Libel and slander, the words libel and slander are stated as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">\t&quot;Libel and slander.  Defamation is committed when the defendant publishes to a third person words or matter containing an untrue imputation against the reputation of the claimant.  Broadly speaking, if the publication is made in a permanent form or is broadcast or is  part of theatrical performance, it is libel; if in some transient form, it is slander.  The most important distinction between the two is that libel is actionable per se the law presumes that some damage will flow from it; for the publication of a slander to be actionable, on the other hand, some special damage must be proved to flow from it, unless it falls within certain specified categories.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\tIn Halsbury&#x27;s Las of England, Simonds Edn., Vol.24, page 8 in Sub<a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_27\"> S. 3</a> of the section &quot; Libel and Slander, &quot; it is observed that if the occasion was a privileged one, express or actual malice might have to be proved.  The precise form in which this is put is :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">\t&quot; If the occasion is such that there was either a duty or right to make the publication, it is said that the occasion rebuts the presumption of malice, but the malice ( which here means malice in fact, or as it is technically called, express or actual malice) may be proved. &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">\t\t20. On a reading of the above passage it is clear that if  the  publication is made in a permanent form or is broadcast or is  part of theatrical performance, it is libel; if in some transient form, it is slander.  The  distinction between libel and slander is that libel is actionable per se the law presumes that some damage will flow from it; for the publication of a slander to be actionable, on the other hand, some special damage must be proved to flow from it, unless it falls within certain specified categories. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">\t\t21. It is also pertinent to note that on the side of the appellant/ plaintiff, except his own evidence, he has not examined any other independent witness to prove his case.  In the reply sent by the appellant on 29.9.2000 to the first respondent, the appellant has not specifically denied about the poor performance of the company.  Further, he had stated that the performance of the company cannot be linked to an individual, but to the Board of Directors.   He has also stated  many things about the   Board of Directors and  the President.  It is not in dispute that the appellant&#x27;s brother-in-law viz., A.Sivasailam was  the Chairman of the company.  According to the appellant, there was    family dispute between him and the Chairman of the Company  viz., A.Sivasailam.  Further, in the said reply, the appellant had personally attacked A.Sivasailam on many aspects.   On a reading of the  reply sent by the  appellant on 29.9.2000,  one could understand that the appellant had only tried to settle  his personal scores with A.Sivasailam.  When the publication made by the respondents are with regard to the performance of the company and its  poor management which resulted in deterioration  of the company, the  appellant had made personal allegations against the Chairman of the Company viz., A.Sivasailam which according to us, was not in good taste.     Further, the appellant had called upon the  respondents/ defendants to publish the reply notice in their magazine which was not done by the respondents.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">\t22. The judgments relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant relate  to defamatory and libel articles.  As already stated, the appellant has not pleaded specifically in the plaint that a particular portion published by the respondents are defamatory.  Further, in order to establish that the articles published by the respondents are defamatory, the appellant  ought to have pleaded and proved that the articles published by the respondents are defamatory and libel.  On a reading of the articles published by the respondents, it is clear that the respondents have made comments with  regard to the poor performance of the company, which the appellant had not denied in his reply dated 29.9.2000.   The poor management by the appellant is also evident from the letter dated  21.6.1990 from  the Ministry of Department of Company Affairs to the appellant/plaintiff rejecting the proposal   to re-appoint the appellant as Managing Director holding that  he is not a fit and proper person for re-appointment.  Aggrieved over the order passed by the Ministry of Department of Company Affairs, the appellant preferred a Writ Petition in W.P.No.13455 of 1990 before this court and the same was  dismissed.  As  against the order in the said writ petition,  the appellant   has preferred an appeal in W.A.No.503 of 1999 and a Division Bench of this court also dismissed the writ appeal and confirmed the order of the learned single Judge thereby confirming the order passed on   21.6.1990 by the Ministry of Department of Company Affairs .  Therefore, it is proved  that the appellant was not appointed as Managing Director of the company after 1990 since it was found that he is not a fit and proper person.   By examining D.W.2, the respondents established that the company was in a   deterioration mode after  the appellant  became the Managing Director in the year 1968.   The appellant being the plaintiff failed to establish his case that the contents of the articles published by the respondents are false and that the company was performing well during his tenure as Managing Director.  In the reply dated 29.9.2000, the appellant not only made several unwarranted personal attacks against A.Sivasailam but also made some damaging remarks against the magazine  stating that when the appellant wanted to get  a copy of the edition carrying the article, none was available in any stationery mart or in leading magazine vendor  and that finally,  a copy was traced with a waste paper merchant, who was carrying on his business for recycling paper from the trash purchased by him periodically from the lot discarded by people as useless, waste and thrown into the garbage to be ridden quickly.  However, the said   contention  of the appellant that a copy of the magazine was obtained only from the waste paper merchant  was not established by any means.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">\t\t23. In the article published on 30.11.2000, the respondents based on analysis conducted with regard to the company gave a elaborate details with regard to the performance of the company.  If the comments made by the respondents in the magazine are personal,  one can understand  that the article would defame the reputation of that particular individual.   In the  present case, the articles published  by the respondents relates only to the performance of the company and its  deterioration in the performance by the poor management of the appellant.  Therefore, the article published by the respondents cannot be termed as defamatory against the appellant. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">\t\t24.  In the Judgment relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  respondents in U.S  Supreme Court Reports 11 L ed 2d (referred supra),   the U.S. Supreme Court clearly held that  the  proposition has disquieting implications for criticism of governmental conduct and for good reason, no court of last resort in that country has ever held, or even suggested, that prosecutions for libel on government have any place in the American system of jurisprudence.   In the present case, the respondents have  only  criticized the poor management of the company and not the  individual in their articles published in their Magazine.  The  fair criticism  of system of administration of justice or functioning of institutions or authorities entrusted with the task of deciding rights of the parties gives an opportunity to the operators of the system/institutions to remedy the wrong and also bring about improvements.  The articles  published by the  respondents are  only  for the interest of the public  and for improving the performance of the company.   Therefore, we are of the a considered view that the publication  of the articles by the respondents  are only fair comments   on a matter of public interest.  When the respondents justified  the contents of the articles by establishing that the contents are fair comments  on a matter of public interest, the articles published by them cannot be termed as defamatory against the appellant.   It is needless to say that with regard  to the liberty of the Press  and fundamental right to freedom of  speech, the right is protected  under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India.  However,  the   Constitution itself has prescribed certain limits for the exercise of the freedom of speech and expression and this Court is only called upon to see whether a particular case comes within these limits.   The said point does not arise in this case  since we are of the view  that the articles published by the respondents are fair comments made by them in the interest of the public. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\"> \t\t25. Since the articles published by the respondents are only the comments with regard to the performance of the company, there cannot be any libel.  Further, there is no motive for the respondents for  publishing the articles as against the  appellant.  If the impugned articles  complained of are justified as comment and the words also contain allegations of facts, the respondents are  required to prove that such allegations of facts are true and it is not sufficient for him to plead that they bonfidely  believed them to be true.  The distinction between comment and allegation of fact must always be borne in mind in determining that  the plea of fair comment can be sustained.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">\t\t26. Further, in the present case, the facts do not establish a personal animus for the writer to write the impugned articles against the appellant.   In the absence of any proof regarding the animus, we are of the view that the articles contain  only the fair comment on the performance of the company and not  any defamatory  statement as against  the appellant personally.  \n</p>\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">\t\t27. The judgments relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant   mainly relate  to the alleged defamatory articles published  by the respondents/defendants.   Since we are of the considered view that the articles contains only fair comment made by the respondents with regard to the performance of the company, the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant are not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">\t\t28. In the case on hand, after the receipt of the reply dated 29.9.2000,  the respondents published  another article on 30.11.2000 in answer to the notice given by the appellant seeking  unconditional apology from them for the remarks made in the first article dated 30.8.2000.  The second article   was published  on a privileged occasion for  the reason that the respondents    were  justifying their earlier comments made on 30.8.2000.  Therefore, the second article  was made by the respondents justifying their earlier comments  made by them with regard to the poor performance of the company.    The appellant/plaintiff failed to establish that the second article was made dishonestly or with any motive as against him.   In the absence of any proof with regard to the same, the article published on 30.11.2000 was made by the respondents and the same can constitute   qualified privilege.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">\t\t29. The contents of the second article dated 30.11.200 is justified by the language used by he appellant/plaintiff in his letter dated 29.09.2000.  The malice in law which is presumed in every false and defamatory statements stands rebutted by a privileged occasion.   Further, it was not proved by the appellant  that there was misunderstanding  or  strained relationship between him  and the respondents.   In the absence of any proof,   with regard to the strained relationship   or ill feeling between  the appellant and the respondents, no ulterior motive can be attributed for the publications made by the respondents.   The appellant also miserably failed to establish his case  by adducing any acceptable evidence.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">\t\t30.  It is also settled principle of law  that the word &quot;malice&quot;   is used in the sense of an improper motive and that the burden of proof  lies only on  the appellant/plaintiff.  Here also, in the absence of any proof, no &quot;malice&quot; can be attributed for the articles published by the  respondents.  \n</p>\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">\t\t31. The learned single Judge, after taking into consideration the oral and documentary evidences of both side, has  rightly come to the conclusion that the  impugned articles dated 30.8.2000 and 30.11.2000 does not amount to libel and they are only   fair comments on the performance of the company. The learned single Judge has rightly dismissed the suit.     In these circumstances, we find no ground to interfere with the judgment and decree of the learned single Judge made in C.S.No.157 of 2001.  The   appeal  is liable to be dismissed.    Accordingly, the Original Side Appeal is dismissed.   Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is  closed.  However, there shall be no order as to costs. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">rj\n\n</p>","numcites":23,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":136029902,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"defamation","formInput":"defamation"},{"value":"article 19(2)","formInput":"article%2019%282%29"},{"value":" fair comments","formInput":"%20fair%20comments"},{"value":"freedom of speech","formInput":"freedom%20of%20speech"},{"value":"libel","formInput":"libel"},{"value":"slander","formInput":"slander"},{"value":"order vii rule 11","formInput":"order%20vii%20rule%2011"},{"value":"libel and slander","formInput":"libel%20and%20slander"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"defamatory statement","formInput":"defamatory%20statement"},{"value":"truth  filter:  malicious defamation","formInput":"truth%20%20filter%3A%20%20malicious%20defamation"},{"value":"unconditional apology","formInput":"unconditional%20apology"},{"value":"reporter  filter:  editors defamation civil suits","formInput":"reporter%20%20filter%3A%20%20editors%20defamation%20civil%20suits"},{"value":"asian paint","formInput":"asian%20paint"},{"value":"malice","formInput":"malice"},{"value":"defamatory","formInput":"defamatory"},{"value":"defamation  citedby: 493243","formInput":"defamation%20%20citedby%3A%20493243"},{"value":"slander  filter:  criminal defamation","formInput":"slander%20%20filter%3A%20%20criminal%20defamation"},{"value":"apology","formInput":"apology"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
