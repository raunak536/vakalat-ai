Amid his heady successes, and hectic travel, he\n            failed to see that his guru Shankar Dev was ailing,\n            increasingly unhappy and isolated in his own home,\n            Kripalu Bagh Ashram. For instance, Shankar Dev, who\n            was the convener of the Divya Yog Mandir Trust, was not\n            on the boards of any of the new companies that were set up\n            by Ramdev. But what Ramdev could not see, though it was\n            in plain sight, many in Haridwar saw. Several remember\n            the swiftly ageing Shankar Dev, ravaged by spinal\n            tuberculosis, becoming increasingly frail and forlorn. It\n            was when Ramdev was in Chicago that news came from\n            Kankhal On 14 July 2007, Shankar Dev disappeared.\n            Vanished without a trace. He left, that morning for his\n            usual walk and simply did not return. It may have been\n            devastating news for Ramdev. Or maybe it was just\n            &#x27;inconvenient timing. With the Chicago schedule drawing\n            to a close, Ramdev had to choose: Should he go on to\n            London, where the House of Commons planned to receive\n            and honour him, or should he send his regrets and rush\n            hack to Kankhal to lead the search for his missing guru?\n            Usually once a disciple takes deeksha, or initiation into the\n            sacred, from his guru, he establishes a bond with him.\n            Ramdev had not just taken deeksha from. Shankar Dev but\n            also accepted saffron robes from him -that is, he renounced\n            the world. From the moment he look the saffron robes from\n            Shankar Dev, that guru- shishya relationship was meant to\n            become the central fulcrum of his life. From that moment\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                               Page 12 of 211</span>\n             onward, Ramdev was supposed to consider his guru as his\n            spiritual and temporal father and mother.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            (ii) At page no. 110 of the book\n            The Cryptic Note Left Behind in Shankar Dev&#x27;s Room...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">            &quot;There is no way of knowing what Ramdev truly felt when\n            he heard of the disappearance or if he struggled with the\n            decision or for how long, but in the end he decided to carry\n            on with his tour. The day after his aides filed a missing\n            person&#x27;s report at Kankhal police station, on 18 July 2007,\n            Ramdev attended a ceremony at the British House of\n            Commons in his honour.

He\n            was seventy-seven years old.

When had he taken the loan? And\n            from whom? More importantly why did Ramdev, sitting\n            atop an empire worth at least Rs 100 crore, not repay the\n            loan Why did Shankar Dev not ask him for help? Or had\n            he? ...When Ramdev returned to India, more than three\n            weeks had passed since Shankar Dev&#x27;s disappearance. He\n            summoned a press conference in Haridwar, remembers the\n            Jansatta reporter and Haridwar resident Sunil Pandey. At\n            the press conference he was saying how Shankar Dev was\n            like a father to him and how sad it was ...

In his inimitable style, Ramdev welcomed the\n            investigation on the one hand, but also attacked the CBI\n            and the government, accusing them of a politically\n            motivated conspiracy to frame him in the case. Given the\n            sour relationship between Ramdev and the Union\n            government at that time, his allegation did have some\n            credence. Whatever the CBI&#x27;s initial motivations, it was\n            widely reported that it initiated a move to close the case in\n            December 2014 - by this time the Narendra Modi led\n            government had taken charge at the Centre -because the\n            agency had failed to make any headway. The special CBI\n            magistrate in Dehradun set the date for the next hearing as\n            12 January 2015 but this is where the public case file goes\n            cold.

Without his old Congress allies, and\n            their largess- land discounts, permissions, loan approvals-\n            Ramdev could not have become as powerful as he had in\n            the first place. &#x27;Yet when he realized the Congress was a\n            sinking ship and fell out with his earlier godfathers, he\n            negotiated a safe landing space with the VHP-RSS-BJP\n            combine. Smoothly, courageously, he abandoned the\n            Congress party,becoming part of the battering ram that\n            brought it down. Ramdev is said to have helped the BJP\n            with the 2014 general election campaign and is now\n            apparently reaping &#x27;rewards for that service. In May\n            2017, a Reuters article alleged that according to\n            (unpublished) documents examined by them, Ramdev has\n            received, 46 million dollars in land allocations and\n            discounts from BJP-led state governments.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">            (xix) Page 206:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">            &quot;When denied political domination, he chose to harness\n            politics to seek economic domination.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">            (xx) At Page 208:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">            &quot;Most important, is he willing to play by the rules of the\n            society he lives in and hold himself up to the laws that\n            ordinary businessmen have to adhere to?

The appellate court would\n              normally not be justified in interfering with\n              the exercise of discretion under appeal\n              solely on the ground that if it had considered\n              the matter at the trial stage it would have\n              come to a contrary conclusion. If the\n              discretion has been exercised by the Trial\n              Court reasonably and in a judicial manner\n              the fact that the appellate court would have\n              taken a different view may not justify\n              interference with the trial court&#x27;s exercise of\n              discretion.

The source of that\n       information has not been disclosed, therefore, the\n       respondents in this case have not specifically taken the\n       defence of truth. Of course, truth may be a defence to\n       action for defamation, but whether publication of all\n       truth about an individual particularly relating to his/her\n       personal life is in public interest or not is a larger\n       question that may arise.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       42. In balancing the two rights viz. the Right to Privacy\n       and the Right to Freedom of Speech, the element of\n       public interest is always based as a touch stone.

Similarly, there are several\n       other articles published by the respondents, which\n       suggest strained relationship between her and her\n       brother (who also happens to be a prominent\n       politician), some talk of her relationship between her\n       and a Police Officer, some attributing certain motives in\n       her meeting with a Union Minister and certain cartoons\n       and caricatures, which refer to the detention of the\n       applicant etc. Of course, the veracity of those statements\n       made in those articles or the question as to whether they\n       are defamatory in nature or not will have to be decided\n       only after trial, but at the same time the respondents, in\n       my considered opinion, cannot be allowed to go on\n       publishing articles, which do not relate to the public life\n       of the applicant, as a member of the parliament or as a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 65 of 211</span>\n        leader of the political party or as a daughter of the\n       former Chief Minister or as a sister of the former\n       Deputy Chief Minister.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_84\">43.

Laws J&#x27;s express linking of the public law\n              approach to Bonnard -v- Perryman has led, as I\n              have noted above, to the threshold for injunctions\n              restraining publication of reports of public\n              authorities to be set very high indeed. The cases in\n              which interim injunctions are granted in private\n              law defamation claims are vanishingly few.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">              Respectfully, however, I have serious reservations\n              as to whether setting the bar so high is still correct\n              or can be justified. i) Although the principle from\n              Bonnard -v- Perryman has been approved,\n              post<a href=\"/doc/87575/\" id=\"a_48\">Human Rights Act</a> 1998, by the Court of\n              Appeal in Greene -v- Associated Newspapers\n              [2005] QB 972, one of the bases of doing so was\n              that the determination of meaning (so often the\n              heart of a defamation claim) was reserved to the\n              jury ([57]). The Court distinguished the authority\n              of In re S (A Child), stressing ―the distinction\n              between a defamation case (where the claimant&#x27;s\n              right to a reputation has been put in issue and the\n              issue cannot be effectively resolved before the\n              trial) and a case which raises direct issues of\n              privacy or confidentiality‖ [79]-[81]. ii) Since the\n              decision in Greene, the right to trial by jury in\n              defamation claims has been removed (s.11\n              Defamation Act 2013). A key plank of the\n              justification for retaining the rule in Bonnard -v-\n              Perryman has therefore gone. In any event, when\n              an issue arises in public law proceedings\n              concerning the alleged publication of defamatory\n              statements, the matter has always been resolved by\n              a judge sitting alone and not by a jury. iii)\n              Application of the rule in Bonnard -v- Perryman\n              and (the equivalent, in public law) Vernons gives a\n              presumptive priority to <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 10 (freedom of\n              expression)</a> right over <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 8 (including the\n              right to reputation).</a> It has been held in private law\n              litigation that such presumptive priority is not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 78 of 211</span>\n               justifiable,   being    inconsistent     with     the\n              jurisprudence of the ECHR: Douglas -v- Hello!\n              Ltd [2001] QB 967 [133], [135] per Sedley LJ,\n              approved by the House of Lords in Campbell -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">              vMGN Ltd [2004] 2 AC 457 [55] per Lord\n              Nicholls; [111] per Lord Hope; [138]-[139] per\n              Baroness Hale and in In re S (A Child) [17] per\n              Lord Steyn.

This is partly\n                     due to the importance the court\n                     attaches to freedom of speech. It is\n                     partly because a judge must not\n                     usurp the constitutional function of\n                     the jury unless he is satisfied that\n                     there is no case to go to a jury.

From the above reasoning it follows that\n                 the Court will invariably not grant an interim\n                 injunction to restrain the publication of\n                 defamatory material as it would be\n                 unreasonable to fetter the freedom of speech\n                 before the full trial takes place, where each of\n                 the parties can argue in detail with the help of\n                 additional evidence. Similarly in this matter, it\n                 is incumbent IA No.9089/2010 in CS(OS)\n                 No.1407/2010 Page 18 upon this Court to\n                 decide whether it would be reasonable to fetter\n                 the reasonable criticism, comment, and parody\n                 directed at the plaintiff, which to a large extent\n                 is protected by the Constitutional guarantee to\n                 free speech, to all the citizens of India. This\n                 point of view was also strengthened by a recent\n                 challenge to the old common law rule of\n                 Bonnard in the case of Greene v. Associated\n                 Newspapers Limited, 2005 (1) All.ER. 30,\n                 where it was decided that if it is a known fact\n                 that the true validity of the defamation claims\n                 will only be tested at trial level then it would\n                 only be appropriate for the Court not to award\n                 an interim injunction to the plaintiffs as it\n                 would otherwise put an unreasonable burden\n                 on the concept of free speech. After an\n                 elaborate survey of the law on the issue, it was\n                 held that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">                       &quot;This survey of the caselaw shows\n                       that in an action for defamation a\n                       court will not impose a prior\n                       restraint on publication unless it is\n                       clear that no defence will succeed at\n                       the trial. This is partly due to the\n                       importance the court attaches to\n                       freedom of speech. It is partly\n                       because a judge must not usurp the\n                       constitutional function of the jury\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 87 of 211</span>\n                        unless he is satisfied that there is no\n                       case to go to a jury. The rule is also\n                       partly founded on the pragmatic\n                       grounds that until there has been\n                       disclosure of documents and cross-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">                       examination at the trial a court\n                       cannot safely proceed on the basis\n                       that what the defendants wish to say\n                       is not true.

Press has to exercise care\n              and caution while reporting about matters under\n              investigation or pending trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">              98.

It was further submitted on behalf of the author that\nfurthermore, where a portion of publication or sentence is not\ndefamatory per se, it is obligatory upon the Plaintiff, in addition to\npleading the allegedly defamatory portion, to plead the innuendo or\nthe secondary meaning and that on a meaningful reading of the plaint\nas submitted on behalf of the author it was contended that neither was\nthere a specific pleading to which portion of the BOOK was alleged\nto be defamatory nor was the alleged defamatory innuendo pleaded\nand that thus there was no cause of action whatsoever for the grant of\nany injunction as claimed by the Petitioner. Inter alia it was submitted\non behalf of the author that the Court could not take into account\nportions of a publication which the Plaintiff himself had not identified\nin his plaint to be defamatory and by considering portions extraneous\nto the plaint, the Court would be said to be stepping into the shoes of a\nPlaintiff which course is totally impermissible in law and that the\nalleged defamatory portions had to be affirmed by way of affidavit in\nthe Plaint.

It was also submitted on behalf of the author that the\nrequirement of identifying the alleged defamatory portions was also\nfounded upon principles of natural justice so that the defendant had an\nopportunity to meet the case propounded and that a Plaintiff could not\nbe permitted to play hide and seek and disclose what it alleged to be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                               Page 95 of 211</span>\n defamatory portions only during the course of arguments. Inter alia\nthe author submits that the plaintiff i.e. the petitioner herein in various\nportions of his plaint had stated that an ‗attempt&#x27; had been made to\ndefame or that an ‗attempt&#x27; had been made to raise a finger of\nsuspicion but that a mere attempt unlike criminal law, was not\nactionable in civil law.

The author further submitted that no injunction could be and\nshould be granted since the plaintiff had adequate remedy to seek\ndamages and that the Court should invariably not grant an injunction\nto restrain the publication of defamatory material (assuming that such\nis the case, for arguments) as it would be unreasonable to fetter the\nfreedom of speech before the full trial takes place.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_166\">95.

India&#x27;s\n   foremost yoga guru was scheduled to start his tour in New York\n   on 30 June 2007 and wind it up in Coventry in the UK on 8\n   August, rumbling through New Jersey, Chicago, Glasgow and\n   London in between.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">          Animesh Goenka, then president of Heritage India, a\n   small charitable organization that was involved with the\n   planning of Ramdev&#x27;s tour, had told the media that the US leg\n   of the tour, estimated to cost $350,000, was to be funded\n   exclusively through charitable donations from private\n   individuals and corporations. The sale of tickets to the yoga\n   camps, priced between $100 and $500, was expected to raise\n   half a million dollars. This money, Goenka had asserted, would\n   be funnelled into research on amla and developing a product\n   for which a patent could he sought.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">          While Ramdev prepared for his international tour,\n   Balkrishna was making certain critical and far-reaching\n   changes. On 18 May 2007, fifteen months after its formation,\n   Patanjali Ayurveda Pvt. Ltd dropped the word &#x27;private&#x27; from its\n   name. This was a critical move if the company wanted to list\n   itself on the stock market. Patanjali&#x27;s shareholding also\n   changed around this time, as would happen frequently over the\n   years, with several of Ramdev&#x27;s key associates coming on board\n   as shareholders, albeit minor ones, at this point. As before, and\n   as with Vedic Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd, Ramdev&#x27;s pliant and\n   trustworthy Balkrishna remained the largest shareholder by\n   far.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">          Notable among these new shareholders were Krishan\n   Kumar Pittie and Sarvan Poddar Pittie would eventually play a\n   major role in Ramdev&#x27;s quest for media domination and Poddar\n   would buy a Scottish island, Little Cumbrae, for GBP 2.1\n   million in September 2009 and donate it to Patanjali Yogpeeth&#x27;s\n   UK trust.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 100 of 211</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">            Balkrishna also converted Vedic Broadcasting Pvt.

Had they been a\n   little more alert they would have sensed that something wasn&#x27;t\n   quite sitting right. Ramdev was preparing to take over Aastha.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">           But Ramdev himself missed something brewing in his\n   own backyard. Amid his heady successes, and hectic travel, he\n   failed to see that his guru Shankar Dev was ailing, increasingly\n   unhappy and isolated in his own home, Kripalu Bagh Ashram.\n   For instance, Shankar Dev, who was the convener of the Divya\n   Yog Mandir Trust, was not on the boards of any of the new\n   companies that were set up by Ramdev.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">           But what Ramdev could not see, though it was in plain\n   sight, many in Haridwar saw. Several remember the swiftly\n   ageing Shankar Dev, ravaged by spinal tuberculosis, becoming\n   increasingly frail and forlorn. Spinal tuberculosis causes the\n   patient to cough blood, lose weight, get night sweats and chills,\n   and experience a loss of appetite, fatigue and fever, and it can\n   sometimes impair mobility as a result of pain in the spine and\n   damage to the joints.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">           Like in many small towns, friendships and kinship survive\n   long years in Kankhal Sushant Mahendru&#x27;s family, friends of\n   Shankar Dev, continued looking out for him even after he\n   stopped coming to their house when his old friend died. &#x27;I have\n   seen him several times during those months when he had TB,\n   He was alone and ignored in a little room in Kripalu Bagh\n   Ashram.... cooking for himself, washing his own clothes and\n   utensils. The only difference was that he took rickshaws to\n   commute because he could no longer cycle because of the TB.\n   But even that was difficult for him ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">           These people [Ramdev and Balkrishna] had a Nissan\n   Terrano at the time, but not one person in Kankhal has any\n   memory of Shankar Dev sitting in any of their cars. He was\n   always on a cycle or in a rickshaw,&#x27; says Mahendru.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">           The anguish of watching Shankar Dev deteriorate is\n   etched on Mahendru&#x27;s face. From being the master of his\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 101 of 211</span>\n    ashram, Shankar Dev was reduced to a sidestepped has-been in\n   Kripalu Bagh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">          ShankarDev is still the subject of hushed conversations in\n   Kankhal today. Those who remember tell of his trials and speak\n   of his tribulations in lowered voices -- no one wants to cross\n   the now all-powerful Ramdev. In a small place like Kankhal,\n   word can get around. They are right to be worried. For\n   instance, when I asked about Shankar Dev&#x27;s deteriorating\n   standard of living Balkrishna became positively belligerent and\n   furious at me.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">          Ramdev&#x27;s tour began successfully in New York when a\n   thousand people, mostly Indian Americans already familiar\n   with his yoga through Aastha USA, attended his inaugural\n   camp at Nassau Community College -- some from as far as\n   California.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">          At the Garden State Exhibit Center in Somerset, New\n   Jersey, there was a groundswell of fan support -- 3000 people\n   attended. The state Senate and the General Assembly passed a\n   resolution that this Legislature honors Swami Ramdev for his\n   firm belief that good health is the birthright .of all human\n   beings, and extends best wishes for a successful yoga camp in\n   the US&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">          It was when Ramdev was in Chicago that news came\n   from Kankhal. On 14 July 2007, Shankar Dev disappeared.\n   Vanished without a trace. He left that morning for his usual\n   walk and simply did not return.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">          It may have been devastating news for Ramdev. Or\n   maybe it was just inconvenient timing. With the Chicago\n   schedule drawing to a close, Ramdev had to choose: Should he\n   go on&#x27;to London, where the House of Commons planned to\n   receive and honour him, or should he send his regrets and rush\n   back to Kankhal to lead the search for his missing guru?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">          Usually once a disciple takes deeksha, or initiation into\n   the sacred, from his guru, he establishes a bond with him.\n   Ramdev had not just taken deeksha from Shankar Dev but also\n   accepted saffron robes from him -- that is, he renounced the\n   world. From the moment he took the saffron robes from\n   Shankar Dev, that gurushishya relationship was meant to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 102 of 211</span>\n    become the central fulcrum of his life. From that moment\n   onward, Ramdev was supposed to consider his guru as his\n   spiritual and temporal father and mother.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">          There is no way of knowing what Ramdev truly felt when\n   he heard of the disappearance or if he struggled with the\n   decision or for how long, but in the end he decided to carry on\n   with his tour. The day after his aides filed a missing person&#x27;s\n   report at Kankhal pohce station, on 18 July 2007, Ramdev\n   attended a ceremony at the British House of Commons in his\n   honour.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">          An investigation began in India, but clues were scarce. A\n   cryptic note was found in Shankar Dev&#x27;s room: ‗I have taken\n   some loan from you for this trust but I cannot repay it. Please\n   forgive me. I am leaving.&#x27; He was seventy-seven years old.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">          The note raised more questions than it answered: Exactly\n   how much did this old man who continued to live as simply as\n   before Ramdev&#x27;s meteoric rise borrow that he could not repay\n   the sum? Why did he borrow it? When had he taken the loan?\n   And from whom? More importantly - why did Ramdev, sitting\n   atop an empire worth at least Rs 100 crore, not repay the loan\n   on his behalf? Why did Shankar Dev not ask him for help? Or\n   had he?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">          Even though Karamveer had left the organization,\n   Shankar Dev, who missed him dearly, often called him -\n   sometimes for financial help. ‗I used to send whatever little I\n   could so he could get by,&#x27; says Karamveer. Vipin Pradhan, a\n   former aide and Karamveer&#x27;s nephew, says, &#x27;By then, the trust\n   was being run by ... relatives of Ramdev who had come in from\n   outside and had no intention, of serving any interest other than\n   their own. They treated Shankar Dev badly and he was very\n   unhappy.&#x27;&#x27;\n          Kararhveer says that once when he was visiting\n   Haridwar and staying with an old friend in Tripura Ashram,\n   &#x27;Shankar Dev came to meet me. They had sent two people after\n   him to do his CID {that is, to spy on him]. They waited at the\n   gates while we met. I&#x27;m not sure why... they [Ramdev and\n   Balkrishna] had doubts [about Shankar Dev] in their minds at\n   the time... who knows what doubt... what they were thinking at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                            Page 103 of 211</span>\n    the time. It must have been a very difficult situation for Shankar\n   Dev.&#x27;\n          But it is Radhika Nagrath&#x27;s appraisal of the situation that\n   is most damning. Remember, Nagrath is the one who designed\n   Divya Pharmacy&#x27;s website in its early days. She is still\n   associated with Patanjali and has an obvious soft spot for\n   Ramdev, whom she speaks of with affection, though she is\n   unhesitatingly honest. She says, &#x27;Shankar Dev was a real saint -\n   a very gentle guy. He felt ousted in his own home. He did not\n   get any compassion because these people were in a race for\n   something else. It was once his home, his shelter. He used to\n   sign all the expense cheques for the trust at first [but] now the\n   authority was taken away from him and he was not happy with\n   the way things had shaped out. He had given these people\n   shelter and now they had no time for him ... they had no use for\n   an old man any more.&#x27;\n          An uneasy silence always follows questions about\n   Shankar Dev among Kankhal residents. People always ask,\n   &#x27;Can I trust you? Are you writing for him or against him?\n   You see, Ramdev has become too powerful. And look what-\n   happened to his guru ...&#x27;\n          After his pit stop at the House of Commons, Ramdev\n   continued his tour, travelling to Glasgow then back to London,\n   and finally ending his tour in Coventry on 8 August 2007. When\n   he returned to India, more than three weeks had passed since\n   Shankar Dev&#x27;s disappearance. To outside observers it seemed\n   as though Ramdev was too busy chasing fame and fortune,\n   making them wonder: did he even care?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">          After his return, Ramdev summoned a press connference\n   in Haridwar, remembers the Jansatta reporter and Haridwar\n   resident Sunil Pandey. At the press conference he was saying\n   how Shankar Dev was like a father to him and how sad it was ...\n   I asked him that if he really was like a father to him, why -\n   didn&#x27;t he come back?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">          ―I was in the US, conducting camps, answered Ramdev.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">          ‗Well, if a family member disappeared, one would come\n   back, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; Pandey pressed Ramdev.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                              Page 104 of 211</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">             ‗If I knew he was alive, I would have,&#x27; replied Ramdev.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">           &#x27;So you are admitting that you know that he is dead?&#x27;\n      demanded Pandey.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">           That was the suspicion in everyone&#x27;s minds.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">             Stunned, realizing he had misspoken, Ramdev fell silent.\n             ‗Then his people just took over and changed the subject.\n      Though a lot of people were present at the press conference,&#x27;\n      recalls Pandey.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">             Little of this murky business was reported in the national\n      media at that time. Across the country, Ramdev&#x27;s star was\n      ascendant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">             It was only in October 2012, five years after Shankar\n      Dev&#x27;s disappearance, that the Central Bureau of Investigation\n      (CBl), India&#x27;s apex investigative agency, initiated a probe to\n      find him. In his inimitable style, Ramdev welcomed the\n      investigation on the one hand, but also attacked the CBI and\n      the government, accusing them of a politically motivated\n      conspiracy to frame him m the case. Given the sour relationship\n      between Ramdev and the Union government at that time, his\n      allegation did have some credence.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_169\">98.

Of course, I found many who\n   were energized and motivated by Ramdev and his story. But the\n   man also leaves behind a trail of a different sort.\n       A trail of people whose goodwill or frailties he used to\n   further his own enrichment and pursue his own agenda, people\n   who were left by the wayside after they had served their\n   purpose. A trail of people who either vanished into thin air, or\n   died mysterious deaths, or live on in utter fear of him. A trail of\n   decisions and political machinations driven not by the\n   principles he espouses but by expediency. A trail blazing into\n   the post-truth world where reality was mutable and the trusting\n   millions who believe in him could be manipulated through his\n   television channels. Finally, a trail of shirked responsibility.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">                                         (emphasis supplied.)\n\n   For every negative event surrounding him, he has consistently\n   yelled foul, always choosing to lay the blame at someone else&#x27;s\n   door -- the government&#x27;s or his detractors&#x27;, accusing them of\n   conspiring against him and fabricating evidence to pull him\n   down. On some occasions, he may have even been right, but he\n   has overused the argument to such an extent that it has lost its\n   credibility.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">      All Ramdev&#x27;s former allies, aides, supporters and mentors\n   who had watched him rise but had fallen by the wayside at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                               Page 106 of 211</span>\n    some point seemed to have been waiting for a call like mine,\n   from anyone at all, asking them about their time with Ramdev.\n   They were all ready to tell their stories.\n       Yet for all the dubious choices he has made since his rise to\n   fame and fortune, no one can take away or belittle the legacy of\n   this farmer&#x27;s son. Ramdev took yoga and Ayurveda out of the\n   restrictive realm of religion and made it an accessible practice\n   of preventive health care for millions of Indians. He reminded\n   them that the pursuit of spirituality has little meaning if the\n   body is unhealthy. Even today, despite the pressures of running\n   a growing business, he continues to hold yoga camps in\n   Haridwar. He&#x27;s still on television every day, thanks to a\n   combination of reruns and fresh shoots.\n       Most important, he drew attention to India&#x27;s own health\n   care heritage - Ayurveda. Leaving aside how it was all\n   executed, Ramdev&#x27;s charisma reminded people that not every\n   ailment needs a modern doctor. There are other options that\n   are less intrusive.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">       Today, preventive health care is the new buzzword for the\n   health-care industry globally. Prevention is better than cure\n   may be an old adage, but India&#x27;s beleaguered 60-billion-dollar\n   health-care industry, groaning and creaking under the\n   staggering pressure of 1.2 billion people, is recognizing the\n   worth of that ancient wisdom now. Ramdev has undoubtedly\n   played a vital role in making Ayurveda and yoga relevant and\n   accessible to millions of Indians.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">       In pursuit of that goal of offering healthy living options to\n   the market, his astute business instinct has also spawned India&#x27;s\n   fastest-growing company. The sheer speed of growth of his\n   company and the breathtaking ambition of it as he chases\n   another impossible-sounding target of doubling revenues to Rs\n   20,000 crore in 2017-18 will always inspire entrepreneurs.\n   Whatever the future may bring for Patanjali, young people\n   without degrees and money will draw inspiration from its\n   dazzling ascent. The tales of how a homegrown company shook\n   up multinational corporations out of a stupor, forced them to\n   change their strategy, take notice of Ayurveda as a source of\n   new products will also endure.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 107 of 211</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">        Nothing can take this legacy away from Ramdev. It is his to\n   keep.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">       While Ramdev&#x27;s legacy relating to television, Ayurveda,\n   yoga and business is fairly clear, what is his political legacy?\n   Every venture he has touched in his life has been a success but\n   popular opinion may suggest that he failed in his political\n   ambition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">       Ramdev strayed into politics accidentally, not by design.\n   After he met Rajeev Dixit, it just sort of happened: he tried to\n   harness his fame as a sadhu-cum yoga-teacher to propel\n   himself on to a larger platform and dreamt of his own political\n   party. But somewhere along the way Ramdev seems to have\n   decided against trying to become a mainstream political player\n   and instead use his political power -- and it is undeniably clear\n   that he does have political power thanks to his popularity\n   among people -- to further his business interests. Ramdev&#x27;s\n   politics now plays a supporting role for his business empire --\n   and that&#x27;s not a failure as much as a sensible, pragmatic\n   realignment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">       But pragmatism and taking utilitarian, hard-boiled decisions\n   is second nature for Ramdev. It is easy to forget that Ramdev\n   was not always a BJP ally. Once upon a time he was the\n   protege of the Congress, willing to hijack the VHP-RSS agenda\n   to hand over a victory to allies in the Grand Old Party.\n   Without his old Congress allies, and their largesse - land\n   discounts, permissions, loan approvals - Ramdev could not\n   have become as powerful as he had in the first place. Yet when\n   he realized the Congress was a sinking ship and fell out with\n   his earlier godfathers, he negotiated a safe landing space with\n   the VHP-RSS-BJP combine.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">       Smoothly, courageously, he abandoned the Congress party,\n   becoming part of the battering ram that brought it down.\n   Ramdev is said to have helped the BJP with the 2014 general\n   election campaign and is now apparently reaping rewards for\n   that service. In May 2017, a Reuters article alleged that\n   according to (unpolished) documents examined by them,\n   Ramdev has received 46 million dollars in land allocations and\n   discounts from BJP-led state governments.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                            Page 108 of 211</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">        But do not take this to be a permanent realignment. Ramdev\n   is a hardheaded ally who can blow hot and cold at will.\n       Today, even as he reiterates his support for the BJP\n   government, Ramdev is quietly mending fences with his former\n   allies-turned-foes, holding public and private meetings with\n   Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh and Mulayam Singh Yadav and\n   the Congress politicians. If he ever needs to abandon the BJP,\n   his old alliances may well be restored enough to make the\n   transition possible. Ramdev&#x27;s ability to nurse new dreams,\n   pursue them and abandon them if needed, his fluidity, makes it\n   impossible to categorize his political flirtation as a complete\n   failure. His ability to adapt and respond to changing\n   landscapes is formidable - and admirable. When denied\n   political domination, he chose to harness politics to seek\n   economic dominion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">       Yet, Ramdev and the empire he has built now stand at a\n   crossroads. However beguiling it is to believe in the fairy tale\n   of one man&#x27;s ability to build an empire from nothing in almost\n   no time, his success is far from assured.\n       A seething rivalry between his brother and his deputy\n   threatens his empire. Ram Bharat and Balkrishna, who always\n   banded together against any third ascending power in\n   Ramdev&#x27;s empire, do not enjoy a close relationship. One gets\n   the impression that for Ramdev blood is thicker than water and\n   so Balkrishna, given to insecurity and jealousy, has long been\n   envious of Ram Bharat - for instance, all those years ago, when\n   Karamveer was still around, Balkrishna was upset with Ramdev\n   for buying Ram Bharat a bike and a house.\n       These two men have long been Ramdev&#x27;s lieutenants,\n   executing his orders on the ground. Ram Bharat has always\n   been in charge of the purse strings. Balkrishna oversees the\n   Ayurveda and to lesser extent the FMCG side of the empire,\n   under Ramdev&#x27;s watchful eye.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">       But Balkrishna, a man who knows everything about Ramdev,\n   is also seen to be attention-hungry and desires a prominent\n   public profile, like Ramdev&#x27;s -- that&#x27;s why he is so active on\n   social media, building his own brand, even making claims of\n   discovering the mythical sanjeevani buti, the herb described in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                            Page 109 of 211</span>\n       the Ramayana as one that can raise the dead to life. Ramdev\n      and Balkrishna&#x27;s shared history apparently forced Ramdev&#x27;s\n      hand to give him space on the masthead of the company and on\n      their advertisements.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">          But don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking they&#x27;re equals. Balkrishna\n      is without a doubt Ramdev s pliable and controllable deputy. It\n      was nothing but expediency that led Ramdev to put 94 per cent\n      of Patanjali in Balkrishna&#x27;s name -- his long-standing\n      subordinate could be controlled as neither Ramdev nor his\n      family could sit at the helm without a backlash.\n          It is generally speculated that Ram Bharat is not\n      particularly thrilled with this arrangement. Yet, because he\n      continues to control the finances of the company, he is\n      mollified. This division of real and perceived power keeps their\n      rivalries from spilling over. For now.\n          But it is hard not to feel as though this house of cards may\n      come crashing down.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">          For Ramdev, the stakes have never been higher. And there\n      are some questions he needs to consider. Will he find the\n      courage to distance his unpredictable family, particularly his\n      brother, from the company? Will, he be able to stand up to\n      people within his organization and prevent them, from pursuing\n      unfair trade practices with his distributors and suppliers? Can\n      he rein in his advertising juggernaut from misleading and mis-\n      selling to the public? Is he willing to own the mistakes made in\n      the past and correct them? Most important, is he willing to play\n      by the rules of the society he lives in and hold himself up to the\n      laws that ordinary businessmen have to adhere to? Is he ready\n      to stop using his saffron robes as a holy shield against public\n      scrutiny?‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_170\">99.

The author nevertheless submits that in any event the\nBOOK gives an extremely balanced account where the version of the\nplaintiff i.e. the petitioner herein has been duly noted and published.\nThe author further submits that without prejudice to her submissions\nthat there is nothing defamatory in the BOOK and that public figures\nlike the plaintiff i.e. the petitioner herein cannot be too thin skinned in\nreference to the comments or observations or opinions or any other\nmatter as regards them or in respect of events surrounding them and\nthat the standard in law for defamation in relation to public figures is\nthat of a &quot;crank&quot; and &quot;an enthusiast&quot; and law rather mandates that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 111 of 211</span>\n even if public figures know from the bottom of their hearts that\npublications are undeserved, they must even submit to be\nmisunderstood.

The author further submits that the verdicts of this Court in\nHis Holiness Shamar Rimpoche, Shashi Tharoor, Khushwant Singh\nshow that inferences of defamation are not to be drawn easily and that\ninjunctions are invariably never granted in the cases of public figures.\nThe author further submits that there is a vital public interest in\nobtaining information about a public figure and that public interest is\nthe matter of freedom of speech and is to be construed liberally and\nfurthermore, an approach which does not chill the speech needs to be\nadopted. The author further relied on the verdict in Khushwant Singh\nand Indu Jain to contend that BOOK is in public interest and to judge\nwhether a publication is in public interest or not, each sentence or\nparagraph or chapter is not to be analysed to ascertain if the same\nwould serve any &#x27;public interest&#x27;, and to attempt to identify what that\npublic interest / public goal might be and that such a microscopic\napproach is totally impermissible and unwarranted in law. The entire\npublication is to be read as a whole. The author further submits that in\nlaw, a matter which is &quot;of interest to public&quot; is also in public interest,\nand the standards for &quot;public interest&quot; from different arenas e.g. public\ninterest petitions etc are not to be imported in the matters of freedom\nof speech.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                               Page 112 of 211</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\"> 101.      It has been submitted on behalf of the author that if the\npublic figure is to be construed too rigidly or if the authors are to be\nheld liable for every inaccuracy and that nothing contained in the\nBOOK is inaccurate, the same would amount to &#x27;chilling&#x27; of speech\nwhich is a widely accepted constitutional principle and that in such a\nsituation not only false speech will be deterred but the authors will be\ndeterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be\ntrue and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can\nbe proved in Court or fear of the expense of having to do so. The\nauthor further submits that in such an event no author would even\nwant to then ever write or talk about anything that is controversial for\nthe fear of being unable to prove and that on account of this, even in\ndefamation actions, the law does not even require &#x27;truth&#x27; to be\n&#x27;absolute truth&#x27; but only &#x27;substantial truth&#x27; and that in any case, the\ntruthfulness or falsity are to be determined only in trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_173\">102.     The author further submitted to the effect that no consent of\nthe plaintiff i.e. the petitioner herein is at any stage required and that\nthere is no violation of the right to privacy inasmuch as freedom of\nspeech cannot be made conditional on the mercy of the subject about\nwhom something is sought to be written and that if consent were to be\nmandatory for any writing to be made on public figures that would be\nthe end of freedom of speech as seldom would a public figure allow\nsomething that does not soothe his/her ears or does not propagate\nhis/her agenda and further submits that unless the matters pertain to\nand impinge on the right to privacy of an individual, consent for any\npublication is not mandatory from the person concerned. The author\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 113 of 211</span>\n further submits that the Petitioner herein i.e. the plaintiff of the suit\napart from having not claimed any right to privacy had in fact\nwaived/relinquished the same by his conduct for all times. The author\nfurther submits that the Petitioner himself has his authorized\nbiography written by Sandeep Dev- Swami Ramdev- Ek Yogi - Ek\nYodhha in which he has given a detail of his own family life and life\nin early childhood, details of his education and educational institutes\nhe attended, friendship with Acharya Balkrishna, and injuries of Baba\nRamdev. It is submitted by the author that it has been revealed in\ndetail in the said biography that he was called &#x27;petul&#x27; in his childhood\nfor being fat, he belonged to a poor family, and that he was regularly\nbeaten up by his father or that once he was alleged to be a thief etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_174\">103.

The publisher\nfurther contended that both the author and the publisher have\nunequivocally committed to standing by the truth of the statements\nmade in the BOOK and the fairness of comments and conclusions\nreached, both before the Trial Court and the Appellate Court bring\nforth the justification has been arrived at and submits further that none\nof the allegedly defamatory statements had been made for the first\ntime inasmuch as there was acquiescence and no irreparable harm\ncould possibly be caused to the reputation of the petitioner. The\npublisher contends that the petitioner has contended that his right to\nprivacy has been infringed but that this claim is not made in the plaint\nby the plaintiff i.e. the petitioner herein and is thus irrelevant and that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 115 of 211</span>\n the petitioner being a public figure, the facts of his life are already in\npublic domain and that he has also authorized his biographies and\ngiven television serials about his life and he volunteered his life for\npublic examination.

Inter alia the publisher submitted that the repetition rule is\nirrelevant and whether or not repetition of a libel would still be libel is\na separate question, but the fact that it has been often repeated and\nacquiesced to would be sufficient to deny the petitioner an injunction.</span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_155\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"44777\" id=\"span_156\">106.

For instance,\n               Shankar Dev, who was the convener of the\n               Divya Yog Mandir Trust, was not on the boards\n               of any of the new companies that were set up by\n               Ramdev.

Or maybe it was just &#x27;inconvenient\n               timing. With the Chicago schedule drawing to a\n               close, Ramdev had to choose: Should he go on\n               to London, where the House of Commons\n               planned to receive and honour him, or should he\n               send his regrets and rush back to Kankhal to\n               lead the search for his missing guru? Usually\n               once a disciple takes deeksha, or initiation into\n               the sacred, from his guru, he establishes a bond\n               with him. Ramdev had not just, taken deeksha\n               from Shankar Dev but also accepted saffron\n               robes from him - that is, he renounced the\n               world, From the moment he took the saffron\n               robes from Shankar Dev, that guru- shishya\n               relationship was meant to become the central\n               fulcrum of his life.

Please forgive\n               me. I am leaving.&#x27; He was seventy seven years\n               old. The note raised more questions than it\n               answered: Exactly how much did this old man\n               who continued to live as simply as before\n               Ramdev&#x27;s meteoric rise borrow that he could not\n               repay the sum? Why did he borrow it? When had\n               he taken the loan? And from whom? More\n               importantly - why did Ramdev, sitting atop an\n               empire worth at least Rs. 100 crore, not repay\n               the loan. Why did Shankar Dev not ask him for\n               help? Or had he? ...When Ramdev returned to\n               India, more than three weeks had passed since\n               Shankar Dev&#x27;s disappearance. He summoned a\n               press conference in Haridwar, remembers the\n               Jansatta reporter and Haridwar resident Sunil\n               Pandey. &#x27;At the press conference he was saying\n               how Shankar Dev was like a father to him and\n               how sad it was.... I asked him that if he really\n               was like a father to him, why didn&#x27;t he come\n               back?&#x27; ‗I was in the US, conducting camps,&#x27;\n               answered Ramdev. ‗Well, if a family member\n               disappeared, one would come back, isn&#x27;t It?&#x27;\n               Pandey pressed Ramdev. If I knew he was alive,\n               I would have,&#x27; replied Ramdev. &#x27;So you are\n               admitting that you know that he is dead?&#x27;\n               demanded Pandey. That was the suspicion in\n               everyone&#x27;s minds.

As a general rule, the law\n         does not allow a person to evade liability by attributing\n         a statement to some other person. If D states, ―C\n         murdered X‖, then a defence of truth requires D to\n         show that C did murder X. If, however, D states that ―A\n         told me that C murdered X‖or that ―there is a rumour\n         that C murdered X‖, D is still required to prove that C\n         did murder X in order to establish the defence. It does\n         not matter that, taken literally, the statement is true in\n         the sense that D can show that he or she was told the\n         information by A or that such a rumour does exist. In\n         short, ―If you repeat a rumour you cannot say it is true\n         by proving that the rumour in fact existed; you have to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                               Page 124 of 211</span>\n          prove that the subject matter of the rumour is true‖.\n         The ―repetition rule‖ ―reflects a fundamental canon of\n         legal policy in the law of defamation.... That words\n         must be interpreted, and the implications they contain\n         justified, by reference to the underlying allegations of\n         fact and not merely by reliance upon some second-hand\n         report of assertion of them‖.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">               This is because ―repeating someone else&#x27;s libelous\n         statement is just as bad as making the statement\n         directly‖, and therefore ―for the purpose of the law of\n         libel a hearsay statement is the same as a direct\n         statement‖. This would seem to accord with reality, for\n         if:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">               ―A says to B that C says that D is a scoundrel, B\n         will think just as ill of D as if he had heard the\n         statement directly from C. If moreover, A is a\n         respectable newspaper, D&#x27;s position will be worse in\n         part because there will be many more Bs, and in part\n         because responsible newspapers do not generally\n         repeat serious allegations unless they think there is\n         something in them so that the very fact of publication\n         carries a certain weight.‖\n\n         The same approach is taken where D, rather than\n         purporting to report what someone else has said,\n         simply asserts that he believes that C murdered X---\n         no matter how honest that belief and no matter how\n         accurately it states the &quot;fact&quot; of his state of mind,\n         again he must prove that C murdered X. This does\n         not mean that wherever D makes a statement\n         implicating C with wrongdoing it must be proved\n         that C was guilty of the wrongdoing: on its proper\n         interpretation, the statement may convey merely\n         that there are reasonable grounds to suspect C or\n         grounds for investigation of his conduct, and then D\n         succeeds on justification by proving the truth of the\n         words in that level of meaning rather than guilt. It\n         is, therefore, necessary to determine what meaning\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                              Page 125 of 211</span>\n          the words can convey to the reasonable person for it\n         is only such a meaning that the defendant is\n         required to justify. Thus it would seem that a\n         statement that proceedings for conspiracy have been\n         issued against the claimant may be justified by proof\n         that proceedings have been issued, and the\n         defendant is not required to proved that the\n         claimant has committed the wrong alleged in them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">and on the verdict in ―Rosalyn Jane Mark V.

Although, therefore, it is true to say, as\n            indeed I said in Stern -v- Piper, that the\n            repetition rule, where it applies, ―dictates the\n            meaning to be given to the words used‖ , that is\n            by no means to say that the meaning dictated is\n            an artificial one. Rather the rule accords with\n            reality. If A says to B that C says that D is a\n            scoundrel, B will think just as ill of D as if he\n            had heard the statement directly from C. If,\n            moreover, A is a respectable newspaper, D&#x27;s\n            position will be worse than if B had merely\n            heard the statement directly from C. It will be\n            worse in part because there will be many more\n            Bs, and in part because responsible newspapers\n            do not generally repeat serious allegations\n            unless they think there is something in them so\n            that the very fact of publication carries a certain\n            weight. If, of course, in retailing C&#x27;s statement,\n            A says that C is often unreliable so that B should\n            not suppose the statement necessarily to be true,\n            that would certainly mitigate the gravity of the\n            libel. Just as it would aggravate the libel if A\n            said that C&#x27;s statements ordinarily turned out to\n            be true. But in either event, D&#x27;s reputation would\n            be damaged and the repetition rule precludes A\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                              Page 126 of 211</span>\n             from pretending the contrary (ie, justifying by\n            asserting that what he said was true, the only\n            defamer being C).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">                  35.

To regard\n            reportage as being incapable of harming a\n            person&#x27;s reputation would be to introduce into\n            the law a fiction which the repetition rule is\n            designed to avoid. Furthermore, as I sought to\n            point out in both Stern -v- Piper and Al-Fagih,\n            abolishing the repetition rule would make a\n            nonsense of the law of qualified privilege.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">113.     The petitioner further contended that it is also a settled rule of\ncommon law rule that consent must be clear and unequivocal and the\nnature of publication would be relevant for ascertaining such consent\nwith reference made to Paragraph 19.10 &amp; 19.11 in ―Gatley on Libel\nand Slander (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 12th Edition)&quot; with reference to\n<a href=\"/doc/842137/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 3</a> which reads to the effect:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">                  ―19.10.

Carrie V Tolkien\n                  neatly illustrates this defence. The defendant\n                  published a potentially defamatory comment\n                  on the claimant&#x27;s blog. The claimant\n                  discovered this a maximum of four hours 19\n                  minutes later but allowed it to remain there\n                  for 22 months. He had therefore acquiesced\n                  in the publication of the libel from the time\n                  of discovery and there was no evidence in the\n                  short, initial period of any substantial\n                  publication to others.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">                  19.11.    Limits of doctrine. Consent, as in\n                  other areas of the law of tort, is a narrow\n                  defence. Thus, it has been held not to apply\n                  where the publication was not substantially\n                  the same as that to which the claimant\n                  consented, nor where the publication was to\n                  a wider audience.

The\n                  mere submission by the claimant of a matter\n                  to public discussion neither authorizes a\n                  defamatory response, nor even necessarily\n                  gives rise to any qualified privilege, unless\n                  he has been party to an attack on the\n                  defendant which justifies a public reply.

In fact the submission is\n                 that right to freedom of speech and expression\n                 which includes freedom of press should be\n                 given higher status and the individual&#x27;s right\n                 to have his/her reputation should yield to the\n                 said right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"330608\" id=\"span_188\">In this regard a passage from <a href=\"/doc/330608/\" id=\"a_114\">Sakal\n                 Papers (P) Ltd.</a> (supra) has been commended\n                 us.

It is not a restriction that has an\n                 inevitable consequence which impairs\n                 circulation of thought and ideas. In fact, it is\n                 control regard being had to another person&#x27;s\n                 right to go to Court and state that he has been\n                 wronged and abused.

If this be the\n                 sense in which you are using the words, then a\n                 libel action is concerned only with a man&#x27;s\n                 reputation, that is, with what people think of\n                 him: and it is for damage to his reputation, that\n                 is, to his esteem in the eyes of others, that he\n                 can sue, and not for damage to his own\n                 personality or disposition.

In short, his &quot;character&quot; is the\n                 esteem in which he is held by others who know\n                 him and are in a position to judge his worth.

But a man&#x27;s\n                 &quot;character,&quot; so understood, may become\n                 known to others beyond his immediate circle.\n                 In so far as the estimate spreads outwards\n                 from those who know him and circulates\n                 among people generally in an increasing\n                 range, it becomes his &quot;reputation,&quot; which is\n                 entitled to the protection of the law just as\n                 much as his character. But here I speak only\n                 of a reputation which is built upon the\n                 estimate of those who know him. No other\n                 reputation is of any worth.

Test it\n                 this way. Suppose an honourable man becomes\n                 the victim of groundless rumour.

Once besmirched by an unfounded\n                 allegation in a national newspaper, a\n                 reputation can be damaged forever, especially\n                 if there is no opportunity to vindicate one&#x27;s\n                 reputation. When this happens, society as well\n                 as the individual is the loser. For it should not\n                 be supposed that protection of reputation is a\n                 matter of importance only to the affected\n                 individual and his family. Protection of\n                 reputation is conducive to the public good. It is\n                 in the public interest that the reputation of\n                 public figures should not be debased falsely. In\n                 the political field, in order to make an informed\n                 choice, the electorate needs to be able to\n                 identify the good as well as the bad.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">                 Consistently with these considerations, human\n                 rights conventions recognise that freedom of\n                 expression is not an absolute right. Its exercise\n                 may be subject to such restrictions as are\n                 prescribed by law and are necessary in a\n                 democratic society for the protection of the\n                 reputations of others.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">                 38.

Yet, to most people,\n                 their good reputation is to be cherished above\n                 all. A good reputation is closely related to the\n                 innate worthiness and dignity of the individual.\n                 It is an attribute that must, just as much as\n                 freedom of expression, be protected by\n                 society&#x27;s laws. In order to undertake the\n                 balancing required by this case, something\n                 must be said about the value of reputation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">                 108.

That importance must, in turn, be\n                 based upon the good repute of a person.

False\n                 allegations can so very quickly and completely\n                 destroy a good reputation. A reputation\n                 tarnished by libel can seldom regain its\n                 former lustre.

In the context of the actio injuriarum, our\n                 common law has separated the causes of action\n                 for claims for injuries to reputation (fama) and\n                 dignitas. Dignitas concerns the individual&#x27;s\n                 own sense of self worth, but included in the\n                 concept are a variety of personal rights\n                 including, for example, privacy. In our new\n                 constitutional order, no sharp line can be\n                 drawn between these injuries to personality\n                 rights. The value of human dignity in our\n                 Constitution is not only concerned with an\n                 individual&#x27;s sense of self-worth, but constitutes\n                 an affirmation of the worth of human beings in\n                 our society.

In fact the\n       submission is that right to freedom of speech and\n       expression which includes freedom of press should be\n       given higher status and the individual&#x27;s right to have\n       his/her reputation should yield to the said right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_252\">In this\n       regard a passage from <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_220\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd.

Freedom of\n       speech can be restricted only in the interests of the\n       security of the State, friendly relations with foreign State,\n       public order, decency or morality or in relation to\n       contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an\n       offence. It cannot, like the freedom to carry on business,\n       be curtailed in the interest of the general public. If a law\n       directly affecting it is challenged, it is no answer that the\n       restrictions enacted by it are justifiable under clauses (3)\n       to (6). For, the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 19</a> is to enumerate\n       different freedoms separately and then to specify the\n       extent of restrictions to which they may be subjected and\n       the objects for securing which this could be done. A\n       citizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the\n       freedoms together and clause (1) does not prefer one\n       freedom to another. That is the plain meaning of this\n       clause. It follows from this that the State cannot make a\n       law which directly restricts one freedom even for\n       securing the better enjoyment of another freedom.‖\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_283\">       137.

It was argued by the petitioners that the entire\n       authentication process is probabilistic in nature\n       inasmuch as case of a genuine person for authentication\n       can result in rejection as biometric technology does not\n       guarantee 100% accuracy. It may happen for various\n       reasons, namely, advance age, damage to fingerprints\n       due to accident, etc. Even in case of children the\n       fingerprints may change when they grow up. The\n       emphasis was that there was a possibility of failure in\n       authentication for various reasons and when it happens\n       it would result in the exclusion rather than inclusion. In\n       such eventuality an individual would not only be denied\n       the benefits of welfare schemes, it may threaten his very\n       identity and existence as well and it would be violative of\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_225\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_226\">21</a> of the Constitution. The Authority has\n       claimed that biometric accuracy is 99.76%. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75351199\" id=\"span_256\">It was,\n       however, submitted that where more than 110 crores of\n       persons have enrolled themselves, even 0.232% failure\n       would be a phenomenal figure, which comes to 27.60\n       lakh people. Therefore, the rate of exclusion is alarming\n       and this would result in depriving needy persons to enjoy\n       their fundamental rights, which is the so-called laudable\n       objective trumpeted by the respondents.

Your people had differences with\n       him, didn&#x27;t they? I know they were upset that some\n       outsider like Rajeev Dixit came out of nowhere and\n       became the national secretary of the Bharat Swabhiman\n       Andolan. They were jealous that thousands of people used\n       to come to meet him.&#x27;\n\n       This back and forth went on for over an hour, says Dubey.\n       Finally, Ramdev suggested that they all go to the hall\n       where Dixit&#x27;s body lay, and ask the people there, and the\n       Dixit family, for their opinion.

They want me to do a postmortem . . . such\n       cutting [of a dead body] is not permitted in Hindu\n       dharma.&#x27;\n\n       One of the mourners present in the hall, a Dr Suman from\n       Haryana who was closely involved with the work of the\n       Bharat Swabhiman Andolan and Rajeev Dixit, stood up\n       and said, &#x27;So why aren&#x27;t you getting it [a postmortem]\n       done?&#x27; Ramdev was livid at being openly questioned, and\n       was in no mood to answer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_301\">       Turning to his men, he commanded, &#x27;Get the body ready\n       for its final journey.

It cannot\n            be said that a more accurate judgment about\n            people can be facilitated by knowing private\n            details about their lives - people judge us badly,\n            they judge us in haste, they judge out of context,\n            they judge without hearing the whole story and\n            they judge with hypocrisy.

There is no justification for making all\n            truthful information available to the public.

This also means\n            that an individual may be permitted to prevent\n            others from using his image, name and other\n            aspects of his/her personal life and identity for\n            commercial purposes without his/her consent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                              Page 185 of 211</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_302\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"793946\" id=\"span_277\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1203848\" id=\"span_278\">145.

It is submitted that the court should adopt a cautious\n       approach in recognizing a particular privacy claim as implicit\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 21.</a> The right to privacy is a jurisprudential realm\n       where globally the courts are still groping amidst confusion to\n       ascertain the extent of privacy concerns which should be\n       recognized as a constitutional right. Many a times, the court\n       has proceeded on an assumption that a claimed right is a\n       fundamental right under the Constitution. It is noted in Gobind\n       Vs. State of MP (Mr. Shaym Divan&#x27;s Compilation pg 123) that\n       the US SC recognizes that ―a right of personal privacy, or a\n       guarantee of certain areas of zones of privacy does exist under\n       the Constitution. (Pr. 19). In para 20 they observed that the\n       framers of our Constitution ―must have deemed to have\n       conferred upon an individual as against the Government a\n       sphere he should be let alone. Yet, in para 23 they observe\n       against a broad definition of privacy as such a right was not\n       explicit in the Constitution. Thus, the court was against a\n       general recognition of a right to privacy. Further, the court in\n       paras 22 and 23 has stressed, as the only suggestion that the\n       ―unifying principle underlying the concept has been the\n       assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right\n       implicit in the concept of ordered liberty‖. They recommend in\n       para 28 that the right to privacy will have to undergo case-by-\n       case development. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_309\">Yet again, in para 23, the court has\n       emphsised that ―privacy interest in autonomy must also be\n       placed in the context of other rights and values‖ (also in the\n       context of right to life and personal liberty of others as <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_267\">‗X&#x27; v.\n       Hospital ‗Z&#x27;.‖</a></span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_339\">177. Thus the right to privacy which includes within it, the right to\n\nreputation has to undergo a case by case development and privacy\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                              Page 199 of 211</span>\n interest in autonomy (which would include the right to reputation)\n\nmust also be placed in the context of other rights and values.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_340\">178. Thus in the circumstances, it is essential to observe that the\nimpugned order too reflects the injury caused to the petitioner by\npublication and sale of the BOOK by the respondents. It is also\napparent as has been observed hereinabove that the petitioner is\nrevered and respected as a spiritual Yoga Guru and that the veracity or\notherwise of the contents of statements made in the BOOK is yet to\nbe established and as already held elsewhere hereinabove in relation\nto the disappearance of Shankar Dev Ji and the murder of the Swami\nYogananda, no material evidence is indicated to have been collected\nor is stated to be an existence against the petitioner by acceptance of\nthe closure report in relation to Swami Shanker Dev Ji and the\n―Untrace Report‖ in relation to Swami&#x27;s Yogananda murder as has\nalready been held elsewhere hereinabove and thus there appears no\nbelief of justification put forth by the respondents in relation to these\naspects to suffice to negate the grant of the prayer of the petitioner\nseeking restraint of the portions of the BOOK with insinuating\nstatements against the petitioner in relation thereto.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_341\">179. This is so in as much as though it is sought to be contended on\nbehalf of the respondents that what is sought to be put forth through\nthese paragraphs and chapters adverted to hereinabove is justifiable as\n„fair comment‟, it is essential to observe that in order to be justifiable\nas fair comment, it must appear as a comment and must not be so\nmixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish between\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                                Page 200 of 211</span>\n what is reported and what is comment and a comment must not\nconvey imputations of disreputable motive unless adequately\nsupported with evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_342\">                            CONCLUSION\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_343\">180.

India&#x27;s foremost yoga guru was scheduled to\n       start his tour in New York on 30 June 2007 and wind it up\n       in Coventry in the UK on 8 August, rumbling through New\n       Jersey, Chicago, Glasgow and London in between.\n           Animesh Goenka, then president of Heritage India, a\n       small charitable organization that was involved with the\n       planning of Ramdev&#x27;s tour, had told the media that the US\n       leg of the tour, estimated to cost $350,000, was to be\n       funded exclusively through charitable donations from\n       private individuals and corporations. The sale of tickets to\n       the yoga camps, priced between $100 and $500, was\n       expected to raise half a million dollars. This money,\n       Goenka had asserted, would be funnelled into research on\n       amla and developing a product for which a patent could he\n       sought.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_315\">           While Ramdev prepared for his international tour,\n       Balkrishna was making certain critical and far-reaching\n       changes. On 18 May 2007, fifteen months after its\n       formation, Patanjali Ayurveda Pvt. Ltd dropped the word\n       &#x27;private&#x27; from its name. This was a critical move if the\n       company wanted to list itself on the stock market.\n       Patanjali&#x27;s shareholding also changed around this time, as\n       would happen frequently over the years, with several of\n       Ramdev&#x27;s key associates coming on board as shareholders,\n       albeit minor ones, at this point. As before, and as with\n       Vedic Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd, Ramdev&#x27;s pliant and\n       trustworthy Balkrishna remained the largest shareholder\n       by far.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_316\">           Notable among these new shareholders were Krishan\n       Kumar Pittie and Sarvan Poddar Pittie would eventually\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_314\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 203 of 211</span>\n        play a major role in Ramdev&#x27;s quest for media domination\n       and Poddar would buy a Scottish island, Little Cumbrae,\n       for GBP 2.1 million in September 2009 and donate it to\n       Patanjali Yogpeeth&#x27;s UK trust.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_317\">           Balkrishna also converted Vedic Broadcasting Pvt. Ltd\n       into a public limited company.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">           Kirit Mehta and his partners at Aastha were too busy\n       struggling to survive to notice the dramatic changes that\n       were taking place in Vedic Broadcasting&#x27;s story. Had they\n       been a little more alert they would have sensed that\n       something wasn&#x27;t quite sitting right. Ramdev was\n       preparing to take over Aastha.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">           But Ramdev himself missed something brewing in his\n       own backyard. Amid his heady successes, and hectic travel,\n       he failed to see that his guru Shankar Dev was ailing,\n       increasingly unhappy and isolated in his own home,\n       Kripalu Bagh Ashram. For instance, Shankar Dev, who\n       was the convener of the Divya Yog Mandir Trust, was not\n       on the boards of any of the new companies that were set up\n       by Ramdev.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">           But what Ramdev could not see, though it was in plain\n       sight, many in Haridwar saw. Several remember the swiftly\n       ageing Shankar Dev, ravaged by spinal tuberculosis,\n       becoming increasingly frail and forlorn. Spinal\n       tuberculosis causes the patient to cough blood, lose weight,\n       get night sweats and chills, and experience a loss of\n       appetite, fatigue and fever, and it can sometimes impair\n       mobility as a result of pain in the spine and damage to the\n       joints.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">           Like in many small towns, friendships and kinship\n       survive long years in Kankhal Sushant Mahendru&#x27;s family,\n       friends of Shankar Dev, continued looking out for him\n       even after he stopped coming to their house when his old\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_315\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 204 of 211</span>\n        friend died. &#x27;I have seen him several times during those\n       months when he had TB, He was alone and ignored in a\n       little room in Kripalu Bagh Ashram.... cooking for\n       himself, washing his own clothes and utensils. The only\n       difference was that he took rickshaws to commute because\n       he could no longer cycle because of the TB. But even that\n       was difficult for him ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_322\">            These people [Ramdev and Balkrishna] had a Nissan\n       Terrano at the time, but not one person in Kankhal has\n       any memory of Shankar Dev sitting in any of their cars. He\n       was always on a cycle or in a rickshaw,&#x27; says Mahendru. \\\n            The anguish of watching Shankar Dev deteriorate is\n       etched on Mahendru&#x27;s face. From being the master of his\n       ashram, Shankar Dev was reduced to a sidestepped has-\n       been in Kripalu Bagh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_323\">            ShankarDev is still the subject of hushed conversations\n       in Kankhal today. Those who remember tell of his trials\n       and speak of his tribulations in lowered voices -- no one\n       wants to cross the now all-powerful Ramdev. In a small\n       place like Kankhal, word can get around. They are right to\n       be worried. For instance, when I asked about Shankar\n       Dev&#x27;s deteriorating standard of living Balkrishna became\n       positively belligerent and furious at me.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_324\">            Ramdev&#x27;s tour began successfully in New York when a\n       thousand people, mostly Indian Americans already\n       familiar with his yoga through Aastha USA, attended his\n       inaugural camp at Nassau Community College -- some\n       from as far as California.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_325\">            At the Garden State Exhibit Center in Somerset, New\n       Jersey, there was a groundswell of fan support -- 3000\n       people attended. The state Senate and the General\n       Assembly passed a resolution that this Legislature honors\n       Swami Ramdev for his firm belief that good health is the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_316\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 205 of 211</span>\n        birthright .of all human beings, and extends best wishes\n       for a successful yoga camp in the US&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_326\">           It was when Ramdev was in Chicago that news came\n       from Kankhal. On 14 July 2007, Shankar Dev\n       disappeared. Vanished without a trace. He left that\n       morning for his usual walk and simply did not return.\n           It may have been devastating news for Ramdev. Or\n       maybe it was just inconvenient timing. With the Chicago\n       schedule drawing to a close, Ramdev had to choose:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_327\">       Should he go on&#x27;to London, where the House of Commons\n       planned to receive and honour him, or should he send his\n       regrets and rush back to Kankhal to lead the search for his\n       missing guru?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_328\">           Usually once a disciple takes deeksha, or initiation into\n       the sacred, from his guru, he establishes a bond with him.\n       Ramdev had not just taken deeksha from Shankar Dev but\n       also accepted saffron robes from him -- that is, he\n       renounced the world. From the moment he took the\n       saffron robes from Shankar Dev, that gurushishya\n       relationship was meant to become the central fulcrum of\n       his life. From that moment onward, Ramdev was supposed\n       to consider his guru as his spiritual and temporal father\n       and mother.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_329\">           There is no way of knowing what Ramdev truly felt\n       when he heard of the disappearance or if he struggled with\n       the decision or for how long, but in the end he decided to\n       carry on with his tour. The day after his aides filed a\n       missing person&#x27;s report at Kankhal pohce station, on 18\n       July 2007, Ramdev attended a ceremony at the British\n       House of Commons in his honour.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_330\">           An investigation began in India, but clues were scarce.\n       A cryptic note was found in Shankar Dev&#x27;s room: ‗I have\n       taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot repay\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 206 of 211</span>\n        it. Please forgive me. I am leaving.&#x27; He was seventy-seven\n       years old.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_331\">           The note raised more questions than it answered:\n       Exactly how much did this old man who continued to live\n       as simply as before Ramdev&#x27;s meteoric rise borrow that he\n       could not repay the sum? Why did he borrow it? When had\n       he taken the loan? And from whom? More importantly -\n       why did Ramdev, sitting atop an empire worth at least Rs\n       100 crore, not repay the loan on his behalf? Why did\n       Shankar Dev not ask him for help? Or had he?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_346\">           Even though Karamveer had left the organization,\n       Shankar Dev, who missed him dearly, often called him -\n       sometimes for financial help. ‗I used to send whatever little\n       I could so he could get by,&#x27; says Karamveer. Vipin\n       Pradhan, a former aide and Karamveer&#x27;s nephew, says,\n       &#x27;By then, the trust was being run by ... relatives of Ramdev\n       who had come in from outside and had no intention, of\n       serving any interest other than their own. They treated\n       Shankar Dev badly and he was very unhappy.&#x27;&#x27;\n           Kararhveer says that once when he was visiting\n       Haridwar and staying with an old friend in Tripura\n       Ashram, &#x27;Shankar Dev came to meet me. They had sent\n       two people after him to do his CID {that is, to spy on him].\n       They waited at the gates while we met. I&#x27;m not sure why...\n       they [Ramdev and Balkrishna] had doubts [about Shankar\n       Dev] in their minds at the time... who knows what doubt...\n       what they were thinking at the time. It must have been a\n       very difficult situation for Shankar Dev.&#x27;\n           But it is Radhika Nagrath&#x27;s appraisal of the situation\n       that is most damning. Remember, Nagrath is the one who\n       designed Divya Pharmacy&#x27;s website in its early days. She is\n       still associated with Patanjali and has an obvious soft spot\n       for Ramdev, whom she speaks of with affection, though\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 207 of 211</span>\n        she is unhesitatingly honest. She says, &#x27;Shankar Dev was a\n       real saint - a very gentle guy. He felt ousted in his own\n       home. He did not get any compassion because these people\n       were in a race for something else. It was once his home,\n       his shelter. He used to sign all the expense cheques for the\n       trust at first [but] now the authority was taken away from\n       him and he was not happy with the way things had shaped\n       out. He had given these people shelter and now they had\n       no time for him ... they had no use for an old man any\n       more.&#x27;\n          An uneasy silence always follows questions about\n       Shankar Dev among Kankhal residents. People always ask,\n       &#x27;Can I trust you? Are you writing for him or against him?\n       You see, Ramdev has become too powerful. And look what-\n       happened to his guru ...&#x27;\n          After his pit stop at the House of Commons, Ramdev\n       continued his tour, travelling to Glasgow then back to\n       London, and finally ending his tour in Coventry on 8\n       August 2007. When he returned to India, more than three\n       weeks had passed since Shankar Dev&#x27;s disappearance. To\n       outside observers it seemed as though Ramdev was too\n       busy chasing fame and fortune, making them wonder: did\n       he even care?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_347\">          After his return, Ramdev summoned a press\n       connference in Haridwar, remembers the Jansatta reporter\n       and Haridwar resident Sunil Pandey. At the press\n       conference he was saying how Shankar Dev was like a\n       father to him and how sad it was ... I asked him that if he\n       really was like a father to him, why -didn&#x27;t he come back?\n          ―I was in the US, conducting camps, answered Ramdev.\n          ‗Well, if a family member disappeared, one would come\n       back, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27; Pandey pressed Ramdev.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_348\">          ‗If I knew he was alive, I would have,&#x27; replied Ramdev.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 208 of 211</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_349\">            &#x27;So you are admitting that you know that he is dead?&#x27;\n       demanded Pandey.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_350\">           That was the suspicion in everyone&#x27;s minds.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_351\">           Stunned, realizing he had misspoken, Ramdev fell\n       silent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_352\">           ‗Then his people just took over and changed the\n       subject.

Across the country, Ramdev&#x27;s\n       star was ascendant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_354\">           It was only in October 2012, five years after Shankar\n       Dev&#x27;s disappearance, that the Central Bureau of\n       Investigation (CBl), India&#x27;s apex investigative agency,\n       initiated a probe to find him. In his inimitable style,\n       Ramdev welcomed the investigation on the one hand, but\n       also attacked the CBI and the government, accusing them\n       of a politically motivated conspiracy to frame him m the\n       case. Given the sour relationship between Ramdev and the\n       Union government at that time, his allegation did have\n       some credence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_355\">           Whatever the CBI&#x27;s initial motivations, it was widely\n       reported- that it initiated a move to close the case in\n       December 2014 - by this time the Narendra Modi-led\n       government had taken charge at the-Centre - because the\n       agency had failed to make any headway. The special BJ\n       magistrate in Dehradun set the date for the next hearing as\n       12 January 2015 but this is where the public case file goes\n       cold.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_356\">           It&#x27;s hard to ascertain what happened thereafter. While a\n       right to information (RTI) request I filed with the CBI in\n       Delhi met with the response that the CBI was not covered\n       by the RTI, another filed in Dehradun met with the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">CM(M) 556/2018 &amp; 557/2018                             Page 209 of 211</span>\n        response that the CBI does not answer questions on open\n       cases.
