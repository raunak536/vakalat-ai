Right to seek divorce on the ground of\n\nimpotency would directly come in conflict with so called right to\n\nprivacy of the respondent.

DNA evidence has assumed great\n\nsignificance      and     legally    recognized       phenomenon.   Scientific\n\ninvestigations are need of our. DNA is a scientific test and its\n\naccuracy is 99.99 % and therefore, it can be used as evidence not\n\nonly in sexual assault and criminal cases, but also in civil cases\n\ninvolving question of paternity and succession.\n\n[15].        <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is based on\n\npresumption of public morality and public policy. The law presumes\n\nagainst vices and inmorality in a civilized society where it is\n\nimperative to presume legitimacy of a child born during the\n\ncontinuation of a valid marriage between his mother and any man or\n\nwithin 280 days after its dissolution, if the mother remained\n\nunmarried. Such legitimacy has presumption of conclusiveness,\n\nunless it is shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to\n\neach other at any time when the child could have been begotten.\n\nThis presumption cannot be displaced by mere probability or doubt.\n\nThe presumption can only be rebutted by a strong and conclusive\n\nevidence. Once the validity of marriage is proved, then there is a\n\nstrong presumption about the legitimacy of children born out of that\n\n                                        8 of 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:53:52 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\"> CR No.6239 of 2015(O&amp;M)                                                      9</span>\n\nwedlock.

Some of the High Courts have hinted that subjecting the\n\naccused to DNA test is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 20(3)</a> of Constitution of\n\nIndia. Obtaining samples from the accused for DNA profile does not\n\nviolate right against self-incrimination.

The privilege\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 20(3)</a> of Constitution of India is applicable only in\n\ntestimonial evidence. In a criminal case, obtaining DNA profile will\n\nnot violate right against self incrimination. The privilege applies only\n\nin evidence i.e. testimony in essence taken under duress. The right\n\nagainst self-incrimination is just a prohibition on the use of physical\n\nor moral compulsion to extort testimonial evidence from a person,\n\nnot an exclusion of evidence taken from his body when it may be\n\nmaterial and thus, the Court can compel a person male or female to\n\nsubmit for DNA test after incorporation of Section 53-A in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_32\">Criminal\n\nProcedure Code</a>, DNA test of accused is unavoidable in case of\n\nrape.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">                                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"139951018\" id=\"span_28\">9 of 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:53:52 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> CR No.6239 of 2015(O&amp;M)                                             10</span>\n\n[18].        In view of aforesaid precedents, DNA can be ordered in\n\norder to establish relationship by means of modern techniques, but\n\nat the same time, a person cannot be compelled to give evidence\n\nagainst himself and it would be extremely delicate and sensitive\n\naspect as it may lead to invasion of right to privacy that may have\n\ndevastating effect on the mind of the child or the person. The\n\nproposition has to be considered in the light of facts of individual\n\ncase. It is true that in these days of modern science, modern\n\ntechnology provided for possibility of proof of fact has to be given\n\nprecedence over <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act as these\n\nmodern facilities were not available when <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 112</a> of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act was enacted. The law <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_35\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_36\">Nandlal Wasudeo\n\nBadwalk</a>&#x27;s case (supra) can be referred on the aforesaid\n\nproposition. The proposition has to be tested with reference to facts\n\non record.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">[19].        The issue is with regard to birth of Chander Bhan,\n\nwhether he took birth from the wedlock of Bharto Devi with Ram\n\nSarup or from the Karewa wedlock of Bharto Devi with Jagdish. In\n\norder to establish Chander Bhan being son of Jagdish, proof of\n\nmarriage between Bharto Devi and Jagdish was sine qua non. No\n\nevidence of marriage between Bharto Devi and Jagdish has come\n\nforth on record. In such an eventuality, even if DNA profile of\n\nChander Bhan with Jagdish is established that would lend nowhere\n\nfor want of lawful Karewa between Bharto Devi and Jagdish. Even\n\nthough, incidental legitimacy of Chander Bhan would be on\n\n                                       10 of 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:53:52 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> CR No.6239 of 2015(O&amp;M)                                                11</span>\n\nexplanatory note in terms of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act\n\nthat would not be put to any roving inquiry in respect of infidelity of\n\nBharto Devi in the absence of any proof of Karewa marriage\n\nbetween Bharto Devi and Jagdish.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">[20].        In view of aforesaid, the Court has rightly observed that\n\nthere is no eminent need for leading such an evidence at this\n\njuncture. Allegation of infidelity cannot be appreciated in the light of\n\nstand taken by Bharto Devi herself wherein she has denied maternity\n\nviz-a-viz Chander Bhan. The legitimacy of Chander Bhan viz-a-viz\n\nrelationship of Bharto Devi with Jagdish cannot be established by\n\nway of DNA profile in the absence of proof of marriage between\n\nBharto Devi and Jagdish, therefore, trial Court was justified in\n\nobserving that the parties may lead their substantive evidence.\n\n[21].        In view of refusal of Bharto Devi from undergoing DNA\n\nprofile, the Court would be at liberty to act in accordance with law in\n\nthe event of finding existence of lawful marriage between Bharto\n\nDevi and Jagdish. Bullu Ram father-in-law of the plaintiff and father\n\nof Ram Sarup died on 06.12.1969. Mutation Nos.950/240/218 were\n\nsanctioned in respect of properties left by Bullu Ram considering that\n\nplaintiff-Bharto Devi was wife of Jagdish. In Civil Court Decree dated\n\n06.04.1978, mutations were held to be correct. Now dispute is with\n\nregard to property of Ram Sarup for which petitioner-defendant No.2\n\nbeing brother of Ram Sarup staked clamed on the ground that\n\nplaintiff was not entitled to separate 1/8th share which was of Ram\n\n\n\n                                       11 of 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 16-01-2017 02:53:52 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> CR No.6239 of 2015(O&amp;M)                                                   12</span>\n\nSarup as she was married to Jagdish. Plaintiff-Bharto Devi denied\n\nthe relationship with Jagdish. Karewa of plaintiff-Bharto Devi with\n\nJagdish has not been proved on record. Secondly, Chander Bhan\n\nhas not been impleaded as party to the suit against whom DNA\n\nprofile is being sought. Application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_38\">Order 1 Rule 10 CPC</a> is\n\nstatedly pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">[22].        In view of aforesaid, filing of application at this stage\n\nwould be wholly premature and no conclusive adjudication can be\n\nmade even in the light of precedents discussed hereinabove. At this\n\nstage, this Court does not see any lawful justification to interfere with\n\nthe impugned order dated 17.08.2015 passed by Civil Judge (Junior\n\nDivision), Kurukshetra.
