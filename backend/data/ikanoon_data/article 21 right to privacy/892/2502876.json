The report placed by the State shows that the victim\n\n   was examined by a medical team of four members at District Medical Board,\n\n   Mahasamund. The pregnancy has been reported of 21 weeks. It is also stated\n\n   that she is physically fit. The certificate of the medical board categorically\n\n   stated that she is found fit for the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP), at\n\n   the same time, the statement made in a criminal case in Crime No.370/19\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1153041/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 370 (A)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1938563/\" id=\"a_6\">372</a>, <a href=\"/doc/530949/\" id=\"a_7\">373</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_8\">376</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 6</a> of the Protection\n\n   of Children from Sexual Offences Act is perused.

The Supreme Court in the case of Meera Santosh Pal &amp; others Versus Union\n\n   of India and others {(2017) 3 SCC 462} has reiterated the view taken in the\n\n   case of Suchita Srivastava Vs. Chandigarh Admn {(2009) 9 SCC 1} and has\n\n   observed thus in para 9, which is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;9. In Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Admn {(2009) 9 SCC 1} a\n            Bench of three Judges held &quot;a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\n            choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as understood under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution&quot;. The Court there dealt with the\n            importance of the consent of the pregnant woman as an essential\n            requirement for proceeding with the termination of pregnancy. The\n            Court observed as follows :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;22. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\n            choices is also a dimension of &quot;personal liberty&quot; as understood under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is important to recognise that\n            reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to\n            abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s\n            right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This\n            means that there should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise\n            of reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation\n            in sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n            methods. Furthermore, women are also free to choose birth control\n            methods such as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken to their\n            logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement\n            to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to subsequently\n            raise children.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">5. <a href=\"/doc/36911/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a> of the Act, 1971 purports that provisions of <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 4</a> and sub-section\n\n   (2) of <a href=\"/doc/642477/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3</a> of the Act, 1971 wherein certain restrictions have been imposed\n\n   which relates to the length of the pregnancy, shall not apply to the termination of\n\n   a pregnancy when the opinion of the registered medical practitioner for\n\n   termination of pregnancy is on the good faith that such termination of pregnancy\n\n   is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. In case of a rape, if the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                 4</span>\n\n          woman is forced to carry on the pregnancy, then in such case, it would\n\n          eventually lead to social death of a woman as the stigma cannot be attached to\n\n          continue her for entire life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_7\">       6. The statement of the victim would show that she was subjected to rape.        The\n\n          petitioner No. 1 herein is a minor represented through her mother. The report of\n\n          the doctors further shows that there is no risk if the termination of pregnancy is\n\n          caused and it is stated that she is fit to undergo M.T.P.                Under the\n\n          circumstances, taking into this fact that the petitioner No.1 was subjected to\n\n          rape thereby the pregnancy occurred, the prayer to terminate the pregnancy is\n\n          allowed, specially taking into the medical report of the petitioner No.1 is\n\n          approved.     The petitioner No.1 shall be admitted to the District Hospital,\n\n          Mahasamund wherein by the team of doctors in the supervision of medical\n\n          expert, the termination of pregnancy shall be caused. The DNA sample of the\n\n          fetus shall also be taken for further evidence as criminal case against the\n\n          accused is pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_9\">       7.
