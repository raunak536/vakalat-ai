It  is true\tour Constitution\n     does not  expressly declare a right\n     to privacy\t as a  fundamental right\n     but the  said right is an essential\n     ingredient\t of   personal\t liberty\n     Every    democratic\t country\n     sanctifies\t domestic  life;  it  is\n     expected to give him rest, physical\n     happiness,\t peace\t of   mind   and\n     security.

But the right to hold\na telephone  conversation in  the privacy  of ones  home  or\noffice without\tinterference can  certainly  be\t claimed  as\n&quot;right to privacy&quot;. Conversations on the telephone are often\nof  an\t intimate  and\t confidential  character.  Telephone\nconversation  is   a  part  of\tmodern\tman&#x27;s  life.  It  is\nconsidered so important that more and more people are\ncarrying mobile telephone instruments in their pockets.\nTelephone conversation\tis an  important facet\tof  a  man&#x27;s\nprivate life.  Right  to  privacy  would  certainly  include\ntelephone-conversation in  the\tprivacy\t of  one&#x27;s  home  or\noffice.

The  CBI investigation\thas revealed\nseveral lapses\tin the\texecution of the orders passed under\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5(2)</a>  of the Act, Paras 21 and 22 of the report have\nalready been quoted in the earlier part of this judgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">     The Second\t Press Commission  in paras 164, 165 and 166\nof its\treport has  commented on the &quot;tapping of telephones&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">     &quot;Tapping of Telephones\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     164. It  is felt  in some quarters,\n     not  without   reason,   that   not\n     infrequently the  Press in\t general\n     and  its\teditorial  echelons   in\n     particular have  to suffer\t tapping\n     of telephone.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     165. Tapping  of  telephones  is  a\n     serious invasion  of privacy.  is a\n     variety\t  of\t   technological\n     eavesdropping, Conversation  on the\n     telephone are  often of an intimate\n     and  confidential\t character.  The\n     relevant\tstatue,\t  i.e.,\t  <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_58\">Indian\n     Telegraph Act,  1885</a>,  a  piece  of\n     ancient   legislation,   does   not\n     concern   itself\t with\ttapping.\n     Tapping cannot  the regarded  as  a\n     tort because  the law  as it stands\n     today does\t not know of any general\n     right to privacy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">     166. This\tis a hardly satisfactory\n     situation.\t There\t are   instances\n     where appprehensions  of disclosure\n     of sources\t of information\t as well\n     as the character of information may\n     result in constraints on freedom of\n     information    and\t   consequential\n     drying  up\t  of  its   source.  We,\n     therefore,\t     recommend\t    that\n     telephones may not be tapped except\n     in\t  the\tinterest   of\tnational\n     security\t public\t    order     of\n     investigation. of crime and similar\n     objectives, under\torders\tmade  in\n     writing by\t the Minister concerned,\n     or an  officer of\trank to whom the\n     power in  that behalf is delegated.\n     The order\tshould disclose reasons.\n     An order  for tapping of telephones\n     should expire after three months in\n     from  the\t date  of   the\t  order.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">     Moreover within  a period,\t of  six\n     weeks the\torder should come up for\n     review before  an Board constituted\n     on the  lines prescribed in statues\n     providing for preventive detention.\n     It\t should\t be  for  the  Board  to\n     decide   whether\ttapping\t  should\n     continue any  longer. The\tdecision\n     of the  Board should  be binding on\n     the Government.  It  may  be  added\n     that the  Minister or his delegates\n     will be  competent to issue a fresh\n     order for\ttapping of the telephone\n     if circumstances  call for\t it. <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_59\">The\n     Telegraph\tAct</a>   should  contain  a\n     clause  to\t  give\teffect\tto  this\n     recommendation.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">     While dealing  with <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act, the Second\nPress  Commission   gave  following   suggestions  regarding\n&quot;public emergency&quot; and &quot;interest of public safety&quot;:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">     &quot;160. It  may be  noticed that  the\n     public emergency\tmentioned in the\n     sub-section  is  not  an  objective\n     fact. Some\t public functionary must\n     determine its  existence and  it is\n     on the  basis of the existence of a\n     public emergency that an authorised\n     official should  exercise the power\n     of\t withholding   transmission   of\n     telegrams.\t We   think   that   the\n     appropriate     government\t  should\n     declare the existence of the public\n     emergency\t by    a    notification\n     warranting\t the  exercise\tof  this\n     power and\tit  is\tonly  after  the\n     issue of  such a  notification that\n     the       power   of    withholding\n     telegraphic  messages   should   be\n     exercise\tby    the      delegated\n     authority.\t    When      such     a\n     notification   is\t  issued,    the\n     principal officer\tof the telegraph\n     office can be required to submit to\n     be the District Magistrate, whom we\n     consider to be the proper person to\n     be the delegate for exercising this\n     power, such  telegrams brought  for\n     transmission which are likely to be\n     prejudicial to  the interest sought\n     to be protected by the Sub-Section.\n     Thereupon the  District  Magistrate\n     should pass  an  order  in\t writing\n     withholding   or\t allowing    the\n     transmission of  the  telegram.  We\n     are suggesting  the safeguard  of a\n     prior  notification  declaring  the\n     existence\tof  a  public  emergency\n     because the  power of  interception\n     is drastic\t power and  we are loath\n     to\t leave\t the  determination   of\n     existence of  a public emergency in\n     the hands of a delegate&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">     &quot;We are  of the  view that whenever\n     the  power\t  is  exercised\t in  the\n     interest  of   public  safety.   it\n     should,  as  far  as  possible,  be\n     exercised\t bag\tthe    concerned\n     Minister\tof    the    appropriate\n     government for  one month at a time\n     extendible\t by  Government\t if  the\n     emergency\tcontinues.   However  in\n     exceptional circumstances the power\n     can be  delegated to  the\tDistrict\n     Magistrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">     163 We  also think\t that as soon as\n     order is  passed  by  the\tDistrict\n     Magistrate\t    withholding\t     the\n     transmission   of\t a   telegraphic\n     Message, it  should be communicated\n     to the Central or State Governments\n     as the case may be, and also to the\n     sender and\t the  addressee\t of  the\n     telegram. The  text  of  the  order\n     should be\tplaced on  the table  of\n     the respective  State  legislatures\n     after three  months.  We  recommend\n     that, as\tsuggested  by the  Press\n     Council  of  India\t in  its  annual\n     report covering  1969, the\t officer\n     in charge\tof  a  telegraph  office\n     should maintain  a register  giving\n     particulars of the time of receipt,\n     the sender\t and  address  of  every\n     telegram which  he\t refers\t to  the\n     district\t   Magistrate\t    with\n     recommendation of\tits withholding.\n     Similarly, the  District Magistrate\n     should maintain  a register  of the\n     time receipt, content and addressee\n     of each  telegram\tand  record  his\n     decision thereon  together with the\n     time of  the decision. Data of this\n     nature  will help courts, if called\n     upon, to  determine the presence or\n     absence  of  a  mala  fide\t in  the\n     withholding of  telegrams&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">     According to  Mr. Sachar  the only way to safeguard the\nright of  privacy of  an individual  is that there should be\nprior judicial\tscrutiny before\t any  order  for  telephone-\ntapping is  passed under  <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act. He states\nthat such  judicial scrutiny  may  be  exparte.\t Mr.  Sachar\ncontended that\tthe judicial  scrutiny alone would take away\nthe apprehension of arbitrariness or unreasonableness of the\naction. Mr.  Kapil Sibal,  on the  other hand  has suggested\nvarious other  safeguards short of prior judicial scrutiny -\nbased on the law on the subject in England as enacted by the\nInterception of the Communications Act, 1985.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">     We agree  with Mr.\t Sibal that  in the  absence of\t any\nprovision in  the statute, it is not possible to provide for\nprior judicial scrutiny as a procedural safeguard. It is for\nthe Central  Government to make rules under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 7</a> of the\nAct. Rule  7(2)(b) specifically\t provides that\tthe  Central\nGovernment may\tmake rules laying down the precautions to be\ntaken for preventing the improper interception or disclosure\nof messages. <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_63\">The Act</a> was enacted in the year 1885. The power\nto make\t rules under <a href=\"/doc/1464865/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 7</a> of the Act has been there for\nover a century but the Central Government has not thought it\nproper to frame the necessary rules despite severe criticism\nof the manner in which the power under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 5(2)</a> has been\nexercised. It is entirely for the Central Government to make\nrules on  the subject but till the time it is done the right\nto privacy  of an individual has to be safeguarded. In order\nto rule-out  arbitrariness in  the exercise  of power  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 5(2)</a>  of the  Act and  till  the  time\tthe  Central\nGovernment lays\t down just,  fair and  reasonable  procedure\nunder <a href=\"/doc/179207/\" id=\"a_67\">Section  7(2)(b)</a> of  the Act,  it is  necessary to lay\ndown procedural\t safeguards for\t the exercise of power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 5(9)</a>  of the  Act so  that the right to privacy of a\nperson is protected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">     We, therefore, order and direct as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">1.
