In\nthe year 2002 the respondent started to construct a\nhouse and for the same he has demanded dowry from the\npetitioner, when she expressed her inability to arrange\nthe money he assaulted the petitioner. After completion\nof the house they shifted to Mangalore because the\nrespondent was transferred to Mangalore. Thereafter also\nrespondent No.1 again started his old habit of drinking\nalcohol and coming to the home in the late night and\nassaulting the petitioner       ever day.

The    following   points     that   arises    for    my\nconsideration are as under;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">          1.

What order?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">     8.     On perusal of materials before this court,            my\nfindings on the above points are as follows;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                  Point No.1 : In the affirmative;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                  Point No.2 : Partly in the affirmative;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">                  Point No.3 : As per final order for the\n                                    following;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  7</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                                                     Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n                             REASONS\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">     9.       Point No.1 : In a domestic violence case the\npetitioner has       to prove    the domestic        relationship\nbetween herself and respondent, she was residing with\nthe respondent in a shared           household, the domestic\nviolence was caused by the respondent upon her. The\nrespondent has       neglected    the petitioner without any\nreasonable cause and the respondent is                   capable to\nprovide maintenance to the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     10. In this case, there is no dispute regarding the\nrelationship between parties. Hence, it is proved that the\npetitioner     and    the   respondent        are   in    domestic\nrelationship. It is also an admitted fact that, the\npetitioner and respondent resided together till the date of\nseparation. Hence they have resided together in a shared\nhousehold. It is also not disputed they have 2 sons from\nthe wed lock and both have attained majority.              Only the\naspect of domestic violence needs to be proved by the\npetitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">     11. In order to prove that, the respondent has\ncommitted       domestic    violence,   the    petitioner       has\nexamined herself as P.W.1 and filed her affidavit in lieu of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      8</span>\n                                                        Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nher examination in chief wherein she has reiterated the\ncontents      of   her   petition.       She   has    produced      31\ndocuments and got them marked as Ex.P.1 to 31. It is\nallegation of the petitioner that, at the time of marriage\nrespondent demanded dowry of one gold chain, gold ring,\none watch, 350 grams of gold and spent Rs.5 lakhs\ntowards     marriage      expenses.        Even      after   marriage\nrespondent demanded for additional dowry and abused\nher in filthy language, harassed her and abused her\nsaying he would get more dowry if he had married some\nother girl.        She has alleged that, he demanded dowry\nfrom her when he constructed house in 2002. She has\nalleged that, he was not providing her proper food,\ntreating her as a maid servant and also coming home\nlate in the night in a drunken state and abusing her. She\nhas alleged that, he was demanding additional dowry\nfrom her.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">     12. Respondent has denied the said allegation and\ncontended that, petitioner&#x27;s parents did not have the\nmeans to spend such huge amount and conduct the\nmarriage in the year 1990. Further it is contended that,\nthere is no custom of receiving or giving dowry in CSI\nIndian Christian community. It is also contended that,\npetitioner has not submitted any proof regarding giving\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                9</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ndowry to the respondent. In this regard it is elicited from\nthe   petitioner   in   her   cross   examination      dated\n16.08.2023 that there is no custom of receiving and\ngiving dowry in their community.          She has further\nadmitted in the cross examination        that, she has not\nproduced any documents in support of her allegations.\nShe has also admitted that, the gold jewelry is in her\npossession. She has admitted that her father was\nworking as Post Master at Shimoga and receiving gross\nsalary of around Rs.3,500/- and her mother was working\nas government school primary teacher. Further her\nbrother was studying engineering at the time of her\nmarriage. She has admitted that, at the time of marriage\nthey were also constructing their house. Respondent has\nsubmitted Ex.R.1 which is the RTI information obtained\nby him from BEO, Shimoga regarding salary of a primary\ngovernment school teacher serving in April 1990.            In\nEx.R.1 it is stated that basic pay would be Rs.1,040/-\nand DA Rs.302/-, HRA Rs.100/- for such a government\nschool teacher serving in 1990. Respondent has argued\nthat, the gross pay of both the parents of the petitioner in\nthe year 1990 would be approximately Rs.5,000/-.\nFurther they were constructing their house and brother\nof the petitioner was dependent on the parents. Hence,\nthey could not afforded to spend Rs.14 lakhs on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                               10</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nmarriage of the petitioner.        From the admissions of\nP.W.1 in cross examination and from the fact that there\nis no evidence before the Court regarding demanding or\ngiving of dowry before the Court petitioner is unable to\nprove that respondent had demanded dowry at the time\nof marriage.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">        13. It is also alleged by the petitioner that,\nrespondent used to abuse her in filthy and vulgar\nlanguage and come home late in the night in a drunken\nstate and assault her brutally every day.       Admittedly,\npetitioner has not mentioned any specific instances with\ndate and time in her evidence.        There is no evidence\nbefore the Court with respect to any medical treatment\nthat petitioner has obtained as a result of such assault.\nShe has also not produced any evidence to show that\nrespondent was drinking every day and coming home\nlate.    Although, this Court cannot expect independent\nevidence with respect to abuses, insults etc., still when it\nis alleged that petitioner was being assaulted everyday\nthere must be some corroborative evidence.        Hence, it\nappears that she has made general and sweeping\nallegations against the respondent.         Petitioner has\nalleged that, she was been treated like an maid servant\nto do all the household chores. But the petitioner in her\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   11</span>\n                                                    Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ncross examination dated 11.09.2023 in             para one has\nadmitted that, there was a housemaid who was doing all\nthe household chores and there was a care taker to take\ncare of the children in 1994 when she was residing along\nwith the respondent and his mother.           This admission of\nthe petitioner proves that petitioner was not treated as a\nhousemaid by the respondent. Further she has alleged\nthat, respondent was not giving her household articles\nfor cooking.    But petitioner in her cross examination\ndated 16.08.2023 in para No.7 has admitted that,\nrespondent was provided her all the household articles\nand he had also appointed a maid to do all the household\nchores.    This admission of the petitioner proves that,\nrespondent took care of all the household expenses.\nPetitioner has alleged that, respondent had abducted her\nchildren in June 1998 and kept them in his brother&#x27;s\nhouse and also assaulted her.              There is no evidence\nbefore this Court regarding this incident. Hence, this\nallegation of the petitioner is not proved.            It is also\nalleged   by   the   petitioner    that,    respondent    started\ndemanding dowry in the year 2002 when he started\nconstructing a house. In this regard petitioner has not\nsubmitted any evidence.           Respondent in his cross\nexamination    has    categorically    denied     receiving    any\nfinancial help from the petitioner             at the time of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                   12</span>\n                                                    Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nconstruction of 1st floor of BTM Layout house.             Hence,\npetitioner is unable to prove this allegation.          It is the\ncontention of the respondent that, he had received the\nhouse at BTM Layout, 1st stage comprising of 2 portions\nfrom his mother through a gift deed and he constructed\n1st   floor     by   obtaining   loan   of   Rs.4   lakhs     and\nRs.1,05,000/- from his GPF savings.             Thereafter, he\nshifted along with petitioner and his children to the said\nhouse.        He has submitted that, petitioner has obtained\ninjunction from the Hon&#x27;ble Family Court with respect to\nthe first floor of the house where she is residing and she\nhas also trespassed into the ground floor and she is\nreceiving rent of Rs.30,000/- per month from the ground\nfloor of the house.      As per the cause title petitioner is\ncurrently residing in the said house.          Admittedly, the\nhouse at BTM Layout is shared household of the\npetitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      14. It is the main allegation of the petitioner that,\nin 2010 respondent started having a relationship outside\nof the marriage with a lady by name Muthurani and he\nstarted neglecting the petitioner and her children. She\nhas alleged that, he was not coming home regularly and\nwas not interested to come home and respondent was\ngoing on holidays and tours with the said Muthurani.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               13</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nEven after parents have advised the respondent, even\nafter   panchayath   was   conducted   respondent     never\nchanged his behaviour and he started to reside with\nMuthurani by neglecting the petitioner. It is alleged that,\nhe was busy in chatting with the said lady in a indecent\nlanguage, organizing many music programs. In support\nof her contentions she has submitted Ex.P.1 which is the\nwhats app conversation said to be between respondent\nand the said lady, Ex.P.2 SMS said to be exchanged\nbetween respondent and Muthurani, transcript and\naudio recordings of conversation between respondent and\nMuthurani marked as Ex.P.3 and 4, complaint filed by\nthe petitioner   against the respondent before the State\nWomen Commission and the mediation conducted in the\nsaid State Women Commission marked as Ex.P.5.

Respondent has denied this allegation and he\nhas contended that, these are vague allegations made by\nthe petitioner.   He has submitted that,Muthurani is\nknown to him as she was working in NGO by name\nGirzim at Eijipura, Bangalore where the respondent was\na donor.    He has stated that, she was talented in\ncomposing devotional songs and writing lyrics. She and\nher group approached the respondent for sponsoring a\nTamil Christian music CD and respondent consented and\nsponsored the same. They released a CD by name\nSaatchiyin Muthukkal in the year 2015 and 2nd volume in\nthe year 2017. He has submitted that, his 1 st son drove\nthe car and took the respondent to the CD release\nfunction of the 1st volume and the 2nd son came to the CD\nrelease function of the 2nd volume. He has submitted the\nCD cover of both the volumes as Ex.R.57.           He has\nsubmitted that, petitioner was very well aware about the\nproduction of CD and she is making a false allegation of\nillegal affair way after release of the CD. He has alleged\nthat, it is the petitioner   who has refused to maintain\nproper marital relationships since December 2011 and\nshe has refused to cohabit with the respondent. Further\nshe is making false allegations against the respondent. It\nis further contended by the respondent that, in December\n2011 he caught the petitioner with some love messages\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 15</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nin the phone and one love letter written by one of her\nB.Ed., classmate during December 2011 indicating illegal\naffair with another man which shattered their marital\nrelationship. Hence, when the respondent came to know\nabout this he advised the petitioner to mend her ways\nbut petitioner      fought with him immediately shifted to\nanother room in the same house and stopped all the\ncommunications with respondent, boycotted all social\nfunctions and totally stopped the marital relationship\nand stopped cohabitation.      Respondent after waiting for\na long time for the petitioner       to mend her ways he\napproached Karnataka State Legal Service authority for\npre-litigation mediation by application dated 08.04.2013\nmarked as Ex.R.6 and 7. It is submitted that, petitioner\nwas not ready to reconcile hence councilor advised them\nto take divorce. He has submitted that, respondent did\nnot approach legal service authority for divorce but for\nmediation and till now respondent has not filed any\ndivorce petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">     16. The main contention of the respondent is that\nall the evidence emanating from 3 mobile phone handsets\ni.e., Nokia5 basic handset, LG90 phone handset and LG6\nphone handset are not admissible in evidence.            It is\ncontended that, the said mobile phones have been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               16</span>\n                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nobtained fraudulently as they were kept in locked steel\nalmirah of respondent in his room and the keys were\nwith the respondent.    Petitioner broke open the lock of\nthe almirah by committing an offence of theft and\nobtained the same. Hence, respondent has filed police\ncomplaint for the same on 29.05.2018 vide NCR PO\n2197180600338 before Suddaguntepalya police. He has\nstated that he has submitted Ex.R.21 in this regard. He\nhas further contended that, his LG6 phone was robbed\nby the petitioner   and her son by assaulting him on\n20.01.2018 when he had visited the house at KEB Layout\nat 8.00 a.m. and on the same day he has lodged a\ncomplaint against the petitioner and her sons.      He has\nsubmitted Ex.R.20 to 27 in this regard.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">     17. Subsequently only on 4.10.2018 one CD said\nto contain the above SMS, photos and voice recordings\nwere produced before this Court as evidence without\nfollowing proper procedure under <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_4\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Indian\nEvidence Act. The Court refused to accept the same as no\nproper procedure was followed. In the affidavit filed while\nproducing the CD the petitioner has declared from SIM\nthe data was copied to the CD. Whereas, in both the old\nphone Nokia E5 and LG 90 there was no SIM as when\nthe old phone was replaced by the respondent with new\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 17</span>\n                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nphones he had put the same SIM to new phone. Later\nshe has changed her declaration stating that from phone\nmemory she has got the data copied to CD. She has also\nfalsely declared that, the phones were in working\ncondition and was in use in the hands of the respondent.\nWhich is false and misleading as the phones were spoiled\nand were not currently in use and were not in use ever\nsince 2015 and 2016 itself. Also the devices were not\npetitioner&#x27;s and was not in use by her so she cannot give\ndeclaration in respect of the device which does not belong\nto her.    This is clear violation of <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_5\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Evidence\nAct. He has further contended that, petitioner has mis-\ndeclared in her affidavit dated 04.10.2018 that the said\ndevice was in use whereas the said devise was sent for\nForensic    examination    on   17.07.2018   and    it   was\neffectively not in use for 4 years and 2 months.\nRespondent raised objection on the said application of\nthe petitioner on 03.11.2018 and the Court rejected the\napplication and accepted the certificate filed by the\npetitioner U/<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_6\">Sec.65(B)</a> by its order dated 16.11.2019.\nHe has further submitted that, with respect to his mobile\nhandset LG6 he had activated voice recording facility for\nhis safety however it was interfering with the call quality\nhence he uninstalled the same and deleted all the call\nrecordings but petitioner and her sons have retrieved the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                  18</span>\n                                                 Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ncall recordings and installed them back to the device by\ncreating their version to create evidence and they have\nsent the same to Forensic examination on 07.09.2018. It\nis further submitted that, the Forensic expert has\nretrieved the call recordings lodged in PCB memory and\nreproduced this version of call recordings.      The Forensic\nexperts have no where stated that the voice in the said\nrecording belongs to the respondent. The sample voice of\nthe respondent was never taken and never matched with\nthat of the voice contained in the mobile handset.\nTherefore, the voice recordings cannot be accepted as\nevidence. It is argued that as per <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_7\">Sec.65(A)</a> &amp; (B) of\nIndian Evidence Act the procedure laid down should be\nfollowed and certificate should be given by the owner or\nlawful operator of the device and the device should be in\nworking condition and currently in use. In this case the\npetitioner is not the owner of the device and few of the\ndevices were not in working condition. Further they were\npassword protected.       He has further argued that, the\nproduction   of   whats    app    conversation    and    audio\nconversation from him phone is a breach of his right to\nprivacy protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">article 21</a> of Constitution of India\nwhich is his fundamental right. He has relied on the\njudgments of CRMP No.2112/2022 of Hon&#x27;ble High Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                  19</span>\n                                                    Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nof Chhattisgarh and 2015 0 Supreme (Raj) 372 of Hon&#x27;ble\nHigh Court of Rajasthan.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">      18. The learned counsel for the respondent has\ncontended that, all the whats app conversations, audio\nconversations are supported by certificate U/<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">Sec.65-B</a> of\nIndian Evidence Act        issued by the Forensic Lab.\nFurther respondent himself admits that, 2 of his phones\ni.e., LGD 410, Nokia E500 were with the petitioner.\nFurther argued that, petitioner has submitted the\nprimary evidence i.e., the 2 LG phones and one Nokia\nphone along with its SIM card to the Court as Ex.P.7 and\nthe same is kept in safe custody of the Court.            Hence,\npetitioner has complied with <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_10\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Indian Evidence\nAct   by producing the primary evidence itself.          Further\nthe Court has accepted the evidence.                 Hence, the\ncontentions of the respondent are not acceptable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      19. This   Court     has        closely   scrutinized    the\nelectronic/digital evidence submitted by the petitioner\nvide Ex.P.1 to 4 and Ex.P.7 to 9. The objection of the\nrespondent with respect to the electronic/digital evidence\nis mainly 3 fold viz., the said evidence is not admissible\nsince it is obtained fraudulently, there is non compliance\nof <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">Sec.65-B</a> of Indian Evidence Act, the said evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                      20</span>\n                                                    Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nbreaches respondent&#x27;s fundamental right to privacy\nguaranteed to him under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">article 21</a> of Constitution of\nIndia.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">     20. Before dealing with the legal contentions\nraised by the respondent with respect to admissibility\nand breach of privacy it is necessary to consider if the\nrespondent is able to prove that petitioner has gained\naccess to the 3 mobile phones marked in Ex.P.7\nfraudulently.        In order to prove the said contention\nrespondent      is    relying   on    Ex.R.21   which    is   NCR\nNO.PO219180600338 dated 29.05.2018.                 In the said\nNCR it is stated that, petitioner has taken 2 mobile\nphones of the respondent and he has requested the\npolice to get back his mobile phones and other valuable\nproperties.    Ex.R.22 is said to be the complaint on the\nbasis of which Ex.R.21 / NCR is registered. In the said\ncomplaint respondent has mentioned that petitioner has\ntaken his old LG90 phone and old Nokia phone.                  But\nEx.R.22 does not bear the seal or signature of the\nreceiving     authority.        Hence,    Ex.R.22   cannot      be\nconsidered.     Moreover, Ex.R.21 is registered after the\npresent case was filed.          It is the contention of the\nrespondent that, he had kept his 2 old phones in his\nsteel almirah under lock and key. The petitioner has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                               21</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nbroken the lock and opened the almirah and stolen 2 of\nhis old phones i.e., LG90 and Nokia phone. But no such\nallegation is made by the respondent in Ex.R.21 and\ndetails of the phones are also not given by the\nrespondent. Since, Ex.R.21 is registered after the filing of\nthe present petition it appears respondent has created\nEx.R.21 and 22 to suit his case.         Further it is the\nallegation of the respondent that, petitioner and her sons\nhave snatched his LG6 phone in the incident that\nallegedly occurred on 20.01.2018.          Ex.R.40 is the\ncomplaint lodged by the respondent in this regard.      Even\nin this complaint respondent has only mentioned that\npetitioner and her sons took his LG6 phone.      But police\nhave not filed the charge sheet against the petitioner for\ntheft.   Presumably, police have not found sufficient\nevidence to prove that petitioner and her sons have taken\nrespondent&#x27;s LG6 phone in the alleged incident dated\n20.01.2018. Respondent has given Ex.R.36 statement to\nKarnataka State Women Commission on 18.05.2018\neven in this letter there is mention of only 2 phones\nwithout the details of the phone. Even Ex.R.36 letter is\nsubmitted by the respondent after petitioner filed the\npresent petition.    There was no impediment to the\nrespondent to state his contention in the present petition\nin Ex.R.40 and Ex.R.36. Even in his statement of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                22</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nobjection respondent has not mentioned anything about\nthe petitioner stealing 2 of his phones from his lock steel\nalmirah and    the petitioner and her sons robbing LG6\nphone on 20.01.2018. This contention of the respondent\nis a de-novo contention which he has introduced for the\nvery first time in the written arguments.      Therefore, it\nappears that respondent is creating this version about\npetitioner stealing his 3 phones after the petitioner filed\nthe present petition only to suit his case and to exclude\nthe digital / electronic evidence in the present case.\nTherefore, respondent has not been able to prove that\npetitioner has obtained the digital / electronic evidence\nby committing theft.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">     21. Before dealing with the objection of the\nrespondent with respect to non compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_13\">Sec.65-B</a> of\nIndian Evidence Act; it is necessary to thoroughly read\n<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_14\">Sec.65</a> of Indian Evidence Act. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_15\">Chapter-V of Indian\nEvidence Act</a> deals with documentary evidence and it\ncontains <a href=\"/doc/1915814/\" id=\"a_16\">Sec.61</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1942836/\" id=\"a_17\">100</a>.

The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Arjun Pandith\nRao Khotkar V/s Kailash Kushan Rao Gorantyal reported\nin 2020 SCC Online SC 571 after analyzing <a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_23\">Sec.62</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1456410/\" id=\"a_24\">63</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_25\">65</a> and <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_26\">65(B)</a> of Indian Evidence Act held, &quot;the situation\nwould have been different had the appellant adduced\nprimary evidence, by making available in evidence, the\nCDs used for announcement and songs. Had those CDs\nused for objectionable songs or announcements been\nduly   got    seized   through    the   police   or   Election\nCommission and had the same been used as primary\nevidence, the High Court could have played the same in\ncourt to see whether the allegations were true. That is\nnot the situation in this case. The speeches, songs and\nannouncements were recorded using other instruments\nand by feeding them into a computer, CDs were made\nthere from which were produced in court, without due\ncertification. Those CDs cannot be admitted in evidence\nsince the mandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 65- B </a>of the\nEvidence Act are not satisfied. It is clarified that\nnotwithstanding what we have stated herein in the\npreceding paragraphs on the secondary evidence of\nelectronic record with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1385485/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 59</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_29\">65-A</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_30\">65-B</a> of the Evidence Act, if an electronic record as such\nis used as primary evidence under <a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 62</a> of the\nEvidence Act, the same is admissible in evidence, without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                              31</span>\n                                             Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ncompliance with the conditions in <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 65-B</a> of the\nEvidence Act.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">    26.   Further in the said judgment it is held,\n\n     &quot;coming back to <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 65B</a> of the Indian\n     Evidence Act, sub- section (1) needs to be\n     analysed. The sub-section begins with a non-\n     obstante clause, and then goes on to mention\n     information contained in an electronic record\n     produced by a computer, which is, by a deeming\n     fiction, then made a &quot;document&quot;. This deeming\n     fiction only takes effect if the further conditions\n     mentioned in the Section are satisfied in relation\n     to both the information and the computer in\n     question; and if such conditions are met, the\n     &quot;document&quot; shall then be admissible in any\n     proceedings. The words &quot;...without further proof or\n     production of the original...&quot; make it clear that\n     once the deeming fiction is given effect by the\n     fulfillment of the conditions mentioned in the\n     Section, the &quot;deemed document&quot; now becomes\n     admissible in evidence without further proof or\n     production of the original as evidence of any\n     contents of the original, or of any fact stated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              32</span>\n                                                   Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ntherein    of     which   direct     evidence      would     be\nadmissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">     The non-obstante clause in sub-section (1)\nmakes it clear that when it comes to information\ncontained in an electronic record, admissibility\nand proof thereof must follow the drill of Section\n65B, which is a special provision in this behalf -\n<a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_34\">Sections 62</a> to <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_35\">65</a> being irrelevant for this purpose.\nHowever,        Section   65B(1)   clearly    differentiates\nbetween the &quot;original&quot; document - which would be\nthe original &quot;electronic record&quot; contained in the\n&quot;computer&quot; in which the original information is\nfirst stored - and the computer output containing\nsuch information, which then may be treated as\nevidence    of     the    contents     of    the    &quot;original&quot;\ndocument. All this necessarily shows that Section\n65B differentiates between the original information\ncontained in the &quot;computer&quot; itself and copies made\ntherefrom - the former being primary evidence,\nand the latter being secondary evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">  Quite obviously, the requisite certificate in sub-\nsection (4) is unnecessary if the original document\nitself is produced. This can be done by the owner\nof a laptop computer, a computer tablet or even a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                          33</span>\n                                            Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nmobile phone, by stepping into the witness box\nand proving that the concerned device, on which\nthe original information is first stored, is owned\nand/or operated by him. In cases where &quot;the\ncomputer&quot;, as defined, happens to be a part of a\n&quot;computer system&quot; or &quot;computer network&quot; (as\ndefined in the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_36\">Information Technology Act, 2000</a>)\nand it becomes impossible to physically bring such\nnetwork or system to the Court, then the only\nmeans of proving information contained in such\nelectronic record can be in accordance with\nSection   65B(1),   together   with   the     requisite\ncertificate under Section 65B(4). This being the\ncase, it is necessary to clarify what is contained in\nthe last sentence in paragraph 24 of Anvar P.V.\n(supra) which reads as &quot;...if an electronic record as\nsuch is used as primary evidence under <a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n62</a> of the Evidence Act...&quot;.         This may         more\nappropriately be read without the words &quot;under\n<a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 62</a> of the Evidence Act,...&quot;. With this minor\nclarification, the law stated in paragraph 24 of\nAnvar P.V. (supra) does not need to be revisited&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                               34</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">    27.   Thus as per the above judgment when primary\nevidence is submitted before the Court it is not necessary\nto comply with <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_39\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Indian Evidence Act. In this\ncase petitioner has submitted the primary evidence i.e.,\nthe 3 mobile phones i.e., one Nokia handset and 2 LG\nhandsets along with 3 SIM cards marked as Ex.P.7.\nHence, in view of the production of the primary evidence\nitself it is not necessary for the petitioner to comply with\n<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_40\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Indian Evidence Act. It is pertinent to note\nthat, respondent is not denying ownership of the 3\nmobile phones produced in Ex.P.7. It is his case that,\nthe petitioner has stolen one LG mobile phone and one\nNokia phone and she has snatched another LG mobile\nphone from him while assaulting him in 2018.               As\nalready discussed respondent is unable to prove that\npetitioner has stolen the 3 mobile phones from him.\nSince, respondent is admitting the ownership of the said\nphones the evidence emanating from the said phone is\nalso acceptable especially since the primary evidence i.e.,\nthe phones are submitted to the Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">    28.   It is the contention of the respondent that, he\nhad kept his LG90 phone and Nokia phone under lock\nand key in his steel almirah in his house and petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                35</span>\n                                                Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nhas broken the lock of the steel almirah and he has\nstolen the phones.      The son of the respondent Philbert\nPratheek Chandra is an expert in hardware and he has\nimplanted the evidence.       Further his LG6 phone was\nsnatched by the petitioner          and her sons.      Hence,\npetitioner has obtained evidence illegally and therefore,\nit is not acceptable.     As already stated respondent is\nunable to prove that petitioner has illegally obtained the\nphones. Even if it is assumed that petitioner has illegally\nobtained the phones the evidence emanating from such\nphones are admissible. In this regard reference can be\nhad to the decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RM\nMalkani V/s State of Maharashtra reported in (1973) 1\nSCC 471 laid down the following conditions to allow tape\nrecorded conversation to be admissible as evidence before\na Court of law.     It is held in the said decision &quot;tape\nrecorded conversation is admissible provided first the\nconversation is relevant to the matters in issue, secondly\nthere is identification of the voice, thirdly the accuracy of\nthe tape recorded conversation is proved by eliminating\nthe possibility of erasing the tape recorder.       The tape\nrecorded conversation is therefore a relevant fact U/<a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_41\">Sec.8</a>\nof Indian Evidence Act and is admissible U/<a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_42\">Sec.7</a> of\nIndian Evidence Act&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                 36</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                                                   Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">    29.     Therefore,    by   applying    above        mentioned\nprinciples laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court even\nin the present case the recorded audio conversations and\nthe messages exchanged between the respondent and his\nparamour are relevant to the matter in issue.             Firstly,\npetitioner has to prove the accuracy of the conversation.\nFor this petitioner has submitted report and certificate of\nForensic Lab which has hash verification for the all the\naudios and messages.        It is also categorically stated in\nthe report that the audios and messages are found not to\nbe doctored and have not been tampered since they were\ndigitally captured. Hence, petitioner is able to prove the\naccuracy of the conversations.             Further it is the\ncontention of the respondent that, the said report does\nnot authenticate that the voice in the audio conversation\nis belonging to the respondent since his voice sample was\nnever taken by the Court in accordance with law and it\nwas not compared with the voice in the audio recordings.\nThe said audio conversations submitted by the petitioner\nas per Ex.P.3 is declared by the petitioner                 to be\nbelonging    to   the    respondent   by   way     of    affidavit.\nPetitioner being the wife of the respondent who has led\nmarital life with him for 27 long years can obviously\nidentify the voice of the respondent and she has declared\nthe voice to be of the respondent. Hence, the question of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                37</span>\n                                                Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ntaking the voice sample of the respondent and comparing\nit with the audio conversation does not arise. Further, as\nalready stated the report and certificate U/<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_43\">Sec.65-B</a> of\nIndian Evidence Act submitted by Forensic Lab proves\nthe accuracy of the conversation by placing the hash\nvalue.   Further it is a contemporaneous         record of a\nrelevant conversation and hence it is a relevant fact\nadmissible U/<a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_44\">Sec.8</a> of Indian Evidence Act as it is res-\ngastea. When the petitioner-wife has identified the voice\nof the respondent-husband there is no dispute regarding\nthe identification of the voice.    Here it is also pertinent\nto note that the present proceedings are under <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_45\">PWDV Act</a>\nwhich is meant for the protection of rights of a woman\nwho is victim of violence and it aims at preventing of\nsuch violence in the society.       Further U/<a href=\"/doc/1393917/\" id=\"a_46\">sec.28(2)</a> of\nPWDV Act this Court can lay down its own procedure for\ndisposal of application U/<a href=\"/doc/1373165/\" id=\"a_47\">Sec.12</a> of PWDV Act. Moreover,\nit is a quasi criminal and quasi civil proceeding.\nTherefore, as per the law of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nin   Kunapareddy      @   Nookala     Shank     Balaji     V/s\nKunapareddy Swarna Kumari reported in (2016) 11 SCC\n774 the evidence has to be considered on the basis of\npreponderance of probabilities. Hence, the Court cannot\nask for proof beyond reasonable doubt.        Even on this\naspect the audio recordings and whats app conversations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                              38</span>\n                                               Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nsubmitted by the petitioner are relevant and admissible.\nIn this regard reference may be had to the Judgment of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Gujarat in Crl. Revision\nApplication No.1243/2023 in the case of JIL W/o Priyank\nManubhai Choksy V/s State of Gujarat and another\njudgment dated 16.07.2024 wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat\nHigh Court held that it is not necessary to seek to get\nvoice sample of the respondent in a case where audio\nrecording is submitted to the Court by petitioner-wife.\nFurther the Hon&#x27;ble High Court also held that, such\naudio recordings are      admissible. The Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt of Gujarat drew an analogy from <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_48\">Sec.14</a> of Family\nCourts Act and held that a Court which is dealing with\nfamily matters can receive as evidence any report,\nstatement, documents, information or matter that may in\nits opinion assist it to deal effectually with a dispute\nwhether or not the same would be otherwise relevant or\nadmissible under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_49\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and held that\naudio   conversations   become    admissible    and    in    a\nmatrimonial case parties need not prove them in\naccordance with <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_50\">Indian Evidence Act</a>.   Hence, even if the\npetitioner   has illegally obtained the evidence such\nevidence becomes relevant since it is matrimonial dispute\nand it is the only evidence available to the petitioner to\nprove the violence committed by the respondent.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                               39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">    30.   It is also the contention of respondent that,\npetitioner by producing the audio conversations and his\nwhats app messages has violated his right to privacy\nwhich is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> of Constitution of\nIndia. In this regard he has relied on judgment of Hon&#x27;ble\nHigh Court of Chattisgarh in CRMP No.2112/2022,\nJudgment of Hon&#x27;ble High court of Rajasthan in the case\nof Mohammed Rafiq V/s Family Court and others in Civil\nWrit Petition No.14726/2013 dated 26.05.2015 wherein\nit is held that recording of conversation without the\nknowledge of the other spouse cannot be admissible as\nevidence since it breaches the right to privacy of the\nother spouse.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">     31. The     present   Court    while   dealing     with\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_52\">PWDV Act</a> essentially always deals with\nsensitive, personal disputes relating to marriage. By its\nvery nature the issues involved are always private and\npersonal in nature.   Hence, the evidence sought to be let\nin would also relate to the private affairs of the parties.\nHence, evidence cannot be excluded on the ground that it\nwould be a breach of fundamental right of       privacy of\nrespondent. In this regard reference may be had to the\ncase of Deepti Kapur V/s Kunal Julka reported in AIR\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                40</span>\n                                                Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n2020 DELHI 156 Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi while\nconsidering whether CCTV            recording done by the\nhusband without the knowledge of the wife violates her\nright to privacy held,\n\n        &quot;while a litigating party certainly has a right\n        to privacy, that right must yield to the right of\n        an opposing      party to    bring   evidence it\n        considers relevant to court, to prove its case.\n        It is a critical part of the hallowed concept of\n        fair trial that a litigating party gets a fair\n        chance to bring relevant evidence before\n        Court. It is important to appreciate that while\n        the right to privacy is essentially a personal\n        right, the right to a fair trial has wider\n        ramifications and impacts public justice,\n        which is a larger cause. The cause of public\n        justice would suffer if the opportunity of fair\n        trial is denied by shutting-out evidence that a\n        litigating party may wish to lead at the very\n        threshold.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86964673\" id=\"span_39\">Since no fundamental right under our\n        Constitution is absolute, in the event of\n        conflict between two fundamental rights, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                 41</span>\n                                                 Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\n          in this case, a contest between the right to\n          privacy and the right to fair trial, both of\n          which arise under the expansive <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21</a>,\n          the right to privacy may have to yield to the\n          right to fair trial. Reference in this regard\n          may be made to the observations of a 5-\n          Judge Constitution Bench decision of our\n          Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86964673/\" id=\"a_54\">Sahara India Real Estate\n          Corporation Limited &amp; Ors. vs. Securities and\n          Exchange Board of India &amp; Anr</a>&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">    32.     The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Justice KS\nPuttaswamy (retired) and another V/s Union of India and\nothers reported in (2017) 10 SCC 1 recognized privacy as\nfundamental right but held that it is not an absolute\nright and has to be placed in the context of other right\nand values.      This case being filed under <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_55\">PWDV Act</a> is\nalso for protection of right of the aggrieved person under\nthe Constitution of India. Therefore, in the present case\nwhich is filed by the petitioner-wife seeking various reliefs\nfor domestic violence undergone by her, the right of\nprivacy of the respondent has to be viewed in the context\nof the right of a woman to live with dignity and her right\nto fair trial.   The right of privacy of respondent has to\nyield to the right to live with dignity and right of fair trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                               42</span>\n                                                Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nof the petitioner. Here it is also pertinent to note that,\nthis Court by order dated 16.11.2019 allowed the\napplication filed by the petitioner U/<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_56\">Sec.65(B)</a> of Indian\nEvidence Act and accepted her affidavit filed under the\nsaid provision.    The respondent did not file an appeal\nagainst the said order. He did not object even at the time\nof marking.       Hence, the admission of the digital /\nelectronic evidence submitted by the petitioner came to\nbe admitted by the Court. Now, after the completion of\ntrial respondent cannot come up with a contention that,\nthe evidence itself was not admissible in the first place.\nHe ought to have taken such a contention at the time of\nmarking of evidence itself. In this regard reference may\nbe had to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nSonu V/s State of Hariyana reported in 2017 8 SCC 570\nwherein it is held that, objection regarding mode or\nmethod of proof of a document is procedural in nature\nand such an objection if not taken at trial it cannot be\npermitted to be taken at the appellate stage.     Therefore,\nthe court held that &quot;we are satisfied that an objection\nthat CDRs are unreliable due to violation of the\nprocedure prescribed in Sec.65-B(4) cannot permitted to\nbe raised at this stage as the objection relates mode or\nmethod of proof&quot;. The judgment relied by the respondent\nare passed at the stage of admitting the evidence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                    43</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">                                                     Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nFurther in the said cases the spouse had recorded the\nconversations of the other spouse on their phone without\ntheir consent. But in this case petitioner               has not\nrecorded any conversation of the respondent without his\nconsent. She has merely accessed the conversations and\nmessages recorded/saved by the respondent himself and\nas already discussed respondent is unable to prove that\nshe has accessed them illegally.         Hence, the judgment\nsubmitted by the respondent are not applicable to the\npresent case.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">      33.    Hence, from the above discussion evidence\nemanating from the mobile phones are acceptable. On\nscrutiny of Ex.P.3 in page No.25 and 26 respondent while\ntalking to his sister about his paramour has stated &quot;I am\nnot married to her officially but she is more than a wife to\nme she is more than any wife to me&quot;. This conversation\nitself proves that respondent was having a relationship\noutside the marriage with Muthurani.                 Further the\nmessages submitted by the petitioner as per Ex.P.2\nespecially    page   No.20    of    Ex.P.2    also   proves     the\nrelationship outside marriage between respondent and\nMuthurani. Petitioner has also submitted photographs of\nthe    respondent    and     Muthurani       on   various    tours.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                               44</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nRespondent in his cross examination has denied these\nmessages and audio conversation and stated that,\npetitioner&#x27;s son who is a hardware specialist has\nimplanted the said messages and conversations.            As\nalready stated Forensic Lab has submitted certificate\nU/<a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_57\">Sec.65(B)</a> along with hash value and primary evidence\nis also submitted before this Court. Hence, there is no\nquestion of implanting the said evidence.     On the basis\nof preponderance of probability petitioner is able to prove\nthat respondent was having a relationship outside the\nmarriage with another lady.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">    34.   Further respondent counsel has argued that,\neven if it is assumed that respondent was having a\nrelationship outside the marriage the same cannot be\nvalid ground for domestic violence as held in the case of\nPrakash Babu V/s State of Karnataka.        This Court has\nperused the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nPrakash Babu V/s State of Karnataka reported in AIR\n2016 SC 5430 which is a judgment passed in criminal\nappeal filed against judgment of conviction for the\noffences punishable U/<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_58\">Sec.306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_59\">498(A)</a> of IPC.         The\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while discussing <a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_60\">Sec.498(A)</a> of\nIPC held that having an extra marital affair may not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                               45</span>\n                                                Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nconstitute cruelty as specifically defined U/<a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_61\">Sec.498(A)</a> of\nIPC and lead to abetment of suicide U/<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_62\">Sec.306</a> of IPC.\nHowever, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has categorically\nclarified &quot;we intend to make it clear that if the husband\ngets involved in an extra-marital affair that may not in all\ncircumstances invite conviction under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 306</a> of the\nIPC but definitely that can be a ground for divorce or\nother reliefs in a matrimonial dispute under other\nenactments. And we so clarify&quot;. Hence, by the decision of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court which is relied by the\nrespondent himself it is settled that having an extra\nmarital affair can be a ground for divorce or other reliefs\nin matrimonial disputes under <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_64\">DV Act</a> or other divorce\nlaws. Therefore, from the above discussion petitioner by\nproducing Ex.P.2, 3, 7, 8 and 9 is able to prove that\nrespondent has subjected her to domestic violence by\nhaving a relationship outside the marriage with another\nlady.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">    35.   Petitioner   has    alleged   that,   when       she\nquestioned respondent about his relationship he abused\nthe petitioner to give him a divorce or accept the said\nlady as his 2nd wife and allow her to live with him and\nwhen she refused respondent assaulted her and hence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                46</span>\n                                                   Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\npetitioner lodged a complaint against the respondent in\ncrime     No.274/2017    before     Suddaguntepalya        police\nstation on 18.12.2017 for the offences punishable\nU/<a href=\"/doc/1868826/\" id=\"a_65\">Sec.498(A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_66\">506</a> of IPC. Petitioner has submitted\nEx.P.11 i.e., the charge sheet filed in Crime No.274/2017\nto prove her contention. Respondent in his statement of\nobjection has denied the entire incident.           As already\nstated petitioner only needs to probabalize her case and\nthe very fact that a charge sheet is filed in crime\nNo.274/2017 probabalizes the case of the petitioner.\nTherefore, petitioner is able to prove that respondent has\nassaulted her when she questioned him about his\nrelationship outside the marriage.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_64\">    36.     Petitioner   has   further   alleged      that,    on\n20.01.2018 at 8.30 a.m. respondent came to the shared\nhousehold started to abuse her and her children in filthy\nlanguage, threatened to kill her if she does not vacate the\nhouse. Respondent went to the kitchen and took a knife\nand assaulted her with a knife on her stomach as a\nresult she suffered injuries on her right finger and after\nthat respondent caught hold of her hair and hit her head\nagainst the wall also assaulted the children. As a result\nshe lost conscious and she was admitted to Sagar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                               47</span>\n                                              Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nhospital Jayanagar and she has lodged a complaint\nwhich is registered in Crime No.26/2018 against the\nrespondent for the offences punishable U/Sec.506, <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_67\">34</a>,\n504, <a href=\"/doc/1079138/\" id=\"a_68\">120(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_69\">Sec.307</a> of IPC. She has further alleged\nthat, in order to over come her complaint respondent has\nfiled false complaint against her in crime No.27/2018.\nRespondent has denied all the allegations and he has\nstated that, it is the petitioner who has forcibly confined\nhim in the house by locking the door and windows and\npetitioner and her sons have assaulted him and also\nrobbed his ID cards, credit card, debit card and 2 mobile\nphones. When he approached Suddaguntepalya police\nstation police took him to General Hospital, Jayanagar\nfor treatment instead of registering the case and in the\nmeanwhile petitioner to escape from future consequences\ncaused self injury and lodged a complaint before\nSuddaguntepalya police in crime No.26/2018 before he\ncould lodge a complaint.    Thereafter, when respondent\nreturned from the hospital he registered the complaint\nagainst the petitioner and her sons in crime No.27/2018.\nRespondent has submitted charge sheet filed in crime\nNo.26/2018 and 27/2018        in   Ex.38 and 39.    In this\ncase it is admitted fact that, there is case and counter\ncase between the petitioner and respondent. Admittedly,\nthe alleged incident took place after the present petition\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                  48</span>\n                                                 Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nwas filed and both the criminal cases are pending trial.\nSince, the alleged incident took place after the petition\nwas filed it is not necessary for this Court to go into the\nalleged incident.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">      37.   Respondent has contended that, through out\nthe marital life he has looked after the petitioner and his\nchildren with utmost care and he has paid for the\neducation of the children, supported the petitioner during\nher    ill-health,   purchased   a    two   wheeler   for   her,\nmaintained all the expenses of the house, took the\npetitioner and the children to various tourist destinations\nin the interest of the family. He has further submitted\nthat, he has constructed a house at Uttarahalli by\nmaking his 2nd son Wilbert Prathyush as co-applicant in\nthe housing loan obtained by him from Can Fin Homes\nwith an intention to make him legal heir to his property\nin the future and it is not a house that is constructed for\nMuthurani as alleged by the petitioner. It may be true\nthat respondent has maintained the family and provided\nfor them. But it is the duty of the respondent to do so.\nHowever, it is proved from the discussion made above\nthat respondent was also involved in a relationship\noutside of the marriage. There is no dispute that such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                 49</span>\n                                                    Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nconduct by the respondent would amount to emotional\nabuse and it would harm the mental well being of the\npetitioner.    It is an admitted fact that, petitioner and\nrespondent have not had marital relationship since 2010.\nIt is the contention of petitioner that, since respondent\nstarted a relationship with another lady he has neglected\nher.   The messages submitted by the petitioner are from\nthe year 2014 as per Ex.P.2 which indicate that\nrespondent&#x27;s relationship was before the year 2014.\nTherefore, from Ex.P.2 petitioner is able to prove that\nrespondent did not have marital relationship with the\npetitioner due to his relationship outside the marriage\nfrom 2010.          This conduct of the respondent also\namounts       to   emotional   neglect   of   the     petitioner.\nRespondent has contended that, petitioner was having a\nrelationship outside of the marriage with one of her\nB.Ed., classmates and he found some love messages\nexchanged      between   them    in   2010    and     when      he\nquestioned her about the same she cut all relationship\nwith him.      But respondent is not able to prove this\ncontention. There is not even an iota of evidence before\nthe Court to prove this contention of the respondent.           He\nhas also made a counter allegation that soon after he\nstarted constructing a house at JP Nagar petitioner asked\nhim to transfer the house at KEB Layout to her name\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                    50</span>\n                                                       Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\nand when he refused to do so she has filed false cases\nagainst him.      Even this contention of the respondent\nremains not proved.        Even though petitioner is unable\nto prove her allegations regarding dowry she is able to\nprove that respondent was in a relationship outside of\nthe marriage and he has neglected her. Hence, just\nbecause petitioner has not proved the dowry allegations\nher evidence does not become unreliable with respect to\nthe rest of the allegations.             Hence, from the above\ndiscussion it is proved that, respondent has committed\ndomestic violence       against the petitioner.       Hence, point\nNo.1 answered in the affirmative.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">        38.

He has\nstated that, he pays income tax of Rs.5,245/- on his net\npension of Rs.60,650/-. He has submitted that, the said\npension is only provisional pension as the petitioner has\nfiled W.P.No.50194/2019 wherein the retirement benefits\nof the respondent have been stopped.

He has stated that, the said house has 2\nportions in the ground floor which would fetch rent of\nRs.30,000/- per month and petitioner is in possession of\nthe said ground floor and she has let out the same to the\nnew tenants and she is enjoying Rs.30,000/- rent per\nmonth.

He has further stated that, he has gifted\n100 grams of gold jewelry to the petitioner at the time of\nmarriage and afterwards which is in her possession. He\nhas further stated that, petitioner        is working as\nAdministrative Assistant at Mithralaya Girls High School\nand composite junior college for past 30 years and her\nmonthly salary may be around Rs.50,000/-.

The     petitioner   has   filed   her   Assets     and\nliabilities affidavit and stated that, she is a B.A graduate\nand she is working as a Clerk at Mithralaya Girls High\nSchool and composite junior college and she is getting\ngross salary of Rs.20,686/- and her net income is\nRs.7,764/-. She has stated that, she has given a detailed\nbreak up of her expenses and she has stated her monthly\nexpenses is Rs.1,31,905/- and her annual expenses is\nRs.1,19,000/-.   She has admitted that, she is residing at\nBTM Layout.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">     40. Admittedly, due to the order passed in WP\nNo.50194/2019 respondent is receiving only provisional\npension of Rs.60,650/-. Respondent has not submitted\nall his bank statements for past 3 years, he has also not\nsubmitted his IT returns for past 3 years. Further the\nhouse in which respondent is residing also consists of 2\nstoried building comprising of one BHK residential house\nin the ground floor and n the first floor one portion\ncomprising of office and prayer hall, another portion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                  54</span>\n                                                  Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ncomprising 2 BHK residential house.                 Therefore,\nrespondent has evidently let out or can let out at least\none portion of the said house and he has not disclosed\nthe same.      Respondent has not disclosed his actual\npension.      It appears that, respondent has purposefully\nnot disclosed the same in order to avoid paying\nmaintenance to the petitioner. Further respondent has\ngiven a detailed break up of his expenses but he has not\nsubmitted any document regarding the same. It appears\nthat,   he    has   inflated   his    expenses.    Admittedly,\nrespondent does not have any pending loans.             On the\nother hand petitioner is working as a clerk in a school\nand she is getting a meager salary of Rs.7,764/- and\neven she has not filed her 3 years bank statement.          It is\ncontended by the respondent that, petitioner has let out\nthe house at BTM Layout and she is getting rental\nincome of Rs.30,000/- per month which she has failed to\ndisclose. It is an admitted fact that, the house at BTM\nLayout has 2 floors and ground floor has 2 portions both\nof which can be let out. But there is no evidence before\nthe Court regarding any rental income received by the\npetitioner.     Petitioner     has given a break up of her\nexpenses but she has not given any document with\nrespect to her expenses. She has also not submitted her\nbank statement. Hence, an adverse inference has to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                55</span>\n                                                 Crl.Misc.11/2018\n\n\ndrawn against the petitioner        also.   Respondent being\nthe husband of the petitioner is duty bound to maintain\nher. Further since it is proved by the petitioner that she\nhas   been   subjected   to   domestic      violence   by   the\nrespondent he is duty bound to provide monetary relief\nU/<a href=\"/doc/485875/\" id=\"a_71\">Sec.20</a> of PWDV Act.         Even if it is assumed that,\npetitioner is receiving the rental income the gap between\nthe income of the petitioner            and income of the\nrespondent is very large.
