He is a businessman and public spirited person.  He is questioning allotment of the land to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee which according to him is made without following due process of law.  The land allotted to Rajasthan State Haj Committee is pasture land.  Thus, it could not have been allotted by the State Government and the Jaipur Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the JDA&#x27;).  The allotment was made by order dated 20.10.2004 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Zone-8, JDA and order dated 30.11.2005 issued by the Deputy Secretary, Urban Development &amp; Housing Department, Government of Rajasthan, Jaipur.  The lease deed was executed on 06.01.2006 by the JDA in favour of the Rajasthan State Haj Committee.  The Rajasthan State Haj Committee is constituted under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_1\">Haj Committee Act, 2002</a> (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act of 2002&#x27;) and the Rules have been framed thereunder by the State Government.  The land ad-measuring 5 bighas comprised in Survey No.157 situated at village Ramsingpura Bas, Tehsil Sanganer, District Jaipur has been allotted to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee.  It is also averred that the land worth crores of rupees has been allotted on token price of Rs.1/- without inviting applications and the pasture land could not be allotted for the purpose of construction of Haj House.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\tIt is also averred in the petition that earlier in 2003, one bigha land was allotted to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee for the purpose of construction/establishment of Haj House (Centre for Muslim Pilgrims) near &#x27;Karbala&#x27;, Jal Mahal, Jaipur and the then Chief Minister of State of Rajasthan has laid the foundation stone.  Thereafter, fresh elections were held and another party came into power and has allotted 5 bighas of the land to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee.  Initially the allotment was proposed at the rate of Rs.1,000 per square meter as mentioned in the order dated 20.10.2004 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Zone-8, JDA filed as Annexure-1 to the writ petition.  Thereafter the proposal was modified on 06.09.2005 and the land ad-measuring 2 bighas was proposed to be allotted free of charge and 3 bighas of land at the reserved rate for institutions. Thereafter, the Deputy Commissioner, Zone-8, JDA issued order dated 17.09.2005 directed deposit of &#x27;Nazrana&#x27; amount.  On 30.11.2005, the Deputy Secretary, Urban Development &amp; Housing Department communicated approval of the State Government to the Secretary, JDA to allot the aforesaid 5 bighas of land on token price of Rs.1/- on lease for a period of 99 years.  Thereafter, lease deed was executed on 06.01.2006.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\tIt is submitted that pasture land could not have been allotted in view of the provisions contained in the <a href=\"/doc/107852649/\" id=\"a_2\">Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994</a> and the Rules 169 &amp; 170 of the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Rules, 1996.  The JDA has not followed due process for allotment of the State largesse while making the allotment of land to the Haj Committee.  The nature of the pasture land cannot be changed for construction of the Haj House, as such, lease has been illegally granted.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\tIn the return filed by the respondents No.1 &amp; 2 State Government, it is contended that the petition has been filed with some political motives; it cannot be said that it has been filed to cater the public interest.  In the master plan, the land is earmarked for institutions. According to the provisions contained in the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Trust (Disposal of Urban Lands) Rules, 1974 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Rules of 1974&#x27;), the commercial lands are to be disposed of by public auction and rest of the land can be allotted with prior approval of the State Government on the rates decided by the State Government.  Rule 18(1) of the Rules of 1974 empowers the State Government to determine the rate for the purpose of allotment; it can be given free of cost also. Master plan has to prevail for the purpose of use of the land.  There is no violation of the master plan while making allotment of land to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee;  it has not been allotted to lure the Muslim Voters.  One bigha of land was allotted on 21.08.2003 by Jaipur Nagar Nigam.  The said land was insufficient to cater the needs of the Haj House in view of the fact that large number of Hajis used to go every year for Haj Pilgrimage.  Hence, prayer was made to allot sufficient land, same was entertained.  Thus, the action was taken in accordance with law.  Once the land had been transferred to the JDA, its nature had been changed from pasture to institutional.  As such, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/107852649/\" id=\"a_3\">Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act, 1994</a> are not applicable in the instant case; provisions of <a href=\"/doc/142722859/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 54</a> of the Jaipur Development Authority Act, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/105378770/\" id=\"a_5\">JDA Act</a>&#x27;) are applicable;  due procedure of law has been followed while making the allotment.  Thus, the land has rightly been allotted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">\tIn the return filed by the respondents No.3 &amp; 4-the JDA and its Deputy Commissioner, JDA, it is additionally contended that the land which was allotted earlier was insufficient and it was requested that the Haj House should be near to Airport so that Hajis can be prevented from unnecessary trouble while travelling to Makka-Madina in Saudi Arabia.  After formation of the JDA, the land has been transferred in the name of the JDA.  Thus, provision of the <a href=\"/doc/107852649/\" id=\"a_6\">Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act</a> cannot be made applicable.  Land was no more pasture land in accordance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/105378770/\" id=\"a_7\">JDA Act</a>, as master plan has been prepared in accordance with provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/105378770/\" id=\"a_8\">JDA Act</a>.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\tIn the return filed by respondent No.6-the Rajasthan State Haj Committee, it is contended that since large number of Haj Pilgrims go for pilgrimage to sacred places to Saudi Arabia, the allotment has been made in order to facilitate stay of the Haj Pilgrims and then they proceed to Makka Madina from Jaipur.  <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_9\">The Haj Committee Act, 2002</a> has been enacted for making arrangements for the pilgrimage of Muslims for Haj and for the ancillary matters connected therewith.  Persons from all religions give warm farewell to the Haj Pilgrims.  They also extend welcome on the successful return from the journey to the sacred places.  The use of the land has not been changed.  Allotment is made as per Rule 18 of the Rules of 1974.   Secularism does not mean negation of religion but it in fact recognizes and gives protection to all religions equally.  Construction of Haj House indicates the spirit of religious tolerance, which is the basic structure of the Constitution of India as enshrined in its Preamble and Part-III.  Allotment of land is to advance the religious brotherhood and the tolerance to provide facilitates to the pilgrims.  Land has not been allotted for commercial purposes but it has been allotted to the statutory committee for providing facilitates to the pilgrims.  Haj Houses are already existing in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\tAdditional affidavit has been filed by the petitioner pointing out duties of the Committee under the <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_10\">Haj Committee Act, 2002</a>. The chart of State-wise distribution of quota for the pilgrims of Haj is also submitted.  In Rajasthan, 3396 pilgrims are permitted to travel as per quota of the year.  The land situated in Karbala was sufficient for Haj House as it is likely to be utilized only for 2-3 months in a year.  Purpose is to establish commercial house also for the rest of the period. It is reserved for the particular community.  The Haj Committee is neither public nor charitable institution;  it is statutory body.  Being secular, the State Government is to be governed by the rationale, the allotment of land to Haj Committee is illogical.  The State Government could not have allotted the land being secular State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1066844\" id=\"span_1\">Mr. G.K. Garg, learned Senior Counsel with Mr. Laxmi Kant appearing on behalf of petitioner has submitted that action of allotment of land to Haj Committee is illegal and unconstitutional.  The State Government could not have allotted the land for the religious activities.  The act of allotment is unconstitutional and violative of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/105378770/\" id=\"a_11\">JDA Act</a> and the Rules of 1974.  The land was pasture land same could not have been allotted for the purpose of construction of Haj House.  In view of the provisions contained in the <a href=\"/doc/107852649/\" id=\"a_12\">Rajasthan Panchayati Raj Act</a> and the Rules framed thereunder,  no concession can be allowed while making allotment of land.  Rule 18 of the Rules of 1974 has been violated while making the allotment on token amount of Rs.1/- for 99 years;  it amounts to sale of the land.  Once the land was allotted at Karbala, there could not have been any allotment in favour of the Haj Committee for the same purpose.  Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of petitioner has relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1066844/\" id=\"a_13\">Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors.</a> [(2011) 5 SCC 29].</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"243179\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"509065\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"709044\" id=\"span_4\">Mr. Dinesh Yadav, AAG appearing on behalf of respondent-State, Mr. Rinesh Gupta appearing on behalf of JDA and Mr. R.N. Mathur, learned Senior Counsel with Mr. Ankul Gupta appearing on behalf of respondent No.6 Rajasthan State Haj Committee have submitted that the action is in accordance with law and concept of secularism is not violated; it cannot be said that the allotment has been made in an illegal manner, the same is permissible under Rule 18 of the Rules of 1974; they have relied upon the decisions of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/709044/\" id=\"a_14\">Prafull Goradia vs. Union of India</a> [(<a href=\"/doc/509065/\" id=\"a_15\">2011) 2 SCC 568], Ms. Aruna Roy &amp; Ors vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a> [(<a href=\"/doc/243179/\" id=\"a_16\">2002) 7 SCC 368] and Delhi Administration vs. Umrao Singh</a> [(2012) 1 SCC 194].</span></span></span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\tThe first question for consideration is whether the allotment so made destroys the concept of secularism as enshrined by the Constitution of India.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"509065\" id=\"span_5\">The Apex Court has considered the concept of secularism in <a href=\"/doc/509065/\" id=\"a_17\">Ms. Aruna Roy</a> (supra) wherein the Apex Court has observed that in a society where there is constant evaporation of social and moral values for getting property, power or post, it is advisable to have a solid social foundation from the base level so that a grown-up person would fight against all kinds of fanaticism, ill will, violence, dishonesty, corruption and exploitation.  It has been further laid down that for controlling the wild animal instinct in human beings and for having a civilized cultured society, it appears that religions have come into existence.  Religion is the foundation for value-based survival of human beings in a civilized society.  The force and sanction behind civilized society depends upon moral values.   The philosophy of coexistence and how to coexist is thought over by the saints all over the world which is revealed by various philosophers.  How to coexist, not only with human beings but all living beings on the earth, may be animals, vegetation and the environment including air and water, is thought over and discussed by saints and leaders all over the world which is reflected in religions.  If that is taught, it cannot be objected to as it is neither violative of constitutional or legal rights nor does it offend moral values.  The argument to the contrary was held to be totally wrong presumption and contention that knowledge of different religions would bring disharmony in the society was also rejected.  On the contrary, knowledge of various religious philosophies is material for bringing communal harmony as ignorance breeds hatred because of wrong notions, assumption, preaching and propaganda by misguided interested persons.  The Apex Court has further observed that the word religion should not be misunderstood nor the contention could be raised that as it is used in the National Policy of Education, secularism would be at peril.  On the contrary, let there be a secularist democracy where even a very weak man hopes to prevail over a very strong man on the strength of rule of law by proper understanding of duties towards the society.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">\tIn our considered opinion, Haj is performed in order to bring about the tolerance and to strengthen the moral values, social values and is for providing for solid social foundation for existence of human beings.  There is pious purpose of all the religious activities, no religion breeds hatred.  It is in order to bring harmony, to understand basic human values, to understand, who am I and all are equals that pilgrimages are undertaken by the various sections of people such as Hindus, Muslims, Jains etc.  Secularism is the basic structure of the Constitution that has to be given policy meaning that is developing understanding and respect towards different religions.  The essence of secularism is non-discrimination of people by the State on the basis of religious differences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1430396\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1430396/\" id=\"a_18\">The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras vs. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt</a> [AIR 1954 SC 282], the Apex Court has considered the concept of religion.  <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 25</a> has been considered by their Lordships of the Apex Court.  It has been observed that <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 25</a> secures to every person, subject to public order, health and morality, a freedom not only to entertain such religious belief, as may be approved of by his judgment and conscience, but also to exhibit his belief in such outward acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his ideas for the edification of others.  A Mathadhipati is certainly not a corporate body; he is the head of a spiritual fraternity and by virtue of his office has to perform the duties of a religious teacher.  It is his duty to practice and propagate the religious tenets, of which he is an adherent and if any provision of law prevents him from propagating his doctrines, that would certainly affect the religious freedom which is guaranteed to every person under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 25.</a>  The Apex Court has also observed that it is clear, therefore, that questions merely relating to administration of properties belonging to a religious group or institution are not matters of religion to which Clause (b) of the <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 26</a> applies.   The Apex Court has further observed that religion is certainly a matter of faith with individuals or communities and it is not necessarily theistic.  There are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in God or in any Intelligent First Cause.  A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but a doctrine or belief.  A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept, it might prescribe rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded as integral parts of religion.  The guarantee under our Constitution not only protects the freedom of religious opinion but it protects also acts done in pursuance of a religion and this is made clear by the use of the expression practice of religion.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"709044\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/709044/\" id=\"a_23\">Prafull Goradia</a> (supra) the Apex Court has considered constitutionality of the <a href=\"/doc/102428/\" id=\"a_24\">Haj Committee Act, 1959</a> which was replaced by the <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_25\">Haj Committee Act, 2002</a>.  The main ground of challenge was that the Act violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_26\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_27\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_28\">27</a> of the Constitution of India.  It was alleged that part of the proceeds of the direct and indirect taxes was used for providing subsidy for the purpose of Haj pilgrimage is only done by Muslims.  For the Haj, the subsidy was granted to the pilgrims in the airfare.  While dismissing the writ petition, the Apex Court has held that there is no violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_30\">15</a> because facilities are also given, and expenditures incurred, by the Central and State Governments in India for other religions. As per the counter affidavit, Government was averse to the idea of granting support to a pilgrimage conducted by any community as for example when the Government incurs some expenditure for the Kumbh or for facilitating Indian citizens going on pilgrimage to Mansarovar, or visit temples and gurdwaras in Pakistan.  Thus, there is no discrimination.  It is not prudent or pragmatic for the court to insist on absolute equality when there are diverse situations and contingencies.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"482515\" id=\"span_8\">Reliance was also placed upon the decision in <a href=\"/doc/482515/\" id=\"a_31\">Transport &amp; Dock Workers Union vs. Mumbai Port Trust</a> [(2011) 2 SCC 575].  It was also <a href=\"/doc/482515/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court that Constitution is not to be interpreted in a narrow or pedantic manner.  This is because a Constitution is a constituent or organic statute.  While a statute must ordinarily be construed as on the day it was enacted, a Constitution cannot be construed in that manner, for it is intended to endure for ages to come.  A balanced view has to be taken here and it cannot be said that even if one paisa of government money is spent for a particular religion there will be violation of <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 27.</a>  It is not desirable to be too rigid in these matters and free play must be given to the joints of the State machinery.  The Apex Court has further laid down that it is due to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers that the Constitution of India is secular and caters to the tremendous diversity.  In this sub-continent, with all its tremendous diversity the only policy which can work and provide for stability and progress is secularism and giving equal respect to all communities, sects, denominations, etc.  The Apex Court has laid down thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">10.\tIn our opinion, if only a relatively small part of any tax collected is utilized for providing some conveniences or facilities or concessions to any religious denomination, that would not be violative of <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 27</a> of the Constitution. It is only when a substantial part of the tax is utilized for any particular religion that <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 27</a> would be violated. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">11.\tAs pointed out in para 8 (iv), (v) and (viii) of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Central Government, the State Government incurs some expenditure for the Kumbh Mela, the Central Government incurs expenditure for facilitating Indian citizens to go on pilgrimage to Mansarover, etc. Similarly in para 8 (vii) of the counter affidavit it is mentioned that some State Governments provide facilities to Hindu and Sikh pilgrims to visit Temples and Gurudwaras in Pakistan. These are very small expenditures in proportion to the entire tax collected. Moreover, in para 8(iii) of the counter affidavit the Central Government has stated that it is not averse to the idea of granting support to the pilgrimage conducted by any community. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">12.\tIn our opinion, we must not be too rigid in these matters, and must give some free play to the joints of the State machinery. A balanced view has to be taken here, and we cannot say that even if one paisa of Government money is spent for a particular religion there will be violation of <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 27.</a> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">13.\tAs observed by Mr. Justice Holmes, the celebrated Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court in Bain Peanut Co. vs. Pinson, at L Ed p. 491 :  U.S. 499, 501 (1931) \nThe interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal. We must remember that the machinery of the government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints\n(see also Missourie, Kansas and Tennessee Railroad vs. May, 194 U.S. 267 (1904). \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">14.\tHence, in our opinion, there is no violation of <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 27</a> of the Constitution. There is also no violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_38\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_39\">15</a> because facilities are also given, and expenditures incurred, by the Central and State Governments in India for other religions. Thus there is no discrimination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\tIt is apparent that the <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_40\">Haj Committee Act, 2002</a> has been enacted for making arrangements for the Haj pilgrims and for ancillary matters connected therewith.  Pilgrim has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/1425331/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(f)</a> to mean a Muslim proceeding to, or returning from, Haj.  State Committee has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/1884971/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 2(h)</a> to mean a State Haj Committee constituted under <a href=\"/doc/362810/\" id=\"a_43\">section 18</a> and includes Joint State Committee.  Constitution and incorporation of Haj Committee of India has also been provided in the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/503854/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 17(1)</a> provides constitution of State Haj Committee.  As per <a href=\"/doc/1014159/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 17(2)</a> of the Haj Committee Act, 2002, the State Committee shall be a body corporate, by the name aforesaid, having perpetual secession and a common seal with power, subject to the provisions of this Act, to acquire, hold and dispose of property, both movable and immovable, to create a charitable trust or endowment, and to contract and shall by the said name sue and be sued.  Composition of State Haj Committee is provided in <a href=\"/doc/362810/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 18</a>;  the same consists of sixteen members to be nominated by the State Government; three Muslim Member of Parliament, State Legislative Assembly, Legislative Council etc.  are also Members.

Haj Houses provides transit accommodation at the time of exit.  Such transit accommodation in fact is a basic human requirement, which is not connected with any religious activity at all.  When pilgrims are assembling at one place, they do have right to get shelter, same is implicit under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> that the need is not of religious one, but of human one. The need is basic human necessity to give meaning to the life itself. Human life is not synonymous with animal existence. Pilgrims cannot be denied right to shelter under the concept of secularism.  While providing shelter places to the pilgrims,  there cannot be any division of communities of Human like Hindu, Muslim, Buddh, Jain or Sikh etc., it cannot be said that concept of secularism has been defeated by providing shelter places in the form of Haj Houses or by providing Mandapam and other facilities in Kumbh Mela such as construction of shelter places, roads nearby the temples etc.  What is being provided in such cases is not basically for promoting the religion, but to provide the basic amenities which are necessary for respectable human life.  Right to life includes frugal comforts also. In case it is held that grant of land for the purpose of providing transit houses is violative of concept of secularism under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_57\">&amp; 15</a> or other provisions of the Constitution of India,  it would defeat the very objective of right to life enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  It is constitutional right to obtain shelter and the safe places for assembling at a particular place and State has obligation to provide not only land, but other basic facilities also.  When large number of people assemble at a particular place, it is open to the State Government to make proper arrangements to provide shelter places and also to make arrangements for maintenance of law and order and even sanction the amount from exchequer for such purpose without fear of violation of the concept of secularism.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\t<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution protects right to live with human dignity.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_60\">Kharak Singh Vs.

Rule 18 of the Rules of 1974 deals with the allotment of land to the public and Charitable Institutions.  It is provided under Rule 18(1) that no land shall be allotted for a price less than the sanctioned reserve price  except for categories covered under Rule 17.  Provided that land for public and charitable institutions may be allotted by the Trust on payment of residential reserve price or with the prior permission of the State Government free of any charge or at concessional rates.

Rule 18(2)(d) provides that the aforesaid principle shall also apply in case of land belonging to the Trust if allotted to Universities or other statutory or non statutory bodies under Government orders.  Erstwhile Urban Improvement Trust has been taken over by the JDA.  It is permissible to make the allotment of land to the statutory body, without realizing the cost of the land.  The Haj Committee is a statutory body formed under <a href=\"/doc/527477/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 17</a> of the Haj Committee Act, 2002 and the Haj Committee Rules, 2002 framed by the Central Government under <a href=\"/doc/620967/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 44</a> of the Act of 2002.   The State Government also framed the Rajasthan State Haj Committee Rules, 2006 under <a href=\"/doc/1082296/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 47</a> of the Act of 2002. The term institution has been defined in Rule 2(6-G) of the Rules of 1974 to mean an establishment, organization or association, formed for the promotion of object especially one of the public or general utility religious, charitable, educational or like nature, etc.  The statutory committee like Haj Committee as has been constituted is not ousted from the purview of the definition of institution.  Thus, allotment could have been made to the statutory committee within ken of Rule 18 of the Rules of 1974.  It was not necessary to realize the market value of the land.  The submission to the contrary raised on behalf of the petitioner is hereby discarded being untenable.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">\tThe next submission that pasture land could not have been allotted for construction of Haj House to the Rajasthan State Haj Committee is untenable for various reasons.  Firstly, the land is within Municipal limits and has been handed over to JDA. Once the land was allotted to the JDA and master plan had been prepared under provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/105378770/\" id=\"a_95\">JDA Act, 1982</a>, in master plan land was reserved for institutional purpose, it cannot be said to be pasture land.  Another reason for rejecting the submission is that there is no necessity to keep the pasture land within Municipal limits as all dairies have been shifted outside Municipal limits and once the land has been shown in master plan for institutional purposes, the same could have been allotted for construction of the Haj Houses to Statutory Committee constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/1275048/\" id=\"a_96\">Haj Committee Act, 2002</a>.  Validity of the master plan so prepared by JDA has not been questioned in the petition.
