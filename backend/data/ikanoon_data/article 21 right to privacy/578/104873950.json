Sri.Y.V.Ravi Prasad, the learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\n    petitioner submits that the petitioner is arraigned as an accused in Crime\n\n    No.364 of 2024 for alleged offences under Section 309 (2), <a href=\"/doc/194236441/\" id=\"a_6\">109(2)</a>,\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/36837024/\" id=\"a_7\">61(2)</a>,<a href=\"/doc/90948046/\" id=\"a_8\">49</a>, 332(b) and 333 of BNS. It is also submitted that the petitioner is\n\n    implicated in several cases and that the petitioner has approached the\n\n    Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and filed SLP (Crl.)No.18172 of 2025.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">  3. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, vide order dated 11.12.2024, granted\n\n    anticipatory bail in the event of his arrest in connection with Crime No.364\n\n    of 2024 registered with Satyanarayanapuram Police Station of Vijayawada\n                                       //4//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                     WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n   City subject to certain terms and conditions as the investigating officer may\n\n   deem fit to impose. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court further observed that the\n\n   petitioner shall cooperate with investigation and shall appear before the\n\n   investigating officer as and when required for the purpose of interrogation.\n\n   A further direction to the petitioner not to influence any of the prosecution\n\n   witnesses and not create any hindrances in the further investigation of the\n\n   alleged offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">4. The learned senior counsel further submits that the 4 th respondent while\n\n   enlarging the petitioner on bail had imposed certain conditions on\n\n   28.02.2025. He further submits that the condition prohibiting the petitioner\n\n   from leaving Vijayawada city without prior intimation to the investigating\n\n   officer and obtaining permission from the Court to leave the State or\n\n   Country is onerous. It is submitted that the petitioner is an advocate, and\n\n   in the event he intends to attend the High Court also, he would have to\n\n   intimate the police, as the High Court is situated beyond the city limits of\n\n   Vijayawada and that in the event the petitioner has to appear before the\n\n   High Court of Telangana, he would have to seek the permission of the\n\n   Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">5. It is also submitted that the petitioner is a heart patient and his children are\n\n   residing in Hyderabad and for visiting them, the petitioner would essentially\n\n   have to intimate the 4th respondent and also obtain permission from the\n\n   Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                                      //5//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                   WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">6. The learned Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submits\n\n   that the conditions are imposed, as the investigating officer deemed fit to\n\n   impose such conditions to ensure the petitioners cooperation for\n\n   investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">7. It is submitted that considering the gravity of the situation, the 4 th\n\n   respondent has imposed certain conditions and that the petitioner is only\n\n   required to intimate the investing officer about his proposed travel outside\n\n   Vijayawada city.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">8. The learned Senior counsel submits that the Section 482 of BNSS would\n\n   not entitle the police to impose such conditions. The condition relating to\n\n   obtaining permission from the Court for leaving the state or country is not\n\n   imposed by the Court in the crime. This condition is imposed by the police\n\n   and the same cannot be imposed on the Court as if it is the condition of\n\n   Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">9. The submission that the petitioner is required to report to the police station\n\n   on every Monday between 11.00AM and 04.00PM is an equally onerous\n\n   condition. The learned senior counsel submits that though the crime was\n\n   registered on 06.11.2024 and the petitioner was enlarged on bail on\n\n   28.02.2025, there has been absolutely no progress in investigation. As\n\n   such, prays the Court to set aside the bail conditions imposed by the 4 th\n\n   respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                                                  //6//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                                WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">      10. This Court vide order dated 05.03.2025 stayed the operation of condition\n\n           No.1. The learned Government Pleader appearing for the state has filed a\n\n           counter and also filed a vacate petition. It is submitted that the respondent\n\n           is opposed the dispensation of condition No.1 primarily on the ground that\n\n           the petitioner has a criminal history and that the petitioner is accused in as\n\n           many as 48 criminal cases. It is also stated in the counter that the\n\n           petitioner is not cooperating with the investigation and that he is\n\n           intimidating the investigating officer and the other police officers and\n\n           showing blatant disregard for the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130290692\" id=\"span_4\">11.

Challa Ramkrishna\n                   Reddy</a>, reiterated the settled position by holding as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                        &quot;22. Right to life is one of the basic human rights. It is\n                        guaranteed to every person by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n                        and not even the State has the authority to violate that right.\n                        A prisoner, be he a convict or undertrial or a detenu, does\n                        not cease to be a human being. Even when lodged in the jail,\n                        he continues to enjoy all his fundamental rights including the\n                        right to life guaranteed to him under the Constitution. On\n                        being convicted of crime and deprived of their liberty in\n                        accordance with the procedure established by law, prisoners\n                        still retain the residue of constitutional rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n                   10.1 We are dealing with a case of the accused whose guilt is yet to\n                   be established. So long as he is not held guilty, the presumption of\n                   innocence is applicable. He cannot be deprived of all his rights\n                   guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21.</a> The Courts must show restraint while\n                   imposing bail conditions. Therefore, while granting bail, the Courts\n                   can curtail the freedom of the accused only to the extent required for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n    (2024) 8 SCC 415\n                                          //7//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                           WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n          imposing the bail conditions warranted by law. Bail conditions cannot\n          be so onerous as to frustrate the order of bail itself. For example, the\n          Court may impose a condition of periodically reporting to the police\n          station/Court or not travelling abroad without prior permission. Where\n          circumstances require, the Court may impose a condition restraining\n          an accused from entering a particular area to protect the prosecution\n          witnesses or the victims. But the Court cannot impose a condition on\n          the accused to keep the Police constantly informed about his\n          movement from one place to another. The object of the bail condition\n          cannot be to keep a constant vigil on the movements of the accused\n          enlarged on bail. The investigating agency cannot be permitted to\n          continuously peep into the private life of the accused enlarged on\n          bail, by imposing arbitrary conditions since that will violate the right of\n          privacy of the accused, as guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21.</a> If a constant vigil\n          is kept on every movement of the accused released on bail by the\n          use of technology or otherwise, it will infringe the rights of the\n          accused guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a>, including the right to privacy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">          The reason is that the effect of keeping such constant vigil on the\n          accused by imposing drastic bail conditions will amount to keeping\n          the accused in some kind of confinement even after he is released\n          on bail. Such a condition cannot be a condition of bail.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">12. Heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioner and the learned\n\n   Government Pleader for the State. Perused the record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">13. The short point for consideration is whether the 4 th respondent was justified\n\n   in imposing the conditions for grant of bail and whether such conditions are\n\n   onerous which frustrate the order of bail itself.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">14. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while granting bail to the petitioner left it to the\n\n   discretion of the 4th respondent to impose terms and conditions as been fit\n\n   to impose. Conditions 3 to 6 imposed by the 4th respondent are more or\n\n   less intune with the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in its order\n\n   at paras 16 and 17 in SLP(Crl.) 18172 of 2024, dated 21.01.2025.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">15. Now, coming to the condition No.1 imposed by the 4th respondent, the 4th\n\n   respondent mandating the petitioner to obtain prior permission from the\n                                       //8//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                     WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n   Court to leave the State or Country is concerned, such a condition is not\n\n   imposed by the Court, as such the petitioner cannot be directed to seek\n\n   permission of the Court for leaving out of State or Country. The 4 th\n\n   respondent cannot superimpose the condition on the Court and expect the\n\n   Court to discharge the judicial function by reporting compliance of the\n\n   petitioner to the investigating officer. Such conditions cannot be imposed\n\n   by the police and the power to impose such conditions always vest with the\n\n   Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">16. Coming to the condition No.2 mandating the petitioner to report to the\n\n   police station on every Monday between 11.00AM and 04.00PM or as\n\n   directed is concerned, it is not in dispute that the investigation is not yet\n\n   complete inspite of lapse of eight months from the date of registration of\n\n   crime and six months from the date of grant bail to the petitioner. It is not in\n\n   dispute that the petitioner is a practicing advocate and the condition of\n\n   reporting to police station on every Monday between 11.00AM and\n\n   04.00PM would interfere with the professional obligations of the petitioner.\n\n   As the petitioner would have to appear for his clients and discharge his\n\n   duty as their counsel before the Court(s) of law. As such, the condition\n\n   No.2 deserves to be relaxed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">17. The submission of the learned Government Pleader by referring to the\n\n   counter that the petitioner is a habitual offender and that there are 48\n\n   cases pending against him is not supported by any details relating to the\n                                          //9//\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                     WP.No.5520 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n      crimes registered against the petitioner. The State has also not filed any\n\n      document or the list of cases pending against the petitioner. In so far as\n\n      Crime No.364 of 2024 is concerned, the petitioner is enlarged on bail and it\n\n      is not the case of the 4th respondent that the petitioner had violated the\n\n      conditions of bail granted in any other offences. Mere statement that the\n\n      petitioner is not cooperating with the investigation is cannot be relied upon\n\n      by this Court.
