With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns, this Commission refers to the\njudgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in SLP(C)\nNo. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_7\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v. Central\nInformation Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein, it has been held as under:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">         13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n         censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n         as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The\n         performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily\n         a matter between the employee and the employer and normally\n         those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under\n         the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                           Page 2 of 7</span>\n           no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the\n          other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n          invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n          the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n          Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n          larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n          appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n          those details as a matter of right.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n          &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n          under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n          larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n          the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n          satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n          such information.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">7.     Henceforth, the legal issue to be decided herein is whether the appellant\nclaiming to be the legally wedded wife of Mr. Sunandan Barua is entitled to seek\ndetails of his income tax returns. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_4\">In this regard, it is apt to mention the decision\ndated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in W.P.(C) 803/2009 titled\nas <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_11\">Vijay Prakash v.

In the matter at hand, the appellant has not succeeded in\nestablishing that the information sought is for larger public purpose.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_5\">8.     Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger public\ninterest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated 11-06-2015\nrendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 8753 of 2013\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_13\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n          misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n          imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n          which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                           Page 3 of 7</span>\n          said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n         fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n         unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_7\">9.     The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in the decision of <a href=\"/doc/69052901/\" id=\"a_14\">Naresh Kumar Trehan\nv.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to\n     the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n     W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n     returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n     Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n     Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and information\n     provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my\n     view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of filing\n     returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.\n     The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public\n     nature and not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The\n     expression &quot;public activity&quot; would denote activity done for the public\n     and/or in some manner available for participation by public or some\n     section of public. There is no public activity involved in filing a\n     return or an individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held that the same\n     was justified &quot;in the larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144795012\" id=\"span_8\">10.

At this juncture, this Commission deems it appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(n)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">    &quot;2(n):- &quot;third party&quot; means a person other than the citizen making a\n    request for information and includes a public authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">12. From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Mr. Sunandan Barua being a\nperson other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the definition of &#x27;third\nparty&#x27;. Moreover, the CPIO has also not intended to disclose the information\ntreating it as confidential and has rather pleaded that there is no public interest in\nthe matter. This Commission also does not find any public interest which\noutweighs the harm caused in its disclosure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_14\">13.
