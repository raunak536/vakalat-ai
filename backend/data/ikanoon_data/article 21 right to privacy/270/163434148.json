Learned Advocate       General      raised   objection   regarding\n                         maintainability of the petitions on twin grounds. Firstly, the relief\n                         claimed in the petitions is vague and Clause 7(2) of prayer clause\n                         does not specify as to which provisions of Madhya Pradesh\n                         Freedom of Religion Act, 2021 (hereinafter referred as &#x27;Act of\n                         2021&#x27;) are unconstitutional. In absence of any specific relief being\n                         prayed for, the whole Act cannot be declared as ultra vires. Moreso,\n                         when petitioners are unable to show that whole Act is brought into\n                         force by the State without their being any legislative competence for\n                         the same. Secondly, the impugned Act of 2021 is almost similar to\n                         Madhya Pradesh Dharma Swatantraya Adhiniyam, 1968\n                         (hereinafter referred as &quot;1968 Adhiniyam&quot;). The constitutionality of\n                         1968 Adhiniyam was called in question before this Court and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                            3</span>\n\n\n                         ultimately matter travelled to Apex Court. The said case was decided\n                         by a Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1308071/\" id=\"a_8\">REV - Stainislaus vs.\n                         State of Madhya Pradesh and others</a>, 1977 (1) SCC 677. The\n                         constitutionality of the 1968 Adhiniyam was upheld by the Supreme\n                         Court. The impugned Act of 2021 is almost similar and enacted by\n                         changing the &#x27;flavour&#x27; (कलेवर) of 1968 Adhiniyam and hence petition\n                         is not maintainable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">                         3.    Faced with this, Mr. Manoj Sharma, learned Senior Advocate\n                         submits that relief claims in W.P.No.6263/2021 is very specific\n                         which reads as under :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                    &quot;7.1 Strike down Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d),\n                                    2(e), 2(i), 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 12 of the Madhya\n                                    Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2021.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                    7.2.

So far rest of the petitions are concerned, he prays for and is\n                         granted permission to file appropriate applications to amend the\n                         petition/relief clause. Since one petition is clearly pregnant with\n                         specific relief clause, the respondents are not taken by surprise and\n                         were made aware about offending sections and grounds as taken by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                             4</span>\n\n\n                         the petitioners. Thus, we are not inclined to dismiss these petitions\n                         based on the first objection raised by learned Advocate General.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1308071\" id=\"span_24\">5.    So far second objection of State is concerned, Shri Manoj\n                         Sharma, learned Senior Advocate submits that in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1308071/\" id=\"a_14\">REV -\n                         Stainislaus</a> (supra), the constitutionality of 1968 Adhiniyam was\n                         called in question only on the ground of alleged violation of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_15\">Article\n                         25</a> of the Constitution of India. If the provisions of impugned Act are\n                         examined in juxtaposition to the 1968 Adhiniyam, it will be clear\n                         that various provisions are differently worded.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"334293\" id=\"span_25\">6.    Thus, Act of 2021 is not verbatim same if compared with the\n                         1968 Adhiniyam. Apart from this, as per the legal journey, the\n                         constitutionality of provisions can now be tested on the anvil of\n                         legislative competence, breach of fundamental rights and right to\n                         privacy and other new grounds which are available to the petitioners.\n                         It is argued that in AIR 1951 SC 318 (<a href=\"/doc/334293/\" id=\"a_16\">State of Bombay vs. F. N.\n                         Balsara</a>), the constitutionality of a statutory provisions was called in\n                         question. The Apex Court declared the law within the ambit of\n                         <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution.</span> The similar question cropped up\n                         before Gujarat High court in W.P. (PIL No.12/2019) Peter Jagdish\n                         Nazarath vs. State of Gujarat. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"334293\" id=\"span_26\">Learned Advocate General raised\n                         similar objection that since validity of Act in question has already\n                         been upheld by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/334293/\" id=\"a_18\">F. N. Balsara</a> (supra), the\n                         constitutionality of the same again cannot be tested.

This includes ground of\n                         &#x27;right of privacy&#x27;. The Gujarat High Court opined that personal food\n                         preferences are related with &#x27;right to privacy&#x27;. Thus, petitions cannot\n                         be dismissed as not maintainable. The impact of previous\n                         adjudication will be considered at appropriate stage i.e. final hearing.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                         7.

Resultantly, second objection raised by the learned\n                         Advocate General cannot be accepted at this stage. The writ petitions\n                         contain arguable points.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                         8.

The Division Bench of the\n                         High Court allowed the petition to limited extent and <a href=\"/doc/64017850/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 4</a> of\n                         the impugned Act of H.P. and Rule 3 of relevant Rules were held be\n                         violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

A\n                         comparative chart is placed before us containing the relevant\n                         provisions applicable in State of M.P., Gujarat and H.P.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">                         14.   It is common ground of learned counsel for the petitioners that\n                         by way of introducing present Act unbridled, uncanalized and\n                         arbitrary powers are given to the authorities. The fundamental right\n                         of citizen to practice a religion, marry a person of his choice\n                         irrespective of caste and religion of his spouse is sought to be\n                         interfered with and taken away. If the impugned act is permitted to\n                         stand it will not only infringe the valuable fundamental rights but\n                         will disturb the harmony of the society. Every citizen has a valuable\n                         right not to disclose his belief. The citizen is under no obligation\n                         either to disclose his own religion or his intention to switch over to\n                         another religion. The religious belief is a matter personal to a citizen.\n                         State has no right to compel a citizen to disclose about his personal\n                         belief. Disclosure of religion or intention to change the religion may\n                         rather lead to communal tension and may endanger the life or limb\n                         of the convertee. The requirement of prior information before\n                         conversion as par the Act of 2021 violates fundamental right of a\n                         citizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                         15.   Learned Senior counsel further contended that <a href=\"/doc/157682464/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 5</a> of the\n                         impugned Act shows that in case of contravention of <a href=\"/doc/83003603/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 3</a>\n                         imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 1 year is prescribed\n                         but proviso thereof shows that if contravention is in relation to a minor, a\n                         woman or a person belonging to reserved category, the term of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                8</span>\n\n\n                         imprisonment shall be for a period of two years. Thus, men and women\n                         and other categories are treated differently which is unconstitutional in\n                         nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                         16.    The &#x27;burden of proof &#x27; is placed on the shoulders of a convertee or a\n                         person who has allegedly violated the provisions of the impugned Act.\n                         This runs contrary to the settled principle of criminal jurisprudence. If\n                         these provisions are permitted to stand, it will have &#x27;chilling effect&#x27; on the\n                         citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                         17.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"42184625\" id=\"span_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_50\">In support of his submissions learned Senior counsel placed\n                         reliance on <a href=\"/doc/110813550/\" id=\"a_26\">Shreya Singhal Vs.

Sounding a contra note, Shri Prashant Singh, learned Advocate\n                         General for the State submits that the petitioners are unable to establish\n                         that the impugned Act is introduced by the respondents without there\n                         being any competence for the same. The petitioners are claiming a\n                         blanket interim relief which cannot be granted. If interim relief is granted,\n                         it will amount to giving them final relief. It is contended that endeavour\n                         of the Court should be uphold the constitutionality of the enactment.\n                         Even if some portion of the enactment is unconstitutional, the remaining\n                         portion can be separated and upheld by applying the doctrine of\n                         severability. For the same purpose, <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_33\">Suresh Kumar Koushal and Anr.\n                         Vs. Naz Foundation and Ors.</a> AIR 2014 SC 563 is relied upon.

At the cost of repetition, learned Advocate General for the State\n                         submits that the impugned Act is almost similar to 1968 Adhiniyam,\n                         constitutionality of which has been tested till Apex Court. Hence, these\n                         petitions are not maintainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"52367404\" id=\"span_61\">20.   The respondents have also prepared a comparative chart containing\n                         relevant provision of the impugned <a href=\"/doc/64531482/\" id=\"a_34\">Act of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat\n                         Freedom and Religion Act</a> 2003 with its amendment upto 2021. By\n                         taking this court to the said comparative chart, Learned Advocate General\n                         urged that the previsions of <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_35\">Gujarat Act</a> are more stringent whereas in\n                         Madhya Pradesh due care has been taken to ensure that Act cannot\n                         misused by anyone.

However, in the present matter, the line of argument of State is\n                         different and, therefore, since the provisions and argument both are\n                         different, said interim order dated 26.8.2021 is of no assistance to the\n                         petitioners.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">                         21.   The petitioners have not placed on record any material to show that\n                         the impugned Act has been misused by the authorities. The definition of\n                         &#x27;fraudulent&#x27; in the Act of 2021 is founded upon the principle flowing\n                         from <a href=\"/doc/1961417/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25</a> of the Indian Penal Code (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a>). Thus, no fault can be\n                         found in the impugned Act. During the course of argument, learned\n                         Advocate General fairly submitted that in State of M.P. The relevant rules\n                         under the Act 2021 have not been notified till date.

Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect\n                                 of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and\n                                 instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human\n                                 dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally\n                                 protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet,\n                                 dignity and freedom are inseparably intertwined, each\n                                 being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The\n                                 ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy\n                                 enables the realisation of the full value of life and\n                                 liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which\n                                 privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised\n                                 in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a\n                                 private space. Privacy enables the individual to\n                                 retain the autonomy of the body and mind. The\n                                 autonomy of the individual is the ability to make\n                                 decisions on vital matters of concern to life.\n                                 Privacy has not been couched as an independent\n                                 fundamental right. But that does not detract from\n                                 the constitutional protection afforded to it, once\n                                 the true nature of privacy and its relationship with\n                                 those fundamental rights which are expressly\n                                 protected is understood. Privacy lies across the\n                                 spectrum of protected freedoms. The guarantee of\n                                 equality is a guarantee against arbitrary State action.\n                                 It prevents the State from discriminating between\n                                 individuals. The destruction by the State of a\n                                 sanctified personal space whether of the body or of\n                                 the mind is violative of the guarantee against\n                                 arbitrary State action. Privacy of the body entitles an\n                                 individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                      19</span>\n\n\n                         personhood. The intersection between one&#x27;s mental\n                         integrity and privacy entitles the individual to\n                         freedom of thought, the freedom to believe in what is\n                         right, and the freedom of self-determination. When\n                         these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a\n                         private space which protects all those elements which\n                         are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage,\n                         procreation and sexual orientation are all integral\n                         to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the\n                         privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable\n                         right to determine how freedom shall be exercised.\n                         An individual may perceive that the best form of\n                         expression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a\n                         realm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the\n                         soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the\n                         outcome of a process of thought. A musician\n                         contemplates upon notes which musically lead to\n                         silence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the\n                         ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or\n                         interact with others. These are crucial aspects of\n                         personhood. The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19</a> can be\n                         fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide\n                         upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with\n                         <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a\n                         choice of preferences on various facets of life\n                         including what and how one will eat, the way one\n                         will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad\n                         other matters on which autonomy and self-\n                         determination require a choice to be made within the\n                         privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the\n                         freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 25</a> has implicit\n                         within it the ability to choose a faith and the\n                         freedom to express or not express those choices to\n                         the world. These are some illustrations of the manner\n                         in which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                                  20</span>\n\n\n                                    the exercise of liberty.

Nor have we\n                                    tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha-\n                                    suffixed right to privacy : this is not an act of judicial\n                                    redrafting.

It was urged before us that since he was born\n                         in his religion and knows his religion well, therefore, it\n                         was thought that while reverting back to his original\n                         religion, no notice be issued. This argument does not\n                         satisfy the parameters of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n                         of India.

What is clear, therefore, is that this\n                                 archaic law has long outlived its purpose and does not\n                                 square with today&#x27;s constitutional morality, in that the\n                                 very object with which it was made has since become\n                                 manifestly arbitrary, having lost its rationale long ago\n                                 and having become in today&#x27;s day and age, utterly\n                                 irrational.

Likewise, the\n                                   rules can be quashed if the same are found to be\n                                   unconstitutional or ultra vires the provisions of\n                                   the Act. However, the operation of the\n                                   statutory provisions cannot be stultified by\n                                   granting an interim order except when the\n                                   court is fully convinced that the particular\n                                   enactment or the rules are ex facie\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">Signed by: MANJU</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">Signing time:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">11/17/2022 5:03:45 PM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                                                              30</span>\n\n\n                                   unconstitutional and the factors, like balance of\n                                   convenience, irreparable injury and public\n                                   interest are in favour of passing an interim order.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_183\">37.
