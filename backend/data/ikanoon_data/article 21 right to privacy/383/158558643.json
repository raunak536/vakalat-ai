The term “fair” denotes\n\nequal opportunity to all people. Universal adult suffrage\n\nconferred on the citizens of India by the Constitution has\n\nmade it possible for millions of individual voters to\n\nparticipate in the governance of our country. For democracy\n\nto survive, it is fundamental that the best available men\n\nshould be chosen as the people’s representatives for the\n\nproper governance of the country and the same can be best\n\nachieved through men of high moral and ethical values who\n\nwin the elections on a positive vote.      Emphasizing on a\n\nvibrant democracy, the Court observed that the voter must\n\nbe given an opportunity to choose none of the above (NOTA)\n\nbutton, which will indeed compel the political parties to\n\nnominate a sound candidate. Accordingly, the principle of\n\nthe dire need of negative voting was emphasised.

In this regard, it may be stated that\n\nthe health of democracy, a cherished constitutional value,\n\nhas to be protected, preserved and sustained, and for that\n\npurpose, instilment of certain norms in the marrows of the\n\ncollective is absolutely necessitous.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\nTHE REFERENCE\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.

In the beginning, we have emphasized on the concept\n\nof democracy which is the corner stone of the Constitution.\n\nThere are certain features absence of which can erode the\n\nfundamental values of democracy.

This Court has laid emphasis on the purity of elections\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/182927551/\" id=\"a_10\">Union of India v. Association</a> for Democratic Reforms\n\nand another7 and, in that context, has observed that\n\nelections in this country are fought with the help of money\n\npower which is gathered from black sources and once\n\nelected to power, it becomes easy to collect tons of black\n\nmoney which is used for retaining power and for re-election.\n\nThe Court further observed that if on an affidavit a\n\ncandidate is required to disclose the assets held by him at\n\nthe time of election, the voter can decide whether he should\n\nbe re-elected. Thereafter, as regards the purity of election,\n\nthe Court observed that to maintain purity of elections and,\n\nin particular, to bring transparency in the process of\n\nelection, the Commission can ask the candidates about the\n\nexpenditure incurred by the political parties, and the voters\n\nwould have basic elementary right to know full particulars\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">7</span>\n    (2002) 5 SCC 294\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                               8</span>\n\n\nof a candidate who is to represent them in Parliament where\n\nlaws to bind their liberty and property may be enacted\n\nbecause the right to get information in a democracy is\n\nrecognised all throughout and it is a natural right flowing\n\nfrom the concept of democracy.         Elaborating further, the\n\nCourt opined that a voter has a right to know the\n\nantecedents including the criminal past of his candidate\n\ncontesting election for MP or MLA as it is fundamental and\n\nbasic for the survival of democracy, for he may think over\n\nbefore making his choice of electing law-breakers as law-\n\nmakers.    Eventually,        the Court directed the Election\n\nCommission to exercise its power under <a href=\"/doc/950881/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 324</a> of the\n\nConstitution requiring the candidate to furnish information\n\npertaining to the fact whether the candidate has been\n\nconvicted/ acquitted/discharged of any criminal offence in\n\nthe past, if any, and whether he has been punished with\n\nimprisonment or fine; whether the candidate is accused in\n\nany   pending   case     of    any   offence   punishable   with\n\nimprisonment for two years or more, and in which charge is\n\nframed or cognizance is taken by the court of law; and\n\ncertain other information.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                                               9</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6.        From the aforesaid authorities, it is perceivable that\n\nwhile giving emphasis on the sanctity of election, the Court\n\nhas expressed its concern with regard to various facets of\n\nthe candidates who contest the election and seek votes.\n\n\nCRIMINALISATION OF POLITICS\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"716836\" id=\"span_29\">7.        Criminalisation of politics is an anathema to the\n\nsacredness of democracy.        Commenting on criminalization\n\nof politics, the Court, in <a href=\"/doc/716836/\" id=\"a_12\">Dinesh Trivedi, M.P. and others\n\nv. Union of India</a> and others8, lamented the faults and\n\nimperfections which have impeded the country in reaching\n\nthe expectations which heralded its conception.           While\n\nidentifying one of the primary causes, the Court referred to\n\nthe report of N.N. Vohra Committee that was submitted on\n\n5.10.1993. The Court noted that the growth and spread of\n\ncrime syndicates in Indian society has been pervasive and\n\nthe criminal elements have developed an extensive network\n\nof contacts at many a sphere. The Court, further referring\n\nto the report, found that the Report reveals several alarming\n\nand deeply disturbing trends that are prevalent in our\n\npresent society. The Court further noticed that the nexus\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">8</span>\n    (1997) 4 SCC 306\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                                                           10</span>\n\n\nbetween politicians, bureaucrats and criminal elements in\n\nour society has been on the rise, the adverse effects of\n\nwhich are increasingly being felt on various aspects of social\n\nlife in India. Indeed, the situation has worsened to such an\n\nextent that the President of our country felt constrained to\n\nmake references to the phenomenon in his addresses to the\n\nNation on the eve of the Republic Day in 1996 as well as in\n\n1997 and hence, it required to be handled with extreme care\n\nand circumspection.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">8.        In Anukul Chandra Pradhan, Advocate Supreme\n\nCourt v.

Thereafter, the three-Judge Bench opined that\n\nany provision enacted with a view to promote the said object\n\nmust          be     welcomed    and      upheld     as   subserving      the\n\nconstitutional          purpose.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195348497\" id=\"span_32\">In   <a href=\"/doc/195348497/\" id=\"a_13\">K.

It is worth saying that systemic corruption and\n\nsponsored criminalization can corrode the fundamental core\n\nof elective democracy and, consequently, the constitutional\n\ngovernance. The agonized concern expressed by this Court\n\non being moved by the conscious citizens, as is perceptible\n\nfrom the authorities referred to hereinabove, clearly shows\n\nthat a democratic republic polity hopes and aspires to be\n\ngoverned by a Government which is run by the elected\n\nrepresentatives who do not have any involvement in serious\n\ncriminal          offences   or   offences    relating   to   corruption,\n\ncasteism, societal problems, affecting the sovereignty of the\n\nnation          and     many      other      offences.

Can there be sound differentiation\n           between corrupt public servants based on their\n           status? Surely not, because irrespective of their\n           status or position, corrupt public servants are\n           corrupters of public power. The corrupt public\n           servants, whether high or low, are birds of the\n           same feather and must be confronted with the\n           process of investigation and inquiry equally.\n           Based on the position or status in service, no\n           distinction can be made between public servants\n           against whom there are allegations amounting to\n           an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_26\">PC Act, 1988</a>.”\n\nAnd thereafter, the larger Bench further said:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">           “Corruption is an enemy of the nation and\n           tracking down corrupt public servants and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">12</span>\n     Writ Petition (Civil) No. 38 of 1997 etc. pronounced on May 06, 2014\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                                            17</span>\n\n\n     punishing such persons is a necessary mandate\n     of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_27\">PC Act, 1988</a>.

Criminal activities that result in disqualification are\n\nrelated to various spheres pertaining to the interest of the\n\nnation, common citizenry interest, communal harmony, and\n\nprevalence of good governance. It is clear that the 1951 Act\n\nlays down that the commission of serious criminal offences\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                              24</span>\n\n\nrenders a person ineligible to contest in elections or\n\ncontinue as a representative of the people.            Such a\n\nrestriction does provide the salutary deterrent necessary to\n\nprevent criminal elements from holding public office thereby\n\npreserving the probity of representative government.\n\n\nSUBMISSIONS OF THE COUNSEL\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">22.   In this backdrop, the proponements put forth by Mr.\n\nDwivedi, learned senior counsel, who was appointed as\n\namicus curiae, are to be noted and considered.         It is his\n\nsubmission that under the constitutional scheme, it is the\n\nright of a citizen to be governed by a Government which\n\ndoes not have Ministers in the Council of Ministers with\n\ncriminal   antecedents.         Though    qualifications    and\n\ndisqualifications   for   the   Members   of   Parliament   and\n\nMembers of the State Legislative Assembly or the State\n\nLegislative Council are provided under the Constitution, and\n\nthey basically relate to the election process and continuance\n\nin the House and the further disqualifications which have\n\nbeen enumerated under the 1951 Act have been legislated\n\nby the Parliament being empowered under the specific\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                                             25</span>\n\n\nprovisions of the Constitution, yet when the Ministers are\n\nappointed   who   constitute   the   spectrum   of   collective\n\nresponsibility to run the Government, a stronger criteria has\n\nto be provided for. A Minister is appointed by the President\n\non the advice of the Prime Minister as per <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 75(1)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution and a Minister enters upon his Office after\n\nthe President administers him oath of office and secrecy\n\naccording to the form set out for the said purpose in the\n\nThird Schedule and, therefore, submits Mr. Dwivedi, it is\n\nthe constitutional obligation on the part of the Prime\n\nMinister not to recommend any person to be appointed as a\n\nMinister of the    Council of Ministers who has criminal\n\nantecedents or at least who is facing a criminal charge in\n\nrespect of heinous or serious offences. The choice made by\n\nthe Prime Minister has to have its base on constitutional\n\nchoice, tradition and constitutional convention which must\n\nreflect the conscience of the Constitution. It is propounded\n\nby him that the same would serve the spirit and core values\n\nof the Constitution, the values of constitutionalism and the\n\nlegitimate expectations of the citizens of this country. The\n\npower conferred on any constitutional authority under any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                                                 26</span>\n\n\nof the Articles of the Constitution may not be circumscribed\n\nby express or obvious prohibition but it cannot be said that\n\nin the absence of use of any express phraseology in that\n\nregard, it would confer an unfettered and absolute power or\n\nunlimited discretion on the said constitutional authority.\n\nLearned senior counsel would contend that the doctrine of\n\nimplied limitation has been accepted as a principle of\n\ninterpretation of our organic and living Constitution to meet\n\nthe        requirements       of   the   contemporaneous   societal\n\nmetamorphosis and if it is not applied to the language of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 75(1)</a>, the élan vital of the Constitution would stand\n\nextinguished. It is urged by him that judiciary, as the final\n\narbiter of the Constitution, is under the constitutional\n\nobligation to inject life to the words of the Constitution so\n\nthat they do not become stagnate or sterile. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_58\">In this context,\n\nMr. Dwivedi has commended us to the views of the learned\n\nJudges            in    <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_66\">His   Holiness    Kesavananda      Bharati\n\nSripadagalvaru v.

Relying on the said principle, it is contended by him\n\nthat the same has to be read into the language of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_67\">Article\n\n75(1)</a> of the Constitution to state that the Prime Minister,\n\nwhile giving advice to the President for appointment of a\n\nperson as Minister, is not constitutionally permitted to\n\nsuggest the name of a person who is facing a criminal trial\n\nand in whose case charge/charges have been framed.\n\nLearned senior counsel has further submitted that high\n\nconstitutional offices have to possess “institutional integrity”\n\nso that the faith of the people at large is not shaken. He has\n\nemphasised on the office of the President, the Governors,\n\nJudges of the High Courts and of the Supreme Court of the\n\ncountry and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.\n\nSuch offices, as contended, are offices of high public trust\n\nand, therefore, it is a natural necessity that in such\n\nappointments, the incumbent should be of impeccable\n\nintegrity and character and it cannot be conceived that such\n\na person would be involved in any kind of criminal offence.\n\nMr. Dwivedi has made a distinction with regard to the\n\neligibility of a person for becoming a Member of Parliament\n\nas that is controlled by qualifications and disqualifications\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                                                       28</span>\n\n\nand the absence of disqualifications, but to be a Minister in\n\nthe Council of Ministers which is done solely on the advice\n\nof the Prime Minister, absence of criminal antecedents has\n\nto be a condition precedent.             It is canvassed by him that\n\nwhen parliamentary democracy is a basic feature of the\n\nConstitution and the Council of Ministers exercise all the\n\npowers as per the democratic conventions, it has to be\n\ntreated       as       an   important   constitutional   institution   of\n\ngovernance of the nation and, therefore, it cannot be\n\nallowed to be held by persons involved in criminal offences.\n\nHe has <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_68\">placed reliance upon</a> the authorities in Centre for\n\n<a href=\"/doc/310431/\" id=\"a_69\">PIL and another v.

Laying stress on the word “advice”, apart from referring\n\nto the dictionary meaning, the learned senior counsel has\n\nurged that the framers of the Constitution have used the\n\nword “advice” as the Office of the Prime Minister is expected\n\nto carry the burden of the constitutional trust. The advice\n\ngiven by the Prime Minister to the President in the context\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 75(1)</a> has to be a considered, deliberate and\n\ninformed one, especially taking note of the absence of\n\ncriminal antecedents and lack of integrity.       A Minister,\n\nthough holds the office during the pleasure of the President,\n\nyet as per the law <a href=\"/doc/99072131/\" id=\"a_76\">laid down by</a> this Court and the\n\nconvention, the advice of the Prime Minister binds the\n\nPresident.   However, the President, being the Executive\n\nHead of the State, can refuse to follow the advice, if there is\n\nconstitutional prohibition or constitutional impropriety or\n\nreal exceptional situation that requires him to act to sustain\n\nthe very base of the Constitution. Learned senior counsel\n\nwould submit that the President, in exercise of his\n\nconstitutional prerogative, may refuse to accept the advice\n\nof the Prime Minister, if he finds that the name of a Member\n\nof Parliament is suggested to become a Minister who is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">\f                                                                 30</span>\n\n\nfacing a criminal charge in respect of serious offences.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27274070\" id=\"span_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58980482\" id=\"span_78\">To\n\nbuttress the said submission, he has drawn inspiration\n\nfrom the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/58980482/\" id=\"a_77\">Samsher Singh v.

Mr. Anil Kumar Jha, learned counsel who has\n\npreferred the writ petition on behalf of the petitioner,\n\nsupplementing the arguments of Mr. Dwivedi, contended\n\nthat though the choice of the Prime Minister relating to a\n\nperson being appointed as a Minister is his constitutional\n\nprerogative, yet such choice cannot be exercised in an\n\narbitrary manner being oblivious of the honesty, integrity\n\nand the criminal antecedents of a person who is involved in\n\nserious criminal offences. The Prime Minister, while giving\n\nadvice to the President for appointment of a person as a\n\nMinister, is required to be guided by certain principles\n\nwhich may not be expressly stated in the Constitution but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">\f                                                            32</span>\n\n\nhe is bound by the unwritten code pertaining to morality\n\nand philosophy encapsulated in the Preamble of the\n\nConstitution.           Learned counsel has emphasised on the\n\npurposive interpretation of the Constitution which can\n\npreserve, protect and defend the Constitution regardless of\n\nthe political impact.         It is contended by him that if a\n\nconstitutional provision is silent on a particular subject,\n\nthis Court can necessarily issue directions or orders by\n\ninterpretative process to fill up the vacuum or void till the\n\nlaw is suitably enacted. The broad purpose and the general\n\nscheme of every provision of the Constitution has to be\n\ninterpreted, regard being had to the history, objects and\n\nresult which it seeks to achieve.

It\n\nis    his   submission   that   <a href=\"/doc/568164/\" id=\"a_87\">Article    84</a>   specifies     certain\n\nqualifications for filling up the seats of Parliament, but it\n\ndoes not state anything as to the character and qualification\n\nof a person qualified to sit in the Parliament.

Therefore, the criminal antecedents or any\n\ndisqualification that is going to be thought of to hold the\n\npost of a Minister after the charge is framed, as contended\n\nby the petitioner, may be in the realm of propriety but that\n\ncannot be read into the constitutional framework.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">28.    Mr. Andhyarujina has further submitted that Section\n\n44(4)(ii) of the Australian Constitution puts a limitation on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                                                             34</span>\n\n\nthe member of the House which travels beyond conviction in\n\na criminal case, for the said provision provides that any\n\nperson who has been convicted and is under sentence, or\n\nsubject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under\n\nthe law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment\n\nfor one year or longer, would be incapable of being chosen\n\nor of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of\n\nRepresentatives.   Learned counsel has commended us to\n\nLane’s Commentary on the Australian Constitution, 1986 to\n\nhighlight that this is an exceptional provision in a\n\nConstitution which disqualifies a person from being a\n\nMember of Parliament even if he is not convicted but likely\n\nto be subject to a sentence for the prescribed offence, but in\n\nthe absence of such a provision in our Constitution or in\n\nlaw made by the Parliament, the Court cannot introduce\n\nsuch an aspect on the bedrock of propriety.            Learned\n\ncounsel has also referred to the U.K. Representation of\n\nPeoples Act, 1981 which provides that a person who is\n\nsentenced   or   ordered   to   be   imprisoned   or   detained\n\nindefinitely or for more than one year is disqualified and his\n\nelection is rendered void and the seat of such a member is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                                               35</span>\n\n\nvacated. Mr. Andhyarujina has also referred to the House of\n\nCommons Library paper on disqualification for membership\n\nof the House of Commons wherein the practice is that the\n\nexistence of a criminal record may not disqualify a person\n\nfrom ministerial office, but convictions for offences involving\n\ncorruption, dishonesty, serious violence or serious sexual\n\nmisconduct would jeopardize a person’s prospect of a\n\nministerial career. Learned senior counsel has also drawn\n\nour attention to a publication by Professor Rodney Brazier\n\n“Is it a Constitutional issue: Fitness for ministerial office” in\n\nPublic Law 1994 wherein it has been stated that whether a\n\ncriminal   record    should     disqualify   a   person     from\n\nmembership of Government is unclear, however, conviction\n\nfor serious offences could impede a ministerial appointment.\n\nHe has also referred to a passage from Constitutional and\n\nAdministrative Law by Hilaire Barnett 4th Ed. P. 354, to\n\nshow that by an unwritten rule of constitutional propriety,\n\nin United Kingdom, a person is unlikely to be made a\n\nMinister if he has been convicted of a serious offence or\n\neven if he is facing prosecution for a serious offence.\n\nSubmission of learned amicus curiae is that there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">\f                                                             36</span>\n\n\nimplied prohibition in our Constitution on appointment of a\n\nMinister in case of a pending prosecution of a serious\n\noffence except conviction and, therefore, the principle of\n\nimplied prohibition that a person who is not convicted but is\n\nbeing prosecuted or charge sheeted for a criminal offence is\n\nto be debarred from being a Member of the Legislature and,\n\nconsequently, a Minister would not be attracted. Learned\n\nsenior counsel would contend that the jurisprudence is\n\nbased on innocence of the accused until he is proved guilty\n\nwhich is in tune with <a href=\"/doc/1091639/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 14(2)</a> of the International\n\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and it cannot be\n\nbrushed aside.    Learned amicus curiae contended that in\n\nrespect of certain constitutional officials like President of\n\nIndia, Judges of courts including superior courts, Attorney\n\nGeneral of India, Comptroller and Auditor General of India\n\nand Governor of a State, implied prohibition is implicit.

He     has   referred    to   a    passage   from\n\nConstitutional and Administrative Law by ECS Wade and AW\n\nBradley as well as the Constitutional Debates and urged\n\nthat a convention should be developed that persons facing\n\ncharge    for   serious    criminal   offences       should   not    be\n\nconsidered for appointment as a Minister, but the Court\n\ncannot form a legal basis for adding a prohibition for\n\nmaking such an appointment justiciable in the court of law\n\nunless there is a constitutional prohibition or a statutory\n\nbar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">30.    Mr. K.

It is his proponement that the Prime\n\nMinister, in certain circumstances, regard being had to the\n\npolitical situations, may have certain political compulsions\n\nto appoint a Minister so that the frequent elections are\n\navoided.   It is his submission that any kind of additional\n\nprohibition     under   <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_91\">Article    75(1)</a>   by   way        of    judicial\n\ninterpretation is impermissible as the Prime Minister is the\n\nsole repository of power under the Constitution to advise the\n\nPresident as to who should become a Minister if he is\n\notherwise constitutionally eligible and there is no statutory\n\nimpediment.       Learned senior counsel would contend that\n\nthe 1951 Act includes certain offences and specifies the\n\nstage, i.e., conviction and, therefore, if anything is added to\n\nit in respect of the stage, it would be travelling beyond the\n\ntext which would be contrary to the principles of statutory\n\ninterpretation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">31.

In essence, the submission of Mr. Parasaran\n\nis that the framers of the Constitution have bestowed\n\nimmense trust on the Prime Minister as would be seen from\n\nthe Constitutional Debates, and, therefore, this Court\n\nshould reiterate the principle of constitutional trust and\n\nthat would be a suggestive one in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 75(1)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_98\">32.

It has been highlighted before us by Mr. Dwivedi, as\n\nnoted earlier, that regard being had to the nature of office a\n\nMinister   holds   in    a   democratic     set-up    under    the\n\nConstitution, persons with criminal antecedents especially\n\ncharged for heinous and serious offences cannot and should\n\nnot hold the said office. He has emphatically put forth that\n\napart from the prohibitions contained in <a href=\"/doc/390434/\" id=\"a_108\">Articles 102</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/139447/\" id=\"a_109\">179</a> of the Constitution and the conviction under the 1951\n\nAct, the relevant stage in trial needs to be introduced to the\n\nphraseology of <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 75(1)</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 164(1)</a> so that\n\nthe Prime Minister’s authority to give advice has to be\n\nrestricted to the extent not to advise a person with criminal\n\nantecedents to become a Minister. To substantiate the said\n\nview, he has taken aid of the doctrine of “implied limitation”.\n\nIn    Kesavananda       Bharati’s   case,    Sikri,   CJ,     while\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                                                             48</span>\n\n\nexpressing his view on the doctrine of implied limitation,\n\nhas observed that in a written Constitution, it is rarely that\n\neverything is said expressly.     Powers and limitations are\n\nimplied from necessity or the scheme of the Constitution.\n\nHe has further held: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      “282. It seems to me that reading the Preamble\n      the fundamental importance of the freedom of the\n      individual, indeed its inalienability, and the\n      importance of the economic, social and political\n      justice mentioned in the Preamble, the\n      importance of directive principles, the non-\n      inclusion in <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 368</a> of provisions like <a href=\"/doc/1205651/\" id=\"a_113\">Articles\n      52</a><a href=\"/doc/1597349/\" id=\"a_114\">, 53</a> and various other provisions to which\n      reference has already been made an irresistible\n      conclusion emerges that it was not the intention\n      to use the word “amendment” in the widest\n      sense.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      283. It was the common understanding that\n      fundamental rights would remain in substance\n      as they are and they would not be amended out\n      of existence.

So far as the concept of implied\n      limitations is concerned, it has two facets. Under\n      the first facet, they are limitations which flow by\n      necessary implications from express provisions of\n      the Constitution. The second facet postulates\n      limitations which must be read in the\n      Constitution irrespective of the fact whether they\n      flow from express provisions or not because they\n      are stated to be based upon certain higher values\n      which are very dear to the human heart and are\n      generally considered essential traits of civilized\n      existence. It is also stated that those higher\n      values constitute the spirit and provide the\n      scheme of the Constitution. This aspect of\n      implied limitations is linked with the existence of\n      natural rights and it is stated that such rights\n      being of paramount character, no amendment of\n      Constitution can result in their erosion.”\n\n      Dealing with the same, the learned Judge ruled: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      “1446.

From the aforesaid authorities, it is luminescent that\n\nthe principle of implied limitation is attracted to the sphere\n\nof constitutional interpretation.         The question that is\n\nrequired to be posed here is whether taking recourse to this\n\nprinciple of interpretation, this Court can read a categorical\n\nprohibition to the words contained in <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 75(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution so that the Prime Minister is constitutionally\n\nprohibited to give advice to the President in respect of a\n\nperson for becoming a Minister of the Council of Ministers\n\nwho is facing a criminal trial for a heinous and serious\n\noffence and charges have been framed against him by the\n\ntrial Judge.     Reading such an implied limitation as a\n\nprohibition would tantamount to adding a disqualification\n\nat a particular stage of the trial in relation of a person. This\n\nis neither expressly stated nor is impliedly discernible from\n\nthe provision. The doctrine of implied limitation was applied\n\nto    the   amending   power   of   the   Constitution   by   the\n\nParliament on the fundamental foundation that the identity\n\nof the original Constitution could not be amended by taking\n\nrecourse to the plenary power of amendment under <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_133\">Article\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">\f                                                              58</span>\n\n\n368</a> of the Constitution. The essential feature or the basic\n\nstructure of the doctrine was read into <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 368</a> to say\n\nthat the identity or the framework of the Constitution\n\ncannot be destroyed.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1939993\" id=\"span_144\">In <a href=\"/doc/1939993/\" id=\"a_135\">Minerva Mills</a> case, giving\n\nexample, the Court held that by amendment, the Parliament\n\ncannot damage the democratic republican character as has\n\nbeen conceived in the Constitution. Though in <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 368</a>\n\nof the Constitution there was no express prohibition to\n\namend the constitutional provisions, yet the Court in the\n\naforesaid two cases ruled that certain features which are\n\nbasic to the Constitution cannot be changed by way of\n\namendment.     The interpretative process pertained to the\n\nword “amendment”.         Therefore, the concept of implied\n\nlimitation   was   read   into   <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_137\">Article   368</a>   to   save   the\n\nconstitutional integrity and identity. In B.R.

A\n\nsubmission was advanced that it was not open to the Court\n\nto read anything into <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 164</a>, for a non-legislator could\n\nbe sworn in as the Chief Minister, regardless of the\n\nqualifications or   disqualifications.   The Court placed\n\nreliance on Kesavananda Bharati’s case and <a href=\"/doc/1939993/\" id=\"a_148\">Minerva\n\nMills’</a> case and opined that if a non-legislator is made a\n\nChief Minister under <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 164</a>, then he must satisfy the\n\nqualification for membership of a legislator as prescribed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 173.</a> A specific query was made by the Court\n\nthat even when the person recommended, was, to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">\f                                                             60</span>\n\n\nGovernor’s knowledge, a non-citizen or under-age or lunatic\n\nor discharged insolvent, could he be appointed as a Chief\n\nMinister. It was urged that he/she could only be removed\n\nby the vote of no-confidence in the Legislature or at the next\n\nelection.   Discarding the same, the Court opined that\n\nacceptance of such a submission would invite disaster. The\n\nCourt further ruled that when a person is not qualified to\n\nbecome a Member in view of <a href=\"/doc/614870/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 173</a>, he cannot be\n\nappointed as a Chief Minister under <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 164(1).</a>      Be it\n\nnoted, there was disqualification in the Constitution and\n\nunder the 1951 Act to become a Member of the State\n\nLegislature, and hence, the Court, appreciating the text and\n\ncontext, read the disqualification into <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 164(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\">53.   On a studied scrutiny of the ratio of the aforesaid\n\ndecisions, we are of the convinced opinion that when there\n\nis no disqualification for a person against whom charges\n\nhave been framed in respect of heinous or serious offences\n\nor offences relating to corruption to contest the election, by\n\ninterpretative process, it is difficult to read the prohibition\n\ninto <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 75(1)</a> or, for that matter, into <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 164(1)</a> to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">\f                                                                    61</span>\n\n\nthe powers of the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister in\n\nsuch a manner.        That would come within the criterion of\n\neligibility and would amount to prescribing an eligibility\n\nqualification and adding a disqualification which has not\n\nbeen stipulated in the Constitution. In the absence of any\n\nconstitutional     prohibition   or     statutory   embargo,   such\n\ndisqualification, in our considered opinion, cannot be read\n\ninto <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 75(1)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/381339/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 164(1)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">PRINCIPLE        OF     CONSTITUTIONAL              SILENCE         OR\nABEYANCE\n\n54.

Apart from the aforesaid reasons, the\n     arguments by the appellants cannot be accepted\n     in view of a very well-known constitutional\n     doctrine, namely, the constitutional doctrine of\n     silence. Michael Foley in his treatise on The\n     Silence of Constitutions (Routledge, London and\n     New York) has argued that in a Constitution\n     “abeyances are valuable, therefore, not in spite of\n     their obscurity but because of it.

The next principle that we intend to discuss is the\n\nprinciple of constitutional implication.   We are obliged to\n\ndiscuss this principle as Mr. Dwivedi, learned amicus\n\ncuriae, has put immense emphasis on the words “on the\n\nadvice of the Prime Minister” occurring in <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 75(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It is his submission that these words are of\n\nimmense significance and apposite meaning from the said\n\nwords is required to be deduced to the effect that the Prime\n\nMinister is not constitutionally allowed to advise the\n\nPresident to make a person against whom charge has been\n\nframed for heinous or serious offences or offences pertaining\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">\f                                                                   65</span>\n\n\nto corruption as Minister in the Council of Ministers, regard\n\nbeing had to the sacrosanctity of the office and the oath\n\nprescribed under the Constitution. Learned senior counsel\n\nwould submit that on many an occasion, this Court has\n\nexpanded the horizon inherent in various Articles by\n\napplying        the   doctrine   of   implication    based   on   the\n\nconstitutional scheme and the language employed in other\n\nprovisions of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">58.    In this regard, inclusion of many a facet within the\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 21</a> is well established.            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572071\" id=\"span_160\">In R.

There is no speck of doubt that the Court has applied\n\nthe doctrine of implication to expand the constitutional\n\nconcepts, but the context in which the horizon has been\n\nexpanded has to be borne in mind. What is suggested by\n\nMr. Dwivedi is that by taking recourse to the said principle,\n\nthe words employed in <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 75(1)</a> are to be interpreted to\n\nadd a stage in the disqualification, i.e., framing of charges in\n\nserious and heinous criminal offences or offences relating to\n\ncorruption. At this juncture, it is seemly to state that the\n\nprinciple         of implication is fundamentally founded on\n\nrational inference of an idea from the words used in the\n\ntext.          The concept of legitimate deduction is always\n\nrecognised.                 In     Melbourne       Corporation      v\n\nCommonwealth47, Dixon, J opined that constitutional\n\nimplication should be based on considerations which are\n\ncompelling.               Mason, CJ, in Political Advertising Case48,\n\nhas ruled that there can be structural implications which\n\nare ‘logically or practically necessary for the preservation of\n\nthe integrity of that structure’.              Any proposition that is\n\narrived at taking this route of interpretation must find some\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">47</span>\n     (1974) 74 CLR 31\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">48</span>\n     (1992) 177 CLR 106\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">\f                                                                        67</span>\n\n\nresting pillar or strength on the basis of certain words in the\n\ntext or the scheme of the text. In the absence of that, it may\n\nnot be permissible for a Court to deduce any proposition as\n\nthat would defeat the legitimacy of reasoning. A proposition\n\ncan be established by reading number of articles cohesively,\n\nfor that will be in the domain of substantive legitimacy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">60. Dixon, J, in Australian National Airways Pty Ltd. v\n\nCommonwealth49, said: ‘I do not see why we should be\n\nfearful about making implications’. The said principle has\n\nbeen approved in Lamshed v Lake50, and thereafter, in\n\nPayroll Tax Case51. Thus, the said principle can be taken\n\naid     of    for    the      purpose   of   interpreting   constitutional\n\nprovision in an expansive manner.                  But, it has its own\n\nlimitations.         The interpretation has to have a base in the\n\nConstitution.           The Court cannot re-write a constitutional\n\nprovision. In this context, we may fruitfully refer to Kuldip\n\nNayar’s case wherein the Court repelled the contention that\n\na right to vote invariably carries an implied term, i.e., the\n\nright to vote in secrecy. The Court observed that where the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">49</span>\n   (1945) 71 CLR 29, 85\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">50</span>\n   (1958) 99 CLR 132, 144-5\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">51</span>\n   (1971) 122 CLR 353, 401\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">\f                                                               68</span>\n\n\nConstitution thought it fit to do so, it has itself provided for\n\nelections by secret ballot e.g., in the case of election of the\n\nPresident   of   India   and   the   Vice-President   of   India.\n\nThereafter, the Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/1512215/\" id=\"a_183\">Articles 55(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1519009/\" id=\"a_184\">66(1)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution which provide for elections of the President\n\nand the Vice-President respectively, referring to voting by\n\nelectoral colleges, consisting of elected Members              of\n\nParliament and Legislative Assembly of each State for the\n\npurposes of the former office and Members of both Houses\n\nof Parliament for the latter office and in both cases, it was\n\nfelt necessary by the framers of the Constitution to provide\n\nthat the voting at such elections shall be by secret ballot\n\nthrough inclusion of the words “and the voting at such\n\nelection shall be by secret ballot”.    If the right to vote by\n\nitself implies or postulates voting in secrecy, then <a href=\"/doc/1512215/\" id=\"a_185\">Articles\n\n55(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1519009/\" id=\"a_186\">66(1)</a> would not have required the inclusion of\n\nsuch words. The necessity for including the said condition\n\nin the said articles shows that “secret ballot” is not always\n\nimplied. It is not incorporated in the concept of voting by\n\nnecessary implication. Thereafter, the Court opined: -\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">\f                                                             69</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      “421.

Thus analysed, it is not possible to accept the\n\nsubmission of Mr. Dwivedi that while interpreting the words\n\n“advice of the Prime Minister” it can legitimately be inferred\n\nthat there is a prohibition to think of a person as a Minister\n\nif charges have been framed against him in respect of\n\nheinous and serious offences including corruption cases\n\nunder the criminal law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">\nOTHER RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTS –\nCONSTITUTIONAL MORALITY, GOOD GOVERNANCE\nAND CONSTITUTIONAL TRUST\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">62.

The      principle         of    constitutional   morality   basically\n\nmeans to bow down to the norms of the Constitution and\n\nnot to act in a manner which would become violative of the\n\nrule of law or reflectible of action in an arbitrary manner. It\n\nactually works at the fulcrum and guides as a laser beam in\n\ninstitution building. The traditions and conventions have to\n\ngrow to sustain the value of such a morality.                                The\n\ndemocratic values survive and become successful where the\n\npeople at large and the persons-in-charge of the institution\n\nare strictly guided by the constitutional parameters without\n\npaving the path of deviancy and reflecting in action the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">52</span>\n     Constituent Assembly Debates 1989: VII, 38.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">\f                                                                               71</span>\n\n\nprimary concern to maintain institutional integrity and the\n\nrequisite constitutional restraints.

In framing a government\n          which is to be administered by men over men, the\n          great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable\n          the government to control the governed; and in\n          the next place oblige it to control itself.       A\n          dependence on the people is, no doubt, the\n          primary control on the government; but\n          experience has taught mankind the necessity of\n          auxiliary precautions.53”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">65.

Responding to the proposal for the\n\namendment suggested by Prof. K.T. Shah with regard to the\n\nintroduction of a disqualification of a convicted person\n\nbecoming a Minister, Dr. B.R.

But the whole\n          question is this whether we should introduce all\n          these qualifications and disqualifications in the\n          Constitution itself. Is it not desirable, is it not\n          sufficient that we should trust the Prime\n          Minister, the Legislature and the public at large\n          watching the actions of the Ministers and the\n          actions of the Legislature to see that no such\n          infamous thing is done by either of them? I think\n          this is a case which may eminently be left to the\n          good-sense of the Prime Minister and to the good\n          sense of the Legislature with the general public\n          holding a watching brief upon them.

As\n\nper the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, one of the\n\nmeanings of the word “advice” is “the way in which a matter\n\nis looked at; opinion; judgment”.    As per P. Ramanatha\n\nAiyer’s Law Lexicon, 2nd Edition, one of the meanings given\n\nto the word “advice” is “counsel given or an opinion\n\nexpressed as to the wisdom of future conduct” (Abbot L.\n\nDict.). In Webster Comprehensive Dictionary, International\n\nEdition, one of the meanings given to the word “advice” is\n\n“encouragement or dissuasion; counsel; suggestion”. Thus,\n\nthe word “advice” conveys formation of an opinion. The said\n\nformation of an opinion by the Prime Minister in the context\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 75(1)</a> is expressed by the use of the said word\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">\f                                                               82</span>\n\n\nbecause of the trust reposed in the Prime Minister under the\n\nConstitution.     To put it differently, it is a “constitutional\n\nadvice”.   The repose of faith in the Prime Minister by the\n\nentire nation under the Constitution has expectations of\n\ngood governance which is carried on by Ministers of his\n\nchoice. It is also expected that the persons who are chosen\n\nas Ministers do not have criminal antecedents, especially\n\nfacing trial in respect of serious or heinous criminal offences\n\nor offences pertaining to corruption.         There can be no\n\ndispute over the proposition that unless a person is\n\nconvicted,   he    is   presumed   to   be   innocent   but   the\n\npresumption of innocence in criminal jurisprudence is\n\nsomething altogether different, and not to be considered for\n\nbeing chosen as a Minister to the Council of Ministers\n\nbecause framing of charge in a criminal case is totally\n\nanother thing.     Framing of charge in a trial has its own\n\nsignificance and consequence. Setting the criminal law into\n\nmotion by lodging of an FIR or charge sheet being filed by\n\nthe investigating agency is in the sphere of investigation.\n\nFraming of charge is a judicial act by an experienced\n\njudicial mind. As the Debates in the Constituent Assembly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">\f                                                                       83</span>\n\n\nwould     show,    after    due    deliberation,     they   thought    it\n\nappropriate to leave it to the wisdom of the Prime Minister\n\nbecause of the intrinsic faith in the Prime Minister. At the\n\ntime of framing of the Constitution, the debate pertained to\n\nconviction. With the change of time, the entire complexion\n\nin the political arena as well as in other areas has changed.\n\nThis Court, on number of occasions, as pointed out\n\nhereinbefore,     has      taken   note   of   the    prevalence      and\n\ncontinuous growth of criminalization in politics and the\n\nentrenchment of corruption at many a level.                        In a\n\ndemocracy, the people never intend to be governed by\n\npersons who have criminal antecedents. This is not merely\n\na hope and aspiration of citizenry but the idea is also\n\nengrained in apposite executive governance. It would be apt\n\nto say that when a country is governed by a Constitution,\n\napart   from      constitutional     provisions,      and    principles\n\nconstitutional morality and trust, certain conventions are\n\nadopted and grown.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"753224\" id=\"span_209\">In Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/753224/\" id=\"a_201\">Advocates-on-\n\nRecord Association</a> (supra), the Court reproduced a\n\npassage    from     K.C.

From the aforesaid, it becomes graphically vivid that\n\nthe Prime Minister has been regarded as the repository of\n\nconstitutional trust. The use of the words “on the advice of\n\nthe Prime Minister” cannot be allowed to operate in a\n\nvacuum to lose their significance. There can be no scintilla\n\nof doubt that the Prime Minister’s advice is binding on the\n\nPresident for the appointment of a person as a Minister to\n\nthe   Council   of   Ministers   unless   the said   person   is\n\ndisqualified under the Constitution to contest the election or\n\nunder the 1951 Act, as has been held in B.R. Kapur’s case.\n\nThat is in the realm of disqualification.     But, a pregnant\n\none, the trust reposed in a high constitutional functionary\n\nlike the Prime Minister under the Constitution does not end\n\nthere.   That the Prime Minister would be giving apposite\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">\f                                                               86</span>\n\n\nadvice to the President is a legitimate constitutional\n\nexpectation, for it is a paramount constitutional concern. In\n\na controlled Constitution like ours, the Prime Minister is\n\nexpected to act with constitutional responsibility as a\n\nconsequence of which the cherished values of democracy\n\nand established norms of good governance get condignly\n\nfructified. The framers of the Constitution left many a thing\n\nunwritten by reposing immense trust in the Prime Minister.\n\nThe scheme of the Constitution suggests that there has to\n\nbe an emergence of constitutional governance which would\n\ngradually grow to give rise to constitutional renaissance.\n\n\n85-A.     It is worthy to note that the Council of Ministers\n\nhas the collective responsibility to sustain the integrity and\n\npurity of the constitutional structure.     That is why the\n\nPrime Minister enjoys a great magnitude of constitutional\n\npower.   Therefore, the responsibility is more, regard being\n\nhad to the instillation of trust, a constitutional one.      It is\n\nalso expected that the Prime Minster should act in the\n\ninterest of the national polity of the nation-state. He has to\n\nbear in mind that unwarranted elements or persons who are\n\nfacing charge in certain category of offences may thwart or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">\f                                                            87</span>\n\n\nhinder the canons of constitutional morality or principles of\n\ngood governance and eventually diminish the constitutional\n\ntrust.   We have already held that prohibition cannot be\n\nbrought in within the province of ‘advice’ but indubitably,\n\nthe concepts, especially the constitutional trust, can be\n\nallowed to be perceived in the act of such advice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">86.   Thus, while interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1532170/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 75(1)</a>, definitely a\n\ndisqualification cannot be added. However, it can always be\n\nlegitimately expected, regard being had to the role of a\n\nMinister in the Council of Ministers and keeping in view the\n\nsanctity of oath he takes, the Prime Minister, while living up\n\nto the trust reposed in him, would consider not choosing a\n\nperson with criminal antecedents against whom charges\n\nhave been framed for heinous or serious criminal offences or\n\ncharges of corruption to become a Minister of the Council of\n\nMinisters. This is what the Constitution suggests and that\n\nis the constitutional expectation from the Prime Minister.\n\nRest has to be left to the wisdom of the Prime Minister. We\n\nsay nothing more, nothing less.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">\f                                                                          88</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">87.

The question in the amended writ petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_204\">Article\n\n32</a> of the Constitution is rather narrow, but the submissions were\n\nquite broad-based.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">3.      Two substantive reliefs have been claimed in the writ petition.\n\nThe first relief is for a declaration that the appointment of\n\nRespondent Nos. 3 to 7 as Ministers in the Government of India is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                         Page 1 of 27</span>\n\funconstitutional. This is based, inter alia, on the averment that\n\nthese respondents have ‘criminal antecedents’. Subsequently by an\n\norder passed on 24th March, 2006 these respondents (along with\n\nrespondent No. 2) were deleted from the array of parties since the\n\nbroad question before this Court was “about the legality of the\n\npersons with criminal background and/or charged with offences\n\ninvolving moral turpitude being appointed as ministers in Central\n\nand State Governments.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">4.

It was held that a non-\n\nelected person may be appointed as a Minister, but only for a period\n\nof six months.

Thus, we find from the positions prevailing in England,\n                Australia and Canada that the essentials of a system of\n                representative government, like the one we have in our country,\n                are that invariably all Ministers are chosen out of the members of\n                the Legislature and only in rare cases, a non-member is appointed\n                as a Minister, who must get himself returned to the Legislature by\n                direct or indirect election within a short period. He cannot be\n                permitted to continue in office indefinitely unless he gets elected in\n                the meanwhile. The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/578636/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 164</a> of the Constitution is no\n                different, except that the period of grace during which the non-\n                member may get elected has been fixed as “six consecutive\n                months”, from the date of his appointment. (In Canada he must get\n                elected quickly and in Australia, within three months.) The framers\n                of the Constitution did not visualise that a non-legislator can be\n                repeatedly appointed as a Minister for a term of six months each\n                time, without getting elected because such a course strikes at the\n                very root of parliamentary democracy. According to learned\n                counsel for the respondent, there is no bar to this course being\n                adopted on the “plain language of the article”, which does not\n                “expressly” prohibit reappointment of the Minister, without being\n                elected, even repeatedly, during the term of the same Legislative\n                Assembly.

Constitutional provisions are required to be understood and\n                interpreted with an object-oriented approach. A Constitution must\n                not be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense. The words used\n                may be general in terms but, their full import and true meaning,\n                has to be appreciated considering the true context in which the\n                same are used and the purpose which they seek to achieve.\n                Debates in the Constituent Assembly referred to in an earlier part\n                of this judgment clearly indicate that a non-member’s inclusion in\n                the Cabinet was considered to be a “privilege” that extends only for\n                six months, during which period the member must get elected,\n                otherwise he would cease to be a Minister.

We must remember that a Constitution is not just a\n                    document in solemn form, but a living framework for the\n                    Government of the people exhibiting a sufficient degree of cohesion\n                    and its successful working depends upon the democratic spirit\n                    underlying it being respected in letter and in spirit. The debates\n                    clearly indicate the “privilege” to extend “only” for six months.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">14.        An implied limitation in the Constitution was also read in B.\n\nR.

Nevertheless, having been projected as the Chief\n\nMinisterial nominee of the political party that obtained a majority in\n\nthe elections, she was elected as its leader and appointed as the\n\nChief Minister of the State.

Therefore,           two       implied      limitations   were   read   into     the\n\nConstitution with regard to the appointment of an unelected person\n\nas a Minister. Firstly, the Minister cannot continue as a Minister\n\nbeyond a period of six months without getting elected, nor can such\n\na person be repeatedly appointed as a Minister. Secondly, the\n\nperson should not be under any disqualification for being appointed\n\nas a legislator.

It was\n\nheld that the pleasure doctrine as originally envisaged in England\n\ngave unfettered power to the authority at whose pleasure a person\n\nheld an office. However, where the rule of law prevails, the\n\n“fundamentals of constitutionalism” cannot be ignored, meaning\n\nthereby that the pleasure doctrine does not enable an unfettered\n\ndiscretion to act arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously.

The expression ‘criminal antecedents’ or ‘criminal background’\n\nis extremely vague and incapable of any precise definition. Does it\n\nrefer to a person accused (but not charged or convicted) of an\n\noffence or a person charged (but not convicted) of an offence or only\n\na person convicted of an offence? No clear answer was made\n\navailable to this question, particularly in the context of the\n\npresumption            of    innocence   that   is   central   to   our    criminal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                                      Page 13 of 27</span>\n\fjurisprudence. Therefore, to say that a person with criminal\n\nantecedents or a criminal background ought not to be elected to the\n\nLegislature or appointed a Minister in the Central Government is\n\nreally to convey an imprecise view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">24.     The law does not hold a person guilty or deem or brand a\n\nperson as a criminal only because an allegation is made against\n\nthat person of having committed a criminal offence – be it in the\n\nform of an off-the-cuff allegation or an allegation in the form of a\n\nFirst Information Report or a complaint or an accusation in a final\n\nreport under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 173</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code or even on\n\ncharges being framed by a competent Court. The reason for this is\n\nfundamental to criminal jurisprudence, the rule of law and is quite\n\nsimple, although it is often forgotten or overlooked – a person is\n\ninnocent until proven guilty. This would apply to a person accused\n\nof one or multiple offences. At law, he or she is not a criminal – that\n\nperson may stand ‘condemned’ in the public eye, but even that does\n\nnot entitle anyone to brand him or her a criminal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">25.     Consequently, merely because a First Information Report is\n\nlodged against a person or a criminal complaint is filed against him\n\nor her or even if charges are framed against that person, there is no\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                         Page 14 of 27</span>\n\fbar to that person being elected as a Member of Parliament or being\n\nappointed as a Minister in the Central Government.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">26.      Parliament has, therefore, in its wisdom, made a distinction\n\nbetween an accused person and a convict. For the purposes of the\n\nelection law, an accused person is as much entitled to be elected to\n\nthe Legislature as a person not accused of any offence. But,\n\nParliament has taken steps to ensure that at least some categories\n\nof convicted persons are disqualified from being elected to the\n\nLegislature. A statutory disqualification is to be found in Section 8\n\nof the Representation of the People Act, 1951.7 The adequacy of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">7</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">  8.

Apart from the difficulty in fixing\n\nthe quantum of sentence (adverted to above), there are several other\n\nimponderables, one of them being the nature of the offence. It has\n\nbeen pointed out by Rodney Brazier in “Is it a constitutional issue:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">fitness for ministerial office in the 1990s”13 that there are four\n\ncategories of offences. The learned author says:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">                    “But four types of crime may be distinguished. First, minor\n                    convictions would not count against a politician&#x27;s worthiness for\n                    office. Minor driving offences, for example, are neither here nor\n                    there. Secondly, and at the other extreme, convictions for offences\n                    involving moral turpitude would dash any ministerial career. No\n                    one could remain in the Government who had been convicted of\n                    any offence of corruption, dishonesty, serious violence, or sexual\n                    misconduct. Thirdly, and most difficult, are offences the\n                    seriousness of which turn on the facts. A conviction for (say)\n                    assault, or driving with excess alcohol in the blood, could present a\n                    marginal case which would turn on its own facts.

In this context, it is\n\nappropriate to recall the words of Dr. Ambedkar in the Constituent\n\nAssembly on 30th December, 1948. He said:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">                   “His [Hon’ble K.T.

Well, so far as\n                   his intention is concerned, it is no doubt very laudable and I do not\n                   think any Member of this House would like to differ from him on\n                   that proposition. But the whole question is this whether we should\n                   introduce all these qualifications and disqualifications in the\n                   Constitution itself. Is it not desirable, is it not sufficient that we\n                   should trust the Prime Minister, the Legislature and the public at\n                   large watching the actions of the Ministers and the actions of the\n                   legislature to see that no such infamous thing is done by either of\n                   them? I think this is a case which may eminently be left to the\n                   good-sense of the Prime Minister and to the good sense of the\n                   Legislature with the general public holding a watching brief upon\n                   them. I therefore say that these amendments are unnecessary.”14\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">33.        That a discussion is needed is evident from the material\n\nplaced by the learned Additional Solicitor General. He referred to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_261\">14</span>\n     Constituent Assembly Debates, Volume VII\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                                         Page 20 of 27</span>\n\fthe 18th Report presented to the Rajya Sabha on 15th March, 2007\n\nby the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee On\n\nPersonnel, Public Grievances, Law And Justice on Electoral Reforms\n\n(Disqualification Of Persons From Contesting Elections On Framing\n\nOf Charges Against Them For Certain Offences). The Report\n\nacknowledges the criminalization of our polity and the necessity of\n\ncleansing the political climate and had this to say:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">                “At the same time, the Committee is deeply conscious of the\n                criminalization of our polity and the fast erosion of confidence of\n                the people at large in our political process of the day. This will\n                certainly weaken our democracy and will render the democratic\n                institutions sterile. The Committee therefore feels that politics\n                should be cleansed of persons with established criminal\n                background. The objective is to prevent criminalisation of politics\n                and maintain probity in elections. Criminalization of politics is the\n                bane of society and negation of democracy. But the arguments\n                against the proposal of the Election Commission are overwhelming.\n                As stated in the foregoing paras the Courts frame charges even\n                when they are conscious that the case is ultimately bound to fail.\n                Appreciation of evidence at the stage of framing charges being\n                more or less prohibited, charges are still framed even when the\n                court is convinced that the prosecution will never succeed. There\n                are many glaring illustrations which are of common knowledge and\n                any criminal lawyer can multiply instances of such nature. Hence\n                the proposal can not be accepted in its present form as the country\n                has witnessed in the past misuse of MISA, TADA, POTA etc.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">34.     On the issue of criminalization of politics, the learned\n\nAdditional Solicitor General also referred to the 244th Report of the\n\nLaw       Commission              of   India   on   “Electoral   Disqualifications”\n\npresented in February, 2014. Though the Report concerns itself\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                                     Page 21 of 27</span>\n\fprimarily with the disqualification to be a member of a Legislature,\n\nit   does       give     some          interesting   statistics   about   the   elected\n\nrepresentatives of the people in the following words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">                “In the current Lok Sabha, 30% or 162 sitting MPs have criminal\n                cases pending against them, of which about half i.e. 76 have\n                serious criminal cases. Further, the prevalence of MPs with\n                criminal cases pending has increased over time. In 2004, 24% of\n                Lok Sabha MPs had criminal cases pending, which increased to\n                30% in the 2009 elections.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">                The situation is similar across states with 31% or 1,258 out of\n                4,032 sitting MLAs with pending cases, with again about half being\n                serious cases. Some states have a much higher percentage of MLAs\n                with criminal records: in Uttar Pradesh, 47% of MLAs have\n                criminal cases pending. A number of MPs and MLAs have been\n                accused of multiple counts of criminal charges. In a constituency\n                of Uttar Pradesh, for example, the MLA has 36 criminal cases\n                pending including 14 cases related to murder.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">                From this data it is clear that about one-third of elected candidates\n                at the Parliament and State Assembly levels in India have some\n                form of criminal taint. Data elsewhere suggests that one-fifth of\n                MLAs have pending cases which have proceeded to the stage of\n                charges being framed against them by a court at the time of their\n                election. Even more disturbing is the finding that the percentage of\n                winners with criminal cases pending is higher than the percentage\n                of candidates without such backgrounds. While only 12% of\n                candidates with a “clean” record win on average, 23% of candidates\n                with some kind of criminal record win. This means that candidates\n                charged with a crime actually fare better at elections than ‘clean’\n                candidates. Probably as a result, candidates with criminal cases\n                against them tend to be given tickets a second time. Not only do\n                political parties select candidates with criminal backgrounds, there\n                is evidence to suggest that untainted representatives later become\n                involved in criminal activities. The incidence of criminalisation of\n                politics is thus pervasive making its remediation an urgent need.”\n\n\n        While it may be necessary, due to the criminalization of our\n\npolity and consequently of our politics, to ensure that certain\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                                        Page 22 of 27</span>\n\fpersons do not become Ministers, this is not possible through\n\nguidelines issued by this Court.

It is wise to remember the words of Dr. Ambedkar in the\n\nConstituent Assembly on 25th November, 1949. He had this to say\n\nabout the working of our Constitution:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">                   “As much defence as could be offered to the Constitution has been\n                   offered by my friends Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar and Mr. T.T.\n                   Krishnamachari. I shall not therefore enter into the merits of the\n                   Constitution. Because I feel, however good a Constitution may be,\n                   it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it,\n                   happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may\n                   turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be\n                   a good lot. The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly\n                   upon the nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide\n                   only the organs of State such as the Legislature, the Executive and\n                   the Judiciary. The factors on which the working of those organs of\n                   the State depend are the people and the political parties they will\n                   set up as their instruments to carry out their wishes and their\n                   politics. Who can say how the people of India and their purposes or\n                   will they prefer revolutionary methods of achieving them? If they\n                   adopt the revolutionary methods, however good the Constitution\n                   may be, it requires no prophet to say that it will fail. It is, therefore,\n                   futile to pass any judgement upon the Constitution without\n                   reference to the part which the people and their parties are likely\n                   to play.”18\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">18</span>\n     http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol11p11.htm\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">Writ Petition (Civil) No.289 of 2005                                            Page 26 of 27</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">\f41.

Right or wrong, for\n\ncourt, not in the ethical sense of morality but in the constitutional\n\nsense.

One cannot think of the Constitution of India without the\n\npreambular principle of democracy and good governance.\n\nGovernance is mainly in the hands of the Executive. The\n\nexecutive power of the Union under <a href=\"/doc/1597349/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 53</a> and that of the\n\nStates under <a href=\"/doc/1995256/\" id=\"a_256\">Article 154</a> vests in the President of India and the\n\nGovernor of the State, respectively. <a href=\"/doc/127060/\" id=\"a_257\">Article 74</a> for the Union of\n\nIndia and <a href=\"/doc/674146/\" id=\"a_258\">Article 163</a> for the State have provided for the Council\n\nof Ministers to aid and advise the President or the Governor, as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                                                                   2</span>\n\fthe case may be.

Before entering office, a Minister has to take oath of\n\noffice (Article 75/164). In form, except for the change in the\n\nwords ‘Union’ or particular ‘State’, there is no difference in the\n\nform of oath. Ministers take oath to … “faithfully and\n\nconscientiously discharge …” their duties and …. “do right to all\n\nmanner of people in accordance with Constitution and the law,\n\nwithout fear or favour, affection or ill-will”.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">6.    Allegiance to the Constitution of India, faithful and\n\nconscientious discharge of the duties, doing right to people and\n\nall these without fear or favour, affection or ill-will, carry heavy\n\nweight. ‘Conscientious’ means “wishing to do what is right,\n\nrelating to a person’s conscience” (Ref.: Concise Oxford English\n\nDictionary). The simple question is, whether a person who has\n\ncome in conflict with law and, in particular, in conflict with law\n\non offences involving moral turpitude and laws specified by the\n\nParliament under <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_259\">Chapter III of The Representation of the\n\nPeople Act, 1951</a>, would be in a position to conscientiously and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                                                                  3</span>\n\ffaithfully discharge his duties as Minister and that too, without\n\nany fear or favour?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_236\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">7.   When does a person come in conflict with law? No quarrel,\n\nunder criminal jurisprudence, a person is presumed to be\n\ninnocent until he is convicted. But is there not a stage when a\n\nperson is presumed to be culpable and hence called upon to\n\nface trial, on the court framing charges?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_238\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_239\">8.   Under <a href=\"/doc/411062/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 228</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n1973 (hereinafter referred to as ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_261\">Cr.PC</a>’), charge is framed by\n\nthe court only if the Judge (the Magistrate – under <a href=\"/doc/150946/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 240</a>\n\nCr.PC) is of the opinion that there is ground for presumption that\n\nthe accused has committed an offence, after consideration of\n\nopinion given by the police under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 173(2)</a> Cr.PC\n\n(challan/police charge-sheet) and the record of the case and\n\ndocuments. It may be noted that the prosecutor and the accused\n\nperson are heard by the court in the process. Is there not a\n\ncloud on his innocence at that stage? Is it not a stage where his\n\nintegrity is questioned? If so, is it not a stage where the person\n\nhas come in conflict with law, and if so, is it desirable in a\n\ncountry governed by rule of law to entrust the executive power\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                                                                4</span>\n\fwith such a person who is already in conflict with law? Will any\n\nreasonably prudent master leave the keys of his chest with a\n\nservant whose integrity is doubted? It may not be altogether\n\nirrelevant to note that a person even of doubtful integrity is not\n\nappointed in the important organ of the State which interprets\n\nlaw and administers justice; then why to speak of questioned\n\nintegrity! What to say more, a candidate involved in any\n\ncriminal case and facing trial, is not appointed in any civil\n\nservice because of the alleged criminal antecedents, until\n\nacquitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_240\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\">9.   Good governance is only in the hands of good men. No\n\ndoubt, what is good or bad is not for the court to decide: but the\n\ncourt can always indicate the constitutional ethos on goodness,\n\ngood governance and purity in administration and remind the\n\nconstitutional functionaries to preserve, protect and promote the\n\nsame. Those ethos are the unwritten words in our Constitution.\n\nHowever, as the Constitution makers stated, there is a\n\npresumption that the Prime Minister/Chief Minister would be\n\nwell advised and guided by such unwritten yet constitutional\n\nprinciples as well. According to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                                                5</span>\n\fspecifically referred to by my learned brother at pargraph-70 of\n\nthe leading judgment, such things were only to be left to the\n\ngood sense of the Prime Minister, and for that matter, the Chief\n\nMinister of State, since it was expected that the two great\n\nconstitutional functionaries would not dare to do any infamous\n\nthing by inducting an otherwise unfit person to the Council of\n\nMinisters. It appears, over a period of time, at least in some\n\ncases, it was only a story of great expectations. Some of the\n\ninstances pointed out in the writ petition indicate that\n\nDr. Ambedkar and other great visionaries in the Constituent\n\nAssembly have been bailed out. Qualification has been wrongly\n\nunderstood as the mere absence of prescribed disqualification.\n\nHence, it has become the bounden duty of the court to remind\n\nthe Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the State of their\n\nduty to act in accordance with the constitutional aspirations. To\n\nquote Dr. Ambedkar:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_242\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">     “However, good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn\n     out bad because those who are called to work it happen\n     to be a bad lot. However, bad a Constitution may be, it\n     may turn out to be good if those who are called to work\n     it happen to be a good lot. The working of a\n     Constitution does not depend wholly upon the nature of\n     the Constitution.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                                                6</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">\f10.   Fortunately for us, our Constitution has stood the test of\n\ntime and is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world.\n\nProblem has been with the other part, though sporadically.\n\nKautilya, one of the great Indian exponents of art of government,\n\nhas dealt with qualification of king and his councillors at\n\nChapter IX in Arthasastra, said to be compiled between\n\nBC 321-296.

No doubt, it is not for the court to issue any direction to the\n\nPrime Minister or the Chief Minister, as the case may be, as to\n\nthe manner in which they should exercise their power while\n\nselecting the colleagues in the Council of Ministers. That is the\n\nconstitutional prerogative of those functionaries who are called\n\nupon to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. But it is\n\nthe prophetic duty of this Court to remind the key duty holders\n\nabout their role in working the Constitution. Hence, I am of the\n\nfirm view, that the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the\n\nState, who themselves have taken oath to bear true faith and\n\nallegiance to the Constitution of India and to discharge their\n\nduties faithfully and conscientiously, will be well advised to\n\nconsider avoiding any person in the Council of Ministers,\n\nagainst whom charges have been framed by a criminal court in\n\nrespect of offences involving moral turpitude and also offences\n\nspecifically referred to in <a href=\"/doc/320017/\" id=\"a_264\">Chapter III of The Representation of\n\nthe People Act, 1951</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_248\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_249\">                                              ...……………………J.\n                                              (KURIAN JOSEPH)\n\nNew Delhi;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_250\">August 27, 2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_251\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                                                   8</span>\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\fITEM NO.1B                 COURT NO.1             SECTION PIL\n(For Judgment)\n                 S U P R E M E C O U R T O F      I N D I A\n                         RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS\n\n         WRIT PETITION (CIVIL)    NO. 289 OF 2005\n\nMANOJ NARULA                                    Petitioner(s)\n\n                                  VERSUS\n\nUNION OF INDIA                                  Respondent(s)\n\nDate : 27/08/2014     This petition was called on for\n                      pronouncement of judgment today.\n\nFor Petitioner(s)     Mr. Anil Kumar Jha, Adv.\n\nFor Respondent(s)     Mr. Arijit Prasad, Adv.\n                      For Mr. B.K.
