It is reiterated that the police cannot (under the\n          existing orders) indulge in night visits; domiciliary visits to\n          the houses of a suspect or accused. They cannot take or\n          demand the photographs, fingerprints etc., except under\n          the procedure established by a &#x27;law&#x27; and if the conditions\n          laid down are satisfied.

(i) Learned Government Pleader for Home, mainly submits\n\nthat, the learned Single Judge erred in embarking upon the\n\nvalidity of Chapter 33 of A.P. Police Standing Orders in-stead of\n\ndeciding the violations on case-to-case basis. He further submits\n\nthat, these Standing Orders, which are issued, have statutory\n\nforce, which is evident from the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_1\">Police Act</a>. According to him, the\n\nrestrictions imposed on the right of the individual are reasonable\n\nrestrictions and the same are not in violation of fundamental\n\nrights.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">(ii)       The learned Government Pleader mainly submitted that, the\n\nratio laid down in K.S.

In\n\nother words, his argument appears to be that, both the cases run\n\nparallel to each other. It is urged that, the Order of the learned\n\nSingle Judge is implemented in toto, it would be difficult for the\n\nPolice to proceed with investigation in sensitive cases, as most of\n\nthe cases are now based on the material collected by interrogating\n\nthe suspects. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_3\">He also relies upon the judgment of the combined\n\nHigh Court of Andhra Pradesh in <a href=\"/doc/232602/\" id=\"a_2\">Sunkara Satyanarayana V.\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh, Home Department and Ors.2</a>, to\n\ncontend that, the Police Standing Orders are clothed with\n\nstatutory power. Hence, seeks to suspend the order impugned.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">4.         Sri. Koneti Raja Reddy, learned Counsel appearing for the\n\nWrit Petitioners/Respondents, mainly submits that, when the\n\nlearned Single Judge has held the Police Standing Orders has no\n\nforce of law and in view of the Judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in K.S. Puttaswamy&#x27;s [cited 1st supra], wherein, right to\n\nprivacy was declared as Fundamental Right, the Court cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">1</span>\n    (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">2</span>\n    1999 (6) ALT 240\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                  4</span>\n\nsuspend the order. In other words, his argument appears to be\n\nthat, when fundamental rights are held to be infringed, question\n\nof suspending the said Order would not arise. He took us through\n\nthe judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court to establish that\n\nthese rowdy sheets have no force of law and, there cannot be any\n\nsurveillance invading the privacy of Writ Petitioners, more so, by\n\nsummoning them to Police Station, making them wait for hours\n\ntogether and, thereafter, torturing them under the guise of\n\ninvestigation. Hence, pleads that I.A. may be dismissed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">5.   The issue that arises for consideration is, whether a prima\n\nfacie case to suspend the Common Order, dated 15.07.2022,\n\npassed in W.P. No. 3568 of 2022, is made out by the Appellants?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">6.

Under Section 9 of Madras District Police Act, the Inspector\n\nGeneral of Police, as Head of Police force, issued number of\n\nStanding Orders, which were mainly guidelines for day to day\n\nadministration and functioning of Police force. The Madras\n\nDistrict Police Act (Act 24 of 1859), which was later adopted by the\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh, as Andhra Adaptation Order, 1953, after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        5</span>\n\nthe formation of State came to be known as <a href=\"/doc/89474490/\" id=\"a_3\">A.P. (Andhra Area)\n\nDistrict Police Act, 1859</a>. It is also to be noted here that, a\n\nseparate Act was then framed even for Telangana Area as well.\n\nFrom the above, it is prima facie clear that, all the Police Standing\n\nOrders that were issued till 1954 by the Inspector General of\n\nPolice for the State of Madras were adopted in toto by the Andhra\n\nPradesh State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">8.   <a href=\"/doc/89474490/\" id=\"a_4\">The Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) District Police Act, 1859</a>,\n\n[&#x27;Act&#x27;], was enacted for better regulation of police force within the\n\nAndhra Area of the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Preamble of the\n\nAct states that, it is expedient to make the police force throughout\n\nthe Andhra area of the State of Andhra Pradesh, a more efficient\n\ninstrument for prevention and detection of crime and to re-\n\norganize the Police-force. At this stage, it would be appropriate to\n\nrefer to <a href=\"/doc/86715036/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/110879193/\" id=\"a_6\">21</a> of the said Act, which are as under:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">      9.

In Sunkara Satyanarayana [cited 2nd supra], a learned\n\nSingle Judge of the combined High Court has specifically framed a\n\nissue, namely, &quot;as to whether the Police Standing Orders have any\n\nstatutory force&quot;. Considering the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/867890/\" id=\"a_11\">State of Andhra Pradesh V. N.

But such of the Police Standing Orders which\n            are issued in exercise of any statutory power either by the\n            Government or by other authorities and duly notified, can be\n            clothed with statutory power.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">3</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">    AIR (1964) SC 33\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                         8</span>\n\n      (1.2) Whether the Police Standing Orders statutory or non-\n      statutory, it is permissible for the police to implement Police\n      Standing Orders only with a view to prevent Crime in the\n      society and for nothing else.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      (1.3) A reading of the relevant Police Standing Orders\n      authorising the police to record and maintain crime history of\n      the station including opening of history sheets and rowdy\n      sheets would show that they are administrative instructions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      (1.4) A police officer may open History Sheet automatically at\n      the time of conviction of a person. But the conviction is not for\n      all offences.

Besides these, persons\n      who are convicted for offences relating to coins and\n      Government Stamps and persons convicted twice for the\n      offences like theft and house breaking and professional\n      prisoners are also the persons against whom history sheets\n      can be opened by the police.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      (1.5) ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      (1.6) ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      (1.7) ....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      (1.8) ....&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">13.   From a reading of the above judgment, it is very clear that,\n\nthough, they are administrative instructions authorizing the Police\n\nto record, maintain crime history of the police including opening of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                9</span>\n\nhistory sheets and rowdy sheets, but the same were held to be\n\nclothed with statutory power.

Issue        identical   to   the   case   on   hand,   came    up   for\n\nconsideration before the Karnataka High Court, wherein, a\n\nlearned Single Judge, while tracing the power of the police to open\n\nrowdy sheets to Police Order No. 1059 of the Mysore Police\n\nManual held that, there is no statutory basis for the said order\n\nand that they are merely executive or departmental instructions.\n\n[<a href=\"/doc/1421595/\" id=\"a_16\">N. Venkatachalapathy V. State of Karnataka4</a>].</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15.        However, a Division Bench of the Karnakata High Court in\n\nK.M. Muniswamy Reddy V State of Karnataka5&quot;, upheld the\n\nvalidity and statutory nature of the Police Standing Orders by\n\nderiving the powers from Karnakata Police Act, to make Rules or\n\nOrders. It would be appropriate to extract the same, which is as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             &quot;18. ...However, a perusal of the <a href=\"/doc/14572486/\" id=\"a_17\">Karnataka Police Act, 1965</a>,\n             would show that Order No. 1059 has a statutory source.\n             <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 21(g)</a> of the Police Act empowers the Inspector\n             General of Police to make Rules or Orders &quot;regulating the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">4</span>\n    ILR 1988 KAR 1261\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">5</span>\n    (1992) SCC Online Kar 183\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                          10</span>\n\n       collection and communication by the Police of intelligence and\n       information&quot;, &quot;Intelligence&quot; and &quot;information&quot; referred here\n       can   only   be   intelligence   or    information   necessary   to\n       discharge the duties by Police Officers effectively.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">16.   The said Standing Order No. 1059 is said to be identical with\n\nOrder 600 and 601 of Andhra Pradesh Police Standing Orders.\n\nFurther, <a href=\"/doc/21405132/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 21</a> of the Karnataka Police Act, 1965, relied upon\n\nby the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court is in pari\n\nmateria with <a href=\"/doc/86715036/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 9</a> of A.P. District Police Act, 1859. It is no\n\ndoubt true that<a href=\"/doc/1421595/\" id=\"a_21\">, <a href=\"/doc/1421595/\" id=\"a_22\">the said judgment</a></a> from Karnataka High Court is\n\nnot binding on this Court, but, definitely it can be looked into for\n\npersuasive value.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">17.   It is also to be noted that the practice of regulating the crime\n\nby opening rowdy sheets has been in vogue since 60 years.\n\nThough in Sunkara Satyanarayana [cited 2nd supra], the Court\n\nobserved that they are only executive instructions, but still did not\n\nquash the rowdy sheet on the said ground. On the other hand, it\n\nregulated the opening and closing of rowdy sheets by giving\n\nvarious directions. Hence, at this stage, since, a prima facie case is\n\nmade out by the Appellants, we feel that the Order of the learned\n\nSingle Judge has to be suspended in relation to the opening of\n\nrowdy sheets.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                   11</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">18.   One another factor, which requires consideration is that, the\n\nlearned Single Judge mainly relied upon K.S. Puttaswamy&#x27;s\n\n[cited 1st supra], to hold that opening of rowdy sheets and\n\nsurveillance of suspects could invade the privacy of an individual.\n\nIt is no doubt true that, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy&#x27;s [cited 1st supra], held that right to privacy is a\n\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India. But, learned Government Pleader for Home, mainly\n\nsubmits that the issue in K.S. Puttaswamy&#x27;s [cited 1st supra],\n\nwas totally different. It was a case where an individual was asked\n\nto furnish details for the purpose of issuing Aadhar Cards, and\n\nunder those circumstances, the Court dealt with right of privacy.\n\nAccording to him, the case on hand relates to suspects/accused\n\nagainst whom rowdy sheets are opened for regulating the crime.\n\nThis argument of learned Government Pleader, in our view, cannot\n\nbe brushed aside at this stage and the same requires adjudication\n\nat length. Therefore, merely because a rowdy sheet is opened\n\nagainst an individual, prima facie, can it be said that it invades his\n\nprivacy thereby violating <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India?\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                             12</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">19.        Therefore questions, which may arise for consideration\n\nwould be, whether observing the movements of suspect or an\n\naccused amounts to infringement of privacy or whether summoning\n\nof a witness or a suspect/accused for questioning or interrogation [if\n\nin accordance with law], amounts to infringement of privacy?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_20\">20.

As we said, discreet surveillance of suspects,\n               habitual and potential offenders, may be necessary and\n               so the maintenance of history sheet and surveillance\n               register may be necessary too, for the purpose of\n               prevention of crime. History sheets and surveillance\n               registers have to be and are confidential documents.\n               Neither the person whose name is entered in the register\n               nor any other member of the public can have access to\n               the surveillance register. The nature and character of the\n               function involved in the making of an entry in the\n               surveillance register is so utterly administrative and\n               non-judicial, that it is difficult to conceive of the\n               application of the rule of audi altrem partem. Such\n               enquiry as may be made has necessarily to be\n               confidential and it appears to us to necessarily exclude\n               the application of that principle. In fact observance of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">6</span>\n    (1981) 1 SCC 420\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                      13</span>\n\n        principles of natural justice may defeat the very object of\n        the rule providing for surveillance. There is every\n        possibility of the ends of justice being defeated instead\n        of being served. It was well observed in Re: K(Infants),\n        1965 A- 201 at p. 238:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        &quot;But a principle of judicial inquiry, whether fundamental\n        or not, is only a means to an end. If it can be shown in\n        any particular class of case that the observance of a\n        principle of this sort does not serve the ends of justice, it\n        must be dismissed; otherwise it would become the\n        master instead of the servant of justice&quot;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">21.   Dealing with Rule 23.7 of Punjab Police Rules, the Court\n\nheld that, permissible surveillance is only to the extent of a close\n\nwatch over the movements of the persons under surveillance and\n\nno more. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court went on to hold that, as long\n\nas surveillance is for the purpose of preventing a crime, it cannot\n\nbe said that, a person whose name is included in the surveillance\n\nregister can have a genuine cause for complaint. In-fact, in\n\nSunkara Satyanarayana [cited 2nd supra], the learned Single\n\nJudge of the Combined High Court of Andhra Pradesh has laid\n\ndown certain guidelines for surveillance of the accused, basing on\n\nPolice Standing Orders.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                   14</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">22.   Having regard to the prima facie findings, arrived at by us, in\n\nthe preceding paragraphs, the Order of the learned Single Judge\n\nin declaring the Standing Orders of A.P. Police Manual / A.P.\n\nPolice Standing Orders to the extent of opening/continuation of\n\nrowdy sheets/history sheets/suspect sheets and the surveillance\n\nof an individual [in terms of Chapter 37 of the above said Standing\n\nOrders] as void, is hereby suspended. However, the rowdy\n\nsheets/history sheets/suspect sheets, which are closed pursuant\n\nto the Orders of the learned Single Judge, shall not be reopened\n\nuntil further orders. It is made clear that, the Appellants are at\n\nliberty to open rowdy sheets/history sheets/suspect sheets if\n\nthere is any fresh material in respect of those individuals. Further,\n\nas an interim measure, surveillance of a suspect or an accused\n\nshall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Standing\n\nOrders. Summoning of an accused or any person to the Police\n\nStation should only be on a prior notice issued in accordance with\n\nthe provisions of law/order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">23.   It is needless to mention that the Police shall not indulge in\n\nvisiting the houses of the suspect/accused during night time,\n\nexcept   to   execute   the   order    of   arrest   or   apprehend   the\n\nsuspect/accused if he is required in any crime registered or if it is\n\npermissible under any law or statue.
