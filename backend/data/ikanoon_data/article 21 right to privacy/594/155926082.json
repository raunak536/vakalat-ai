The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that\n\n      continuation of rowdy sheet against the petitioner is also a social\n\n      sigma on the petitioner. It is also submitted that continuation of\n\n      the rowdy sheet against the petitioner though there is no case\n\n      pending against the petitioner amounts to interfering with the\n\n      fundamental rights of the petitioner i.e., right to live with dignity\n\n      and the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19(1 )(d).</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">                                         //3//\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                WP.Nos.9904 of 2025</span>\n&#x27; i\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      5.

Whether the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of\n                  a Citizen is infringed upon on account of continued\n                  surveillance under the guise of opening and continuing\n                  history sheet ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">                                      II4II\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                             WP.Nos.9904 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n\n     II.   The scope of judicial review of history sheet / rowdy\n           sheet    on    the     touchstone     of   reasonableness,\n           arbitrariness and non-application of mind ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.

The Police Standing Orders do not                  have\n\n\n     statutory force. The standing orders are only administrative\n\n     instructions. It is also not in dispute that the Police Standing\n\n     Orders which are issued under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_6\">Police Act</a> would                   have\n\n\n     statutory force.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">11.
