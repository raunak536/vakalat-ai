The matter was taken up on 2-11-2020, and arguments on the\n\nquestion that whether reputation/privacy/personal liberty of a citizen\n\nof India are integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India or\n\nnot, and whether monetary compensation can be awarded for\n\nviolation of fundamental rights or not, were heard. When the facts of\n\nthis case were being considered in the light of the law of the land,\n\nthen the Advocate General sought time to reconsider the action taken\n\nby the police authorities against the respondents no. 3 to 5, as\n\naccording to him, the matter was handled by the police authorities in\n\na most casual manner.       Accordingly after holding that right of\n\nPrivacy/reputation/dignity are integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and monetary compensation can be awarded to\n\nthe victim for violation of his Fundamental Rights, this Court\n\nadjourned the matter at the request of the Advocate General for\n\nfurther hearing on merits of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The respondents no. 3 and 4 were posted as Sub-Inspector,\n\nwhereas the respondent no.5 was posted as Constable in Police\n\nStation Bahodapur, Distt. Gwalior. The respondents no. 1 and 2 have\n\nfiled their additional return. The matter is heard on merits.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Although the facts of this case were already mentioned in\n\ndetail in the order dated 2-11-2020, but at the cost of repetition, they\n\nare being reproduced once again from order dated 2-11-2020:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          2.     The necessary facts in short are that the\n\n          petitioner is a tenant in a shop. On 25-7-2020,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                         3</span>\n\nthe landlady of the said shop, made a complaint\n\nto the respondent no. 3/S.H.O., Police Station\n\nBahodapur, Distt. Gwalior, alleging that the\n\npetitioner is neither vacating the shop nor is\n\nmaking payment of rent and has also threatened\n\nthat he would encroach upon the remaining house\n\nof the landlady. Thus, it was prayed that the shop\n\nbe got vacated and the arrears of rent be paid to\n\nthe landlady. The respondent no. 3, marked the\n\nsaid complaint to the respondent no. 4 for\n\nconducting an enquiry and it is alleged that\n\nthereafter, the respondents no. 4 and 5 forcibly\n\nevicted the petitioner from the shop on 25-7-2020\n\nitself and was also beaten by the respondent no.4.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">The goods including the furniture of the shop\n\nwas taken to the police station where the\n\npetitioner was compelled to give an undertaking\n\nthat he would vacate the shop and accordingly,\n\nthe goods belonging to the petitioner were\n\nreturned by the respondents. Thereafter, on 14-8-\n\n2020, the respondent no. 3 and 5 took the\n\npetitioner in custody, and got his uncovered face\n\nphotograph published in the newspapers as well\n\nas on social media, by projecting him as a hard\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n\n          core criminal.     On a complaint made to the\n\n          Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, an enquiry\n\n          was conducted and it was found that the\n\n          petitioner is an innocent person having no\n\n          criminal antecedents and accordingly, he was\n\n          released. It is the stand of the respondents no. 1\n\n          and 2 that one person with similar name was\n\n          wanted in a criminal case which was registered in\n\n          the year 2011 and a reward of Rs. 5,000/- was\n\n          declared by the Superintendent of Police,\n\n          Gwalior by order dated 13-8-2020 and under\n\n          mistaken identity, the petitioner was wrongly\n\n          taken into custody.    The respondent no.3 was\n\n          placed under suspension and the news with\n\n          regard to his suspension was duly published in\n\n          the news papers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.    It is submitted by the Counsel for the State that in the\n\ncompliance report dated 2-11-2020, the respondents no. 1 and 2 had\n\nclearly pleaded that violation of personal liberty of a citizen of India\n\nis a serious misconduct, but by mistake, the respondents no.1 and 2\n\nwere in-correct on their part to plead &quot;that the present case is merely\n\nthat of mistaken identity and is not a serious misconduct on the part\n\nof the respondents no. 3 to 5&quot;. It was prayed that this incorrect stand\n\ntaken by the respondents no. 1 and 2 in their compliance report dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  5</span>\n\n2-11-2020 be ignored and may be permitted to be withdrawn.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.    It is submitted by the Counsel for the State, that in the\n\ncompliance report dated 9-11-2020, it was mentioned that the\n\nrespondents no. 3 to 5 have been line-attached, but looking to the\n\nseriousness of the misconduct committed by them, today, they have\n\nbeen placed under suspension.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    As already pointed out, the incident took place in two phases,\n\ni.e, on 25-7-2020, the petitioner was forcibly dispossessed from his\n\nshop by the respondents no. 3 to 5 at the behest of the landlady and\n\nthereafter, on 14-8-2020, the petitioner was taken in custody (No\n\narrest memo was prepared) on the pretext that a reward of Rs. 5,000\n\nhas been declared by S.P., Gwalior against him and his uncovered\n\nface photograph with news &quot;An accused with reward of Rs. 5000 has\n\nbeen arrested&quot; was also published in the news papers as well as was\n\nuploaded on social media by the police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">8.    Shri Amit Sanghi, Superintendent of Police, Gwalior during the\n\ncourse of hearing through Video Conferencing, made a submission\n\nthat in fact he received a telephonic call from the brother of the\n\npetitioner, informing him that his brother is an innocent person, but\n\nstill he has been taken into custody, and he immediately, got an\n\nenquiry done and when it was found that the respondents no. 3 and 5\n\nhave wrongly taken the petitioner in custody, then not only he\n\nensured that the petitioner is released, but an arrangement was also\n\nmade to send him to his house.

Whether this conduct\n\nof the respondents no. 3 and 5, was with an ulterior motive or was a\n\nbonafide mistake shall be considered in the following paragraphs.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">9.    Incident dated 25-7-2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">10.   It is the allegation of the petitioner, that he is a tenant in a shop,\n\nand at the behest of the landlady, the respondents no. 3 to 5, forcibly\n\nevicted him from the shop and his belongings were taken to the\n\npolice station, where he was forced to give an undertaking that he\n\nwould vacate the shop and only thereafter, his some of the belongings\n\nwere returned back and the remaining articles and money have not\n\nbeen returned.     It is also alleged that during forcible eviction\n\nproceedings, the respondent no. 4 and 5 had also beaten him. The\n\nphotographs of taking out the articles/belongings out of the shop,\n\nloading the same on a mini truck and the presence of respondent no. 5\n\non the spot have also been filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.      It is not out of place to mention here that although the\n\nrespondents no. 4 and 5 have filed their detailed return, but they have\n\nnot denied the allegations of beating, forcible eviction by respondents\n\nno. 4 and 5, non-return of some of the belongings and money of the\n\npetitioner as well as the correctness of the photographs filed by the\n\npetitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">12.

Even the petitioner has not alleged that on 14-8-2020,\n\nthe respondent no. 4 was present. Thus, it is clear that the respondent\n\nno. 4 is not involved in the incident which took place on 14-8-2020.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">13.   So far as the incident of forcible dispossession of the petitioner\n\nfrom his shop by the respondents no. 3 to 5 is concerned, it is the\n\nstand of the respondent no. 4 that on 25-7-2020, the landlady made\n\nan application to the respondent no. 3 seeking dispossession of the\n\npetitioner from the shop, which was marked to her.

However, it is not the case of the respondent no.3,\n\nthat the petitioner was wanted in a criminal case in which reward was\n\ndeclared against another person. It is further submitted that the\n\nrespondent no. 3 has a brilliant service carrier of 7 years. On 25-7-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">2020, at about 15:30, the respondent no. 3 went back to his residence\n\nand at 16.46 he received a Whatsapp text message from Reserved\n\nInspector, Gwalior Shri Arvind Dangi, which reads as under :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">HkkbZ lkgc cgksMkiqj Fkkus dh iqfyl esUVy gkfLiVy pkSjkgs ij ,d\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   13</span>\n\nnqdkunkj dk lkeku Hkj ds ys x;h gS] nqdkunkj dk uke v:.k &#x27;kekZ] edku\n\nekfyd vkSj fdjk,nkj dk fookn gS ysfdu iqfyl nqdku ekfyd ds lax\n\nfeydj mldk lkeku ys x;h gS FkksMk ns[k fy;s uk ekeyk\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">18.   Accordingly, he went to Police Station at 16:00 and by that\n\ntime, the petitioner along with bag and baggage had already returned\n\nback. The respondent no. 4 gave him a copy of application dated 25-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">7-2020 made by landlady and behind the back of the respondent no.\n\n3, the respondent no. 4 had already brought the belongings to the\n\nPolice Station and had already compelled the petitioner to submit an\n\nundertaking. It is further submitted that the endorsement made on the\n\napplication dated 25-7-2020, made by the landlady, doesnot bear his\n\nsignatures and the entire incident took place, when the respondent no.\n\n3 was in his residence.     However, the respondent no.3, has not\n\nclaimed that the endorsement of entrusting enquiry to respondent\n\nno.4 is not in his handwriting. It is further pleaded in the return that\n\nthe respondent no.3 is aware of the fact &quot;that vacation of property\n\ndispute is a civil dispute and he cannot act in violation of law&quot;. So\n\nfar as the incident dated 14-8-2020 is concerned, it is pleaded that on\n\n13-8-2020, the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior had declared\n\nrewards against various persons, and reward of Rs. 5000 was\n\ndeclared against one Arun Sharma, son of Omprakash Sharma,\n\nresident of Sector No.02, D-97, Vinay Nagar, Police Station\n\nBahodapur. On 14-8-2020, the respondent no. 5 informed him that\n\nthe petitioner is the same person and relying on his information, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                    14</span>\n\npetitioner was brought to the police station and since, the person\n\nagainst whom reward was declared, was wanted in a criminal case\n\nregistered at Police Station Gole Ka Mandir, Gwalior, therefore, the\n\nverification was done by Police of Gole ka Mandir, and when it was\n\nfound that the petitioner is not the person, against whom reward has\n\nbeen declared by the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, then he was\n\nallowed to go.       This stand of the respondent no.3, regarding\n\nvoluntary verification of identity of the petitioner by Police of Police\n\nStation Gole Ka Mandir, Gwalior is not correct in the light of the\n\npress note relied upon by the respondents no.1 and 2, which have\n\nbeen filed by them along with compliance report dated 20-10-2020.\n\nHowever, admitted that the news with regard to the arrest of the\n\npetitioner with his uncovered face got circulated among the News\n\nPaper and Social Media. It is further pleaded that since, circular\n\ndated 2-1-2014 was in existence, therefore, the news was shared. It is\n\nfurther submitted that a news was also published in the news paper\n\nthat the respondent no.3 has been placed under suspension on\n\narresting an innocent person. It is further pleaded that for the fault of\n\nthe newspaper, the respondent no. 3 cannot be held liable. Further it\n\nis pleaded that at the time of photo session also, the respondent no. 5\n\nwas present and is also in the photo, but even at that time, the\n\nrespondent no. 5 never disclosed to the respondent no. 3, that the\n\npetitioner is not the person against whom a reward has been declared.\n\nAlthough the petitioner has admitted that unless and until, &quot;a person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    15</span>\n\nis held guilty by a Court of competent jurisdiction, he is presumed\n\nthat he is innocent&quot;, but still insisted that the petitioner is an accused\n\nin two other cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">19.   So far as the return filed by the respondent no. 5 is concerned,\n\nhe has not taken any stand with regard to the incident which took\n\nplace on 25-7-2020. He has also not denied the photographs filed by\n\nthe petitioner, in which he is visible on the spot, when the shop was\n\nbeing got forcibly vacated. Thus, in absence of any denial on the part\n\nof the respondent no. 5, regarding his presence on the spot on 25-7-\n\n2020, it is held that the respondents no. 4 and 5 went to the shop of\n\nthe petitioner, and got the same vacated in an illegal manner without\n\nthere being any order of the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">20.   In the undated report of the respondent no.3 (which has been\n\nfiled by the respondent no.4 and has been reproduced), the\n\nrespondent no.3, tried to mislead the Superintendent of Police,\n\nGwalior, by saying that an information was received that there was\n\nsome ruckus at Pagalkhana Tiraha, therefore, S.I. Sangeeta Minj\n\nwent with force. But, the respondent no. 3, in his letter dated 27-7-\n\n2020, written to respondent no.4, had himself written that the\n\nrespondent no. 4 has brought the belongings of the petitioner on the\n\ncomplaint made by the landlady and there is nothing in letter dated\n\n27-7-2020, that the respondent no. 4 was sent after receiving an\n\ninformation of ruckus at Pagalkhana Tiraha. Further, it is clear from\n\nthe application dated 25-7-2020 written by Landlady, the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   16</span>\n\napplication was marked by the respondent no.3 to respondent no. 4\n\nfor enquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">21.   The Counsel for the State also could not point out as to how,\n\nthe respondent no. 3 could have taken cognizance of the complaint\n\nmade by the landlady. From the plain reading of the application, it is\n\nclear that She had prayed for recovery of arrears of rent as well as for\n\neviction of the petitioner. By no stretch of imagination, the complaint\n\nfiled made by the landlady can be said to have disclosed cognizable\n\noffence. Even a non-cognizable offence was not disclosed in the\n\ncomplaint. The entire complaint was beyond the jurisdiction of the\n\npolice authorities but still cognizance of the same was taken.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">22.   When a specific question was put to Shri Amit Sanghi,\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Gwalior, that whether it is the official duty\n\nof the police to get the shops vacated without there being any orders\n\nof the Court, then it was rightly admitted by Shri Amit Sanghi,\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Gwalior, that the police has no authority\n\nwhatsoever under any law, to evict the tenants from the tenanted\n\npremises and the eviction can take place only under the decree of\n\neviction issued by the Court of competent jurisdiction. However, it is\n\nsubmitted by Shri Sanghi, that the incident of 25-7-2020 took place\n\nprior to his posting in Gwalior. Even the respondent no.3, in his\n\nreturn has categorically stated that the matter of eviction is a civil\n\nmatter and police has no jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">23.   Although the Counsel for the respondent no. 4 relied upon\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                   17</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 23</a> of Police Act, but as a departmental enquiry is pending\n\nagainst the respondents no. 3 to 5, therefore, only undisputed facts\n\nand the stand taken by the respondents as well as the preliminary\n\nenquiry reports are being considered for deciding this petition.\n\nHowever, it is not out of place to mention here, that now the\n\nrespondents no. 3 to 5 are involved in mud-sledging on each other,\n\nthereby placing certain documents on record, which were suppressed\n\nby the respondents no. 1 and 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">24.   It is the case of the respondent no. 4 that it was the respondent\n\nno. 3, who had directed her to enquire the complaint made by the\n\nlandlady, whereas it is the case of the respondent no. 3, that the copy\n\nof the complaint was given to him by respondent no. 4, only when he\n\nreturned back to the police station at 16:00 and the endorsement made\n\non the application thereby, directing the respondent no. 4 to enquire,\n\ndoes not bear his signatures. However, the return of the respondent\n\nno. 3 is beautifully silent as to whether such endorsement is in his\n\nhandwriting or not? In para 8 of the return, the respondent no. 3 has\n\npleaded that as per routine procedure when any complaint is\n\nsubmitted in Police Station, it is registered in Complaint register and\n\nis placed by the Police Station Munshi before the respondent no.3.\n\nAlthough it is the contention of the respondent no. 3 that he was\n\ngiven the said application by the respondent no.4, only after he came\n\nback to the police station at 16:00, but his return is completely silent\n\nas to why he did not ask the respondent no. 4, that under whose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                     18</span>\n\nauthority, the endorsement of entrusting enquiry to the respondent no.\n\n4 was written. In absence of such pleadings, an adverse inference has\n\nto be drawn against the respondent no.3, and it is held that\n\nendorsement made on the application dated 25-7-2020 made by the\n\nlandlady is in the handwriting of the respondent no.3 and it was the\n\nrespondent no.3 who had entrusted the enquiry to the respondent no.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">4.    Thus, it is clear that the respondent no. 3 has taken a completely\n\nfalse stand in his return, that he had not marked the application, made\n\nby landlady, to the respondent no.4. Further, the respondent no. 3,\n\nhimself has placed the copy of text message received by him on\n\nWhatsapp from Reserved Inspector Shri Arvind Dangi that the\n\npolice of Bahodapur Police Station, in connivance with the\n\nlandlord, has taken away the belongings of the tenant. Thus, the\n\nrespondent no.3, himself has proved that the petitioner was forcibly\n\nevicted by the respondents no. 4 and 5 and since, the complaint was\n\nmarked by the respondent no.3, therefore, it can be safely presumed\n\nthat the entire incident of forcible eviction took place on the\n\ninstructions of the respondent no.3, inspite of his admission in para 8\n\nof his return that vacation of property is a civil dispute. The stand\n\ntaken by the respondent no. 3, in para 8 of his return reads as under :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         &quot;8.............. The respondent no.3 clearly knows that\n         vacation of property dispute is a civil dispute and\n         cannot act in violation of law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">25.    Further, the respondent no. 3 has not placed any document on\n\nrecord to show that on 25-7-2020, he was at his residence till 17:00.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                         19</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">26.   Further, a preliminary enquiry into the incident was conducted\n\nby C.S.P., Gwalior, and it was found that the respondents no. 4 to 5\n\nare guilty of forcibly evicting the petitioner from the shop. Although\n\nthe copy of the preliminary enquiry report has not been placed on\n\nrecord, but under the instructions of the Court, the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Gwalior, has made the same available.                    The preliminary\n\nenquiry report dated 28-7-2020 reads as under :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            dk;kZy; uxj iqfyl v/kh{kd vuqHkkx Xokfy;j ¼e-iz-½\n       dzekad@uiqv@Xok0@CL155 @20\n       fnukad 28@07@2020\n       izfr]\n               vfrfjDr iqfyl v/kh{kd egksn;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">             ¼&#x27;kgj&amp;e/;

Thus, it is clear that although the complaint/application dated\n\n25-7-2020 did not disclose commission of any cognizable offence,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                     21</span>\n\nbut instead of directing the landlady to approach the Civil Court\n\nseeking eviction of the petitioner, the respondent no. 3, immediately\n\nusurp the powers of the Civil Court, and directed the respondent no. 4\n\nto enquire into the allegations of non-payment of rent and non\n\nvacating of shop by the petitioner. Thereafter, without wasting even a\n\nsingle minute, the respondents no. 4 and 5 went to the shop of the\n\npetitioner, and after dispossessing him forcibly, his belongings were\n\nbrought to the police station, where an undertaking was obtained\n\nfrom the petitioner, and only thereafter, he was allowed to take back\n\nhis belongings from the Police Station. Thus, the manner in which the\n\npetitioner was evicted from his shop in an illegal manner, it appears\n\nthat the respondents no 3 to 5 took contract from the landlady to get\n\nthe shop vacated, which is an alarming situation and cannot be\n\nignored by the Court. Even the respondent no.3 has produced a text\n\nmessage received from Reserved Inspector, Shri Arvind Dangi, which\n\nalso says that the police of Bahodapur Police Station, in connivance\n\nwith landlord has taken away the belongings of the tenant to the\n\npolice station.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117760733\" id=\"span_21\">28.       The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/117760733/\" id=\"a_26\">State of Maharashtra Vs.\n\nSaeed Sohail Sheikh</a> reported in (2012) 13 SC 192 has held as\n\nunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">         39. In a country governed by the rule of law police\n         excesses whether inside or outside the jail cannot be\n         countenanced in the name of maintaining discipline or\n         dealing with anti-national elements. Accountability is\n         one of the facets of the rule of law. If anyone is found\n         to have acted in breach of law or abused his position\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   22</span>\n\n       while exercising powers that must be exercised only\n       within the parameters of law, the breach and the abuse\n       can be punished. That is especially so when the abuse\n       is alleged to have been committed under the cover of\n       authority exercised by people in uniform. Any such\n       action is also open to critical scrutiny and\n       examination by the courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       40. Having said that we cannot ignore the fact that the\n       country today faces challenges and threats from\n       extremist elements operating from within and outside\n       India. Those dealing with such elements have at times\n       to pay a heavy price by sacrificing their lives in the\n       discharge of their duties. The glory of the\n       constitutional democracy that we have adopted,\n       however, is that whatever be the challenges posed by\n       such dark forces, the country&#x27;s commitment to the rule\n       of law remains steadfast. Courts in this country have\n       protected and would continue to protect the ideals of\n       the rights of the citizen being inviolable except in\n       accordance with the procedure established by law.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">                                          (Underline supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">29.   By no stretch of imagination, it can be said that the conduct of\n\nthe respondents no. 3 to 5 was in discharge of their official duties.\n\nUnder these circumstances, this Court has to deal with the matter\n\nwith all seriousness and has to deal with heavily. It is also not out of\n\nplace to mention here that after an undertaking was given by the\n\npetitioner in the police station, some of his belongings were returned\n\nand was permitted to keep the same in the shop. However, none of\n\nthe respondents i.e., No. 3 to 5 have disputed the allegation of the\n\npetitioner, that some of his belongings and money has not been\n\nreturned back.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">30.   Incident dated 14-8-2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">31.   The admitted facts are that a reward of Rs. 5,000/- was\n\ndeclared by Superintendent of Police, Gwalior on 13-8-2020, against\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                   23</span>\n\none Arun Sharma, son of Omprakash Sharma, resident of Section\n\nNo.2, D-97, Vinaynagar, Police Station Bahodapur, Distt. Gwalior,\n\nwhereas the petitioner is Arun Sharma son of Omprakash Sharma,\n\nresident of Laxman Talaiya, Near Asmani Mata Temple, Kapate Wali\n\nGali, Bahodapur, Distt. Gwalior. Thus, it is clear that residential\n\naddress of both the persons are different. Another undisputed fact\n\nis that the petitioner was brought to the Police Station Bahodapur, on\n\n14-8-2020 at 13:56 and was released at 21:37. Thus, it is clear that\n\nthe petitioner was kept in illegal confinement in the Police Station for\n\n7 1/2 hours, and during this period, the respondent no.3, even did not\n\ntry to verify that whether the petitioner is the same person against\n\nwhom reward has been declared by the S.P., Gwalior, or not. The\n\nrespondent on.3 could have verified the identity of the petitioner from\n\nhis residential address also, but even that was not done. It is also\n\nmandatory under law, that after arresting a person, an information is\n\nto be given to his family members. As the brother of the petitioner\n\nhad already approached the S.P., Gwalior, therefore, the respondent\n\nno.3 was aware that the residential address of the petitioner is\n\ndifferent from that of the person, against whom reward has been\n\ndeclared by S.P., Gwalior.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">32. Further, the respondent no. 1 in para 11 of his return has stated\n\nthat after the reward of Rs. 5000 was declared by the Superintendent\n\nof Police, Gwalior, instructions were issued to the Police Station\n\nBahodapur personals to put the efforts to trace out Arun Sharma, son\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                    24</span>\n\nof Omprakash Sharma, wanted in crime no. 255/2011. The copy of\n\nthe order by which rewards were declared by the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Gwalior has also been filed by the respondent no.1. From the\n\nsaid order, it is clear that reward against one more person, namely\n\nAvinash son of Ashok Upadhyay resident of Sector 3, behind\n\nElectricity Office, Vinay Nagar, Police Station Bahodapur, Distt.\n\nGwalior, was also declared and he was also the resident of an area\n\nfalling within the territorial jurisdiction of Police Station Bahodapur,\n\nthen why instructions were issued to trace out Arun Sharma only and\n\nwhy not Avinash son of Ashok Upadhyay also? Thus, it is clear that\n\nArun Sharma (Tenant) was unlawfully taken into custody with malice\n\nand in utter misuse of the official position.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">33.   Further, the return of the respondent no.3, is completely silent\n\non the question of timing of sending press release to I.T. Cell,\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Gwalior. Further, it is the stand of the\n\nrespondent no.3 himself, that since, the person against whom, the\n\nreward was declared was wanted in a crime registered at Police\n\nStation Gole Ka Mandir, and after due verification by Police of Gole\n\nKa Mandir, the petitioner was released, but has not clarified that why\n\nthe respondent no. 3, released the press note and forwarded the same\n\nto the I.T. Cell, Superintendent of Police, with uncovered face of the\n\npetitioner by branding him as &quot;An accused with reward of Rs. 5000&quot;,\n\neven prior to verification. Thus, it is clear that the respondent no. 3,\n\ndid not verify the identity of the petitioner and deliberately released\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                   25</span>\n\nthe press note with uncovered face of the petitioner. Further, the\n\nstand that the Police of Gole Ka Mandir, had voluntarily verified the\n\nidentity of the petitioner, is contrary to the submission made by the\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Gwalior. At the cost of repetition, it is once\n\nagain pointed out that during the course of hearing, it was specifically\n\nstated by Superintendent of Police, Gwalior that on receiving a\n\ncomplaint from the brother of the petitioner, he got the enquiry done,\n\nand when it was found that the petitioner was never required by the\n\npolice, then he was released. Further, it is the stand of the respondent\n\nno. 3, that the press note was released in the light of the Circular\n\ndated 14-1-2014, which has been partially quashed by this Court by\n\nits order dated 2-11-2020. However, the Counsel for the respondent\n\nno. 3, could not point out any thing from the then existing circular, to\n\nshow that the police officers were given unfettered right to declare\n\nany innocent person as a &quot;an Accused against whom reward has been\n\ndeclared&quot; and release the press note with his uncovered face\n\nphotograph, even without due verification.        Even otherwise, the\n\nconduct of the respondent no.3 was not in accordance with the\n\ncircular dated 2-1-2014, which was in existence till 2-11-2020. Thus,\n\nit is clear that now the respondents no. 3 to 5 are trying to indulge\n\nthemselves in mud sledging against each other, however, the fact of\n\nthe case is that while doing so, they themselves have disclosed certain\n\ninculpatory facts which were suppressed by the respondents no. 1 and\n\n2 in their return.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                         26</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">34.   Further, Additional Superintendent of Police, Gwalior has also\n\nconducted a preliminary enquiry. It is really surprising that all the\n\nsenior police officers were somehow trying to project that the present\n\ncase is that of mistaken identity.              Although, the copy of the\n\npreliminary enquiry report prepared by Shri Pankaj Pandey, Add.\n\nSuperintendent of Police, City (Center), Gwalior was not filed by the\n\nrespondents, but on the directions of the Court, the same has been\n\nmade available and the same is reproduced as under :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        dk;kZy;

In the conclusion, it was observed by the Add. Superintendent\n\nof Police, City (Center), Gwalior that it is a case of mistaken identity\n\ndone under excitement, because of similarity in name, father&#x27;s name\n\nand residential address. Surprisingly, the Add. S.P., City (Center),\n\nGwalior himself has disclosed the residential addresses of the\n\npetitioner and the wanted person in his preliminary enquiry report,\n\nbut inspite of that he, for the reasons best known to him, gave a\n\nwrong finding that because the residential address of both the persons\n\nwere same, therefore, the respondent no. 3 had committed mistake.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">36.   At the cost of repetition, it is once again clarified that during\n\nthe course of hearing of the case, the S.P., Gwalior has made a\n\nstatement before this Court, during the course of arguments, that in\n\nfact he had received a call on his mobile phone from the brother of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                   35</span>\n\nthe petitioner, and only on his instructions, an enquiry was conducted\n\nand the petitioner was later on released. But the Add. Superintendent\n\nof Police, City (Center), Gwalior, did not mention this fact in his\n\nPreliminary Enquiry Report, although he has recorded the statement\n\nof one Shri R.P. Gautam, Sub-Inspector, Police Station Gola ka\n\nMandir, Gwalior, who had conducted an enquiry in order to find out\n\nthe identity of the petitioner.         But surprisingly, the Add.\n\nSuperintendent of Police, City (Center), Gwalior, in his preliminary\n\nenquiry report, conveniently drew a conclusion that by mistaken\n\nidentity the petitioner was brought to the Police Station and upon his\n\nidentification he was released, but did not mention that the\n\nrespondents no. 3 to 5 did not try to verify the identity of the\n\npetitioner on their own, but the identity of the petitioner was\n\nestablished only after the intervention of the Superintendent of\n\nPolice. Further, the respondent no.3 also in his return, did not claim\n\nthat after taking the petitioner in custody, he ever tried to verify his\n\nidentity. Be that as it may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">37.   It is surprising, that the Additional Superintendent of Police,\n\nCity (Center), Gwalior was informed by the petitioner, about the\n\nincident which had taken place on 25-7-2020, and was also aware of\n\nthe fact that in both the incidents, the respondent no.3 and 5 were\n\ninvolved, but still did not try to find out as to whether the unlawful\n\ncustody of the petitioner on 14-8-2020 by the respondent no.3 and 5\n\nwas the case of mistaken identity or it was in continuation of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                   36</span>\n\nincident dated 25-7-2020. As already observed that it appears, that\n\nthe respondents no.3,4 and 5 had taken a contract for getting the shop\n\nvacated, and when the shop was not vacated by the petitioner inspite\n\nof the undertaking given by him in the police station, therefore,\n\ndeliberately he was apprehended on 14-8-2020. Even before the\n\nenquiry officer, the respondent no.3 had made a statement that he had\n\nblindly believed the information given by the respondent no. 5 that\n\nthe present petitioner is the same person, against whom a reward of\n\nRs. 5,000 has been declared by the Superintendent of Police.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">38.   Further, the Add. Superintendent of Police, City (Center),\n\nGwalior did not even try to verify that whether the respondent no. 5\n\nwas on his duty in the police station or was on duty at somewhere\n\nelse. According to the respondent no. 5, he was on duty at another\n\npoint, and he doesnot know anything about the unlawful\n\napprehension of the petitioner. However, in the preliminary enquiry,\n\nit was found that the petitioner was unlawfully apprehended by the\n\nrespondent no.3, on the information given by the respondent no.5.\n\nThus, it is clear that the respondent no. 5 was not on the point, where\n\nhe was deputed, but he was roaming around here and there.\n\nHowever, the Add. Superintendent of Police, City (Center), Gwalior,\n\ndid not observe about the conduct of respondent no. 5 of leaving his\n\npoint of duty and roaming around here and there. Be that whatever it\n\nmay be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">39.   Further, the respondent no. 5 has admitted that in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    37</span>\n\nphotograph of the petitioner with uncovered face which was\n\npublished in the newspaper, he is also there. It is fairly conceded by\n\nthe Counsel for the respondent no.5, that as per the duty Rojnamcha\n\nSanha, the respondent no. 5 should not have been in the police station\n\nat the time of photo session. Further, it is the stand of the respondent\n\nno.3, that it was the respondent no.5, who had given an information\n\nthat the petitioner is the same person, against whom a reward of Rs.\n\n5000 has been declared by the Superintendent of Police. Thus, it is\n\nclear that inspite of the best efforts by the respondents no. 3,4, and 5,\n\nas the petitioner had not handed over the vacant possession of the\n\nShop to the landlady, therefore, the petitioner was taken into unlawful\n\ncustody on 14-8-2020 at 13:56 and was kept in the police station\n\nunlawfully till 21:37 and was released only after the intervention of\n\nthe Superintendent of Police, Gwalior and in the meanwhile, the\n\nphotograph of the petitioner was circulated amongst Social Media as\n\nwell as Print Media by projecting him as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      ikap gtkj :i; dk bukeh /kks[kk/kMh dk vkjksih idMk x;kA\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">40.     Another important aspect of the matter is that according to the\n\npreliminary enquiry report prepared by the Add. Superintendent of\n\nPolice, City (Center), Gwalior, the petitioner was brought to the\n\nPolice Station Bahodapur, Distt. Gwalior on 14-8-2020 at 13:56 and\n\nwas kept till 21:37, but for the reasons best known to the respondents\n\nno. 3 and 5, the petitioner was not formally arrested.            If the\n\nrespondents no. 3 and 5 were of the view that the petitioner is the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                    38</span>\n\nsame person against whom reward of Rs. 5000 has been declared by\n\nthe S.P., Gwalior, then there was no impediment for arresting the\n\npetitioner formally. Further, if the movements of the petitioner were\n\ncurtailed in order to do some investigation, then the primary duty of\n\nthe respondent no. 3 and 5 was to verify as to whether the petitioner\n\nis the same person, against whom the reward of Rs. 5000 was\n\ndeclared by the Superintendent of Police or not. Even that was not\n\ndone.     Further, the respondent no. 3 has tried to shred his\n\nresponsibility by stating that he had acted on the information given\n\nby the respondent no.5, but the said stand of the respondent no. 3\n\ncannot be accepted because, even if the stand of the respondent no.3\n\nis accepted, but still it cannot be said that he had acted in good faith.\n\nThe word &quot;Good Faith&quot; has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/1180351/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 52</a> of I.P.C.,\n\nwhich reads as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">         52. &quot;Good faith&quot;.--Nothing is said to be done or\n         believed in &quot;good faith&quot; which is done or believed\n         without due care and attention.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">        It is not the case of the respondent no.3, that before and after\n\ntaking the petitioner in custody and before releasing the press note\n\nwith news &quot;An accused with reward of Rs. 5000 has been arrested&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">with uncovered face of the petitioner, he had acted with due care and\n\nattention. So far as the registration of two criminal cases against the\n\npetitioner is concerned, the Counsel for the respondent no.3, could\n\nnot point out that if any criminal case has been registered against a\n\nperson, then the police in an illegal manner, and without there being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                   39</span>\n\nany allegation in a particular case, can project him as a &quot;An accused\n\nwith reward of Rs. 5000&quot; and can publish his uncovered face in the\n\nprint as well as social media. The respondent no.3 has filed a copy of\n\nthe charge sheet filed by the police in crime No. 173/2913 registered\n\nat Police Station Heeranagar, Indore. From this charge sheet it is\n\nclear that on 20-4-2013, an information was received that gambling is\n\ngoing on, therefore, the police party raided the premises, however,\n\ntwo persons succeeded in running away. The purse of one of the\n\nmiscreant fell down and from the ID proof kept in the said purse, it\n\nwas found that the said purse belongs to one Rinku. Large number of\n\nmobile sims and mobile phones were seized. During investigation one\n\nSanti@ Chandraprakash of Morena was also implicated as an\n\naccused. On verification, it was found that the mobile SIMs were\n\npurchased from the shop of the petitioner on the basis of forged\n\ndocuments, and accordingly, he too was made an accused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"124114412\" id=\"span_40\">Thus, it is\n\nclear that in crime no. 173/13, the allegations against the petitioner\n\nare that mobile SIMs were purchased from his shop on the basis of\n\nforged documents. However, there is no allegation that the petitioner\n\nwas involved in actual gambling. Further, the respondent no.3, has\n\nalso admitted that unless and until, a person is convicted, he is\n\npresumed to be innocent, and it is not the case of the respondent no.3,\n\nthat the petitioner has been convicted in any criminal case. Further,\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/124114412/\" id=\"a_28\">Malak Singh Vs. State of P&amp;H</a>\n\nreported in (1981) 1 SCC 420 has held as under :</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                    40</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">        7.

During the course of arguments, it was submitted by the\n\nCounsel for the respondent no.3 that a mistake has been committed\n\nby respondent no.3, but that was committed in excitement and now he\n\nwould abide by all the judgments passed by Supreme Court as well as\n\nHigh Court and now he would follow all instructions. The contention\n\nmade by the Counsel for the respondent no.3 cannot be accepted. The\n\nCounsel for the respondent no.3 could not point out any provision of\n\nlaw, which gives authority or exemption to the respondent no. 3 from\n\ndeviating his duties under excitement.        Further, this admission\n\nclearly establishes that the respondent no. 3 had acted in a haste\n\nunder rash and reckless excitement without any due care and\n\nattention.   Further, what was the need of excitement is also not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                     41</span>\n\nknown.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">42.   Thus, it is clear that not only the petitioner was taken in\n\nunlawful detention, but he was projected in the media that he is a &quot;an\n\naccused with reward of Rs. 5000&quot;. Although, the respondents no. 3\n\nand 5 had, intentionally apprehended the petitioner in an unlawful\n\nmanner, but unfortunately, the police authorities have tried to project\n\nthat it is a simple case of mistaken identity. Further, the respondents\n\nno. 1 and 2, in their compliance report dated 20-10-2020, have filed a\n\ncopy of news published in the newspaper that the respondent no. 3\n\nhas been suspended for arresting an innocent person. Thus, it is the\n\ncase of the respondents no. 1 and 2 also, that the petitioner was\n\narrested but is completely silent as to why formal arrest memo was\n\nnot prepared?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"705101\" id=\"span_44\">43.   It is a well established principle of law that there is a difference\n\nbetween &quot;Custody&quot; and &quot;Arrest&quot;. The Supreme Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/705101/\" id=\"a_30\">Khatri (2) v. State of Bihar</a>, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 627, has held\n\nas under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         7. There are two other irregularities appearing from\n         the record to which we think it is necessary to refer. In\n         the first place in a few cases the accused persons do\n         not appear to have been produced before the Judicial\n         Magistrates within 24 hours of their arrest as required\n         by <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 22</a> of the Constitution. We do not wish to\n         express any definite opinion in regard to this\n         irregularity which prima facie appears to have\n         occurred in a few cases, but we would strongly urge\n         upon the State and its police authorities to see that this\n         constitutional and legal requirement to produce an\n         arrested person before a Judicial Magistrate within 24\n         hours of the arrest must be scrupulously observed. It is\n         also clear from the particulars furnished to us from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                  42</span>\n\n       records of the Judicial Magistrates that in some cases\n       particularly those relating to Patel Sahu, Raman Bind,\n       Shaligram Singh and a few others the accused persons\n       were not produced before the Judicial Magistrate\n       subsequent to their first production and they continued\n       to remain in jail without any remand orders being\n       passed by the Judicial Magistrates. This was plainly\n       contrary to law. It is difficult to understand how the\n       State continued to detain these accused persons in jail\n       without any remand orders. We hope and trust that the\n       State Government will inquire as to why this\n       irregularity was allowed to be perpetrated and will see\n       to it that in future no such violations of the law are\n       permitted to be committed by the administrators of the\n       law. The provision inhibiting detention without\n       remand is a very healthy provision which enables the\n       Magistrates to keep check over the police\n       investigation and it is necessary that the Magistrates\n       should try to enforce this requirement and where it is\n       found to be disobeyed, come down heavily upon the\n       police.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"265365\" id=\"span_46\">(Underline supplied)\n\n\n      The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/265365/\" id=\"a_32\">Mohd.

Firstly speaking about the formal arrest, for the\n       accused being in custody of the investigating agency\n       he need not have been formally arrested. It is enough\n       if he was in custody of the investigating agency\n       meaning thereby his movements were under the\n       control of the investigating agency. A formal arrest is\n       not necessary and the fact that the accused was in\n       effective custody of the investigating agency is\n       enough. It has been amply proved that the accused was\n       apprehended, searched and taken into custody.

Superintendent of Police, City (Center), Gwalior,\n\nduring preliminary enquiry has recorded the statement of Head\n\nConstable 1875 Surendra Kumar Bhatele, who has stated that on 14-\n\n8-2020, the respondent no.3 had sent a message for preparing a press\n\nnote on his Whatsapp, but conveniently did not mention the time of\n\nsending such message.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                   44</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">45.   All the important documents have been withheld by the Police,\n\nand even on the directions of the Court, only the file pertaining to the\n\nsuspension of the respondent no. 3 and some copies of different\n\norders were sent, some of which have been reproduced in this order.\n\nBe that as it may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">46.   From the file of suspension of the respondent no. 3, it appears\n\nthat the respondent no.3 was suspended by order dated 14-8-2020.\n\nThereafter, the respondent no.3 moved an application for revocation\n\nof his suspension on 28-8-2020, and on the very same day, his\n\nsuspension order was revoked. It is not out of place to mention here,\n\nthat on 14-8-2020, a report was submitted by Additional\n\nSuperintendent of Police, City (Center), Gwalior, that the petitioner\n\nwas unlawfully detained in police station Bahodapur. Thereafter on\n\n3-10-2020, a show cause notice was issued to respondent no. 3. It is\n\nnot out of place to mention here that the notices of this petition were\n\nissued for the first time, by this Court on 8-9-2020. Thus, it is clear\n\nthat after taking an application from the respondent no.3 for\n\nrevocation of his suspension, the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior\n\nrevoked his suspension on the very same day and the chapter was\n\nclosed. However, only after receiving the notice from this Court, the\n\nfirst show cause notice was given to the respondent no. 3 on 3-10-\n\n2020 and accordingly, a fine of Rs. 5000 was imposed by order dated\n\n14-10-2020, i.e., just two days prior to filing of first compliance\n\nreport. Thus, it is clear that the police department has not taken the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                   45</span>\n\nmisdeeds of the respondents no. 3 to 5 with all seriousness and took\n\nthe matter as if the police has a right to tarnish the privacy/personal\n\nliberty/reputation of any citizen at their sweet will.      Thus, the\n\nAdvocate General of the State was right in making a statement\n\nbefore this Court on 2-11-2020, that the matter has been handled in\n\na most causal manner and he may be granted time to reconsider\n\nthe steps taken against the respondents no. 3 to 5. Thus, it is clear\n\nthat even the Advocate General of the State was not satisfied with\n\nthe manner in which the police authorities had handled the case\n\nagainst the respondents no. 3 to 5. Be that as it may.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">47.   The Counsel for the respondent no. 5 submitted that all the\n\npolice personals which are visible in the photograph have not been\n\nproceeded against by the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior and he\n\nhas deliberately adopted the policy of pick and choose, and the\n\nrespondent no.5 has been made a scapegoat. In reply, it is submitted\n\nby Shri Amit Sanghi, Superintendent of Police, Gwalior, that action\n\nwas taken on the basis of the Preliminary Enquiry Report in which it\n\nwas concluded that the respondents no. 3 and 5 are responsible for\n\nunlawful custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">48.   Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the\n\nrespondent no. 5 and Shri Amit Sanghi, S.P., Gwalior.           In the\n\npreliminary enquiry report, the enquiry officer has not considered the\n\nrole played by all other team members who are visible in the\n\nphotograph.   Therefore, the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                  46</span>\n\ndirected to conduct an enquiry with regard to the role of all other\n\npolice personals who were the members of the team, which had\n\nillegally apprehended the petitioner and are visible in the Photograph\n\nand take action accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">49.   The Supreme Court in the case of Arnab Manorajan\n\nGoswami Vs. State of Maharashtra, by Judgment dated 27-11-\n\n2020 passed in Criminal Appeal No. 742 of 2020 has held as under :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       59. These principles are equally applicable to the\n       exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of the\n       Constitution when the court is called upon to secure\n       the liberty of the accused. The High Court must\n       exercise its power with caution and circumspection,\n       cognizant of the fact that this jurisdiction is not a\n       ready substitute for recourse to the remedy of bail\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 439</a> of the CrPC. .........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       60. Human liberty is a precious constitutional value,\n       which is undoubtedly subject to regulation by validly\n       enacted legislation. As such, the citizen is subject to\n       the edicts of criminal law and procedure. Section 482\n       recognizes the inherent power of the High Court to\n       make such orders as are necessary to give effect to the\n       provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_40\">CrPC</a> ―or prevent abuse of the\n       process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends\n       of justice‖. Decisions of this court require the High\n       Courts, in exercising the jurisdiction entrusted to\n       them under Section 482, to act with circumspection.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">       In emphasising that the High Court must exercise this\n       power with a sense of restraint, the decisions of this\n       Court are founded on the basic principle that the due\n       enforcement of criminal law should not be obstructed\n       by the accused taking recourse to artifices and\n       strategies. The public interest in ensuring the due\n       investigation of crime is protected by ensuring that\n       the inherent power of the High Court is exercised\n       with caution. That indeed is one - and a significant -\n       end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is\n       equally important: the recognition by Section 482 of\n       the power inhering in the High Court to prevent the\n       abuse of process or to secure the ends of justice is a\n       valuable safeguard for protecting liberty. The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_41\">Code of\n       Criminal Procedure</a> of 1898 was enacted by a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                   47</span>\n\n       legislature which was not subject to constitutional\n       rights and limitations; yet it recognized the inherent\n       power in Section 561A. Post Independence, the\n       recognition by Parliament of the inherent power of\n       the High Court must be construed as an aid to\n       preserve the constitutional value of liberty. The writ\n       of liberty runs through the fabric of the Constitution.\n       The need to ensure the fair investigation of crime is\n       undoubtedly important in itself, because it protects at\n       one level the rights of the victim and, at a more\n       fundamental level, the societal interest in ensuring\n       that crime is investigated and dealt with in\n       accordance with law. On the other hand, the misuse of\n       the criminal law is a matter of which the High Court\n       and the lower Courts in this country must be\n       alive. ....................Whether the appellant has\n       established a case for quashing the FIR is something\n       on which the High Court will take a final view when\n       the proceedings are listed before it but we are clearly\n       of the view that in failing to make even a prima facie\n       evaluation of the FIR, the High Court abdicated its\n       constitutional duty and function as a protector of\n       liberty. Courts must be alive to the need to safeguard\n       the public interest in ensuring that the due\n       enforcement of criminal law is not obstructed. The\n       fair investigation of crime is an aid to it. Equally it is\n       the duty of courts across the spectrum - the district\n       judiciary, the High Courts and the Supreme Court - to\n       ensure that the criminal law does not become a\n       weapon for the selective harassment of citizens.\n       Courts should be alive to both ends of the spectrum -\n       the need to ensure the proper enforcement of criminal\n       law on the one hand and the need, on the other, of\n       ensuring that the law does not become a ruse for\n       targeted harassment. Liberty across human eras is as\n       tenuous as tenuous can be. Liberty survives by the\n       vigilance of her citizens, on the cacophony of the\n       media and in the dusty corridors of courts alive to the\n       rule of (and not by) law. Yet, much too often, liberty\n       is a casualty when one of these components is found\n       wanting.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_54\">50.

Gwalior, therefore, he was taken in unlawful custody on 14-8-\n\n2020 by the respondents no. 3 and 5 and was brought to the police\n\nstation Bahodapur at 13:56 and was released at 21:37 only after the\n\nintervention of the Superintendent of Police, Gwalior. Further, after\n\ntaking him in custody, he was not formally arrested and no attempt\n\nwas made by the respondents no. 3 and 5 to verify that whether the\n\npetitioner is the same person against whom a reward of Rs. 5000 has\n\nbeen declared by the S.P., Gwalior or not, specifically when the\n\nresidential address of the petitioner is different. Further, without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                    50</span>\n\nformally arresting him, the respondents no. 3 and 5 projected in the\n\nmedia (Print as well as Social) that the petitioner is a &quot;an accused\n\nwith reward of Rs. 5000&quot; and has been arrested. Further even after\n\nrelease of the petitioner from the Police Station, no attempts were\n\nmade to withdraw the press release from Print Media, and it was\n\nprominently published in the news paper on the next day, that the\n\npetitioner is a criminal and has been arrested.

Further the respondent no.3 has also\n\nadmitted in his return that vacating property is a civil dispute, and\n\npolice has no jurisdiction.

The category of cases\n       in which preliminary inquiry may be made are as\n       under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                   54</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">         (a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">         (b) Commercial offences\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">         (c) Medical negligence cases\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">         (d) Corruption cases\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">          (e) Cases where there is abnormal delay/laches in\n          initiating criminal prosecution, for example, over\n          3 months&#x27; delay in reporting the matter without\n          satisfactorily explaining the reasons for delay.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">       The aforesaid are only illustrations and not exhaustive\n       of all conditions which may warrant preliminary\n       inquiry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">       120.7. While ensuring and protecting the rights of the\n       accused and the complainant, a preliminary inquiry\n       should be made time-bound and in any case it should\n       not exceed 7 days. The fact of such delay and the\n       causes of it must be reflected in the General Diary\n       entry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">       120.8. Since the General Diary/Station Diary/Daily\n       Diary is the record of all information received in a\n       police station, we direct that all information relating to\n       cognizable offences, whether resulting in registration\n       of FIR or leading to an inquiry, must be mandatorily\n       and meticulously reflected in the said diary and the\n       decision to conduct a preliminary inquiry must also be\n       reflected, as mentioned above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_67\">61.   Thus, the stand taken by Superintendent of Police, Gwalior,\n\nthat unless and until a deeper enquiry into the matter is conducted,\n\nthe FIR could not have been lodged against the respondents no. 3 to 5\n\nis incorrect. When a complaint discloses commission of cognizable\n\noffence, then in some cases, a preliminary enquiry may be conducted.\n\nIn this Case, preliminary enquiries were conducted regarding incident\n\ndated 25-7-2020 and 14-8-2020 and in both the preliminary\n\nenquiries, it was found that the respondents no. 3 to 5 are prima\n\nfacie guilty. Thus, in the light of the judgment passed by Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_53\">Lalita Kumari</a> (Supra), nothing more was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                   55</span>\n\nrequired to be done by the S.H.O., Police Station Bahodapur, Distt.\n\nGwalior before lodging a F.I.R. against the respondents no. 3 to 5.\n\nFurther more, the contention of the Counsel for the State that the\n\ndiscretion of the police officer, not to lodge the FIR cannot be taken\n\naway by the Court is concerned, it is palpably misconceived and\n\ncontrary to the law of Land.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_69\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_54\">Lalita Kumari</a> (Supra) it\n\nhas been held that registration of FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 154</a> of Cr.P.C. is\n\nmandatory, where the information discloses commission of\n\ncognizable offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">62.   It is further submitted by the Counsel for the State that so far as\n\nthe incident dated 14-8-2020 is concerned, the act of the respondents\n\nno. 3 and 5 would be covered by <a href=\"/doc/202169/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 76</a> of Indian Penal Code,\n\ntherefore, they cannot be prosecuted. By relying on illustration (b) of\n\nSection 76 of Penal Code, it is submitted that since, the respondents\n\nno. 3 and 5 had taken the petitioner in custody under a belief, that he\n\nis the same person, against whom a reward of Rs. 5000 has been\n\ndeclared and is wanted in a criminal case, therefore, even if they have\n\ncommitted a mistake, but still, it cannot be said that they have\n\ncommitted any offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">63.

For application of Section 76 of Penal Code, the following\n\ncircumstances must exist :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(a) The person must be an officer of a Court of Justice;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(b) There must be an order of the Court\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(c) Before arresting a person, he must have conducted an enquiry;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(d)   He must have bonafide belief, that he is arresting the same\n\nperson, against whom an order of the Court has been issued.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">66.   However, if the present case is considered, then none of the\n\nabove mentioned ingredients are present. Neither the respondents no.\n\n3 and 5 are the officer of a Court of Justice, nor there is any order of\n\nthe Court.     Further, admittedly no enquiry was done by the\n\nrespondents no. 3 and 5 before apprehending the petitioner, nor there\n\nwas any bonafide belief on their part to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">67.   The present case is a glaring example of gross misuse of police\n\nuniform. As already pointed out, that although the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Gwalior acted promptly after receiving an information of\n\nunlawful detention of the petitioner, and did every thing to protect the\n\nfundamental rights of the petitioner, but thereafter, all efforts have\n\nbeen made to protect the respondents no. 3 to 5, inspite of clear\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                   57</span>\n\nfindings by the enquiry officers themselves, that the respondents no. 3\n\nto 5 have acted in an illegal manner. Be that as it may. Under these\n\ncompelling circumstances, this Court cannot ignore its constitutional\n\nduty by relegating the petitioner to file complaint against the\n\nrespondents no. 3 to 5, therefore, the Superintendent of Police,\n\nSpecial Police Establishment (Lokayukt) Gwalior is directed to lodge\n\na F.I.R. against the respondent no. 3 to 5 for their criminal acts\n\ncommitted in their official uniform, including offence under <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections\n\n294</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_59\">323</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_60\">341</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_61\">379</a>,<a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_62\">380</a>,<a href=\"/doc/393714/\" id=\"a_63\">424</a>,<a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_64\">452</a>,<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_65\">34</a> of I.P.C. and under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 7</a>,<a href=\"/doc/20491688/\" id=\"a_67\">7-A</a> of\n\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Further, the S.P.E. (Lokayukt)\n\nshall be free to implicate any other person, who appears to have\n\ncommitted offence, either under any provision of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_68\">I.P.C</a>. or under any\n\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_69\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a>, including under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/642316/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 12</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act. Let this exercise be\n\ndone within a period of fifteen days from today and the copy of\n\nthe FIR should be submitted before the Principal Registrar of this\n\nCourt, within a period of 16 days from today.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">68.   Before concluding the order, this Court thinks it apposite to\n\npoint out hostile attitude of the Police Department in protecting the\n\nlife and liberty of the citizens of India. This Court by order dated 2-\n\n11-2020, had quashed a part of circular dated 2-1-2014 issued by the\n\nDirector General of Police and had quashed the provisions by which\n\nthe police was authorized to share the personal information and\n\nphotographs of accused and victims (covered or uncovered) with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                     58</span>\n\nmedia. Further patrolling of accused in general public was also held\n\nto be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, and\n\naccordingly, the Director General of Police, Bhopal, was directed to\n\nissue necessary instructions in this regard. During the course of\n\narguments, it was pointed by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, that circular\n\ndated 7-11-2020 has been issued, and when he was directed to point\n\nout that whether there is any direction to the police personals, not to\n\npublically parade the accused persons in general public, then he\n\nprayed that since it is already 1:30 P.M., therefore, he would reply\n\nafter tea break. Accordingly after tea break it was submitted by Shri\n\nM.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Add. Advocate General, that he has taken\n\ninstructions, and in fact clause 7 of circular dated 7-11-2020\n\nspecifically provides that the accused persons should not be produced\n\nbefore the Media, and that would cover parading in General Public\n\nalso.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">69.     Clause 7 of circular dated 7-11-2020 reads as under :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">         7- fxjQ~rkj O;fDr dks ehfM;k ds le{k fdlh Hkh\n         gkyr es izLrqr u djsA\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">70.     Unfortunately, the State Police, is still not ready to realize the\n\nimportance of liberty of the citizen of India. When this Court had\n\nrestrained the police from parading the accused persons in general\n\npublic, then by no stretch of imagination, the non-parading of accused\n\nin general public would be covered by clause 7 of Circular dated 7-\n\n11-2020. Further, Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Add. Advocate General\n\nsubmitted that it has come to the notice of the Police Headquarters,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                     59</span>\n\nthat inspite of the fact that parading of accused persons in general\n\npublic has been held to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution,\n\nstill in some cities of State of Madhya Pradesh like Ujjain etc, such\n\nincidents have taken place and accused persons were paraded in\n\ngeneral public, and submitted that Police Headquarter will take\n\naction. Since, this submission made by Shri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi,\n\nAdd. Advocate General is not the subject-matter of this Case,\n\ntherefore, it is left to the wisdom of the Police Department. However,\n\nShri M.P.S. Raghuvanshi, Additional Advocate General submitted\n\nthat a specific circular restraining the police from parading the\n\naccused persons in general public shall be issued and accordingly,\n\nafter the conclusion of hearing, he supplied a copy of order dated 26-\n\n11-2020 issued by the Police Headquarters, directing that no parading\n\nshall be done in general public. The said order dated 26-11-2020 is\n\ntaken on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">71.
