Fair Trial Under Criminal\nProcedure (Amendments to the Contempt of Court Act, 1971)&quot;. The subject\nwas taken up suo motu having regard to the extensive prejudicial coverage\nof crime and information about suspects and accused, both in the print and\nelectronic media. There is today a feeling that in view of the extensive use\nof the television and cable services, the whole pattern of publication of\nnews has changed and several such publications are likely to have\nprejudicial impact on the suspects, accused, witnesses and even Judges and\nin general, on the administration of justice.       According to our law, a\nsuspect/accused is entitled to a fair procedure and is presumed to be\ninnocent till proved guilty in a Court of law.       None can be allowed to\nprejudge or prejudice his case by the time it goes to trial.\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_2\">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees freedom of\nspeech and expression and <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_3\">Art. 19(2)</a> permits reasonable restrictions to be\nimposed by statute for the purposes of various matters including &#x27;Contempt\nof Court&#x27;. <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_4\">Art. 19(2)</a> does not refer to &#x27;administration of justice&#x27; but\ninterference of the administration of justice is clearly referred to in the\ndefinition of &#x27;criminal contempt&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_5\">sec. 2</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act,\n1971 and in <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_6\">sec. 3</a> thereof as amounting to contempt.             Therefore,\npublications which interfere or tend to interfere with the administration of\njustice amount to criminal contempt under that Act and if in order to\n\n\n\n                                                                         2\n preclude such interference, the provisions of that Act impose reasonable\nrestrictions on freedom of speech, such restrictions would be valid.\n\n       At present, under <a href=\"/doc/1689734/\" id=\"a_7\">sec. 3(2)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 read\nwith the Explanation below it, full immunity is granted to publications even\nif they prejudicially interfere with the course of justice in a criminal case, if\nby the date of publication, a chargesheet or challan is not filed or if\nsummons or warrant are not issued. Such publications would be contempt\nonly if a criminal proceeding is actually pending i.e. if chargesheet or\nchallan is filed or summons or warrant are issued by the Court by the date of\npublication. Question is whether this can be allowed to remain so under\nour Constitution or whether publications relating to suspects or accused\nfrom the date of their arrest should be regulated?\n\nSupreme Court and House of Lords accept that prejudicial publications may\naffect Judges subconsciously:\n\n       The Supreme Court and the House of Lords have, as pointed out in\nChapter III of our Report, observed that publications which are prejudicial\nto a suspect or accused may affect Judges also subconsciously. This can\nbe at the stage of granting or refusing bail or at the trial.\n\nSupreme Court holds prejudicial publication after &#x27;arrest&#x27; can be criminal\ncontempt:\n\n       Under the Contempt of Courts Acts of 1926 and 1952, unlike the Act\nof 1971, there was no specific definition of &#x27;civil&#x27; or &#x27;criminal&#x27; contempt.\nFurther before 1971, the common law principles were applied to treat\nprejudicial publications made even before the &#x27;arrest&#x27; of a person as\ncontempt. In fact, some Courts were treating as &#x27;criminal contempt&#x27;,\nprejudicial publications even if they were made after the filing of a First\nInformation Report (FIR). But the Supreme Court, in Surendra Mohanty v.\nState of Orissa (Crl. App. 107/56 dt. 23.1.1961) however, held that filing of\nan FIR could not be the starting point of pendency of a criminal case.\nBecause of that judgment, a prejudicial publication made after the filing of\nthe FIR gained immunity from law of contempt. But in 1969, the Supreme\nCourt held in A.K. Gopalan v. Noordeen 1969 (2) SCC 734 (15th Sept.,\n1969) that a publication made after &#x27;arrest&#x27; of a person could be contempt if\nit was prejudicial to the suspect or accused. This continues to be the law as\nof today so far as <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_8\">Art. 19(1)(a)</a><a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_9\">, 19(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Art. 21</a> are concerned.\n\n\n                                                                            3\n Sanyal Committee&#x27;s (1963) proposal accepting &#x27;arrest&#x27; as starting point\ndropped by Joint Committee:\n\n       In the meantime from 1963, efforts were made to make a new law of\ncontempt. The Sanyal Committee (1963) which was appointed for this\npurpose, while observing that our country is very vast and publications\nmade at one place do not reach other places, however, recommended that so\nfar as criminal matters are concerned, the date of &quot;arrest&quot; is crucial, and that\nshould be treated as the starting point of &#x27;pendency&#x27; of a criminal\nproceeding.     It conceded that filing of an FIR could not be the starting\npoint. The Sanyal Committee prepared a Bill, 1963 stating that prejudicial\npublications could be criminal contempt if criminal proceedings were\n&#x27;imminent&#x27;. But thereafter, nothing happened for six years.\n\n        The Bill of 1963 prepared by the Sanyal Committee was reviewed by a Joint\nCommittee of Parliament (1969-70) (Bhargava Committee) and after some brief\ndiscussion, the Joint Committee decided to drop reference to &#x27;imminent&#x27; proceedings.\nThis was done for two reasons (1) that the word &#x27;imminent&#x27; was vague and (2) such a\nvague expression may unduly restrict the freedom of speech if the law applied to\n&#x27;imminent&#x27; criminal proceedings. The recommendations of the Joint Committee resulted\nin the 1971 Act which omitted all references to &#x27;imminent&#x27; proceedings or to &#x27;arrest&#x27; as\nthe starting point of pendency of a criminal proceeding.\n\nJoint Committee&#x27;s reasons are flawed:\n\n       The attention of the Joint Committee was not drawn to the decision of\nthe Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan v. Noordeen (1969 (2) SCC 734) dated\n15th September, 1969 when it gave its Report on 23rd February, 1970. Once\nthe Supreme Court judgment fixed the date of &#x27;arrest&#x27; as the starting point\nfor treating a criminal proceeding as pending, there remained no vagueness\nin the law. In that case, the Supreme Court has also balanced the rights of\nthe suspect and accused on the one hand and the rights of the media for\npublication. In fact, in A.K. Gopalan&#x27;s case, the editor of the Newspaper\nand others who made prejudicial publication after arrest were convicted for\ncontempt, while Mr. A.K. Gopalan who made the statement after FIR but\nbefore arrest was exonerated by the Supreme Court.\n\n       Apart from the declaration of law and fair balancing of the competing\nrights as above by the Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan v. Noordeen (1969),\nthe date of arrest is the starting point under the UK Contempt of Court Act,\n\n\n                                                                                   4\n 1981 and the Bill of 2003 prepared by the New South Wales Law\nCommission.         Case law in Scotland, Ireland, Australia or the Law\nCommission Reports of those countries have also declared that if a person is\narrested or if criminal proceedings are imminent, prejudicial publications\nwill be criminal contempt. The leading judgment in Hall v. Associated\nNewspaper, 1978 SLT 241 (Scotland) has been followed in other\njurisdictions and is the basis of the provision in the UK Act of 1981 for\nfixing &#x27;arrest&#x27; as the starting point of pendency of a criminal case.\n\n\nThe 24 hour rule:\n\n       According to Hall, once a person is arrested, he comes within the\n&#x27;care&#x27; and protection of the Court as he has to be produced in Court in 24\nhours. In India, this is a guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/1371971/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 22(2)</a> of the Constitution.\nThe reason for fixing arrest as the starting point is that, if a publication is\nmade after arrest referring to the person&#x27;s character, previous conviction or\nconfessions etc., the person&#x27;s case will be prejudiced even in bail\nproceedings when issues arise as to whether bail is to be granted or refused,\nor as to what conditions are to be imposed and whether there should be\npolice remand or judicial remand. Such publications may also affect the\ntrial when it takes place later. Basing on this, in England and other\ncountries, &quot;arrest&quot; and &quot;imminent&quot; proceedings are treated as sufficient and\nare not treated as vague.        In this context, we have referred to the\ncomparative law in several countries where the Constitutions guarantees\nprotection to freedom of speech as also the liberty of suspects or accused.\n\n       Another important point here is that, in the year 1978, the Supreme\nCourt in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, AIR 1978 SC 597 has altered\nthe law as it stood before 1978 to say that so far as liberty referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Art.\n21</a> is concerned, &#x27;procedure established by law&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Art. 21</a> must be a fair,\njust and reasonable procedure.      This was not the law in 1970 when the\nJoint Committee gave its report nor when the 1971 Act was enacted.\n\n       Hence, the Joint Committee&#x27;s observations and its omitting the word\n&#x27;imminent&#x27; and its not treating &#x27;arrest&#x27; as starting point, do not appear to be\nconstitutionally valid.\n\nStarting point of pendency should be &#x27;arrest&#x27; and not filing of chargesheet:\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_14\">sec. 3</a> to be amended:\n\n\n                                                                            5\n        In view of the changes in the constitutional law of our country as\ndeclared by the Supreme Court in A.K. Gopalan v. Noordeen (1969 (2) SCC\n734) in so far as <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 21</a> are concerned and Maneka\nGandhi case (AIR 1978 SC 597) in so far as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Art. 21</a> is concerned, the two\nreasons given by the Joint Committee in 1970 for omitting the word\n&#x27;imminent&#x27; and for not treating &#x27;arrest&#x27; as the starting point, are no longer\ntenable. <a href=\"/doc/1689734/\" id=\"a_18\">Sec. 3(2)</a> of the Act and Explanation below <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_19\">sec. 3</a> as of now, treat a\ncriminal proceeding as pending only if a chargesheet or challan is filed or if\nsummons or warrant is issued and the time of &#x27;arrest&#x27;. This has to be\nrectified by adding a clause &#x27;arrest&#x27; in the Explanation below <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_20\">sec. 3</a> as being\nthe starting point to reckon &#x27;pendency&#x27; of a criminal proceeding as in the\nUK Act of 1981 and as proposed by other Law Reform Commission\nproposals in other countries. Further, when such an amendment is made, it\nis not as if that no publications are permitted after arrest. Only those which\nare prejudicial publications are not permitted. In addition, publications\nmade without knowledge of arrest, or filing challan or without knowledge\nof summons or warrant, remain protected.\n\n       In this Report, we have also exhaustively discussed the Sunday Times\njudgment of the European Court 1979 (2) EHRR 245 which related to prior\nrestraint of publications relating to a &quot;civil&quot; case and there the restraint was\nabsolute and not temporary. That case is not a precedent in the present\ncontext.\n\n      The above amendment as to &#x27;arrest&#x27; as being starting point is\nproposed by using the word &#x27;active&#x27; criminal proceeding in <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_21\">sec. 3</a>, rather\nthan &#x27;pending criminal proceeding&#x27; and inserting the word &#x27;arrest&#x27; in the\nExplanation below <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_22\">sec. 3</a>.\n\nHigh Court to be approached directly than by reference from subordinate\nCourt:\n\n       Again, as at present, if there is criminal contempt of subordinate\nCourts, the subordinate Courts have to make a reference to the High Court.\nThis procedure applies to scandalizing the Judges (<a href=\"/doc/1467847/\" id=\"a_23\">sec. 2(c)(i)</a>) as also to\npublications interfering with administration of justice under <a href=\"/doc/949983/\" id=\"a_24\">sec. 2(c)(ii)</a> and\n(iii).    So far as contempt of prejudicial publications is concerned, a\nprocedure of reference by the subordinate Court to the High Court is\ncumbersome and time consuming. We have, therefore, proposed sec. 10A\n\n\n                                                                           <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_25\">6</a>\n that so far as criminal contempt of subordinate Courts under <a href=\"/doc/949983/\" id=\"a_26\">sec. 2(c)(ii)</a> and\n(iii) by way of publication is concerned, there is no need for a reference by\nthe subordinate Courts, but that the High Court could be approached\ndirectly without consent of the Advocate General. This is provided in sec.\n10A of the Bill.\n\nHigh Court to be empowered to pass &#x27;postponement&#x27; orders on the lines of\nsec. 4(2) of the UK Act, 1981:\n\n       In addition, there is need to empower the Courts to pass\n&#x27;postponement&#x27; orders as to publication. While Courts have held that\nconditions for passing orders of prior restraint should be permitted only\nunder stringent conditions, it is, however, accepted that temporary\npostponement of publication can be passed. This is accepted in several\njurisdictions across the world. For passing of &#x27;postponement orders&#x27;, the\nUK Act of 1981 requires special proof of &#x27;serious risk of prejudice&#x27; to be\nshown. We have proposed clearer words that &#x27;real risk of serious prejudice&#x27;\nhas to be proved before any &#x27;postponement&#x27; orders are issued. We have\nproposed this in sec. 14A. Any breach of a postponement order will be\ncontempt under sec. 14B. Such a procedure exists in UK too.\n\nEnumeration of publications in the media which could be prejudicial stated\nin Ch. IX of the Report:\n\n       The Report also mentions in Chapter IX what publications can be\nprejudicial if made after a person is arrested. It is recognized in several\ncountries and also in India that publications which refer to character,\nprevious convictions, confessions could be criminal contempt. Publishing\nphotographs may hinder proper identification in an identification parade.\nThere are various other aspects such as judging the guilt or innocence of the\naccused or discrediting witnesses etc. which could be contempt. We have\nreferred to these aspects as a matter of information to the media. We have\nalso discussed the recent phenomenon of media interviewing potential\nwitnesses and about publicity that is given by police and about investigative\njournalism.\n\n      We have also annexed a Draft Bill.\n\nJournalists to be trained in certain aspects of law:\n\n\n\n                                                                          7\n        We have also recommended that journalists need to be trained in\ncertain aspects of law relating to freedom of speech in <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_27\">Art. 9(1)(a)</a> and the\nrestrictions which are permissible under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_28\">Art. 19(2)</a> of the Constitution,\nhuman rights, law of defamation and contempt. We have also suggested\nthat these subjects be included in the syllabus for journalism and special\ndiploma or degree courses on journalism and law be started.\n\n      The Report is important and is also exhaustive on the issues which\ntoday are crucial in our country so far as criminal justice is concerned and\nwe are of the view that, as at present, there is considerable interference with\nthe due administration of criminal justice and this will have to be remedied\nby Parliament.\n\n\n                                                              Yours sincerely,\n\n\n                                                        (M. Jagannadha Rao)\n\n\n\n\nShri H.R. Bhardwaj\n\nUnion Minister for Law and Justice\nGovernment of India\nShastri Bhawan\nNew Delhi.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           8\n                               INDEX\n\nChapter               Title                                     Page\n\nI.

Do publications in the media subconsciously\n          affect the Judges                                   39 to 54\n\nIV.       How &#x27;imminent&#x27; criminal proceedings came to be\n          <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_29\">Excluded from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</a>      55 to 73\n\nV.        Whether Joint Committee was right in stating\n          that the word &#x27;imminent&#x27; is vague?                  74 to 89\n\nVI.       Does &#x27;A.K. Gopalan&#x27; vs. &#x27;Noordeen&#x27; (1869)(SC)\n          make &#x27;imminence&#x27; relevant only in respect of\n          arrest for serious offences? What is the effect\n          of the 24 hour rule?                               90 to 112\n\nVII.      Freedom of expression Contempt of Court,\n          Due Process to protect liberty                         113\nto 153\n\nVIII.     Postponement of publications by Court:\n          Whether substantial risk of prejudice as in\n          UK inappropriate                                       154\nto 188\n\nIX.       What categories of media publications\n          are recognized as prejudicial to a suspect\n          or accused                                        189 to 215\n\nX.        Recommendations for amending the\n          <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_30\">Provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act,\n          1971</a>\n\n                                                                  9\n            (using &#x27;active&#x27; and &#x27;arrest&#x27; in sec 3 and\n           &#x27;real risk of serious prejudice&#x27; in new sec 14A   216 to 226\n\n\n\nAnnexure I: Draft Bill\n            Contempt of Court (Amendment) Bill, 2006         227 to 233\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    10\n                                   Chapter I\n\n                                Introductory\n\n      The subject of &#x27;Trial by Media&#x27; is discussed by civil rights activists,\n\nconstitutional lawyers, judges and academics almost everyday in recent\n\ntimes. With the coming into being of the television and cable-channels, the\n\namount of publicity which any crime or suspect or accused gets in the media\n\nhas reached alarming proportions. Innocents may be condemned for no\n\nreason or those who are guilty may not get a fair trial or may get a higher\n\nsentence after trial than they deserved. There appears to be very little\n\nrestraint in the media in so far as the administration of criminal justice is\n\nconcerned.\n\n      We are aware that in a democratic country like ours, freedom of\n\nexpression is an important right but such aright is not absolute in as much as\n\nthe Constitution itself, while it grants the freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>,\n\npermitted the legislature to impose reasonable restriction on the right, in the\n\ninterests of various matters, one of which is the fair administration of justice\n\nas protected by the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_32\">Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</a>.\n\n      If media exercises an unrestricted or rather unregulated freedom in\n\npublishing information about a criminal case and prejudices the mind of the\n\n\n\n                                                                           11\n public and those who are to adjudicate on the guilt of the accused and if it\n\nprojects a suspect or an accused as if he has already been adjudged guilty\n\nwell before the trial in court, there can be serious prejudice to the accused.\n\nIn fact, even if ultimately the person is acquitted after the due process in\n\ncourts, such an acquittal may not help the accused to rebuild his lost image\n\nin society.\n\n\n\n      If excessive publicity in the media about a suspect or an accused\n\nbefore trial prejudices a fair trial or results in characterizing him as a person\n\nwho had indeed committed the crime, it amounts to undue interference with\n\nthe &quot;administration of justice&quot;, calling for proceedings for contempt of court\n\nagainst the media. Other issues about the privacy rights of individuals or\n\ndefendants may also arise.       Public figures, with slender rights against\n\ndefamation are more in danger and more vulnerable in the hands of the\n\nmedia. after the judgment in R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu :AIR 1995\n\nSC 264.\n\n\n\n      The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion\n\nreceived a submission from the British Irish Watch against a very sustained\n\nattack by the press on Mrs. Bernadette and Mr. Michael McKevitt who had\n\nbeen advocating national sovereignty for Ireland and who were claiming\n\n                                                                            12\n the Irish people&#x27;s right to self-determination through a Committee. It was\n\nthe media which started linking these two persons to the Omagh bombing of\n\n15th August,1998 which killed 29 people. The media attack started even\n\nbefore the police questioned these two persons. The contents of the\n\nrepresentation to the U.N.Rapporteur by the British Irish Watch quoted\n\nbelow, fits well into what is happening with the media in our own country.\n\nThe representation stated:\n\n\n\n      &quot;Guilt by association is an invidious device. In the case of Bernadette\n\n      and Michael McKevitt, the media have created a situation where\n\n      almost no one in Ireland is prepared to countenance the possibility\n\n      that they may be innocent, notwithstanding the fact that neither of\n\n      them has even been questioned by the police in connection with the\n\n      Omagh bombing.         They have demonized, ... ... ...          such media\n\n      campaigns are self-defeating. If the media repeatedly accuses people\n\n      of crimes without producing any evidence against them, they create\n\n      such certainty of their guilt in the minds of the public that, if these\n\n      persons are even actually charged and tried, they have no hope of\n\n      obtaining a fair trial. When such trials collapse, the victims of the\n\n      crime are left without redress. Equally, defendants may be acquitted\n\n\n\n                                                                         13\n       but they have lost their good name&quot;.\n\n      (see The Blanket, Journal of Protest and Dissent, November 2000).\n\n\n\n      The observations of Mr. Andrew Belsey in his article &#x27;Journalism and\n\nEthics, can they co-exist&#x27; (published in Media Ethics : A Philosophical\n\nApproach, edited by Mathew Kieran) quoted by the Delhi High Court in\n\nMother Dairy Foods &amp; Processing Ltd v. Zee Telefilms (IA 8185/2003 in\n\nSuit No. 1543/2003 dated 24.1.2005) aptly describe the state of affairs of\n\ntoday&#x27;s media.      He says that journalism and ethics stand apart. While\n\njournalists are distinctive facilitators for the democratic process to function\n\nwithout hindrance the media has to follow the virtues of &#x27;accuracy, honesty,\n\ntruth, objectivity, fairness, balanced reporting, respect or autonomy of\n\nordinary people&#x27;. These are all part of the democratic process. But practical\n\nconsiderations, namely, pursuit of successful career, promotion to be\n\nobtained, compulsion of meeting deadlines and satisfying Media Managers\n\nby meeting growth targets, are recognized as factors for the &#x27;temptation to\n\nprint trivial stories salaciously presented&#x27;. In the temptation to sell stories,\n\nwhat is presented is what &#x27;public is interested in&#x27; rather than &#x27;what is in\n\npublic interest&#x27;.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            14\n       Suspects and accused apart, even victims and witnesses suffer from\n\nexcessive publicity and invasion of their privacy rights.         Police are\n\npresented in poor light by the media and their morale too suffers. The day\n\nafter the report of crime is published, media says &#x27;Police have no cue&#x27;.\n\nThen, whatever gossip the media gathers about the line of investigation by\n\nthe official agencies, it gives such publicity in respect of the information\n\nthat the person who has indeed committed the crime, can move away to\n\nsafer places. The pressure on the police from media day by day builds up\n\nand reaches a stage where police feel compelled to say something or the\n\nother in public to protect their reputation. Sometimes when, under such\n\npressure, police come forward with a story that they have nabbed a suspect\n\nand that he has confessed, the &#x27;Breaking News&#x27; items start and few in the\n\nmedia appear to know that under the law, confession to police is not\n\nadmissible in a criminal trial. Once the confession is published by both the\n\npolice and the media, the suspect&#x27;s future is finished. When he retracts from\n\nthe confession before the Magistrate, the public imagine that the person is a\n\nliar. The whole procedure of due process is thus getting distorted and\n\nconfused.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         15\n       The media also creates other problems for witnesses. If the identity\n\nof witnesses is published, there is danger of the witnesses coming under\n\npressure both from the accused or his associates as well as from the police.\n\nAt the earliest stage, the witnesses want to retract and get out of the muddle.\n\nWitness protection is then a serious casualty. This leads to the question\n\nabout the admissibility of hostile witness evidence and whether the law\n\nshould be amended to prevent witnesses changing their statements. Again,\n\nif the suspect&#x27;s pictures are shown in the media, problems can arise during\n\n&#x27;identification parades&#x27; conducted under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_33\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> for\n\nidentifying the accused.\n\n\n\n      Sometimes, the media conducts parallel investigations and points its\n\nfinger at persons who may indeed be innocent. It tries to find fault with the\n\ninvestigation process even before it is completed and this raises suspicions\n\nin the minds of the public about the efficiency of the official investigation\n\nmachinery.\n\n\n\n      The print and electronic media have gone into fierce competition, that\n\na multitude of cameras are flashed at the suspects or the accused and the\n\npolice are not even allowed to take the suspects or accused from their\n\n\n\n                                                                           16\n transport vehicles into the courts or vice versa. The Press Council of India\n\nissues guidelines from time to time and in some cases, it does take action.\n\nBut, even if apologies are directed to be published, they are published in\n\nsuch a way that either they are not apologies or the apologies are published\n\nin the papers at places which are not very prominent.\n\n\n\n      Apart from these circumstances, basically there is greater need to\n\nstrike a right balance between freedom of speech and expression of the\n\nmedia on the one hand and the due process rights of the suspect and\n\naccused. Art 19(1)(a), 19(2), Art 21 and Art 14 of the Constitution play a\n\nvery important role in striking an even balance. As we shall be showing in\n\nthe ensuing chapters, the present <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_34\">Contempt of Court Act, 1971</a> requires\n\nsome changes in view of the law that has been declared by the Supreme\n\nCourt at least in two leading cases, one is A.K. Gopalan vs. Noordeen 1969\n\n(2) SCC 734 and the other is Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India AIR 1978\n\nSC 597.    These judgments have struck a balance between competing\n\nfundamental rights which were not noticed or available at the time when the\n\nJoint Parliament Committee (1969) made some drastic changes in the Bill\n\nprepared by the Sanyal Committee (1963).            These issues fall for\n\nconsideration.\n\n\n\n                                                                        17\n       In addition, we have the judgment in Sunday Times case decided by\n\nthe European Court on prior restraint on press publications, the (UK)\n\nContempt of Court Act, 1981 and the Reports of Law Commissions in\n\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries which have tried to\n\nstrike an even balance between competing fundamental rights.\n\n\n\n      It is in the light of the problems mentioned, the drastic changes in the\n\ninterpretation of Arts 14, 19, 21 of the Constitution of India that have come\n\nabout on account of judgments of the Supreme Court and the reforms\n\nbrought in or proposed in other jurisdictions, that we have taken up the\n\nsubject suo motu.\n\n\n\n      We shall be discussing a number of important issues relating to the\n\nfreedom of speech and expression and the right to due process for a fair trial\n\nunder the criminal law, in the ensuing chapters.\n\n(In this Chapter and in the ensuing Chapters, wherever we use the word &#x27;due\n\nprocess&#x27; for fair trial in a criminal proceeding, we mean a procedure\n\nestablished by law under Art 21 which is fair, just and reasonable and not\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          18\n arbitrary or violative of Art 14 of the Constitution of India as decided by the\n\nSupreme Court in (Maneka Gandhi&#x27;s case above referred to).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           19\n                                 CHAPTER II\n\n\n\n             Human Right Conventions, Madrid Principles,\n\n                    Indian Constitution and Contempt\n\n                            of Courts Act, 1971\n\n\n\n      Our criminal law and criminal jurisprudence are based on the premise\n\nthat the guilt of any person charged in a court of law has to be proved\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt and that the accused is presumed to be innocent\n\nunless the contrary is proved in public, in a court of law, observing all the\n\nlegal safeguards to an accused. Not only that, the accused has a basic right\n\nto silence. That right stems from the constitutional right of the accused\n\ncommon to several constitutions that the accused cannot be compelled to\n\nincriminate himself. That is also the reason why confessions to the police\n\nare inadmissible in a court of law.\n\n\n\n      The right to silence has been considered in detail in our 180th Report,\n\n(2001) titled &quot;Art 20(3) of the Constitution of India and the Right to\n\nSilence&quot;.   At the outset, it is necessary to go into some fundamental\n\nconcepts relating to human rights as contained in International Conventions,\n\n\n\n                                                                         20\n the Madrid Principles and our <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_35\">Constitution and Contempt of Court Act,\n\n1971</a>.\n\n\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)\n\n        There are certain rights of suspects and accused which are basic\n\nhuman rights.

The\n\nobjectives of the meeting were:\n\n   (1)      to examine the relationship between the media and judicial\n\n            independence as guaranteed by the 1985 UN Principles on the\n\n            Independence of Judiciary.\n\n   (2)      To formulate principles addressing the relationship between\n\n            freedom of expression and judicial independence.\n\n         The group of media representatives and jurists while stating in the\n\n   &#x27;Preamble&#x27; that the &#x27;freedom of the media, which is an integral part of\n\n   freedom of expression, is essential in a democratic society governed by\n\n   the Rule of Law and that it is the responsibility of the Judges to\n\n   recognize and give effect to freedom of the media by applying a basic\n\n   presumption in their favour and by permitting only such restrictions on\n\n   freedom of the media as are authorized by the International Covenant on\n\n   Civil and Political Rights (&quot;International Covenant&quot;) and are specified in\n\n   precise law, emphasized that :\n\n                                                                         29\n           &quot;The media have an obligation to respect the rights of\n\n          individuals, protected by the International Covenant and the\n\n          independence of the judiciary&quot;.\n\nIt refers to the principles which are drafted as &quot;minimum&quot; standards of\n\nprotection of the freedom of expression.\n\nThe Basic Principle :\n\n(1) Freedom of expression (as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 19</a> of the Covenant),\n\n      including the freedom of the media - constitutes one of the essential\n\n      foundations of every society which claims to be democratic. It is\n\n      the function and right of the media to gather and convey information\n\n      to the public and to comment on the administration of justice,\n\n      including cases before, during and after trial, without violating the\n\n      presumption of innocence.\n\n(2) This principle can only be departed from in the circumstances\n\n      envisaged in the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\n      Rights, as interpreted by the 1984 Siracusa Principles on the\n\n      Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant\n\n      on Civil and Political Rights (U.N.

Secrecy in such circumstances\n\n                 must be regarded as being mainly for the benefit of persons who\n\n                 are suspected or accused and to preserve the presumption of\n\n                 innocence. It shall not restrict the right of any such person to\n\n                 communicate to the press, information about the investigation or\n\n                 the circumstances being investigated.\n\n      (5)        The Basic Principle does not exclude the holding in camera of\n\n                 proceedings intended to achieve conciliation or settlement of\n\n                 private disputes.\n\n      (6)        The Basic Principle does not require a right to broadcast or record\n\n                 court proceedings. Where this is permitted, the Basic Principle\n\n                 shall remain applicable.\n\n      Restrictions :\n\n\n\n                                                                                  31\n (7)    Any restriction of the Basic Principle must be strictly prescribed\n\n       by law. Where any such law confers a discretion or power, that\n\n       discretion or power must be exercised by a Judge.\n\n(8)    Where a Judge has a power to restrict the Basic Principle and is\n\n       contemplating the exercise of that power, the media(as well as\n\n       any other person affected) shall have the right to be heard for the\n\n       purpose of objecting to the course of that power and, if exercised,\n\n       a right of appeal.\n\n(9)    Laws may authorize restrictions of the Basic Principle to the\n\n       extent necessary in a democratic society for the protection of\n\n       minors and members of other groups in need of special\n\n       protection.\n\n(10)    Laws may restrict the Basic Principle in relation to the criminal\n\n       proceedings in the interest of the administration of justice to the\n\n       extent necessary in a democratic society:\n\n       a. for the prevention of serious prejudice to a defendant;\n\n       b. for the prevention of serious harm to or improper pressure\n\n          being placed upon a witness, a member of a Jury or a victim.\n\n(11)   Where a restriction of the Basic Principle is sought on the\n\n       grounds of national security, this should not jeopardize the rights\n\n       of the parties, including the rights of the defence. The defence\n\n                                                                      32\n          and the media shall have the right, to the greatest extent possible,\n\n         to know the grounds on which the restriction is sought (subject, if\n\n         necessary, to a duty of confidentiality if the restriction is\n\n         imposed) and shall have the right to contest this restriction.\n\n(12)     In civil proceedings, restrictions of the Basic Principle may be\n\n         imposed if authorized by law to the extent necessary in a\n\n         democratic society to prevent serious harm to the legitimate\n\n         interests of a private party.\n\n(13)     No restriction shall be imposed in an arbitrary or discriminatory\n\n         manner.\n\n(14)     No restriction shall be imposed except strictly to the minimum\n\n         extent and for the minimum time necessary to achieve its\n\n         purpose, and no restriction shall be imposed if a more limited\n\n         restriction would be likely to achieve that purpose. The burden of\n\n         proof shall rest on the party requesting the restriction. Moreover,\n\n         the order to restrict shall be subject to review by a Judge.\n\nStrategies for Implementation :\n\n       Para 1 states that the Judge should receive guidance in dealing with\n\nthe press and the Judge shall be encouraged to assist the press by\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          33\n   providing summary of long or complete judgment of matters of public\n\n  interest.\n\n       Para 2 says that Judges shall not be forbidden to answer questions\n\n  from the press etc.\n\n      Para 3 is important and states:\n\n       &quot;3. The balance between independence of judiciary, freedom of the\n\n  press and respect of the rights of the individual - particularly of minors\n\n  and other persons in need of special protection - is difficult to achieve.\n\n  Consequently, it is indispensable that one or more of the following\n\n  measures are placed at the disposal of affected persons or groups; legal\n\n  recourse, Press Council, Ombudsman for the Press, with the\n\n  understanding that such circumstances can be avoided to a large extent\n\n  by establishing a Code of Ethics for the media which should be\n\n  elaborated by the profession itself.\n\n  Siracusa Principles : (referred to in Para 2 of Basic Principle of Madrid\n\n  Principles)\n\n  The following are extracts from the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation\n\nand Derogation Provision in the International Covenant on Civil and\n\nPolitical Rights.

Thus so\n\nfar as criminal contempt is concerned, the &#x27;pre-trial&#x27; period has not been\n\ngiven the required importance under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_83\">Court of Contempts Act, 1971</a>.\n\n&#x27;Pendency&#x27; under the Explanation to sec 3 starts, in a criminal case, only\n\nfrom the time when the charge sheet or challan is filed or summon or\n\n\n\n                                                                         43\n  warrant is issued by the criminal Court and not even from date of arrest,\n\n even though from the time of arrest, a person comes within the protection\n\n of the Court for he has to be brought before a Court within 24 hours under\n\n Art 22(2) of the Constitution of India. If there are prejudicial publications\n\n after arrest and before the person is brought before Court or his plea for\n\n bail is considered, there are serious risks in his getting released on bail.\n\n\n\n      Certain acts like publications in the media at the pre-trial stage, can\n\naffect the rights of the accused for a fair trial. Such publications may relate\n\nto previous convictions of the accused, or about his general character or\n\nabout his alleged confessions to the police etc.\n\n\n\n       In the context of a parallel investigation which was undertaken\n\n pending arrest and trial in the court, the Supreme Court referred to &#x27;trial by\n\n press&#x27;. This was, of course, before 1971 Act was enacted. In Saibal v.\n\n B.K. Sen (AIR 1961 SC 633) it said:\n\n             &quot;It would be mischievous for a newspaper to systematically\n\n             conduct an independent investigation into a crime for which a\n\n             man has been arrested and to publish the results of the\n\n             investigation. This is because, trial by newspapers, when a trial\n\n             by one of the regular tribunal is going on, must be prevented.\n\n                                                                                44\n            The basis for this view is that such action on the part of the\n\n           newspaper tends to interfere with the course of justice&quot;.\n\nThe words &quot;tends to interfere with the course of justice&quot; used by the\n\nSupreme Court in the above case are quite significant.\n\n\n\n    In the light of the human rights concepts referred to above and the\n\nprovisions of our <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_84\">Constitution and the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</a>, the\n\nquestion arises whether any publication of matters regarding suspect or\n\naccused can amount to contempt of Court not only when it is made during\n\nthe pendeny of a criminal case (i.e. after the charge sheet is filed) but\n\nbefore that event, e.g. once a person is arrested and criminal proceedings\n\nare &quot;imminent&quot;. This issue requires a very detailed examination and will\n\nbe considered in the ensuing chapters.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       45\n                               Chapter - III\n\n\n\n    Do publications in the media subconsciously affect the Judges?\n\n\n\n      There is then a nice question whether a media publication can\n\n&#x27;unconsciously&#x27; influence Judges or Juries and whether Judges, as human\n\nbeings are not susceptible to such indirect influences, at least\n\nsubconsciously or unconsciously ?\n\n\n\n    The American view appears to be that Jurors and Judges are not liable\n\nto be influenced by media publication, while the Anglo-Saxon view is that\n\nJudges, at any rate may still be subconsciously (though not consciously)\n\ninfluenced and members of the public may think that Judges are\n\ninfluenced by such publications and such a situation, it has been held,\n\nattracts the principle that &#x27;justice must not only be done but must be seen\n\nto be done&#x27;. The Anglo-Saxon view appears to have been accepted by the\n\nSupreme Court as can be seen by a close reading of the Judgment in\n\nReliance Petrochemicals v. Proprietor of Indian Express : 1988(4) SCC\n\n592. If one carefully analyses that judgment, in the light of an earlier\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       46\n  judgment of the Court in P.C. Sen (in Re) :AIR 1970 SC 1821, this view\n\n of the Supreme Court appears to be clear.\n\n\n\n      In P.C. Sen in re the Supreme Court observed: (p 1829)\n\n\n\n      &quot;No distinction is, in our judgment, warranted that comment on a\n\n      pending case or abuse of a party may amount to contempt when the\n\n      case is triable with the aid of a Jury and not when it is triable by a\n\n      Judge or Judges.&quot;\n\n      It appears that it was accepted by the Supreme Court that Judges are\n\nlikely to be &quot;subconsciously&quot; influenced . That was also the view of Justice\n\nFrankfurter of U.S. Supreme Court (in his dissent) and of Lord Scarman and\n\nLord Dilhorne of the House of Lords. We shall presently refer to these\n\nviews.\n\n\n\n         P.C. Sen (in Re) (AIR 1970 SC 1821) was, no doubt, a case where\n\n a civil action by way of a writ was pending in the High Court. There was\n\n a broadcast by the Chief Minister of West Bengal, who had knowledge of\n\n the challenge to the West Bengal Milk Products Control Order, 1965 in a\n\n Writ Petition that was pending in the Calcutta High Court, and the High\n\n\n\n                                                                        47\n  Court held him to be guilty of contempt for justifying the Control Order in\n\n his radio broadcast but let him off without punishment.\n\n      On appeal, the Supreme Court agreed that the speech of the Chief\n\nMinister was ex facie calculated to interfere with the administration of\n\njustice. In the course of the judgment, it was stated that no distinction can\n\nbe made on the ground whether a case is triable by a Judge or Jury. If an\n\naction tends to influence the Jury, it may also tend to influence a Judge.\n\n\n\n        In Reliance Petrochemicals Ltd. vs. Proprietors of Indian Express\n\n 1988(4) SCC 592, an order of prior restraint was passed by the Supreme\n\n Court initially while a civil case was pending adjudication. There there\n\n was a public issue of the commercial company, the company started the\n\n public issue after obtaining sanction of the Controller of Capital Issues.\n\n The sanction was under challenge by various parties in different High\n\n Courts and the company filed a transfer petition in the Supreme Court to\n\n bring all the matters before the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n      In that case which related to transfer of all similar cases to one Court,\n\n initially, at the instance of Reliance Petrochemicals, the Supreme Court\n\n passed an order restraining the Indian Express Newspapers from\n\n publishing any article, comment, report or editorial on the subject of\n\n                                                                             48\n public issue by the company. The Indian Express applied for vacating the\n\norder and while vacating the order, the Supreme Court considered the case\n\nlaw pertaining to publications which could be prejudicial and referred to\n\nthe exceptions.\n\n\n\n      The Supreme Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> which deals with\n\nfreedom of speech and expression and the restrictions stated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 19\n\n(2).</a> It pointed out that the American Constitution does not contain any\n\nprovision for imposition of reasonable restrictions by law.\n\n\n\n    It adverted to the absolute terms in which the U.S First Amendment\n\ndealing with freedom of speech and expression is couched and to the\n\ntheory of &#x27;real and present danger&#x27; which was evolved by the U.S Courts\n\nas the only inherent limitation on that right in that country. The Supreme\n\nCourt in Reliance case stated that the position in India was different, here\n\nthe right of freedom of speech and expression was not absolute as in USA.\n\nThe Court observed (see para 10, p.602):\n\n                  &quot;Our Constitution is not absolute with respect to freedom\n\n           of speech and expression as enshrined by the First Amendment\n\n           to the American Constitution.&quot;\n\n\n\n                                                                        49\n         The Court again stated (see para 12, p.603,) that it was not dealing\n\n with a case of publication by press affecting &#x27;judicial administration&#x27; in\n\n the context of Contempt of court but was examining the question of\n\n publication as a matter relating to &#x27;public interest&#x27;. After referring to the\n\n First Amendment to the US Constitution which is in absolute terms, the\n\n Court stated (p.605, para 15):\n\n            &quot;In America, in view of the absolute terms of the First\n\n            Amendment, unlike the conditional right of freedom of speech\n\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_87\">Article     19(1)(a)</a> of our Constitution, it would be\n\n            worthwhile to bear in mind the &#x27;present and imminent danger&#x27;\n\n            theory&quot;.\n\nThe Supreme Court then referred to the observations of Justice Frankfurter\n\nin John D. Pennekamp v. State of Florida (1946) 328 US 331) to the effect\n\nthat &#x27;the clear and present danger&#x27; concept was never stated by Justice\n\nHolmes in Abrams v. U.S : (1919) 250 US 616 to express a technical\n\ndoctrine or convey a formula for adjudicating cases. It was a literary phrase\n\nnot to be distorted by being taken out from its context. The Judiciary,\n\naccording to Justice Frankfurter could not function properly if what the\n\npress does is reasonably calculated to disturb the judicial judgment in its\n\nduty and capacity to act solely on the basis of what is before the Court. The\n\njudiciary is not independent unless Courts of Justice are enabled to\n\n                                                                          50\n administer law by absence of pressure from without, or the presence of\n\ndisfavour.\n\n          There is yet another celebrated passage in the said judgment of\n\nJustice Frankfurter (not quoted by our Supreme Court) to which we may\n\nrefer:-\n\n               &quot;No Judge fit to be one is likely to be influenced consciously,\n\n               except by what he sees or hears in Court and by what is\n\n               judicially appropriate for his deliberations. However, Judges\n\n               are also human and we know better than did our forbears how\n\n               powerful is the pull of the unconscious and how treacherous\n\n               the rational process ... and since Judges, however stalwart, are\n\n               human, the delicate task of administering justice ought not to\n\n               be made unduly difficult by irresponsible print. The power to\n\n               punish for contempt of court is a safeguard not for Judges as\n\n               persons but for the functions which they exercise. It is a\n\n               condition of that function - indispensable in a free society -\n\n               that in a particular controversy pending before a court and\n\n               awaiting judgment, human beings, however strong, should not\n\n               be torn from their moorings of impartiality by the undertone of\n\n               extraneous influence.   In securing freedom of speech, the\n\n\n\n                                                                          51\n             Constitution hardly meant to create the right to influence\n\n            Judges and Jurors.&quot;\n\n       The Supreme Court next referred to Nebraska Press Association v.\n\n Hugh Stuart : (1976) 427 US 539 where the American Supreme Court\n\n vacated a prior-restraint order passed by the trial Judge in a multiple\n\n murder case while that case was pending, on the ground that the view of\n\n the trial Judge that Jurors are likely to be influenced by the press\n\n publications, was speculative. The US Supreme Court stated that the trial\n\n court should have resorted to alternative remedies such as - change of\n\n venue, postponement of trial, a searching voir dire of the Jury panel for\n\n bias, and sequestration of jurors - before passing a restraint order. After\n\n referring to Nebraska, our Supreme Court observed that (p.607, para 21):-\n\n            &quot;We must examine the gravity of the evil. In other words, a\n\n            balance of convenience in the conventional phrase of Anglo-\n\n            Saxon Common Law Jurisprudence would, perhaps, be the\n\n            proper test to follow.&quot;\n\nAfter thus referring to the US First Amendment as being absolute and to the\n\ntest of &#x27;real and present danger&#x27; evolved in US and after holding that the\n\nposition in India was different because here <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> granted only a\n\nconditional right, the Supreme Court turned to the Anglo-Saxon\n\nJurisprudence and examined the English cases.\n\n                                                                        52\n       The Supreme Court referred to Attorney General v. BBC : 1981 A.C\n\n303 (HL). In that case the Attorney General had brought proceedings for an\n\ninjunction to restrain the defendants from broadcasting a programme\n\ndealing with matters which related to an appeal pending before a Local\n\nValuation Court on the ground that the broadcast would amount to contempt\n\nof court.   In that context, (though the House of Lords held that contempt\n\nlaw did not apply to the Valuation Court), Lord Scarman observed that\n\n&#x27;administration of justice&#x27; should not at all be hampered with.         Lord\n\nDenning in the Court of Appeal had observed that professionally trained\n\nJudges are not easily influenced by publications. But, disagreeing with that\n\nview of Lord Denning, Lord Dilhorne stated (pp 335) in yet other oft-quoted\n\npassage as follows:\n\n      &quot;It is sometimes asserted that no Judge will be influenced in his\n\n      Judgment by anything said by the media and consequently that the\n\n      need to prevent the publication of matter prejudicial to the hearing of\n\n      a case only exists where the decision rests with laymen. This claim to\n\n      judicial superiority over human frailty is one that I find some\n\n      difficulty in accepting. Every holder of a Judicial Office does his\n\n      utmost not to let his mind be affected by what he has seen or heard or\n\n      read outside the Court and he will not knowingly let himself be\n\n      influenced in any way by the media, nor in my view will any layman\n\n                                                                         53\n       experienced in the discharge of Judicial duties.      Nevertheless, it\n\n      should, I think, be recognized that a man may not be able to put that\n\n      which he has seen, heard or read entirely out of his mind and that he\n\n      may be subconsciously affected by it. It is the law, and it remains the\n\n      law until it is changed by Parliament, that the publications of matter\n\n      likely to prejudice the hearing of a case before a court of law will\n\n      constitute contempt of court punishable by fine or imprisonment or\n\n      both&quot;.\n\n      No doubt, as stated above, Lord Denning M.R stated in the Court of\n\nAppeal that Judges will not be influenced by the media publicity (Att Gen v.\n\nBBC : 1981 AC 303 (315) CA), a view which was not accepted in the Houe\n\nof Lords in Att Gen vs. BBC 1981 AC 303 (HL).\n\n      In fact, Borrie and Lowe in their Commentary on Contempt of Court\n\n(3rd Edn, 1996) state that Lord Denning&#x27;s view is &quot;more a statement of\n\npolicy rather than literal truth&quot;.\n\n      Cardozo, one of the greatest Judges of the American Supreme Court,\n\nin his &#x27;Nature of the Judicial Process&#x27; (Lecture IV, Adherence to Precedent.\n\nThe Subconscious Element in the Judicial Process) (1921) (Yale University\n\nPress) referring to the &quot;forces which enter into the conclusions of Judges&quot;\n\nobserved that &quot;the great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men, do\n\nnot turn aside in their curse and pass the Judges by&quot;.\n\n                                                                         54\n       The full text of the passage in the above essay of Cardozo reads thus:\n\n            &quot;Even these forces are seldom fully in consciousness. They lie\n\n            so near the surface, however, that their existence and influence\n\n            are not likely to be disclaimed. But the subject is not exhausted\n\n            with the recognition of their power. Deep below consciousness\n\n            are other forces, the likes and the dislikes, the predilections and\n\n            the prejudices, the complex instincts and emotion and habits\n\n            and convictions, which make the man, whether he be litigant or\n\n            Judge ... ... ... There has been a certain lack of candor in much\n\n            of the discussions of the theme or rather perhaps in the refusal\n\n            to discuss it, as if Judges must lose respect and confidence by\n\n            the reminder that they are subject to human limitations .. ...&quot;\n\nCardozo then stated in a very famous quotation,\n\n            &quot;None the less, if there is anything of reality in my analysis of\n\n            the Judicial Process, they do not stand aloof on these chill and\n\n            distant heights; ... The great tides and currents which engulf\n\n            the rest of men, do not turn aside in their course, and pass the\n\n            Judges by&quot;.\n\n      The New South Wales Law Commission in its Discussion Paper\n\n(2000) (No.43) on &#x27;Contempt by Publication&#x27; stated (see para4.50) that most\n\n                                                                          55\n law reform bodies &quot;tended to take the view that Judicial officers should\n\ngenerally be assumed capable of resisting any significant influence by\n\nmedia publicity.     Despite this, they have not gone so far as to exclude\n\naltogether as a possible ground of liability for sub-judice contempt, the risk\n\nof influence on a Judicial officer. The justification for this approach is two-\n\nfold :      first, it is always possible that a Judicial officer may be\n\nsubconsciously influenced; and secondly, it is just as important to protect\n\nthe public perception of Judges&#x27; impartiality as to protect against risk of\n\nbias&quot;.    The Discussion Paper notes that in UK, the Phillmore Committee\n\nnoted that Judges are generally capable of putting extraneous matter out of\n\ntheir minds but, in its recommendations, the Committee did not exclude\n\ninfluence on Judicial officers as a ground for liability.\n\n         The NSW Law Commission referred to an article by S. Landsman and\n\nR.Rakos &quot;A Preliminary Inquiry into the effect of potentially biasing\n\ninformation on Judges and Jurors in Civil Litigation&quot; (1994) ( 12\n\nBehavioral Sciences and the Law 113), which concluded that there is no\n\nempirical data to support or refute the assertion that Judicial officers are not\n\nlikely to be significantly influenced by media publicity. We cannot forget\n\nthe Common Law rule laid down in R v. Sussex Justices : Exparte\n\nMcCarthy : 1924(1) KB 256 that\n\n\n\n                                                                            56\n              &quot;Justice should not only be done, it should manifestly and\n\n             undoubtedly be seen to be done&quot;.\n\n      The Irish Law Commission in its Consultation paper (1991) (p 115)\n\non Contempt of Court observed similarly.        The Canadian Law Reform\n\nCommission also took the view that, while Judges may generally be\n\nimpervious to influence, the possibility of such influence could not be ruled\n\nout altogether, and that in the case of Judicial officers, the sub-judice rule\n\nserved an important function of protecting public perception of impartiality\n\n(see Canadian Law Reform Commission, Contempt of Court : Offences\n\nagainst Administration of Justice {Working Paper 20, 1977, p 42-43} and\n\nReport 17 (1982) at p 30).\n\n      In Union of India v. Naveen Jindal : 2004(2) SCC 510, it was clearly\n\nheld that the US First Amendment is in absolute whereas the right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> can be restricted as permitted in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 19(2)(a)</a>, echoing\n\nwhat was stated in Reliance Petrochemicals.\n\n      In M.P. Lohia v. State of West Bengal : 2005(2) SCC 686, the facts\n\nwere that a woman committed suicide in Calcutta in her parents&#x27; house but a\n\ncase was filed against the husband and in-laws under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_91\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n\nfor murder alleging that it was a case of dowry death.          The husband\n\n(appellant in the Supreme Court) had filed a number of documents to prove\n\nthat the woman was a schizophrenic psychotic patient. The parents of the\n\n                                                                          57\n woman filed documents to prove their allegations of demand for dowry by\n\nthe accused. The trial was yet to commence. The Courts below refused\n\nbail.\n\n        The Supreme Court granted interim bail to the accused and while\n\npassing the final orders, referred very critically to certain news items in the\n\nCalcutta magazine. The Court deprecated, two articles published in the\n\nmagazine in a one-sided manner setting out only the allegations made by the\n\nwoman&#x27;s parents but not referring to the documents filed by the accused to\n\nprove that the lady was a schizophrenic. The Supreme Court observed:-\n\n             &quot;These type of articles appearing in the media would certainly\n\n             interfere with the course of administration of justice.&quot;\n\nThe Court deprecated the articles and cautioned the Publisher, Editor and\n\nJournalist who were responsible for the said articles against\n\n        &quot;indulging in such trial by media when the issue is sub-judice.&quot;\n\nand observed that all others should take note of the displeasure expressed by\n\nthe Court.\n\n        The Punjab High Court in Rao Harnarain v. Gumori Ram : AIR 1958\n\nPunjab 273 stated that &#x27;Liberty of the press is subordinate                to the\n\nadministration of justice. The plain duty of a journalist is the reporting and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             58\n not the adjudication of cases.&#x27; The Orissa High Court in Bijoyananda v.\n\nBala Kush (AIR 1953 Orissa 249) observed that -\n\n             &quot;the responsibility of the press is greater than the responsibility\n\n             of an individual because the press has a larger audience. The\n\n             freedom of the press should not degenerate into a licence to\n\n             attack litigants and close the door of justice nor can it include\n\n             any unrestricted liberty to damage the reputation of respectable\n\n             persons.&quot;\n\n      In Harijai Singh v. Vijay Kumar : 1996(6) SCC 466, the Supreme\n\nCourt stated that the press or journalists enjoy no special right of freedom of\n\nexpression and the guarantee of this freedom was the same as available to\n\nevery citizen. The press does not enjoy any special privilege or immunity\n\nfrom law.\n\n\n\n      Summarizing the position, it will be seen that the right to free speech\n\nin US is absolute and no restraint order against publication is possible\n\nunless there is &#x27;clear and present danger&#x27; to the right itself.\n\n      But, the position in India is different. The right to free speech is not\n\nabsolute as in US but is conditional and restricted by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 19(2).</a>\n\nTreating a publication as criminal contempt under <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_93\">Section          2(c)</a> of the\n\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971 where the Court comes to the conclusion that\n\n                                                                           59\n the publication as to matters pending in Court &#x27;tends&#x27; to interfere {vide\n\n<a href=\"/doc/491407/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 2(c)(iii)</a>} with the administration of justice, amounts to a reasonable\n\nrestriction on free speech. The view obtaining in USA that trained Judges\n\nor even jurors are not influenced by publication in the media as stated by the\n\nmajority in Nebraska (1976) 427 US 539) was not accepted in England in\n\nAttorney General v. BBC 1981 AC 303 (HL) by Lord Dilhorne who stated\n\nthat Judges and Jurors may be influenced subconsciously and Judges could\n\nnot claim to be super human was quoted by the Supreme Court in Reliance\n\nPetrochemicals. In what manner they are so influenced may not be visible\n\nfrom their judgment, but they may be influenced subconsciously. Even in\n\nUS, Justice Frankfurter has accepted that Judges and Jurors are likely to be\n\ninfluenced. The view of the Indian Supreme Court even earlier in P.C. Sen\n\nIn re : AIR 1970 SC 1821 was that Judges and Jurors are likely to be\n\ninfluenced and that view in the Anglo-Saxon law appears to have been\n\npreferred by the Supreme Court in Reliance case. That         Judges      are\n\nsubconsciously influenced by several forces was also the view of Justice\n\nCardozo and of the various Law Commissions referred to above.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          60\n                                   CHAPTER IV\n\n\n\nHow &#x27;imminent&#x27; criminal proceedings came to be excluded from the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_95\">Contempt of Courts Act, 1971</a>: A historical and important perspective\n\n\n\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1689734/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 3(2)</a> of the Contempt of Court Act, 1971 read with the\n\nExplanation below the section (see Chapter II of this Report) excludes from\n\ncriminal contempt, all publications made, before the filing of charge sheet\n\nor challan in court or before issue of summons or warrant, even if such\n\npublications interfere or tend to interfere with the course of justice.\n\n\n\n      In King v. Mirror 1927(1) KB 845, the accused was arrested on\n\nJanuary 9, and within 24 hours, brought before the Court on January 10 and\n\ninvestigation started and on January 13, an identification parade was held.\n\nOffending photographs were published on January 17. It was held that\n\nproceedings have begun. But the question of imminence of criminal\n\nproceedings was not decided.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          61\n       In King v. Parke : (1903) 2 KB 432, it was held that there would be\n\ncontempt of the assize Court even though no committal had taken place and\n\na bill had been filed. What possible difference can it make, whether a\n\nparticular Court which is thus sought to be deprived of its independence and\n\nits power of effecting the great end for which it is created, be it at the\n\nmoment in session or even actually constituted or not? It was in this case\n\nthat Wills J. made the famous observation:\n\n      &quot;It is possible very effectively to poison the fountain of justice before\n\n      it begins to flow. It is not possible to do so when the stream has\n\n      ceased.&quot;\n\n(See Law of Contempt of Court by K.J. Aiyer, 6th Ed, 1983 for the above\n\nanalysis of Indian case law. But, today this is not good law, the date of\n\narrest rather than the filing of first information report, is the starting point of\n\n&#x27;pendency&#x27; as per judgment of our Supreme Court.)\n\n\n\n      Question is whether such exclusion amounts to over-protection of\n\nfreedom of expression and dilution of the protection of due process for fair\n\ncriminal trials?\n\n\n\n      It is first necessary to go into the historical basis of the exclusion of\n\nprejudicial publications made prior to filing of charge sheet or challan from\n\n                                                                              62\n the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_97\">Contempt of Court Act, 1971</a>. A historical perspective will\n\nlay bear how such exclusion, as stated above, from contempt liability come\n\ninto being and whether such exclusion was justified?\n\n\n\nLaw prior to 1971:\n\n      Under both the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_98\">Contempt of Courts Act, 1926</a> and 1952, there was no\n\ndefinition of civil contempt and criminal contempt. Further, Courts did\n\napply contempt law to publications which interfered or tended to interfere\n\nwith administration of justice if criminal proceedings were &quot;imminent&quot; and\n\nthe person &#x27;knew or should have known&#x27; that a proceeding was imminent\n\n(see Subrahmanyam in re : AIR 1943 Lah 329 (335); Tulja Ram v. Reserve\n\nBank : AIR 1939 Mad 257; State v. Radhagobinda : AIR 195 4 Orissa 1.\n\nState v. Editor etc. of Matrubhumi : AIR 1955 Orissa 36; Le Roy Frey v. R.\n\nPresad : AIR 1958 Punjab 377; Emperor v. Kustalchar : AIR 1947 Lah 206).\n\n\n\n      In Smt. Padmavati Devi v. R.K. Karanjia AIR 1963 MP 61, it was\n\nheld that to attract the jurisdiction of contempt, it was not necessary that the\n\ntrial of the accused must be imminent in the sense that committal\n\nproceedings must have been instituted. The filing of the first information\n\nreport was sufficient. At any rate, by the production of the arrested person\n\nbefore a Magistrate for remand, the criminal case was actually pending in a\n\n\n                                                                           63\n criminal court competent to deal with it judicially. In criminal cases, such a\n\nstep could be taken in the case of a non-cognisable offence, by the filing of\n\na complaint in the Court and in the case of a cognisable offence by the\n\nmaking of a first information report. Arrest of the accused by the police\n\nduring investigation could, therefore, be &quot;during&quot; the pendency of the cause.\n\nIt may be that thereafter the investigation may prove abortive, the\n\nprosecution may be dropped or the accused may be released and orders may\n\nbe passed granting protection to the prosecution and to the accused from\n\nunjustified attacks as long as the investigation has not ended. There is no\n\njustification for distinction between the English law and the Indian law on\n\nthe point. In England also, a person may be arrested without warrant and\n\nafter an arrest, the prosecution may be dropped for paucity of evidence but\n\nthat has never been considered to be a good reason for not considering the\n\ncriminal cause as pending.\n\n\n\n      This is so far as &#x27;arrest&#x27; is concerned even where a charge sheet or\n\nchallan was not filed before the 1971 Act.\n\n\n\n      But, before the 1971 Act, it has been held in Smt. Padmavathi Devi&#x27;s\n\ncase and in the following cases that as soon as a complaint is lodged in the\n\npolice station and an investigation is started, the matter becomes sub-judice\n\n                                                                          64\n attracting the judicial power of the Court to punish for contempt.\n\n(Diwanchand v. Narender : AIR 1950 East Punjab 366, Rao Narain Singh v.\n\nGumani Ram : AIR 1958 Punjab 273; Emperor v. Chowdhary : AIR 1947\n\nCal 414; Mankad v. Shet Pannalal : AIR 1954 Kutch 2; State v.

Gopalan vs.\n\nNoordeen (1969) referred to below.\n\n\n\nA.K. Gopalan vs. Noordeen: (1969)\n\n      In A.K. Gopalan v. Noordeen : (AIR 1969(2) SCC 734) (decided on\n\n15th September, 1969 before the 1971 Act), the Supreme Court held that a\n\ncriminal proceeding is imminent only when an arrest had taken place. In\n\nthat case, a person lost his life in an incident and first information report\n\nwas lodged on the same day.       About a week later, Mr. A.K. Gopalan\n\n(appellant) made a statement and three days later, the respondent and his</pre>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">brother were arrested and remanded to police custody. The statement was\n\npublished in a newspaper after the arrest. The respondent moved the High\n\nCourt for contempt against the appellant, editor, printer and publisher of\n\nnewspaper. The High Court held them all guilty of contempt of Court as the\n\nstatement on publications were after the filing of the first information\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                         65</span>\n report. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal of Mr. A.K. Gopalan but\n\ndismissed the appeal of the editor. The Court held:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      (i)     Committal for contempt is not a matter of course.

The accused were not arrested till after his statement is\n              made and there was nothing to suggest imminence of\n              proceedings, and there was nothing to show that the first\n              appellant was instrumental in getting the statement published\n              after the arrest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      (iv)    The fundamental right to freedom of speech will be unduly\n              restrained if it is held that there should be no comment on a\n              case even before an arrest had been made. In fact, in cases of\n              public scandals involving companies, it is the duty of free press\n              to comment on such topics and draw the attention of the public.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (v)     As regards the editor, the proceedings in the criminal court\n              were imminent, because by the date the statement was\n              published, the accused was arrested, and remanded by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                            66</span>\n              magistrate, which shows that proceedings in a court were\n             imminent. The possibility of the accused being released after\n             further investigation is there, but is remote. Even though the\n             name of the accused was not mentioned, it was indicated that\n             the person who committed murder was acting in pursuance of a\n             conspiracy, and that would certainly put the public against the\n             accused.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1920320\" id=\"span_3\">(The dissenting Judge Mitter J, held that even the first appellant was\n\n      guilty of contempt of court.)\n\n\n\n      We have earlier referred to <a href=\"/doc/1920320/\" id=\"a_99\">Smt.

Courts have, by and large, tried to\n\n        exercise their powers in this respect in such a way that the law\n\n        of contempt does not seriously interfere with freedom of\n\n        speech because they have themselves realised that it is\n\n        extremely difficult to draw the lines between cases where\n\n        proceedings may be said to be imminent and cases where they\n\n        may not be. For instance, the mere filing of a first information\n\n        report may not be conclusive that proceedings are imminent\n\n        although stern logic may demand that the line should be drawn\n\n        at that point. Even where an arrest has taken place, it may not\n\n        always be followed up by a judicial proceeding. The only\n\n        guidance that we obtain from decided cases is that the question\n\n        will depend upon the facts of each case (Foot Note 1 extracted\n\n        below).

We\nwould also like to go a little further and provide certain additional\nsafeguards. It has been observed in several cases that once a\nperson is arrested, it would be legitimate to infer that proceedings\nare imminent (see Foot Note 2 extracted below). But in actual fact\nthat result may not invariably follow. We have already said that it\nshould be a valid defence for an alleged contemnor to prove that\nhe had no reasonable grounds for believing that a proceeding was\nimminent. To this, we would like to add that where no arrest has\nbeen made, a presumption should be drawn in favour of the\nalleged contemnor that no proceedings are imminent (Foot Note 3\nextracted below).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">   We shall refer to the Footnotes 1, 2, 3 now:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39724480\" id=\"span_9\">Foot Note 1: &quot;See the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/39724480/\" id=\"a_103\">Surendra Mohanty v.

It prepared a draft Bill and published it in the\n\nGazette in February, 1968 and invited responses. After receiving responses,\n\nthe Bill was finalized. It provided any definition of &#x27;contempt&#x27; but in\n\nclauses 3 to 7 stated what will not be contempt. The Report stated in para\n\n15 as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      &quot;15   ..           ..          ..           ..           ..\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\n\n      The Law of Contempt of Courts touches upon citizens&#x27; fundamental\n\n      rights to personal liberty and to freedom of expression and therefore,\n\n      it is essential that all should have a clear idea about it.       The\n\n      Committee were, however, aware that it would be difficult to define\n\n      in precise terms the concept of Contempt of Court, nevertheless, it\n\n      was not beyond human ingenuity to frame or formulate a suitable\n\n      definition thereof. The Committee have, therefore, after giving a very\n\n      anxious and elaborate thought to this aspect in the Bill, evolved a\n\n      definition of the expression &#x27;Contempt of Court&#x27; in clause 2 of the\n\n      Bill. While doing so, the Committee have followed the well-known\n\n      and familiar classification of contempts into &#x27;civil contempt&#x27; and\n\n      &#x27;criminal contempt&#x27; and have given essential indications and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                        75</span>\n       ingredients of each class or category of contempt. The Committee\n\n      hopes that the proposed definitions will go a long way in enabling the\n\n      public to know what contempt of court means so that they could\n\n      avoid it; and the courts would find it easy to administer it. The\n\n      proposed definition would also, the Committee trust, remove\n\n      uncertainties arising out of an undefined law and help the\n\n      development of the law of contempt on healthier lines.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      But in para 16, the Committee referred to the &quot;other principal changes\n\nby the Committee in the Bill&quot;.

Print media and the radio services too have\n\ntremendously increased.       News in internet is available globally.\n\nDissemination of news by the electronic media and internet is so fast that\n\nthe moment a crime of some significance is alleged to have been committed\n\nand somebody is suspected, every News Channel rushes to the place and\n\ncovers the item within minutes. The suspect is shown on the television or in\n\nthe internet and almost a parallel inquiry starts.

These\n\ntechnological developments in the media and types of behaviour were not\n\nthere when the Sanyal Committee in its Report in 1963 stated in one para\n\nthat our country is so vast that events relating to a crime in one part of the\n\ncountry do not get spread to other parts of the country. This reasoning is no\n\nlonger tenable. Some of the television channels are national and some are\n\nlocal, in the sense they publish news in local languages but are part of the\n\nsame cable network and these channels are accessible in other parts of the\n\ncountry too. Today, cable TV system displays regional TV channels in\n\nvernacular languages in various states to cater to the customers who hail\n\nfrom the particular region speaking that local language.

Newspapers too have\n\nincreased circulation than what was in 1970 and another feature is their\n\ncoverage of news from the states in National dailies and the coverage of\n\nDistrict news in local State newspapers.

In fact, by the date the Committee submitted its Report,\n\nSupreme Court had decided in A.K. Gopalan v. Noorudin AIR 1970 SC\n\n1694: (1969(2) SCC 734) that the word &#x27;imminent&#x27; meant the time when a\n\nperson was arrested, though pendency was not to be reckoned from the time\n\nwhen a first information report was filed. That starting point was fixed by\n\nthe Supreme Court for the purpose of balancing the freedom of speech and\n\nexpression in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 19(1)(a) (read with Article 19</a>(2)) on the one hand and\n\nliberty of the person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 21</a> which guarantees due process. There\n\nis express reference to the freedom of speech and expression in that\n\njudgment.     Therefore, the argument of the Joint Committee as to\n\n&#x27;vagueness&#x27; is no longer available and perhaps the attention of the\n\nCommittee was not invited to the judgment of the Supreme Court which was\n\nalready there by the date of its Report.

If for example, prior to identifying an accused person in a\n\n      police line-up, a witness had been shown by a police officer a\n\n      photograph of the accused, then it would be strongly argued that the\n\n      identification in the line-up was useless, or at least of very limited\n\n      value.    It would be argued that, because of what is sometimes\n\n      described as the displacement effect, there was a high risk that at the\n\n      time of the line-up, the witness was performing an act of recognition,\n\n      not of a person who had been seen by the witness on some previous\n\n      occasion, but of the person in the photograph.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">      In New Zealand, publicity given to confessions allegedly made to the\n\npolice can create serious prejudice to a suspect or accused.

But, the freedom of the press and\n\n      other media is not lightly to be interfered with and it must be shown\n\n      that there is a real likelihood of a publication of material that will\n\n      seriously prejudice the fairness of the trial (Cooke J)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                        92</span>\n       On facts, no action was taken as the publication did not contain\n\ndetails. In Attorney General v. Sports Newspapers Ltd. : 1992 (1) NZLR\n\n503, the NZ Divisional Court held that criminal proceedings must be\n\npending or imminent. In Television New Zealand case, instead of basing\n\nthe judgment on whether the criminal proceedings were imminent, the court\n\nlaid down the test of &#x27;real likelihood of a publication of material that will\n\nseriously prejudice the fairness of the trial&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">(d)   Australia: Case law and Law Reform Commission prejudice on\n      account of &#x27;imminent&#x27; proceedings: accepted in Australia:\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">      Western Australia has a provision in section 11A of the Evidence\n\nAct, 1906 which authorises a Judge to restrict publication of evidence in\n\nany proceeding where the Judge considers that publication may tend to\n\nprejudice any prosecution that has been or may be brought against a person.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">      The Law Reform Commission of Australia issued a number of\n\ndiscussion papers addressing the issues of contempt by publication in 1986,\n\n1987 and 2000.

Gopalan</a>&#x27;s case) the Supreme Court examined the question as to\n\nwhether the prejudicial publication of a statement in the media at a time\n\nwhen the only step taken was the recording of first information report under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1898, could be contempt of\n\ncourt. Kapur, J observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                     &quot;Before the publication of the comments complained of,\n             only the first information report was filed in which though\n             some persons were mentioned as being suspected of being\n             responsible for causing the breach in the Bund, there was no\n             definite allegation against any one of them. In the charge-sheet\n             subsequently filed by the police these suspects do not appear\n             amongst the persons accused. It was, therefore, argued that by\n             the publication there could not be any tendency or likelihood to\n             interfere with the due course of justice. The learned Additional\n             Solicitor-General for the State submitted on the other hand that\n             if there is a reasonable probability of a prosecution being\n             launched against any person and such prosecution be merely\n             imminent, the publication would be a contempt of court.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                         97</span>\n  <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_135\">The Contempt of Courts Act</a> (1952) confers on the High\nCourts the power to punish for the contempt of inferior courts.\nThis power is both wide and has been termed arbitrary. The\ncourts must exercise this power with circumspection, carefully\nand with restraint and only in cases where it is necessary for\nmaintaining the course of justice pure and unaffected. It must\nbe shown that it was probable that the publication would\nsubstantially interfere with the due course of justice;\ncommitment for contempt is not a matter of course but within\nthe discretion of the court which must be exercised with\ncaution. To constitute contempt is not necessary to show that as\na matter of fact a judge or jury will be prejudiced by the\noffending publication but the essence of the offence is conduct\ncalculated to produce an atmosphere of prejudice in the midst\nof which the proceedings will have to go on and a tendency to\ninterfere with the due course of justice or to prejudice mankind\nagainst persons who are on trial or who may be brought to trial.\nIt must be used to preserve citizen&#x27;s rights to have a fair trial of\ntheir causes and proceeding in an atmosphere free of all\nprejudice or prepossession.

In\norder to do this various facts will have to be proved and in each\ncase that question would depend on the facts proved.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">Kapur J further observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">     &quot;In the present case all that happened was that there was a\nfirst information report made to the police in which certain\nsuspects were named; they were not arrested; investigation was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                               98</span>\n              started and on the date when the offending article was\n             published no judicial proceedings had been taken or were\n             contemplated against the persons named in the information\n             report. Indeed after the investigation the suspects named in that\n             report were not sent up for trial. At the date of this offending\n             publication was made, there was no proceeding pending in a\n             court of law nor was any such proceeding imminent.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">      A reading of the above observations shows that the date of filing of a\n\nfirst information report under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure Code cannot be the starting point for treating a criminal\n\nproceeding as pending, still there could be contempt if criminal proceedings\n\nare &#x27;imminent&#x27;. In that case in the charge sheet, some of the names referred\n\nto in the first information report were not included.           In order that\n\npublications are in contempt, they must be such as would &quot;substantially&quot;\n\ninterfere with the due course of justice. It is not necessary to show that as a\n\nmatter of fact a Judge or Jury will be prejudiced by the offending\n\npublication but the essence is whether the publication was calculated to\n\nproduce an atmosphere of prejudice in the midst of which the proceeding\n\nwill have to go on and has a tendency to interfere with the due course of\n\njustice or to prejudice mankind against persons who are on trial or who may\n\nbe brought to trial. It must be used to preserve citizens&#x27; right to have a fair\n\ntrial of their causes and that the proceedings arecarried in an atmosphere\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                           99</span>\n free of all prejudice or prepossession. It will be contempt if there is a\n\npublication of any news or comments which have a tendency to or are\n\ncalculated to or are likely to prejudice the parties or their cause or to\n\ninterfere with course of justice. As to when proceedings begin or when they\n\nare imminent must depend upon the circumstances of each case. It was felt\n\nthat the exact boundaries do not fall for decision in the case. Apart from the\n\nfacts in information report, various other facts have to be proved. In <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_137\">the\n\nabove case</a>, the first information report alone was there but, it was stated,\n\nthat none was arrested as on the date of the publication.

While the\n\nstatement of Mr.A.K.

The Supreme Court held that Mr.A.K.\n\nGopalan was not guilty of contempt and so far as the printers and publishers\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                          100</span>\n were concerned, the Court took the view that the question was whether\n\nproceedings in a court were imminent? The Court &quot;referred&quot; to arrest in a\n\nserious cognizable case i.e. one of alleged murder, and stated that &#x27;arrest&#x27;\n\nmeans that the police was prima facie on the right track. It also referred to\n\nthe fact that the accused must have been produced before a Magistrate\n\nwithin 24 hours of the arrest in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 22</a> of the\n\nConstitution and the Magistrate must have authorized further detention of\n\nthe accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      The Court stated &quot;In these circumstances, it is difficult to say that any\n\nproceedings in a court were not imminent&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      Not only that, the Supreme Court stated further:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">               &quot;The fact that the police may have, after investigation, come to\n\n               the conclusion that the accused was innocent does not make the\n\n               proceedings any the less imminent&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      Why publication could subvert the course of justice was:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">               &quot;because it would tend to encourage public investigation of a\n\n               crime and a public discussion of the character and antecedents\n\n               of an accused in detention.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       The Court also observed that it is not in every case when a person is\n\narrested, a proceeding in a court can be said to be imminent because there\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                           101</span>\n could be delay in the scrutiny of accounts may take time. If it is a case\n\nagainst a company, a large number of accounts may have to be investigated\n\nby the police and criminal proceedings may not be imminent in spite of\n\narrest. On that ground the Court said :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">             &quot;as observed by this Court, it is difficult to lay down any\n\n             inflexible rule&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">It then said :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">             &quot;But, as far as an investigation of a charge of murder is\n\n             concerned, once an accused has been arrested proceedings in\n\n             Court should be treated as imminent&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">   (Mitter, J however, held even Mr.A.K.

Gopalan</a>&#x27;s case that the fact that an arrest under <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 41</a> of the\n\nCr.PC has been made may be prima facie proof that criminal proceedings\n\nare &#x27;imminent&#x27;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                          102</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">       But, it is true the Court made an observation that there can still be\n\nexceptions where notwithstanding an arrest, criminal proceedings may not\n\nbe imminent such as where a mass of accounts of a company are to be\n\nscrutinized or investigated before charge sheet is filed under Section 173.\n\nThose observations deal with a delayed time factor but that does not, in our\n\nopinion, mean that in the case of (say) arrest of a company&#x27;s Director, there\n\ncan be prejudicial publications because of delay in the filing of charge-\n\nsheet. This requires a proper meaning being given to the word &#x27;imminent&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">      In our view, the word &#x27;imminent&#x27; does not mean merely that the\n\ncharge sheet must be filed in Court &quot;immediately&quot; after arrest. &#x27;Imminent&#x27;\n\nhere mans the &#x27;reasonable likelihood&#x27; of the filing of charge sheet whether\n\nimmediately or in a reasonable time. If the word &#x27;imminent&#x27; should mean\n\n&quot;immediate&quot;, then in all cases where there are delays in investigation such\n\nas when investigation is entrusted to the CBI or the ACB in the States, there\n\ncould be a free licence to issue prejudicial publications. That cannot be the\n\nlaw. &#x27;Imminence&#x27;, in our view, really means &#x27;reasonable likelihood&#x27; of\n\nfiling of charge sheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                                                         103</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">       But we are not saying that once arrest is made, the media is obliged to\n\nmake no publications at all. What the law requires is that they should not,\n\nwhile making publications, prejudice the case of the suspect by referring to\n\nhis character, prior convictions, confessions, photographs (where identity is\n\nin question) or describe him as guilty or innocent (see Chapter IX). Further,\n\nsec 3 grants immunity to publications made without knowledge of the\n\npendency of the criminal proceeding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">      Nor is the editorial note correct in suggesting that the word\n\n&#x27;imminence&#x27; requires a person who wants to make a prejudicial publication\n\nto go to the police station or to somehow find out if the police had come to a\n\npreliminary conclusion to file a charge sheet. Such an interpretation of the\n\nword &#x27;imminent&#x27; is a highly unreasonable one and impracticable. We do\n\nnot see any problem in understanding that &#x27;imminence&#x27; in respect of a\n\nperson who is &#x27;arrested&#x27; means that he is &quot;most likely&quot; to be charge sheeted.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">      Further, as stated below, &#x27;arrest&#x27; is important in another sense because\n\nof the 24 hour rule which we shall presently discuss.

There\n\nremains the problem of selecting a starting point that is both\n\nsufficiently certain and early enough to afford real protection to any\n\nensuing trial.     The Phillmore Committee (paras 123, 216)\n\nrecommended that for criminal proceedings, the starting point\n\nshould be (a) in England and Wales, when the accused person is\n\ncharged or a summons served and (b) in Scotland, when the person\n\nis publicly charged on petition or otherwise or at the first calling in\n\ncourt of a summary complaint.       Had this recommendation been\n\nimplemented , it is suggested that it would have tipped the balance\n\ntoo far in favour of freedom of speech.

However, despite the\n\n              difficulties adverted to above, it is submitted that the Act gets the\n\n              timing about right.

It is accepted that such publications can prejudice the minds of the\n\nJurors or even the Judges (where Jury is not necessary). The impact on\n\nJudges has been elaborately discussed in Chapter III of this Report. The\n\nSupreme Court of India has indeed accepted, in more than one case, that\n\nJudges may be &#x27;subconsciously&#x27; prejudiced against the suspect/accused.

Restrictions intended to protect the administration of justice\n\nfrom interference can be included in the Contempt Law of our country\n\nunder Art 19(2), if they are &#x27;reasonable&#x27; It is even accepted in our country\n\nthat actual prejudice of Judges is not necessary for proving contempt. It is\n\nsufficient if there is a substantial risk of prejudice.   The principle that\n\n&quot;Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done&quot; applies from\n\nthe point of view of public perception as to the Judges being subconsciously\n\nprejudiced as has been accepted in UK and Australia.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">         In view of the above, such a publication made in respect of a person\n\nwho is arrested but in respect of whom a charge sheet or challan has not yet\n\nbeen filed in a Court, in our view, prejudices or may be assumed by the\n\npublic to have prejudiced the Judge, and in that case a procedure, such as\n\nthe one permitted by <a href=\"/doc/1689734/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 3(2)</a> read with Explanation of the Contempt of\n\nCourts Act,1971, does not prescribe a procedure which is fair, just and\n\nequitable, and is arbitrary and will offend <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                         125</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">        Contempt law which protects the &#x27;administration of justice&#x27; and the\n\n&#x27;course of justice&#x27; does not accept undue interference with the due process\n\nof justice and the due process includes non-interference with the rights of a\n\nsuspect/accused for an impartial trial. Thus, Contempt of Court law protects\n\nthe person who is arrested and is likely to face a criminal trial.         No\n\npublication can be made by way of referring to previous convictions,\n\ncharacter or confessions etc. which may cause prejudice to such persons in\n\nthe trial of an imminent criminal case.

Further, we have always taken the\n\nview that there is a particular interest in trying cases in the\n\ncommunity where the alleged crime occurred. Next, challenges for\n\ncause are rare. And for the reasons indicated in the contemporaneous\n\njudgment of this court in R v. Sanders 1995 (3) NZLR 545, cross-\n\nexamination of prospective jurors about their views and beliefs is\n\ngenerally undesirable. Sequestration of jurors for the duration of\n\ntrials has not been a practice in New Zealand. Clearly it would add to\n\nthe pressure on jurors and affect their ordinary lives.

In the court below\n\nwhich heard the case against Gisborne New Herald and other papers in\n\nSolicitor General v.

Solicitor General, there appears to\n\nhave been a shift that both rights be balanced. The Court of Appeal also\n\nstated in Gisborne:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">      &quot;The common law of contempt is based on public policy. It requires\n\n      the balancing of public interest factors. Freedom of the press as a\n\n      vehicle for comment on public issues is basic to any democratic\n\n      system. The assurance of a fair trial by an impartial court is essential\n\n      for the preservation of an effective system of justice. Both values\n\n      have been affirmed by the Bill of Rights. The public interest in the\n\n      functioning of the courts invokes both these values. It calls for free\n\n      expression of information and opinions as to the performance of these\n\n      public responsibilities. It also calls for determination of disputes by\n\n      courts which are free from bias and which make their decisions safely\n\n      on the evidence judiciously brought before them. Full recognition of\n\n      both these indispensable elements can present difficult problems for\n\n      the courts to resolve. The issue is how best those values can be\n\n      accommodated under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, 1990.&quot;\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                                          134</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">       Finally, the Court of Appeal stated -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">             &quot;The present rule is that where on the conventional analysis,\n\n      freedom of expression and fair trial cannot both be fully assured, it is\n\n      appropriate in our free and democratic society to temporarily curtail\n\n      freedom of media express so as to guarantee a fair trial.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">      In other words, while the trial Judge said fair trial rights override\n\nmedia rights, the Court of Appeal said both must be balanced and the Court\n\nmay impose a temporary ban.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nGlennon &amp; Hinch cases: freedom of speech and liberty have to be balanced.\n\nBut a conviction for contempt due to likelihood of interference with\n\nadministration of justice need not result in setting aside the conviction of an\n\naccused: Is it correct?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">      Glennon was a Roman Catholic priest who, in 1978 was convicted of\n\nindecently assaulting a girl under 16.

Indeed, it is a touchstone of the existence of the rule of law.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">      The High Court of Australia held that although the trial might not\n\ntake place until some two years after the first broadcast by Mr. Hinch, the\n\ntrial courts were entitled to reach the conclusion that there was &#x27;a\n\nsubstantive risk of serious interference with the fairness of trial&#x27;.          In\n\nsensational cases, jurors were prone to remember the publication in spite of\n\nlapse of time.

He relied on the judgment punishing Mr. Hinch for his\n\npublication. But the High Court of Australia rejected his plea in R.V.\n\nGlennon: (1992) 173 CLR 592 and restored the conviction of Glennon for\n\nsexual offences against young people.        The Court made a distinction\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                                              137</span>\n between preventing prejudicial publicity rather than minimising its impact\n\nat trial. It stated that different tests were applicable in contempt proceedings\n\nand on the one hand to criminal convictions. Contempt proceedings are\n\nconcerned with potential prejudice, which must be assessed as at the time of\n\npublication. Actual prejudice is not an element of contempt charge. By\n\ncontrast, before a conviction is set aside, a court of appeal is concerned with\n\nthe extent of actual prejudice and, in particular, whether a miscarriage has\n\noccurred. There was no inconsistency in upholding the convictions of\n\nGlennon and punishing Hinch for contempt. Community&#x27;s expectations, it\n\nwas observed, must be fulfilled. It stated that in such a situation, the\n\nquashing of convictions may indeed open &#x27;flood-gates&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">      But the Judgment in Glennon has been criticised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">\n\n      Allam Ardik, in the Faculty of Griffith University (2000), Alternative\n\nLaw Journal, page 1, says that the appellate judge restored the conviction on\n\naccount of &#x27;fear of public outrage&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">      Prof. Michael Chesterman (1999) NSW Unit of Tech, (Sydney Law\n\nReview p.5 refers to statistics to say that 11 cases out of 20 cases since 1980\n\nin Australia, where there was &#x27;convergence&#x27; in the sense that the trial was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                                           138</span>\n aborted and the contemnor convicted.

The NSW Court also stated that\n\nfreedom of expression is not unconditional. &quot;Expression can, for legally\n\nrelevant purposes, be free even though it is subject to other legitimate\n\ninterests&quot; (ibid, Gleeson, CJ).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                                          142</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">           The Commission referred (see paras 2.13 to 2.15) to <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 19(2)</a> of\n\nthe International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights which permits\n\nrestriction on freedom of speech and expression for various purposes and\n\nstated:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">               &quot;Furthermore, <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 19</a> of the ICCPR is made subject to\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 19(1)</a> which guarantees the right to individuals to a &#x27;fair\n\n               hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal&quot;.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">          The Commission referred (see paras 2.16 to 2.19), to the &#x27;Principle\n\nof Open Justice&#x27; which again is not absolute and it stated (see para 2.18)\n\nthat &quot;media can effectively perform this &#x27;watch dog&#x27; role, promoting\n\ndiscussion of courts and the justice system, &#x27;without publishing the most\n\nobviously prejudicial material specifically relevant to a case&#x27;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">          The Commission dealt with (see paras 2.20 to 2.22) the Rules of\n\nEvidence, about the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond\n\nreasonable doubt as a basic tenet of criminal procedure.

In contrast, the public interest in the free\n\nflow of information is by no means wholly interrupted by a careful\n\nobservance of the sub judice rule, since, at worst, the inhibition of\n\nunrestricted comment and publication of allegedly relevant facts is of a\n\ntemporary nature only.     It rejected the argument that the sub judice rule\n\noffends against the guarantee of freedom of expression (Art 40.6.1).

But, the Court of Appeal vacated\n\nthe injunction granted by the Divisional Court. The House of Lords allowed\n\nthe appeal and restored the injunction. It was held that when the civil cases\n\nwere pending, it was contempt of court to publish articles pressurizing the\n\nDistillers to settle the matters as that would affect the administration of\n\njustice.

Under <a href=\"/doc/202193/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 10(2)</a>,\n\nrestrictions were permissible if they were &quot;necessary         in a democratic\n\nsociety, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public\n\nsafety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or\n\nmorals, for the protection of the reputation of others, for preventing the\n\ndisclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the\n\nauthority and impartiality of judiciary&quot;. The majority in the European Court\n\nheld that &#x27;authority&#x27; of the judiciary did cover its adjudicative functions as\n\nwell as its powers to record settlements.

This question was more factual because the point was whether\n\npublic interest required publication of the evil effects of thalidomide.\n\n&#x27;Necessary&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/202193/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 10(2)</a> was not synonymous with &#x27;indispensable&#x27;.\n\n&#x27;Necessary&#x27;, the Court said, was not as flexible as the words &#x27;admissible&#x27;,\n\n&#x27;ordinary&#x27;, &#x27;useful&#x27;, &#x27;reasonable&#x27; or &#x27;desirable&#x27;. It implied a &#x27;pressing social\n\nneed&#x27; or one which was &#x27;proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued&#x27;. The\n\ngeneral injunction granted by the Court did not meet this standard as it was\n\nin very wide terms, further, there was not much pressure on the Distillers\n\nLtd for settlement since the issue was also debated in Parliament.

It said &quot;There appears to be no neat set of answers ...&quot;\n\nto the effects of Thalidomide. Therefore, the effect of the article on readers\n\nwas likely to be &#x27;varied&#x27; and hence not adverse to the &#x27;authority of the\n\njudiciary&#x27;.

Having regard to all the\n\ncircumstances, the interference complained of did not correspond to a social\n\nneed sufficiently pressing to outweigh public interest in freedom of\n\nexpression within the meaning of the Convention.

Question is whether such prejudicial\n\npublications may be directed to be postponed by a general or specific order.\n\n\n\nPrior restraint and subsequent punishment are distinct\n\n\n\n      There is a well recognized distinction between prior restraint and\n\nsubsequent punishment. In Constitutional Law (4th Ed)(1991) by John E.\n\nNowah &amp; Ronald D. Rotunda, while referring to the position in USA it is\n\nstated: (p 970)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                         160</span>\n        &quot;While it is no longer true that the first amendment means only\n\n       freedom from prior restraint, prior restraint is still considered to be\n\n       more serious than subsequent punishment&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">Mr. A. Bickel states that a &#x27;criminal statute &#x27;chills&#x27; while prior restraint\n\n&#x27;freezes&#x27; (see the Morality of Dissent, p 61 1975). In our view, if it is &#x27;prior\n\nrestraint&#x27; but only &#x27;postponement&#x27; of publication, there is no &#x27;freezing&#x27; at\n\nall.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">\n\nStringent conditions have to be imposed if postponement of publications by\n\nCourt is to be permitted:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">       While subsequent punishment may deter some speakers, prior\n\nrestraint limits public debate and knowledge more severely and prior\n\nrestraint must be subjected o stringent conditions, whether I is permanent or\n\ntemporary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">       Under English law, sec 4(2) requires proof or &#x27;substantial risk of\n\nprejudice&#x27; has to be proved if a postponement order has to be passed by\n\nCourt.

The Court required proof of actual prejudice for quashing the trial\n\nand said that likelihood of prejudice which is relevant for contempt, was not\n\nrelevant for quashing a conviction. This judgment has, as already stated,\n\nbeen severely criticized.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">       It is, therefore, necessary to see if there can be prevention of prejudice\n\nrather than take serious measures after prejudice has occurred. Of course,\n\nthis has to be limited to extreme cases because it amounts to &#x27;prior restraint&#x27;\n\non publications which it is accepted as being a serious encroachment on the\n\nfreedom of speech.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">       In the United States where the only exception is &#x27;grave and present&#x27;\n\ndanger, prior restraint procedures are very narrow.

But, we have pointed out that that case is distinguishable\n\nbecause the Court&#x27;s order of prior restraint related to the publication of\n\nprejudicial matter affecting settlement in a batch of civil cases. Several civil\n\nactions were filed against a company which sold thalidomide to pregnant\n\nwomen who filed cases against the company on account of the probable\n\nafter-effects of the drug on their children to be borne. The publications\n\ncriticized the drug and the company when settlement proceedings were\n\npending.   We pointed out that that case did not relate to publications\n\naffecting suspect or accused in a pending or imminent criminal law.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">      Yet another point we had noted was that the European Court while\n\ndeciding Sunday Times case held that in order to grant an injunction it was\n\nincumbent on the party affected to prove &#x27;necessity&#x27; because <a href=\"/doc/1406924/\" id=\"a_224\">Art. 1</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                           163</span>\n European Convention requires that the restriction to be imposed on the\n\nfreedom of speech was &#x27;necessary&#x27; in a democratic society. The European\n\nCourt specifically pointed out that the Convention did not use the word\n\n&#x27;reasonable&#x27; but used the word &#x27;necessary&#x27;.       Our Constitution uses the\n\nwords &#x27;reasonable restriction&#x27; and permits a law to be made imposing\n\n&#x27;reasonable restrictions&#x27;. Further, the European Court commented on the\n\n&#x27;absolute nature of the injunction&#x27; granted by the UK Courts and said that\n\nwhile such a permanent ban on publication was not necessary, an order\n\npostponing the publication for some time was permissible even under the\n\nConvention.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_255\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_256\">       Therefore, US precedents and Sunday Times case are not precedents\n\nin our country.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_257\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">       In the Indian context, where an injunction was granted and vacated in\n\nReliance Petrochemicals case, we have pointed out in Chapter III that the\n\ninjunction in that case related to a civil case and that that case is also not\n\nrelevant so far as restraints on publications to prevent prejudice in criminal\n\ncases, particularly, after arrest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_259\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                                          164</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_260\">       While there are these differences between the American and\n\nStrasbourg jurisprudence and Reliance case on the one hand and the Indian\n\nconstitutional provisions, it is still incumbent for us to decide whether\n\nserious interference with the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed\n\nby our Constitution in <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_225\">Art. 19(1)</a> can be prevented by an injunction order of\n\na temporary nature.

Blair J observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_406\">      &quot;If a photograph of an accused person is broadcast in a newspaper\n\n      immediately after he is arrested, then such of the witnesses who have\n\n      not then seen him, may quite unconsciously be led into the belief that\n\n      the accused as photographed is the person they saw. The fact that a\n\n      witness claiming to identify the accused person, has seen a\n\n      photograph of him before identifying him, gives the defence an\n\n      excuse for questioning the soundness of the witness&#x27;s identification&quot;.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">We have also referred (see Chapter IV) to the NSW case from Australia in\n\nAttorney General (NSW) v.

It would be argued that, because of what is sometimes\n\n       described as displacement effect, there was a high risk that at the time\n\n       of the line-up, the witness was performing an act of recognition not of\n\n       a person who had been seen by the witness on some previous\n\n       occasion but of the person in the photograph&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">\n\n       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144973785\" id=\"span_172\">In <a href=\"/doc/144973785/\" id=\"a_281\">R v.

TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd : (1990) 20 NSWLR\n\n368, in the case of a murder of two women and a child at two distant\n\nlocations, the suspect surrendered to the police, was interviewed, confessed\n\nand was then taken to the scenes of the crimes by the police where he\n\ndemonstrated various significant matters to them. On these visits, the police\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                                                         205</span>\n and the suspect were accompanied by a journalist including television\n\ncrews. At one point, the television crew travelled in the same aircraft with\n\nthe suspect and the police, to the scene of the crime. The police held a press\n\nconference at which it was announced that the suspect had confessed.\n\nThese matters were all broadcast on television news. The NSW Court of\n\nAppeal stated that the tendency of this publication was to create a risk of\n\nprejudice to the accused at the trials (which did not take place ultimately\n\nsince the accused committed suicide while in custody) and was not lessened\n\nbecause of the very strong evidence against the accused. The Court of\n\nAppeal observed (p 382):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_408\">      &quot;A notion that the rules relating to contempt of court somehow apply\n\n      with less rigour to the case of a person against whom there is a very\n\n      strong case would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the\n\n      nature and purpose of those rules&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">      The contempt was not also lessened because of the role of the police\n\nin encouraging the publicity.

In England, there have been occasions in which the police have\n\noverstepped the mark of prudence (though no prosecution has even been\n\nbrought), the most notorious example being the &#x27;euphoric&#x27; press conference\n\nheld by the police following the arrest (on other charges) of Peter Sutclifee\n\nwho was later charged with being the so called &#x27;Yorkshire ripper&#x27;. There\n\nwas much concern over the treatment of Sutcliffe&#x27;s arrest but it was the\n\npress, rather than the police themselves, who bore the brunt of the criticism,\n\nno doubt because of the subsequent behaviour of the press over the case.\n\nThe authors say that &quot;Irrespective of the responsibility that lies on the\n\npolice, the media themselves have a responsibility that reliance on a police\n\npress release will not be a defence to charges of contempt brought against\n\nthem, if their publication is held creative of real risk of prejudice&quot; (as in AG\n\n(NSW) v.

When later they have to\n\ngive evidence, they may feel bound to stick to what they have said in the\n\nmedia interview.

There was a coroner&#x27;s inquiry into the death\n\nof seven people during a fire accident at an amusement centre.          One\n\nwitness, who had already given evidence, was widely reported as saying, in\n\neffect, that an attendant had allowed two children to go on a &#x27;ghost train&#x27;\n\ninto the fire.   The Daily Telegraph, believing that the attendant would not\n\nbe giving evidence, published a detailed account by him in which he sought\n\nto defend himself from the previous witnesses&#x27; allegations.      Part of that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                                                         216</span>\n article stated that the publication in Daily Telegraph may sound that he (the\n\nattendant) had sent the two kids to death. But, he said, it was not so. He\n\neven had to wrestle with one young lad who was determined to follow his\n\nmates into the fire and that he had to tear him from the car.   The Court of\n\nAppeal held that the publication interfered with the course of justice and\n\nwas contempt and fined the proprietors in a sum of 10,000 Australian\n\ndollars.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">      The authors say that the conducting of interview, with a view to\n\npublication of &#x27;background&#x27; material after the trial is generally regarded as\n\nlegitimate practice, but would amount to contempt if it could be shown to\n\nhave been of a &#x27;bullying&#x27; kind such as to deter witnesses from giving\n\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_217\">      Payments to witnesses in current legal proceedings for their stories is\n\ncontrary to clause 8 of the (UK) Press Complaints Commission Code of\n\nPractice.

But the authors say (p. 409) that &quot;such an\n\narrangement could amount to contempt since it seems to provide an\n\ninducement to the witness to &#x27;tailor&#x27; his evidence so as to ensure the more\n\nfinancially lucrative result&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_427\">      In the trial of Jeremy Thorpe, there were allegations (the authors\n\npointed out) there were allegations that the Sunday Telegraph agreed to pay\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                                                         217</span>\n a fee to Peter Bessel, a leading witness, for his revelations as a future\n\nwitness for a fee being reportedly contingent on a verdict of guilty. This\n\nwas condemned by the Press Council.

Taking &quot;arrest&quot; as starting point, any\n\n          restriction on prejudicial publications will be reasonable if they have\n\n          to satisfy the due process requirement under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_303\">Article 21</a> which, after\n\n          Maneka Gandhi&#x27;s case AIR 1978 SC 597, as that judgment requires\n\n          that the procedure protecting liberty must be fair, just and reasonable\n\n          and not arbitrary or violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 14.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">          Therefore, in our view, the word &#x27;pending&#x27; used in <a href=\"/doc/1075225/\" id=\"a_305\">Section 3(1)</a>,(2)\n\nand Explanation clauses (a) and (b) at different places must be substituted\n\nby the word &#x27;active&#x27; because the word &#x27;pending&#x27; gives an impression that a\n\ncriminal case must be actually pending.

So far as breach of sec 3, as proposed, when even a prejudicial\n\npublication is made after arrest or after a charge sheet is filed, or summons\n\nor warrant is issued, at present, if there is criminal contempt of subordinate\n\ncourts, those courts have no power to punish for contempt but can only\n\nmake a reference to the High Court under sec 15(2).

We are, in fact, concerned with publications which prejudice a\n\n      fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_245\">      (c)      <a href=\"/doc/520823/\" id=\"a_314\">Sections 7</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1409321/\" id=\"a_315\">8</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1123057/\" id=\"a_316\">9</a> of the NSW Bill deem publications as amounting\n\n      to contempt if they create substantial risk of prejudice. They do not\n\n      relate to postponement orders. The Bill is in Annexure A to that Report\n\n      of the NSW Law Commission (2003). But, Appendix B to that Bill\n\n      contains another draft Bill giving powers to court to regulate access to\n\n      court records or reports and contains a provision for passing\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                                                             227</span>\n       &#x27;suppression orders&#x27; but the sections as proposed there do not refer to\n\n      substantial risk of prejudice by publications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_246\">(d)       In our view, firstly, the section to be proposed by us must vest\n\npowers in Court to pass postponement orders as to prejudicial publication\n\nof any matter relating to an active criminal proceeding and not merely to\n\nreporting about the case as in Section 4(2) of the U.K Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_247\">(e) Further, in view of the interpretation of the words &#x27;substantial risk of\n\nprejudice&#x27; by English Courts as where &#x27;there is no substantial risk&#x27; or &#x27;no\n\nremote risk&#x27; and the absence of any adjective governing the word\n\n&#x27;prejudice&#x27;, we are of the view that instead of the words &#x27;substantial risk of\n\nprejudice&#x27; in Section 4(2) of the U.K Act, in the proposed section giving\n\npowers to the Court to pass &#x27;postponement&#x27; orders, we should use the\n\nwords:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_436\">         &quot;real risk of serious prejudice&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_248\">      so that the emphasis is not only on the word &#x27;risk&#x27; but also on the word\n\n      &#x27;prejudice&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_249\">(f) A question may be asked as to why we are not using these words\n\n(significant risk of serious prejudice) in <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 3</a> which deals with\n\n&#x27;interference&#x27; or &#x27;tending to interfere&#x27; with the administration of justice in\n\nsec 2 or the words &#x27;course of justice&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_318\">Section 3</a>.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                                                                          228</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_250\">       The reason is that the words used in sec 2© and 3 define what\n\npublication may be &#x27;criminal contempt&#x27; but the question of restricting\n\nfreedom of speech by passing an order of &#x27;prior restraint&#x27; as in sec 4(2) of\n\nthe UK Act, 1981 requires more stringent conditions. That is why, for\n\npurposes of passing postponement orders as to publication, it is necessary to\n\nuse the words &quot;significant risk of serious prejudice&quot;. Prior restraint as\n\npointed by the Supreme Court in Reliance Petrochemicals is a serious\n\nencroachment on the right of the press for publication under Art 19(1)(a)\n\nand cannot be interfered with merely because the publication interferes or\n\ntends to interfere with the course of justice as stated in sec 2(c) or sec 3.\n\nPrior restraint requires more stringent conditions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">(g)   The next question is as to which Court should pass postponement\n\norders. In our view, such powers cannot be vested in the subordinate courts\n\nwhere the criminal proceedings are &#x27;active&#x27;. This is because under the 1971\n\nAct, the subordinate courts have no power to take action for contempt.\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_319\">Section 15(2)</a>, they can only make a &#x27;reference&#x27; to the High Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_252\">      Further, the balancing of the rights of freedom of speech and the due\n\nprocess right of the suspect/accused as explained in Maneka Gandh&#x27;s case\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                                                                         229</span>\n can be done more appropriately by the High Court which is a Constitutional\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_253\">         The High Court for the purpose of passing postponement orders will\n\nbe a Bench of not less than two Judges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_254\">(h)       Postponement of publication does not mean result in an absolute\n\nprohibition. Initially, an order of postponement must be temporary, and can\n\nbe passedex parte and but must be made for a week enabling the media to\n\ncome forward for variation or cancellation. Of course, the initial order of\n\nrestraint must be published in the Media, so that the media will have an\n\nopportunity to know about the passing of the order and have the order\n\nvaried/cancelled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_255\">(i)      There is, however, danger of the postponement order lapsing at the\n\nend of one week, if no application is filed for variation or modification by\n\nthe media and no variation/cancellation is granted in a week. Hence, it is\n\nnecessary to provide for its automatic extension by law, in case no\n\napplication is filed within one week or where the order is not varied or\n\ncancelled within one week. Of course, after such automatic extension also,\n\nthe media can apply for variation or cancellation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_256\">(j) We, therefore, recommend insertion of Section 14A as stated in sec 6 of\n\nthe Bill annexed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                                                                        230</span>\n (4)   We also propose Section 14B under which any breach of a\n\npostponement order i.e. where the media makes a publication in breach of\n\nthe postponement order, it will amount to contempt of court for which the\n\nHigh Court may take action according to law for criminal contempt.
