CHALY, J\n\n      This Public Interest Litigation is filed by an Advocate, seeking\n\nto protect, the interest of the community of lawyers, and        violation\n\nof the fundamental rights of the public at large regarding their rights\n\nto be kept informed about the current social, political, economic,\n\ncultural and other topics and important issues, to enable them to\n\nunderstand and form an opinion, how they are managed by\n\nGovernment and administration including but not limited to the\n\nimportant judicial pronouncements. Basically, petitioner wants a\n\nguideline to be formed by this court to regulate the activities of the\n\nprint and electronic media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">      2.     According   to   the   petitioner,   honest   and    truthful\n\nrepresentation of the events from time to time is envisaged in the\n\nscheme of the Constitution of India. In a democratic set up, citizens\n\nmust be able to form their own opinion, comments and view points\n\non such matters and events that affect their future.       The right to\n\nfreedom of speech and expression contained in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 19</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India is not absolute as it is bound by sub-clause (2).\n\nAccording to the petitioner, deliberate planting of lies, repeated\n\nbroadcast of news to malign the image of judiciary, government\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                   :3:</span>\n\n\nfunctionaries, police force, political leaders including but not limited\n\nto Prime Minister, Chief Minister and other Ministers at the will,\n\nwhims and fancies without personally verifying the correctness or\n\nsource in violation of broadcasting ethics exceed the scheme of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India, thus creating hindrances in\n\ndischarging duties of functionaries at the critical positions. It is also\n\nstated that the present acts of the media violates the principle of\n\nconsideration of innocence until proved guilty and the media\n\naccording to their political or other socio-economic affiliation\n\nproclaim people as guilty to generate negative opinion on people of\n\ntheir target in violation of fundamental rights of the targeted\n\nvictims. It is submitted that such conduct on the part of the media\n\nnot only creates unrest in the community, but also affects the\n\ncredibility of the news broadcasted to put the public at large in a\n\ngreat dilemma as to what to believe and what not. Thus, according\n\nto the petitioner, the news and opinions published by the media\n\nhouses infringe the fundamental rights of the citizens to know the\n\ntruth and allow some unscrupulous people to indulge in cyber\n\nbullying   on    social   media      platform   with   the   support    of   the\n\nunauthenticated opinions published by the media houses and cause\n\nirreparable     damage    to   the    dignity and      credibility of   certain\n\npersonnel.      Moreover, most of the media houses are engaged in\n\nspreading news of their interest to disintegrate community by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                  :4:</span>\n\n\ncreating political and communal polarisation in the society.          It is\n\nsubmitted that due to such conduct on the part of the media\n\nhouses, the right to privacy which is a fundamental right protecting\n\nthe inner sphere of the individual from interference of both the\n\nState and non-State actors and          the freedom of the individuals to\n\nmake autonomous          choices in life are materially affected.     That\n\napart, it is submitted that the media houses are proclaiming the\n\nnames of the persons not even named in the FIR, and stories are\n\nbeing planted to create suspicion in the minds of the public at large.\n\nTherefore, such an act would amount to contempt of court, since\n\nthe news might prejudice the judiciary. The sum and substance of\n\nthe contention advanced by the petitioner is that the legitimacy of\n\nsuch publication is questionable as criminals are not punished\n\naccording to their political affiliation or religion or caste and making\n\nfalse and baseless allegations against the elected functionaries,\n\nChief Minister, Ministers or Prime Minister would amount to\n\ncontempt and legitimacy of such unfounded allegations are doubtful.\n\nIt is also stated that there is no rational connection between\n\nallegations   and   the    report   published.     Reputation,   being   a\n\nfundamental     right,    the   State   must   protect   the   same   from\n\nunscrupulous media houses.          The victim cannot be expected to\n\nchase down and clear his name after a long battle once his\n\nreputation is maligned as most of the individuals would not have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              :5:</span>\n\n\nresources to fights it out, contents the petitioner.      However, it is\n\nsubmitted that the law cannot permit infringement of fundamental\n\nrights at will, only because a victim is not coming forward to file a\n\ncomplaint and therefore, it is necessary that appropriate guidelines\n\nare formed and ensure the media houses to follow such guidelines\n\nin the interest of the pubic at large. Various examples are cited by\n\nthe   petitioner    which     created     repercussions   and   adverse\n\nconsequences in the trial of various political, social, sensitive, and\n\ncontroversial cases, and based on such aspects, it is submitted that\n\nunless the media plays focussed role in the interest of the nation as\n\na whole, it will damage the justice delivery system of the country\n\ndestroying trust reposed in the judiciary by the common man in a\n\nsystematic manner.       Therefore, unless necessary interventions are\n\nmade, one of the important pillars of the democracy can crumble at\n\nthe hands of some unscrupulous media personnel engaged in the\n\nguise of journalism.     Therefore, prima facie, there is failure of the\n\nsovereign to ensure the protection of fundamental rights of general\n\npublic and the rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India r/w the Indian Penal Code and the Contempt of\n\nCourts Act, and so also various guidelines and judgements\n\nenunciated by the Apex Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">      3. With the above background facts, certain specific instances\n\nare pointed out by the petitioner to substantiate the contention put\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 :6:</span>\n\n\nforth in the writ petition, that, it was reported on 5 th July, 2020, the\n\ncustoms    officials     at   Thiruvananthapuram    Airport   seized   gold\n\nweighing 30 kg. from diplomatic cargo addressed to the United Arab\n\nEmirates (UAE) Consulate in Kerala and the officials caught one Mr.\n\nSarith Nair, a former Public Relations Officer at the Consulate using\n\na fake ID to collect the baggage with the smuggled gold trying to\n\npass himself of as someone who could enjoy diplomatic immunity\n\nwith respect to the cargo.        It is assertively stated that diplomatic\n\ncargo normally cannot be checked by customs officials.           But, the\n\ncustoms officials had received sanction from the Government to\n\nexamine the baggage, which was a news revealed by the Customs\n\nCommissioner to the Press. It is the case of the petitioner that the\n\nCustoms officials were tipped off, that gold might be hidden in the\n\ncargo and suspect that there is a well organised syndicate behind\n\nthe smuggling racket. At the time of interrogation by the customs\n\nofficials, according to the petitioner, the aforesaid Sarith Nair is\n\nreported to have said that he was friendly with one Ms. Swapna\n\nSuresh,   that she was involved in the gold smuggling operations,\n\nand according to the petitioner, the Customs officials say that it is\n\nSwapna Suresh who forged the documents and would allow them to\n\nclaim diplomatic immunity over the cargo.          It is also pointed out\n\nthat the said lady is involved in a forgery case against an Air India\n\nemployee. However, the Press sensationalised these news items and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              :7:</span>\n\n\nstories that came to be published through print, electronic and\n\nsocial media suggesting various suspicions like, the accused lady is\n\nin fact, daughter in law of another prominent Congress leader,\n\nKerala Chief Minister directly or indirectly involved, a Central\n\nMinister might have helped the accused to reach Bangalore, various\n\nvideo   and    photographs   were    published   to   connect   several\n\nGovernment officials and prominent politicians and MPs including\n\nbut not limited.    It was also reported that although the National\n\nInvestigation Agency reportedly stated that they have strong\n\nsuspicion that gold smuggling is linked with international terror\n\nfunding. There is the possibility of an attempt to endanger the life\n\nof the accused. The reporters also went on to put live telecast of\n\nthe journey of the accused giving details of the path, many\n\npassengers and escort vehicles.           Therefore, according to the\n\npetitioner, such type of reporting even if to help anyone, it would be\n\nthe potential criminals and urges one to think as to what should be\n\nthe extreme limit of reporting by the media. It is also stated that\n\nthe media reported that Mr. M. Sivasankar, the former IT Secretary\n\nof the State Government who has been removed, from his post as\n\nChief Minister&#x27;s Principal Secretary, is the connection between\n\nSwapna Suresh and the Kerala Government and the said Mr\n\nSivasankar appointed Swpna Suresh as Operations Manager at the\n\nSpace Park after she left the UAE Consulate. Various other aspects\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                :8:</span>\n\n\nare also pointed out in the writ petition in respect of the news\n\npublished by the media houses connecting the Ministers of the State\n\nGovernment and others.          Therefore, the paramount contention\n\nadvanced by the petitioner is that it is crystal clear that the\n\npublishers are misusing the right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression guaranteed under the Constitution of India for political\n\nmileage,    and   trying   to   use   images      and   words   to    create\n\napprehension in the minds of the viewers about their political\n\nleaders or government servants.        Such maligned publications are\n\nrampant even in other cases where the accused is remotely\n\naffiliated with any political parties or celebrity. Other instances are\n\nalso pointed out by the petitioner in respect of an investigation\n\nconducted in respect of a child abuse and it is contended that the\n\nmedia houses fabricate news to ensure that the accused are\n\nmaligned brutally, and get them punished on the basis of the news\n\npublished irresponsibly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      4.   The petitioner also submits that without understanding the\n\ntrue implications of the news items published, even the children and\n\nstudents are made use of to respond to such fake news against the\n\nGovernment through social media.            Petitioner also points out that\n\nfalse news are reported in respect of Covid-19 patients, steps taken\n\nby the Government, death occurring thereunder etc.                   Various\n\ninstances in respect of rape cases and other criminal offences are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 :9:</span>\n\n\nalso pointed out by the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">      5.   In the backdrop, the grounds raised by the petitioner is\n\nthat because of the trial by Media, as the term refers to the role of\n\nmedia, acting as a Judge overriding the official &#x27;justice delivery\n\nsystem&#x27;,     thereby     distorting,     prejudicing,     sensationalising,\n\ninvestigating the public and ultimately derailing the &#x27;justice delivery\n\nprocesses&#x27;, and steam-rolling the right to fair trial of the accused.\n\nThat apart, it is stated that the Apex Court had even held that the\n\ntrial by press, electronic media or by way of a public agitation is the\n\nvery antithesis of the rule of law and can lead to a miscarriage of\n\njustice. The Law Commission of India, according to the petitioner,\n\ncategorizes 10 types of publications in the media as prejudicial to a\n\nsuspect or accused i.e., (1) publications concerning the character of\n\naccused or previous conclusions; (2) publication of confessions; (3)\n\npublications which comment or reflect upon the merits of the case;\n\n(4) photographs; (5) police activities (6) imputation of innocence\n\n(7) creating an atmosphere of prejudice (8) criticism of witnesses;\n\n(9) premature publication of evidence; (10) publication of interviews\n\nwith witnesses.    However, media in the cases          cited as examples\n\nabove has published almost the 10 prohibited items, and so far\n\nevaded from any stringent action against them.               It is further\n\nsubmitted that in the guise of freedom of speech and expression,\n\nmedia is publishing their prejudiced opinion to convey their political\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020            : 10 :</span>\n\n\nagenda and therefore, licence to politically affiliated media house\n\nmust be cancelled to bring sanity in the industry.          It is also\n\nsubmitted that in the guise of right to impart the truth through the\n\nmedia, which in turn is a fundamental right of the citizens of the\n\ncountry to know, false stories are propagated with the intention to\n\nprejudice to the minds of the people at large, in absolute violation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India.    It is also submitted that\n\nbecause of the careless attitude of reporting,           unimaginable\n\ndamages are caused to the reputation of the affected person, so as\n\nto suggest that those people are connected with an ongoing crime,\n\neven though their names are not appearing in the FIR, or no official\n\npress briefing done by the police or Government, is against the\n\nscheme of fundamental rights and the criminal jurisprudence of the\n\ncountry. The submission of the petitioner is that these are\n\nhappening, since there is no proper guidelines formed by the State\n\nof Kerala, Union of India and the Press Council of India, and unless\n\nand until directions are issued to form the guidelines, the freedom\n\nof speech will get abused time and again enabling the media, to\n\nconduct a trial even before filing of the FIR. Therefore, according\n\nto the petitioner, steps are to be taken to strike a balance between\n\nthe freedom of the press and the right of a victim to have a fair\n\ntrial, failing which it will seriously prejudice the matters pending\n\nbefore court and the victims thereunder, as is discussed above. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020            : 11 :</span>\n\n\npetitioner also contends that many of the media houses while\n\nmaking such false reports has the intention of creating political and\n\nreligious polarisation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      6.

P.\n\nNarayanan, and perused the pleadings and documents on record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      8. The sum and substance of the contentions put forth by the\n\npetitioner is that scathing attacks are made by the media by acting\n\nthemselves as Judges, overriding the official justice delivery system,\n\nand thereby interfering with the right to a fair trial of an accused in\n\ncriminal cases.     Contentions are put forth also to demonstrate that\n\naspersions are made in the print, as well as the visual media\n\nagainst the Chief Minister, Ministers, Opposition Leader and others\n\nwithout any basis and factual foundations. According to the\n\npetitioner, a trial by press, electronic media or   public agitation is\n\nthe very antithesis of the rule of law and can lead to a miscarriage\n\nof justice. Therefore, according to the petitioner, in the guise of the\n\nfreedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 19(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">(a) of the Constitution of India, media is publishing their prejudiced\n\nopinion with the intention of conveying their political agendas and\n\nmatters being so, the licence of the politically affiliated media\n\nhouses must be cancelled to bring sanctity in the industry. It is also\n\nsubmitted that by propagating false and scandalising news, the\n\nmedia is causing prejudice to the mind of the people at large which\n\nis absolutely in violation of the freedom of speech and expression\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 : 15 :</span>\n\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution, and the right of the\n\ncitizens to know the truth. The case of the petitioner, therefore, is\n\nthat the law prevailing in the country to deal with such situations is\n\nnot sufficient enough to tackle the irresponsible acts of the press\n\nand the print and visual media, and in that eventuality, this court\n\nshould step in, and form guidelines incorporating the restrictions, as\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India by its\n\nframers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">      9.    In fact, we are venturing to dispose of the writ petition,\n\nwhen it came up for admission itself, since we had the advantage of\n\nhearing the learned Special Government Pleader, who was ready\n\nwith the judgements rendered by the Apex Court also on the point,\n\nsetting a precedent. In so far as the issue raised by the petitioner is\n\nconcerned, the seminal question that emerges for consideration is\n\nwhether as is sought for by the petitioner, any guidelines can be\n\nframed by this Court in order to regulate and control the activities of\n\nthe press or rather the print and electronic media. It is unequivocal,\n\nand trite that under the Indian Constitution, media is not having any\n\nspecific   fundamental   right   for     their   freedom   of   speech   and\n\nexpression unlike the first amendment to the American Constitution\n\nwhere the press has absolute freedom of speech and expression.\n\nThe press in India is enjoying the freedom of speech and expression\n\nin terms of the fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020               : 16 :</span>\n\n\nof the Constitution of India to the citizens of the country.      <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_28\">Article\n\n19(1)(a)</a> specifies that all citizens shall have the right to freedom of\n\nspeech and expression, along with other valuable rights conferred\n\nthereunder.     But, fact remains, clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19</a> delineates\n\nclear restrictions while exercising the freedom guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India, which stipulates that\n\n&#x27;nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of\n\nany existing law, or prevent the State from making any law, in so\n\nfar as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of\n\nthe right conferred by the said sub-clause in the interests of the\n\nsovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly\n\nrelations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality, or in\n\nrelation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an\n\noffence.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">         10. On a reading of the above specified clause, it is clear that\n\nthe freedom of speech and expression guaranteed is almost\n\nabsolute but for the power enjoyed by the State from making any\n\nlaw so as to have reasonable restrictions in respect of the matters\n\nspecified thereunder. Apparently, by virtue of the powers conferred\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India, the laws are made\n\nby the State in order to protect the sovereignty and integrity of\n\nIndia,     the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign\n\nStates, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020             : 17 :</span>\n\n\nof court, defamation or incitement to an offence.      It is true, the\n\nfreedom     of   speech   and   expression   guaranteed   under   the\n\nConstitution of India is entitled to be enjoyed by all the citizens\n\nwhich includes, the journalists and the personnel attached to the\n\nmedia houses. The issue with the freedom of the press vis-a-vis the\n\nright guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nwas a subject matter for consideration of the constitutional courts\n\nunder different context right from the year 1950 and a plethora of\n\njudgements of the Apex Court as well as High Courts are available in\n\nthe law journals and reports.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_16\">11.   In order to dispose of the case at hand, we are of the\n\nview that it would be worthwhile to track down the judicial history of\n\nthe judgements rendered by the Apex Court, and some High Courts\n\nin the matter of    freedom of speech and expression in the Indian\n\ncontext to arrive at a logical and worthy conclusion.     First among\n\nthe cases that we have come across in that regard is the judgement\n\nof the Six Member Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_33\">Romesh\n\nThappar v.

The distinction between public order and public safety was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              : 18 :</span>\n\n\nconsidered and ultimately held that unless a law restricting the\n\nfreedom of speech and expression is directed solely against the\n\nundermining of the security of the State       or the over-throw of it,\n\nsuch law cannot fall within   the     reservation under   clause (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution, although        the restrictions   which\n\nseeks to impose may have         been        conceived generally in the\n\ninterests of public order. It was further held thereunder that clause\n\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution having allowed the imposition of\n\nrestrictions on the freedom of speech and expression only in cases\n\nwhere danger to the State is involved,and an enactment, which is\n\ncapable of being applied to cases where no such danger could arise,\n\ncannot be held to be constitutional and valid to any extent.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43023\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/43023/\" id=\"a_37\">Brij Bhusan and another v.

After considering the facts and circumstances\n\nand the law involved, the Six Member Constitution Bench of the\n\nApex Court has held that &quot;in construing the Act, we must try to get\n\nat its aim and purpose, and before the Act is declared to be invalid,\n\nwe must see whether it is capable of being so construed as to bear\n\na reasonable meaning consistent with its validity.

The freedom of speech and expression includes the\n\nfreedom of propagation of ideas and that freedom is ensured by the\n\nfreedom of circulation. It was also held that the imposition of pre-\n\ncensorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the Press as\n\nis held in Brijbhushan (supra) which is an essential part of the\n\nright to freedom of speech and expression declared by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">(a) of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      14.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_41\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. and others v.

Bearing the principle in mind, it would\n\nbe clear that the right to freedom of speech and expression carries\n\nwith it the right to publish and circulate one&#x27;s ideas, opinions and\n\nviews with complete freedom and by resorting to any available\n\nmeans of publication, subject again to such restrictions as could be\n\nlegitimately   imposed   under   clause    (2)   of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_44\">Article   19</a>   of   the\n\nConstitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_22\">In <a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_45\">Virendra v.

If it were\n         wholly free even from reasonable restraints it would lead to disorder\n         and anarchy. The freedom is not to be misunderstood as to be a\n         press free to disregard its duty to be responsible. In fact, the\n         element of responsibility must be present in the conscience of the\n         journalists. In an organised society, the rights of the press have to\n         be recognised with its duties and responsibilities towards the society.\n         Public order, decency, morality and such other things must be\n         safeguarded. The protective cover of press freedom must not be\n         thrown open for wrong doings. If a newspaper publishes what is\n         improper, mischievously false or illegal and abuses its liberty it must\n         be punished by court of law. The editor of a newspaper or a journal\n         has a greater responsibility to guard against untruthful news and\n         publications for the simple reason that his utterances have a far\n         greater circulation and impact than the utterances of an individual\n         and by reason of their appearing in print, they are likely to be\n         believed by the ignorant. That being so, certain restrictions are\n         essential even for preservation of the freedom of the press itself. To\n         quote from the report of Mons Lopez to the Economic and Social\n         Council of the United Nations &quot;If it is true that human progress is\n         impossible without freedom, then it is no less true that ordinary\n         human progress is impossible without a measure of regulation and\n         discipline&quot;. It is the duty of a true and responsible journalist to strive\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 : 25 :</span>\n\n\n         to inform the people with accurate and impartial presentation of\n         news and their views after dispassionate evaluation of the facts and\n         information received by them and to be published as a news item.\n         The presentation of the news should be truthful, objective and\n         comprehensive without any false and distorted expression.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                 11. In the present case, as we have noticed above, neither\n         the printer, publisher nor the editor and reporter took the necessary\n         care in evaluating the correctness and credibility of the information\n         published by them as the news items in the newspapers <a href=\"/doc/1292663/\" id=\"a_54\">referred to\n         above</a> in respect of an allegation of a very serious nature having\n         great repercussions causing an embarrassment to this Court. An\n         editor is a person who controls the selection of the matter which is\n         to be published in a particular issue of the newspaper. The editor\n         and publisher are liable for illegal and false matter which is published\n         in their newspaper. Such an irresponsible conduct and attitude on\n         the part of the editor, publisher and the reporter cannot be said to\n         be done in good faith, but distinctly opposed to the high professional\n         standards as even a slightest enquiry or a simple verification of the\n         alleged statement about grant of petrol outlets to the two sons of a\n         Senior Judge of the Supreme Court, out of discretionary quota,\n         which is found to be patently false would have revealed the truth.\n         But it appears that even the ordinary care was not resorted to by the\n         contemners in publishing such a false news items. This cannot be\n         regarded as a public service, but a disservice to the public by\n         misguiding them with a false news. Obviously, this cannot be\n         regarded as something done in good faith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">      20.    In Asharam Bapu v. Union of India and others\n\n[(2013) 10 SCC 37), the Apex Court was considering the question\n\nwhether any guidelines to be formed for the functioning of the\n\nmedia and after taking into account various judgements rendered by\n\nthe Apex Court, it was held that there is no need to entertain the\n\nwrit petition, in view of        various directions in the        judgements\n\nreferred there to, and expressed hope and trust that the media,\n\nboth print and electronic, would follow those guidelines.                  Even\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020               : 26 :</span>\n\n\nthough there are various other judgements with regard to the\n\nnature of freedom enjoyed by the press, we found the above\n\nreferred   ones    relevant   to   the   context.   On   analysing   the\n\nobservations and the findings rendered by the Apex Court in the\n\njudgements discussed above, it is clear that the press enjoys only\n\nthe freedom like any other citizens, in terms of the guarantee\n\nextended under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.        No\n\ndoubt, the press has got the liberty and the freedom for fair and\n\nhonest news reporting. However, it is discernible from the words of\n\nwisdom rendered by the Apex Court that freedom guaranteed to the\n\npress under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> cannot be misused and the press has\n\nthe duty to ensure that reports are made truly and fairly so as not\n\nto interfere with the freedom enjoyed by the citizens in any manner.\n\nWe are also conscious of the fact that the freedom guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> to anyone cannot overlook the guarantee of\n\nlife and liberty enjoyed by the citizens under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India which specifies that no person shall be\n\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the\n\nprocedure established by law. Definitely, the restrictions contained\n\nthereunder would make it clear that even the press is not at liberty\n\nto scuttle the    freedom of life and personal liberty of any citizen.\n\nHowever, the principles of law propounded by the Apex Court also\n\nwould show that the freedom enjoyed by the press as the fourth\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 : 27 :</span>\n\n\nestate   in the    governance     of    the     country    is    vital and      also\n\ndistinguished so as to protect the interests of public, and in the\n\nmatter of disseminating the news for the public good.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">      21.    Taking into account the intention of the constituent\n\nassembly    by    incorporating   <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_59\">Articles      19(1)(a)</a>        and   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">21</a>   to   the\n\nConstitution of India, it is clear that both will have to be enjoyed by\n\nthe citizens among themselves without interfering inter se with the\n\nrights guaranteed in the said provisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">      22.That     said , now       the further question crops up for\n\nconsideration is whether any guidelines can be framed by this Court\n\nas is sought for by the petitioner. As we have discussed above, the\n\nlaws made under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 19</a> makes reasonable\n\nrestrictions in respect of the freedom enjoyed by the press also\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution and according to us, the\n\nrestrictions contained under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 19</a> itself is a\n\nguideline, and it is imperative that even the press while making the\n\npublication should be concerned with the public order, decency or\n\nmorality because the restriction is imposed under clause (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India on the basis of the freedom of\n\nspeech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Which thus means equivalent to freedom, a\n\ncorresponding duty and obligation is cast upon the press to ensure\n\nrestraints so as not to violate the valuable and cherished rights and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020            : 28 :</span>\n\n\nfreedom , and privacy both public and private of the citizens.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      23. Looking at the contentions advanced by the petitioner, it\n\nis explicit that the petitioner was not personally affected by the\n\npublication of any news and there by not personally aggrieved,\n\nhowever the argument      put forth by the petitioner is that since the\n\nmedia is making irresponsible and scathing remarks against public\n\nmen and leaders ruling the state and the nation,          an intrinsic\n\nelement of grievance, in public interest is involved. Analysing the\n\nprinciples of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, and the significant\n\nmultifarious roles played by it, we are of the view that a\n\nconstitutional court would not be able to comprehend various\n\nsituations and form a guideline so as to restrict the media from\n\nenjoying its freedom conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.    Moreover, making a law is the absolute\n\ndomain of the parliament and the State legislatures in terms of the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution of India, and the framers of the\n\nconstitution intended and envisioned a clear demarcation of exercise\n\npower by the Legislature, executive and the judiciary, which is also\n\nlargely dependant on the successive policies formulated by the\n\nGovernment for its functioning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158887669\" id=\"span_35\">24.   The question with respect to the framing of guidelines\n\nand similar other issues were considered by a Five Member\n\nConstitution Bench of the      Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_68\">Sahara India Real\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              : 29 :</span>\n\n\nEstate Corporation Limited and others v.

However, the\n\nproposition of law <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_69\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court earlier and the law in\n\nvogue to take action against the press was taken into consideration\n\nand held that a prior restraint pre-empting the right to freedom of\n\nspeech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution of India\n\ncannot be done, except under exceptional circumstances and that\n\ntoo after considering the issues on a case to case basis. Paragraphs\n\n32 to 34 would be relevant to the context, which read thus:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        &quot;32.    Even apart from these statutory exceptions, publicity of\n       proceedings can be restricted &#x27;in the interests of justice&#x27;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1643138\" id=\"span_37\">In\n       <a href=\"/doc/1643138/\" id=\"a_70\">Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra</a>, the Supreme\n       Court held that the court has the inherent power under Section\n       151 of the Civil Procedure Code to order a trial to be held in\n       camera, but that this power must be exercised with great caution\n       and only where the court is satisfied beyond doubt that the ends\n       of justice would be defeated if the case were to be tried in open\n       court.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">             &quot;21. ... While emphasising the importance of public trial,\n        we cannot overlook the fact that the primary function of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020               : 30 :</span>\n\n\n        Judiciary is to do justice between the parties who bring their\n        causes before it. If a Judge trying a cause is satisfied that the\n        very purpose of finding truth in the case would be retarded, or\n        even defeated if witnesses are required to give evidence subject\n        to public gaze is it or is it not open to him in exercise of his\n        inherent power to hold the trial in camera either partly or fully?\n        If the primary function of the court is to do justice in causes\n        brought before it, then on principle, it is difficult to accede to the\n        proposition that there can be no exception to the rule that all\n        causes must be tried in open court. If the principle that all trials\n        before courts must be held in public was treated as inflexible and\n        universal, and it is held that it admits of no exceptions whatever,\n        cases may arise where by following the principle, justice itself\n        may be defeated. That is why we feel no hesitation in holding\n        that the High Court has inherent jurisdiction to hold a trial in\n        camera if the ends of justice clearly and necessarily require the\n        adoption of such a course. It is hardly necessary to emphasise\n        that this inherent power must be exercised with great caution and\n        it is only if the court is satisfied beyond a doubt that the ends of\n        justice themselves would be defeated if a case is tried in open\n        court that it can pass an order to hold the trial in camera, but to\n        deny the existence of such inherent power to the court would be\n        to ignore the primary object of adjudication itself. The principle\n        underlying the insistence on hearing causes in open court is to\n        protect and assist fair, impartial and objective administration of\n        justice; but if the requirement of justice itself sometimes dictates\n        the necessity of trying the case in camera, it cannot be said that\n        the said requirement should be sacrificed because of the\n        principle that every trial must be held in open court. In this\n        connection it is essential to remember that public trial of causes\n        is a means, though important and valuable, to ensure fair\n        administration of justice; it is a means, not an end. It is the fair\n        administration of justice which is the end of judicial process and\n        so, if ever a real conflict arises between fair administration of\n        justice itself on the one hand, and public trial on the other,\n        inevitably, public trial may have to be regulated or controlled in\n        the interest of administration of justice. That, in our opinion, is\n        the rational basis on which the conflict of this kind must be\n        harmoniously resolved.&quot;45\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">            33. While the principle laid down cannot be faulted, whether\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              : 31 :</span>\n\n\n         it ought to have been applied in the facts of that case is\n\n         questionable. The matter arose out of a sensational libel suit in\n\n         the Bombay High Court. One of the witnesses for the defence\n\n         who had made an affidavit of facts in different proceedings,\n\n         considered relevant for the libel suit, but did not adhere to them\n\n         in these proceedings, made a request that his evidence be\n\n         withheld from publication on the ground that publication of\n\n         reports of his earlier deposition had caused loss to his business.\n\n         The presiding Judge orally ordered that the witness&#x27;s deposition\n\n         should not be reported in newspapers. The petitioners\n\n         challenged the order on the ground, inter alia, that their rights\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> had been infringed and that the gag order\n\n         could not be justified on any ground under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(2).</a> The\n\n         petitioners contended that truthful reports of proceedings could\n\n         not be banned. The Supreme Court, by a majority of 8:1\n\n         dismissed the petition, applying the reasoning set out above.\n\n         Hidayatullah, J. the lone dissenting voice, thought it an\n\n         astounding proposition that a witness could seek protection\n\n         because his truthful statement would harm his own business.\n\n         The Judge held that Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020              : 32 :</span>\n\n\n         which reliance was placed, in spite of its very generous and\n\n         wide language could not be used to confer a discretion on the\n\n         court to turn its proceedings which should be open and public\n\n         into a private affair.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                 34. The majority went on to hold that such a judicial\n\n          decision in the interests of the administration of justice cannot\n\n          be held to be contrary to the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_73\">Article\n\n          19(1)(a).</a> Applying the direct effect test, the court came to the\n\n          conclusion that if, as an incidental consequence of the order,\n\n          the proceedings could not be reported, there could not be said\n\n          to be any constitutional infirmity in the order. It was further\n\n          held that the law empowering the court to prohibit publication\n\n          of proceedings was within the reasonable restrictions\n\n          contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 19(2)</a> which includes restrictions in\n\n          relation to contempt of court. An obstruction to the\n\n          administration of justice is tantamount to contempt of court\n\n          and therefore, prohibition of the publication intended to\n\n          prevent an obstruction to justice was within the scope of\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 19(2).&quot;</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158887669\" id=\"span_41\">After holding so, it was held by the Apex Court that in the light of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020             : 33 :</span>\n\n\nthe law discussed and enunciated in         <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_76\">Sahara</a> (supra), it was held\n\nthat, anyone, be he an accused or an aggrieved person who\n\ngenuinely apprehends on the basis of the the content of the\n\npublication and its effect an infringement of his/her rights under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 21</a> to a a fair trial and all that it comprehends, would be\n\nentitled to approach an appropriate writ court and seek an order of\n\npostponement       of    the   offending      publication/broadcast    or\n\npostponement of reporting of certain phases of the trial, including\n\nidentity of the victim or the witness or the complainant, and that the\n\ncourt may grant such preventive relief, on a balancing of the right to\n\na fair trial and <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> rights, bearing in mind the\n\nabovementioned principles of necessity and proportionality and\n\nkeeping in mind that such orders of postponement should be for\n\nshort duration and should be applied only in cases of real            and\n\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice\n\nor to the fairness of trial.

In this scenario, we feel that the observation made by the\n\nSupreme of Court of United States in the New York Times\n\nCompany v. L. B.

This is not to say that the Constitution protects defamatory\n       statements directed against the private conduct of a public official or private\n       citizen. Freedom of press and of speech insures that government will respond\n       to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by peaceful means.\n       Purely private defendant has little to do with the political ends of a self-\n       governing society. The imposition of liability for private defamation does not\n       abridge the freedom of public speech or any other freedom protected by the\n       First Amendment. [ In most cases, as in the case at bar, there will be little\n       difficulty in distinguishing defamatory speech relating to private conduct\n       from that relating to official conduct. I recognize, of course, that there will be\n       a gray area. The difficulties of applying a public-private standard are,\n       however, certainly, of a different genre from those attending the\n       differentiation between a malicious and nonmalicious state of mind. If the\n       constitutional standard is to be shaped by a concept of malice, the speaker\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                  : 36 :</span>\n\n\n       takes the risk not only that the jury will inaccurately determine his state of\n       mind but also that the injury will fail properly to apply the constitutional\n       standard set by the elusive concept of malice. See note 2, supra.] This, of\n       course, cannot be said &#x27;where public officials are concerned or where public\n       matters are involved. * * * (O)ne main function of the First Amendment is to\n       ensure ample opportunity for the people to determine and resolve public\n       issues.

The media, be it electronic or print media, is generally\n         called the fourth pillar of democracy. The media, in all its forms,\n         whether electronic or print, discharges a very onerous duty of\n         keeping the people knowledgeable and informed. The impact of\n         media is far-reaching as it reaches not only the people physically but\n         also influences them mentally. It creates opinions, broadcasts\n         different points of view, brings to the fore wrongs and lapses of the\n         Government and all other governing bodies and is an important tool\n         in restraining corruption and other ill-effects of society. The media\n         ensures that the individual actively participates in the decision-\n         making process. The right to information is fundamental in\n         encouraging the individual to be a part of the governing process.\n         The enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_106\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> is the most\n         empowering step in this direction.

That is why the press is\n\nalways addressed as the Fourth Estate.                If   the media is not\n\npermitted to undertake such an exercise, the citizens would find it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020                 : 40 :</span>\n\n\ndifficult to know and understand the activities undertaken by the\n\npublic men by virtue of the mandate given by the citizens which\n\nwould lead to total anarchy and prompt the administrators to\n\nindulge   themselves      in   unethical        and   irresponsible   activities,\n\nprejudicial to the interest of the public and thus causing adverse and\n\nnegative situations so as to interfere with the fair administration of\n\nthe justice envisioned by the framers of the Constitution.               In this\n\nregard, we are of the opinion that the finding rendered by the\n\nSupreme Court of United States in New York Time Company v.\n\nUnited States would be relevant. Paragraph 36 reads thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;36.

See T. Emerson, The System of Freedom of\n      Expression, c. V (1970); Z. Chafee, Free Speech in the United States,\n      c. XIII (1941). The present cases will, I think, go down in history as the\n      most dramatic illustration of that principle. A debate of large proportions\n      goes on in the Nation over our posture in Vietnam.

That apart, we are of the view that taking into\n\naccount the requisite provisions of law available under the Indian\n\nPenal Code and the Contempt of Courts Act, any person aggrieved is\n\nentitled to take necessary action so as to redress his grievances. So\n\nalso, the courts are vested with ample powers while conducting trial\n\nof any sensational cases or when privacy is required to be\n\nmaintained, to conduct in-camera proceedings and restrict the\n\nmedia from reporting any sensational news or any news so as to\n\nmaterially interfere with the privacy of a citizen. Moreover, we are\n\nsatisfied that the <a href=\"/doc/143018423/\" id=\"a_108\">Press Council Act, 1978</a> clearly prescribes a\n\nmethodology to redress the grievances of any aggrieved person.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/57989479/\" id=\"a_109\">Initially, the Press Council Act, 1965</a> was passed to establish a Press\n\nCouncil and       Press Council of India was established in July, 1966.\n\nHowever, during emergency, the Press Council of India was\n\ndissolved with effect from 1st January, 1976 and thereupon the <a href=\"/doc/57989479/\" id=\"a_110\">Press\n\nCouncil Act, 1965</a> was repealed by the <a href=\"/doc/143018423/\" id=\"a_111\">Press Council (Repeal) Act,\n\n1976</a> with effect from 1 st January, 1976.

Moreover, a Judge\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\"> W.P.(C) No. 16349/2020             : 46 :</span>\n\n\nadjudicating any lis before it would be depending solely on the\n\nmaterials available on record, and definitely would not be guided by\n\na press report unless the report itself is a material for consideration\n\nin the lis. We are also of the view that the petitioner is never an\n\naggrieved person and no relief can be granted especially in view of\n\nthe fact that the petitioner has not produced any materials to\n\nsubstantiate the pleadings. Thinking so, it is quite vivid and clear\n\nthat the issue raised by the petitioner is set at naught by the Apex\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/158887669/\" id=\"a_118\">Sahara</a> (supra) by holding that general framing of\n\nguidelines for regulating the press is not possible. Therefore, it is a\n\nlaw declared under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of India having\n\nbinding force thoughout India and therefore, binding on this Court\n\nalso.</span>    Before we part with the judgement, it is relevant to mention\n\nthe observations made by the High Court of Judicature, Madras in\n\nM.R. Saravanan (supra) that under self regulation the media\n\nvoluntarily commits to uphold a code of ethics that it, itself drafts,\n\nthus providing a mechanism to which the public can complaint about\n\nperceived breaches of the court and an independent council\n\nadjudicating on the complaints and decides upon appropriate\n\nremedies in order to secure the credibility of its profession and the\n\ntrust of the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">        The upshot of the above discussion is,       petitioner is not\n\nentitled to get any reliefs as is sought for in this writ petition.
