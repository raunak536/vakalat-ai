Tiwari, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri\nSudhir Mehrotra A.G.A. on behalf of the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">      The prayer in the instant writ petition is for a writ of certiorari to\nquash History Sheet No. 60-A declaring the petitioner as History sheeter\ndated 12.10.2007 and the order dated 24.5.2008 passed by respondent no.\n2, Senior Superintendent of Police, Saharanpur rejecting petitioner&#x27;s\nrepresentation against opening of history sheet.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">      The facts giving rise to the dispute are that an F.I.R. was lodged\nagainst the petitioner alleging that mining work was carried out in\ncontravention of provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_1\">Mines and Minerals (Regulation and\nDevelopment) Act, 1957</a> (hereinafter referred to as the Act) as well as U.P.\nMinor Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1963. The petitioner was alleged to\nhave indulged in illegal mining of 5,000 cubic meters in mining area\nknown as Yamuna River Dikka Kala, Tehsil Nakud and Tehsil Sadar,\nDistrict Saharanpur. Similar allegations were levelled in the three F.I.Rs.\nregistered at case crime Nos. 177 of 2007 dated 26.5.2007, 176 of 2007\ndated 27.5.2007 and 139 of 2007 dated 28.5.2007. The three reports are\nannexed with the writ petition as Annexures 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The\npetitioner moved an application before the Secretary Mines and Minerals\nU.P. Government, Lucknow after he came to know about the F.I.Rs.\nlodged against him along with others. On the basis of said application, an\ninquiry was conducted constituting an inquiry committee of three\nmembers. Annexure-5 to the writ petition is a letter dated 19.10.2007 along\nwith report of inquiry committee wherein the Director, Geology Mining\nU.P., Lucknow stated that the petitioner and others were not found\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                           2</span>\n\ninvolved in theft or illegal mining. It appears that there were other\ncomplaints as well regarding illegal mining and the Station House Officer,\nPolice Station Kotwali Nagar, Saharanpur issued a circular on 15.9.2007\npursuant to an order dated 12.8.2007 of the Inspector General of Police and\nAdditional Director General of Police, State of U.P. to all the Senior\nSuperintendent of Police/Superintendent of Police calling for a report of\nhistory sheet in a computerized C.D. excluding name of such persons in\nrespect of whom a false history sheet has been opened pertaining to minor\noffence. This Circular is Annexure-6 to the writ petition. However, the\nStation House Officer respondent no. 3 submitted a report against the\npetitioner and his brother Dr. Naveen Karnwal and consequent thereon,\nHistory sheet No. 60-A was opened. Representations were given by the\npetitioner and his brother.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      Sri K.D. Tiwari has specifically brought to our notice that only cases\non the basis of which History sheet has been opened, are the F.I.R. under\n<a href=\"/doc/103826425/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 3</a>/<a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_3\">57</a>/<a href=\"/doc/191009828/\" id=\"a_4\">21</a> of the Act. Grievance of the petitioner is that proceedings\nhave been initiated at the instance of rival competitors who were also\ninvolved in mining work and in collusion with the concerned authorities.\nBesides, opening of History sheet using term &#x27;Mafia&#x27; for the petitioner is a\nblatant misuse of the powers by the police authorities. The petitioner had\napproached this Court and challenged the History Sheet No. 60-A in a Writ\nPetition No. 21086 of 2007-Sanjay Karnwal Vs. State of U.P. and others.\nThe ground of challenge was that offences mentioned in Regulation 228(1)\nof the Police Regulations do not include the offence alleged to have been\ncommitted by the petitioner. The writ petition was disposed of with a\ndirection to the concerned officer to decide the representation within two\nmonths from the date on which certified copy of the order along with self\nattested copy of the writ petition is presented. Pursuant to the aforesaid\ndirection, the petitioner had moved a representation before the Senior\nSuperintendent of Police, Saharanpur and the same was rejected on\n24.5.2008. A copy of the order is annexed as Annexure-10 to the writ\npetition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      Sri K.D. Tiwari has brought to our notice Annexure-5, which is a\nletter issued by Director Bhutatva Evam Khanikarm, Uttar Pradesh to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                              3</span>\n\nSpecial Secretary State of U.P. Audyogik Vikas Anubhag-5, Lucknow\ndated 18.10.2007. This letter was sent along with a report submitted by\nMining Department after making a detailed enquiry. Emphasis is that a\nbare perusal of the report, makes it evident that the petitioner was\ncompletely exonerated from the charges. There was no mining theft\nwhatsoever and witnesses mentioned in the F.I.R. stated before the inquiry\ncommittee that they had given statement before the police only on the basis\nof rumours spread in the area but they have no personal knowledge and\ninquiry committee also did not find violation of any of the provisions of\nthe said Act as well as U.P. Minor Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1963.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">      A.G.A. has countered the arguments of Sri K.D. Tiwari and tried to\nhighlight that the petitioner is a Mafia and has misappropriated the\ngovernment properties in the garb of mining and contravened specific\ndirections provided under the Act and Rules framed under the Act and,\ntherefore, he is not liable to carry out mining work. It is also stated that on\naccount of History sheet, licence of the petitioner has been suspended and\nin the event, History sheet is quashed, he will again indulge in the activities\nwhich is detrimental to the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      We have heard learned counsels and gone through writ petition,\nsupplementary affidavit, counter affidavit, supplementary counter affidavit\nand rejoinder affidavit. Opening of history sheet by the police is provided\nin Police Regulations 228. Opening of history sheets are intended to\nmaintain personal records of criminals under surveillance and is liable to\nbe opened only in respect of such persons who are or likely to become\nhabitual criminal or abettors of such crime. There are two classes of history\nsheets.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">   (1) Class A history-sheets for dacoits, burglars, cattle-thieves, railway\n      goods wagon thieves, and abettors thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">   (2) Class B history-sheets for confirmed and professional criminals\n      who commit crimes other than dacoity, burglary, cattle-theft, and\n      theft from railway goods wagons, e.g., professional cheats and other\n      experts for whom criminal personal files are maintained by the\n      Criminal Investigation Department, poisoners, cattle poisoners,\n      railway passenger thieves, bicycle thieves, expert pick-pockets,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                              4</span>\n\n      forgers, coiners, cocaine and opium smugglers, hired ruffians and\n      goondas, telegraph wire-cutters, habitual illicit distillers and abettors\n      thereof.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">      Thus it is evident that jurisdiction to open a history-sheet of an\nindividual arises only at a stage when a particular person is considered or\nthought to be a confirmed or professional criminal for which there has to\nbe some basis for such an opinion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      In the instant case, the basis for opening history-sheet is the three\nF.I.Rs. alone. Before we proceed to examine that whether history-sheet\nopened in respect of the petitioner could be quashed or not, we have to\nexamine certain provisions of the Act and Rules framed under the Act.\nPenalties are provided under <a href=\"/doc/191009828/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 21</a> of the Act but <a href=\"/doc/88384686/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 22</a> of the\nsaid Act states that no court shall take cognizance of any offence\npunishable under this Act or any rules made thereunder except upon\ncomplaint in writing made by a person authorized in this behalf by the\nCentral Government or State Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">      Similarly Rule 74 of U.P. Minor Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1963\nprohibits any court to take cognizance of an offence punishable under the\nrules except on a complaint in writing of the facts constituting such\noffences by the District Officer or by any officer authorized by him in this\nbehalf.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">      In the circumstances, we fail to understand that how the F.I.Rs. were\nregistered at different case crime numbers at the first place as well as\nlearned A.G.A. has not been able to apprise us if any other offence has\nbeen registered against the petitioner which resulted in opening of the\nhistory-sheet. It is also admitted by counsel appearing on behalf of\nrespondents that no offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Penal Code</a> is alleged so far\nagainst the petitioner. The three reports are in quick succession in the year\n2007. Admittedly, there is not a single offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">Indian Penal Code</a>\npending against the petitioner in which the petitioner was ever involved\nand, therefore, the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner has\nsubstance that he has been deprived of only source of livelihood whereby\nfundamental rights have been eroded in a highhanded manner which could\nnot be done.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                             5</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_5\">We have looked into a catena of decisions by this Court as well as\nApex Court where encroachment by police on the privacy of an individual\nmaking &#x27;domiciliary visits&#x27; was depreciated but in the case of <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_9\">Kharak\nSingh Vs. State of U.P.</a>, AIR 1963 SC, 1295, majority judgment held that\n<a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> is not infringed by a watch being kept over the movements\nof the suspect and, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> has no relevance in that context.\nMajority judgment ruled that right of privacy is not a guaranteed right\nunder the Constitution, and therefore, surveillance by the police will not\namount to infringement of any fundamental right.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_6\">The Apex Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_12\">Govind Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, AIR 1975 SC, 1378 observed\nthat a person subjected to surveillance, the object and limitation of such\nsurveillance depends upon character and antecedents of the person\nconcerned. The Police Regulation has force of law and, therefore, it can\nnot be said to be infringement of fundamental right. Nevertheless <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution is a right of an individual to be free from restriction\nor encroachment directly imposed or indirectly approached by calculated\nmeasures.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_7\">Thus, we have to examine each and every case on the basis of facts\nand circumstances. We are of the considered view that Regulation 228 and\n240 does not give an unbridled, uncanalised power to the police to use it in\nsuch a way which has necessary consequence of squeezing out the\nfundamental freedom of the citizen. A note of caution was given in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_14\">Malak Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Haryana</a>, AIR 1981 SC, 760.\nThus evidently the police does not possess a licence to enter the names of\nwhoever they like or dislike in the surveillance register. Ordinarily the\nnames of persons with previous criminal record alone are entered in the\nsurveillance register. They must be proclaimed offenders, previous\nconvicts, or persons who have already been placed on security for good\nbehaviour. In addition, names of persons who are reasonably believed to be\nhabitual offenders or receivers of stolen property whether they have been\nconvicted or not, can be categorized and entered in the surveillance register\nunder the Police Regulation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">      The facts and circumstances detailed in the writ petition, counter and\nrejoinder affidavits as well as the specific denial by learned A.G.A. that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                              6</span>\n\nsave for three F.I.Rs. in quick succession, no other offence is alleged\nagainst the petitioner under any criminal Act whatsoever. This is sufficient\nfor us to arrive at a conclusion that the petitioner can not be bracketed as\nconfirmed or professional criminal or habitual offender. Only allegation\nagainst him is that he indulged in some wrongful mining work which again\nstands nullified by report of Geologist annexed along with letter of the\nDirector on behalf of the petitioner. Besides the conviction or prosecution\nof the petitioner can not proceed on the basis of F.I.R. or charge sheet.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">         We have also noticed that the representation pursuant to a direction\nof this Court has very casually been rejected by the Senior Superintendent\nof Police, Saharanpur stating therein that the provisions in Police\nRegulation 228 and 240 authorises police to open a history sheet.\nHowever, we have noticed that there is nothing to substantiate that the\npetitioner is involved in the nature of offence envisaged by Regulation 228\n(A) &amp; B of Police Regulation, there is not even a suspicion by any of the\nauthorities. Admittedly, petitioner has no criminal antecedent and,\ntherefore, rejection of the representation as well as opening of the history\nsheet without even looking into requirement of Regulation 228 and 240 of\nthe U.P. Police Regulation, the order dated 24.5.2008 can not be left to\nstand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">         A close perusal of the order of the Senior Superintendent of Police,\nSaharanpur, it transpires that while rejecting representation of the\npetitioner and justifying opening of the history sheet, he has referred Police\nRegulation 228 (1) as well as Police Regulation 240 which are enabling\nprovisions for opening history sheet of a person. We are conscious of the\nPolice Regulations but the said provisions provide that history sheet can be\nopened only against such persons who are dacoits, burglars, cattle thieves,\nrailway goods wagon thieves and abettors of such offence as well as\ncertain other offences classified in Police Regulation 228 (2). Regulation\n240 enables the Police to open a history sheet also on the basis of suspicion\nor on conviction or acquittal. In the instant case, the only offence alleged is\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_15\">Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957</a>,\nwhich is once again only three instances pertaining to the year 2007 which\nwas found to be baseless by inquiry committee and Director, Mines and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                             7</span>\n\nMinerals had accordingly informed the Special Secretary. There is no other\noffence mentioned whatsoever till date even after lapse of almost three\nyears. Admittedly the F.I.R. is the only basis which is beyond the scope of\nthe Act, since only a complaint by the competent authority can be\nregistered and on its basis cognizance of an offence under the Act can be\ntaken, therefore, we are of the opinion that the impugned order as well as\nhistory sheet opened against the petitioner is without any basis, without\nany satisfaction of the concerned authority and amounts to violation of a\nvaluable right of the petitioner besides being only a highhanded act on the\npart of the respondents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">       We are satisfied that there was no sufficient ground to entertain a\nreasonable belief that surveillance was required in the case of the\npetitioner. There exists no evidence to support the act of opening of the\nhistory sheet No. 60-A of the petitioner at Police Station Kotwali Nagar,\nDistrict Saharanpur and, therefore, it deserves to be quashed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">       In the result, the writ petition, is allowed. The order dated 24.5.2008\npassed by respondent no. 2, Senior Superintendent of Police, Saharanpur is\nquashed. The respondents are directed to close the present history sheet\nNo. 60-A of the petitioner and not to keep surveillance on the petitioner, in\npursuance of the said history sheet.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">Dt/- 9.7.2010.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">Rmk.\n</p> ","numcites":10,"numcitedby":3,"docsource":"Allahabad High Court","citetid":601938,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"history sheets opening","formInput":"history%20sheets%20opening"},{"value":"up police regulation","formInput":"up%20police%20regulation"},{"value":"ILLEGAL MINING ","formInput":"ILLEGAL%20MINING%20"},{"value":"theft","formInput":"theft"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"saharanpur","formInput":"saharanpur"},{"value":"abettor","formInput":"abettor"},{"value":"police regulations","formInput":"police%20regulations"},{"value":"minor minerals","formInput":"minor%20minerals"},{"value":"mineral concession rules","formInput":"mineral%20concession%20rules"},{"value":"history","formInput":"history"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
