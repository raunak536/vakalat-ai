The respondent no.1 and the appellant no.1 were married in New\n\nYork, United States of America (for short “USA”) on 13 th January 2011. The\n\nchild was born in USA on 21st January 2016. Thus, the child is a citizen of\n\nUSA by birth and is holding a USA passport. Unfortunately, the child was\n\ndiagnosed with hydronephrosis which required surgery. It is the case of the\n\nrespondent no.1 that as they were not in a position to secure an\n\nappointment of a doctor in USA for surgery, it was agreed between the\n\nappellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 that the child will undergo surgery\n\nat Max Hospital, Saket.    As the child is a citizen of USA, consent for\n\ninternational travel with one legal guardian was executed by and between\n\nthe appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 on 4 th February 2019. The\n\nconsent was recorded in the said document to enable the child to travel with\n\nthe mother – the appellant no.1 to India. The consent was executed for the\n\nperiod between 5th February 2019 to 26th September 2019. The consent\n\ndocument recorded that the child will be leaving USA on 5 th February 2019\n\nand will be returning back to USA on 26 th September 2019. It was further\n\nrecorded that any changes to this plan shall be discussed and consented to\n\nby both the parents. A certificate dated 17 th September 2019 issued by Dr.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                      3</span>\n\n\nAnurag Krishna, Director, Paediatrics and Paediatric Surgery of Max\n\nHospital, Saket, New Delhi records that the child underwent a surgery on\n\n14th March 2019.    It records that he had examined the child on 12 th July\n\n2019 when he found that the child was doing well. Dr. Anurag Krishna has\n\nrecorded that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months post-surgery\n\nalong with a fresh ultrasound and renal scan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.   It is the case of the respondent no.1 that at the time of surgery, he\n\nflew down to India. After the surgery, he returned to USA for his work. It is\n\nbrought on record that the respondent no.1 has a status of permanent\n\nresident in USA which is valid up to 16 th August 2031. According to the\n\ncase of the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1 violated the international\n\ntravel consent by not allowing the minor child to come back to USA by 26 th\n\nSeptember 2019. According to the respondent no.1, the appellant no.1\n\ndetained the minor in her illegal custody in India. Therefore, the respondent\n\nno.1 filed a petition on 30th January 2020 before the Circuit Court of Benton\n\nCounty, Arkansas, USA, which according to the respondent no.1 is the\n\nCourt of competent jurisdiction. The petition was filed for seeking primary\n\ncare, control, and custody of the minor on account of his wrongful detention\n\noutside USA. On 3rd February 2020, the Circuit Court passed an interim\n\norder granting primary care, custody, and control of the minor child to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                      4</span>\n\n\nrespondent no.1 and directed the appellant no.1 to return the child to the\n\nrespondent no.1. In the petition for habeas corpus filed by the respondent\n\nno.1 in the High Court, he has stated that though a copy of the said order of\n\nthe Circuit Court was forwarded to the appellant no.1 by email, she\n\ncontinues to detain the minor child in India.    In the circumstances, the\n\nrespondent no.1 filed a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the High\n\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana and prayed for a direction to the State of\n\nHaryana to secure the release of the minor child from the illegal custody of\n\nthe present appellants. The appellant nos.2 and 3 are the parents of the\n\nappellant no.1 who are residents of Gurgaon in Haryana. At present, the\n\nappellant no.1 is staying with them. Various interim orders were passed in\n\nthe said petition from time to time. The High Court appointed a learned\n\ncounsel as amicus curiae, who interacted with the appellant no.1 as well as\n\nthe respondent no.1 on phone/WhatsApp calls with a view to ascertain their\n\nrespective stands. He also submitted a report. By the impugned Judgment\n\nand order, the writ petition filed by the respondent no.1 was allowed. In\n\nparagraph 55, the High Court issued following directions: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “(i) respondent No.2 is directed to return to USA\n           along with minor child on or before 30.09.2021;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           (ii) in case respondent No.2 opts to return to USA,\n           the petitioner shall bear the travel and incidental\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                            5</span>\n\n\nexpenses of respondent No.2 and the minor child\nfor return to and also the expenses for their stay\nin USA till decision of the custody petition and the\npetitioner shall not initiate any criminal/contempt\nproceedings against respondent No.2 for inter\ncountry removal of the minor child;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(iii) if respondent No.2 fails to comply with\naforesaid direction, respondent No.2 shall hand\nover custody of the minor child and his passport\nto the petitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other\ndate as may be agreed to by the petitioner;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(iv) in case respondent No.2 fails to hand over\ncustody of the minor child and her passport to the\npetitioner on 01.10.2021 or on such other date as\nmay be agreed to by the petitioner, respondent\nNo.1 shall take over the custody and passport of\nthe minor child from respondent No.2 and hand\nover custody and passport of the minor child to\nthe petitioner on such date as may be agreed to\nby the petitioner;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(v) on custody of the minor child and his passport\nbeing handed over to the petitioner, the petitioner\nshall be entitled to take the minor child to USA;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(vi) in case passport of the minor child is not\nhanded over to the petitioner or respondent No.1\nby respondent No.2 on the ground of loss/damage\netc., the petitioner shall be entitled to get the\nduplicate passport issued from the concerned\nauthority; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(vii) on such return of the minor child to USA,\neither of the parties shall be at liberty to revive the\nproceedings before US Court for appropriate\norders regarding appointment of guardian and\ngrant of custody of the minor child.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                         6</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144083733\" id=\"span_11\">4.

As can be seen from the\n\norder dated 24th November 2021, this Court made an attempt to ascertain\n\nwhether an amicable solution could be found to the dispute. Both sides\n\nwere directed to submit their suggestions for the amicable resolution of the\n\ndispute. However, an amicable resolution of the dispute was not possible.\n\n\n\nSUBMISSIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANTS\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">6.   The learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that even\n\nafter surgery, the child needs constant medical care. She submitted that\n\nany lapses could be extremely fatal for the life of the minor. She submitted\n\nthat the doctor who operated upon the child has advised a very strict care\n\nregime for the child. She pointed out that constant monitoring of his health\n\nis required.   Even the water intake of the child has to be carefully\n\nmonitored. She pointed out that even the appellant no.3, the grandmother\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                        8</span>\n\n\nof the child is taking care of the minor child and there is a family support\n\navailable as she is residing with her parents.         She pointed out that a\n\ndetailed affidavit has been filed by the appellant no.1 indicating reasons\n\nwhy in the interest of the child he should be in India till he is 9-10 years old.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">7.    Relying upon the material on record, she submitted that even the\n\nrespondent no.1 constantly wished to settle down in India and therefore, he\n\npurchased more and more land in India and especially in Bangalore. The\n\nlearned counsel pointed out that it was the respondent no.1 who himself\n\nselected a pre-school for the child while he was in India in April, 2019. She\n\nsubmitted that the respondent no.1 since the time he got married to the\n\nappellant no.1 made plans to move back to India permanently and was\n\nplanning to construct a farm house and a residential house in Bangalore.\n\nShe submitted that it was the desire of the respondent no.1 that the\n\nappellant no.1 should work in India. Accordingly, property was bought in\n\nBangalore where the mother of the respondent no.1 resides. The learned\n\ncounsel pointed out that after emails dated 25 th December 2019 and 14th\n\nJanuary 2020 were forwarded by the appellant no.1 to return the money to\n\nthe appellant no.2 taken from him for land purchase in Bangalore, the\n\naforesaid petition was filed by the respondent no.1 in the Court at Arkansas\n\nin USA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                      9</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53310178\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"271434\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"768055\" id=\"span_18\">8.     In the written submissions of the appellants, there are various factors\n\npointed out, such as the temperamental nature of the respondent no.1 and\n\nthe conduct of the respondent no.1. The learned counsel submitted that\n\nthis Court has held that principles of autonomy must inure in the individual\n\nagainst non-state persons as well. She submitted that in custody cases, a\n\nwoman cannot be completely eliminated in the name of the welfare of the\n\nchild. She urged that the woman cannot be deprived of her rights. She\n\nsubmitted that in any case, the appellant no.1 is the primary/sole caretaker\n\nof the child. Relying upon the decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/768055/\" id=\"a_3\">Smt. Surinder\n\nKaur Sandhu v. Harbax Singh Sandhu and Another2</a>, <a href=\"/doc/271434/\" id=\"a_4\">Elizabeth\n\nDinshaw (Mrs.) v. Arvand M. Dinshaw and Another</a> 3 and <a href=\"/doc/53310178/\" id=\"a_5\">Nithya Anand\n\nRaghavan v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another4</a>, the learned counsel\n\nsubmitted that there is a statutory presumption in favour of the appellant\n\nno.1 under the doctrine of tender years. She submitted that this doctrine\n\nhas been upheld in the aforesaid three cases and this Court asserted\n\nmaternal preference as found under <a href=\"/doc/39958047/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 6</a> of the Hindu Minority and\n\nGuardianship Act, 1956 (the Act of 1956). She submitted that the appellant\n\n\n\n\n2 (1984) 3 SCC 698\n3 (1987) 1 SCC 42\n4 (2017) 8 SCC 454\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                       10</span>\n\n\nno.1 is the primary caregiver and therefore, it is in the child’s best interest to\n\nretain the custody with the appellant no.1.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.    The learned counsel submitted that to compel the appellant no.1 who\n\nis the primary caregiver to return to USA under the rule of “best interest of\n\nchild” will amount to an invasion of her fundamental right of autonomy which\n\nis a part of the right of privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. By adopting a summary procedure, such invasion on\n\nthe rights of the appellant no.1 cannot be made. She submitted that the\n\nwelfare of the child will mean balancing the interests of all in the family of\n\nthe child. The mother being the primary caregiver must be kept in mind by\n\nthe Court and her legal rights must be respected and protected by the\n\nCourt.   She submitted that the appellant no.1 is a fit mother and, in\n\npatriarchy, some special care is needed to counter the dominant presence\n\nof the father of the child. The learned counsel extensively relied upon an\n\nArticle by Mr.John Ekelaar under the title “Beyond the welfare principle”.\n\nShe submitted that the best interest of the child is the primary principle\n\nwhich also means the welfare of each member of the family of the child.\n\nShe submitted that the matter in patriarchy becomes also a matter of\n\ngender rights which is a constitutional issue covered under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 14</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution of India.       She submitted that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                      11</span>\n\n\nconstitutional provisions recognize that women form a separate category\n\nwho need to be enabled by the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"69261674\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_22\">10.    She submitted that the citizenship of a child has nothing to do with the\n\nwelfare principle.   A child may be a citizen of any country, but if the\n\ncompetent Court finds that it is in the best interest of the child that he is\n\nbrought up in India, the child should be permitted to stay in India. The\n\nlearned counsel invited our attention to a decision of this Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_10\">Kanika Goel v. the State of Delhi</a> through Station House Officer and\n\nanother5 as well as a decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/69261674/\" id=\"a_11\">Prateek Gupta v. Shilpi\n\nGupta</a> and others6. She submitted that in these two cases, though the\n\nchild was a foreign citizen, it was found to be in the best interest that the\n\nchild remains in India to continue with the prime caregiver. Her submission\n\nis that in this case, the child can continue to be an American citizen and\n\nstay in India on the basis of an OCI card. She submitted that eventually,\n\nthe child can make his own choice at the age of 18.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53310178\" id=\"span_24\">11.

She submitted that the learned Judge of the High Court cannot\n\ndecide the case based on his subjective personal opinion. She submitted\n\nthat it is necessary that clear and consistent law be followed even in the\n\ncustody matters and judicial discretion is not used to subvert the evolving\n\nlaw.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53310178\" id=\"span_27\">12.

The learned counsel appearing for the respondent no.1 pointed out\n\nthat the appellant no.1 has spent more than nine years in USA.

He\n\ninvited our attention to the consent executed by the appellant no.1 and the\n\nrespondent no.1 for permitting the child to travel to India between 5 th\n\nFebruary 2019 to 26th September, 2019. He submitted that in the light of\n\nthe increase in cases of international parental child abduction from the\n\nUSA, the Immigration Authorities in USA do not allow a minor US citizen to\n\nleave the country only with one parent without the express consent of the\n\nnon-travelling parent. He submitted that after the consent document was\n\nexecuted, no changes therein were even discussed between the parties.\n\nHe submitted that documents on record will show that in terms of the\n\ninternational travel consent form, return tickets of 26 th September, 2019\n\nwere also booked. He submitted that in violation of the international travel\n\nconsent, the appellant no.1 has not sent back the minor son to USA, which\n\namounts to the detention of the minor in her illegal custody in India.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                     16</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">19.

The learned counsel submitted that in terms of the interim order dated\n\n10th June 2020 of the High Court, the respondent no.1 has been interacting\n\nregularly with his minor son through video conference and there is a very\n\nhealthy and deep father and son relationship between them. He stated that\n\nhe has taken legal advice from a firm specialising in immigration law in\n\nUSA. He submitted that the respondent no.1 received advice from the said\n\nfirm that to enable the appellant no.1 and the child to travel to USA, the\n\nquickest as well as legally and practically most viable way to get a visa was\n\nto get a B-2 non-immigrant visa.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"144083733\" id=\"span_41\">21.   He pointed out that in the visa invitation letter, the respondent no.1\n\nhas clarified that he will take care of tour expenses of the appellant no.1,\n\nincluding the round trip, airfare, food, housing, medical insurance in USA.\n\nThe learned counsel submitted that the order of the High Court is a very\n\nbalanced order which is consistent with the law <a href=\"/doc/144083733/\" id=\"a_27\">laid down by</a> this Court in\n\nthe cases of Lahiri (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/144083733/\" id=\"a_28\">Yashita</a> (supra).

We have given a careful consideration to the submissions.          The\n\nappellant no.1 and the respondent no.1 got married on 13 th January 2011 in\n\nNew York in USA. The minor son was born on 21 st January 2016 and is\n\nadmittedly a citizen of USA.

Admittedly, the period of travel\n\nmentioned in the consent was not extended by the respondent no.1. The\n\nminor son underwent surgery at the hands of Dr. Anurag Krishna on 14 th\n\nMarch 2019.      The certificate dated 17th September 2019 issued by\n\nDr.Anurag Krishna records that he examined the minor on 12 th July, 2019\n\nand he found that the child was doing well.         He has recorded in the\n\ncertificate that the child needs to be reviewed 6 to 7 months after the\n\nsurgery along with fresh ultrasound and renal scan. Thus, the surgery has\n\ntaken place 33 months back. The appellant has not placed on record any\n\nmedical certificate or opinion of Dr.Anurag Krishna on the present health\n\ncondition of the child. The appellants have not placed on record any\n\nmedical certificate of the treating doctor recording that the child needs any\n\nfurther treatment or medical care in India. The respondent no.1 consented\n\nfor the child travelling to India and remaining in India till 26 th September\n\n2019. The reason for the grant of consent was to enable the minor to\n\nundergo surgery in New Delhi. We will have to proceed on the footing that\n\nthere is no documentary evidence available on record to show that the\n\npresence of the child in India for further medical treatment is necessary.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">24.

Firstly, we will deal with the legal submissions made by the learned\n\nCounsel for the appellants. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants\n\nhas placed heavy reliance on the decisions of this Court in the cases of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_29\">Kanika</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/53310178/\" id=\"a_30\">Nithya</a> (supra) which are rendered by Benches of three\n\nJudges of this Court. With some emphasis, the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellants had submitted that there is a need to make a departure\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                      21</span>\n\n\nfrom the rule of “best interest of the child” or the “welfare principle”.   Her\n\ncontention is that welfare would mean balancing the interests of all the\n\nmembers of the child’s family. She contended that the mother as the\n\nprimary caregiver must be kept in mind as a person who has legal rights\n\nwhich must be respected and protected.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_49\">The learned counsel relied upon\n\na decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_31\">K.S.

As expounded in the recent decisions of this\n             Court, the issue ought not to be decided on the basis\n             of rights of the parties claiming custody of the minor\n             child but the focus should constantly remain on\n8 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                     22</span>\n\n\n           whether the factum of best interest of the minor child is\n           to return to the native country or otherwise. The fact\n           that the minor child will have better prospects upon\n           return to his/her native country, may be a relevant\n           aspect in a substantive proceeding for grant of custody\n           of the minor child but not decisive to examine the\n           threshold issues in a habeas corpus petition. For the\n           purpose of habeas corpus petition, the Court ought to\n           focus on the obtaining circumstances of the minor\n           child having been removed from the native country\n           and taken to a place to encounter alien environment,\n           language, custom, etc. interfering with his/her overall\n           growth and grooming and whether continuance there\n           will be harmful.

The learned counsel appearing for the appellant heavily relied upon\n\nan article by Mr.John Ekelaar. The article contains some criticism of “the\n\nwelfare principle”. The author has strongly advocated how the law should\n\nbe reformulated by getting rid of “welfare” or “best interest” principles. The\n\narticle is in the realm of the opinion of the learned author. The decision of\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_38\">Kanika</a> (supra) reiterates the well-settled law that\n\nthe issue regarding custody of a minor child and the issue of the repatriation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                      23</span>\n\n\nof the child to the native country has to be addressed on the sole criteria of\n\nthe welfare of the minor and not on consideration of the legal rights of the\n\nparents.   The principle that the welfare of the minor shall be the\n\npredominant consideration and that the rights of the parties to a custody\n\ndispute are irrelevant has been consistently followed by this Court. In fact,\n\nin sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/136612392/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,\n\n1956 (for short “the 1956 Act”), it is provided that in appointment or\n\ndeclaration of guardian of a minor, the welfare of the minor shall be the\n\nparamount consideration.       When a Court decides that it is in the best\n\ninterest of the minor to remain in the custody of one of the parents, the\n\nrights of the other parent are bound to be affected. As provided in clause (a)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/39958047/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 6</a> of the 1956 Act, in the case of a minor boy or girl, the natural\n\nguardian is the father, but ordinarily, the custody of a minor who has not\n\ncompleted the age of 5 years shall be with the mother. On a conjoint\n\nreading of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/136612392/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 13</a> read with clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/39958047/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 6</a> of\n\nthe 1959 Act, if it is found that the welfare of a minor whose age is more\n\nthan 5 years requires that his custody should be with the mother, the Court\n\nis bound to do so. In the same way, if interest of the minor which is the\n\nparamount consideration requires that the custody of a minor child should\n\nnot be with the mother, the Court will be justified in disturbing the custody of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">\f                                     24</span>\n\n\nthe mother even if the age of the minor is less than five years. In such\n\ncases, the rights of the father or the mother, as the case may be, conferred\n\nby clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/39958047/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 6</a> are bound to be affected. Whenever the Court\n\ndisturbs the custody of one parent, unless there are compelling reasons,\n\nthe Court will normally provide for visitation rights to the other parent. The\n\nreason is that the child needs the company of both parents. The orders for\n\nvisitation rights are essentially passed for the welfare of minors and for the\n\nprotection of their right of having the company of both parents. Such orders\n\nare not passed only for protecting the rights of the parents.   In view of the\n\nsettled legal position, the welfare of the minor being the paramount\n\nconsideration, we cannot act upon the suggestions of Mr.John Ekelaar in\n\nhis Article. We cannot accept the submission that while applying the\n\nwelfare principle, the rights of the mother or father need to be\n\nprotected. The consideration of the well-being and welfare of the child must\n\nget precedence over the individual or personal rights of the parents.\n\nWhether the Court while dealing with a case like this can compel one of the\n\nparents to move from one country to another is a separate issue. We are\n\ndealing with the said issue separately.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"53310178\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_61\">27.

Now we turn to the findings recorded by the High Court. The perusal\n\nof the impugned judgment shows that the High Court has adverted to the\n\nlaw <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_57\">laid down in</a> the cases of <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_58\">Kanika</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/53310178/\" id=\"a_59\">Nithya</a> (supra) apart from\n\nother cases. The High Court found that in the facts of the case, summary\n\ninquiry deserves to be adopted. The Court noted that the child has spent\n\nmore than three years in USA and two and a half years in India. Therefore,\n\nit cannot be said that there is a complete integration of the child with the\n\nsocial, physical, psychological, cultural and academic environment of either\n\nUSA or India. After considering the documents placed on record, the High\n\nCourt found that the appellant no.1 has not produced any further medical\n\nreport or medical treatment record to show that the minor child requires\n\nfurther regular medical treatment apart from usual periodical review and\n\ntherefore, it will not be difficult to arrange a periodical review even if the\n\nchild is in USA. The High Court on examination of the documents found\n\nthat the respondent no.1 had financial resources to maintain the appellant\n\nno.1 and the minor child in USA. Merely because the respondent no.1 had\n\nasked the appellant no.1 to arrange funds for purchase of lands in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">\f                                      27</span>\n\n\nBangalore, it cannot be said that his intention is to abandon USA and settle\n\ndown permanently in India.         Moreover, the High Court noted that\n\ninternational travel consent signed by the appellant no.1 and the\n\nrespondent no.1 required that the minor should come back to USA on 26 th\n\nSeptember, 2019. The High Court held that change in the travel plan was\n\nnot discussed and consented by both the parties. The High Court also\n\nconsidered the allegation that the respondent no.1 has temperamental\n\nissues. In fact, the respondent no.1 produced a Psychological Evaluation\n\nReport dated 21st October 2020 issued by the Centre for Psychology which\n\nrecorded that the respondent no.1 is free of any neurophysiological\n\nproblems and has no diagnosable mental health problems. The certificate\n\nrecorded that he is free of depression, anxiety and reports no suicidal\n\ntendencies. The High Court also considered the relevance of the report of\n\nthe USA Embassy regarding the welfare of the child. The Court noted that\n\nthere is a disclaimer in the said report that the consular officer who is the\n\nauthor of the report is not trained in child protection, social work, or other\n\nsimilar discipline and therefore, the report is not a child custody evaluation.\n\nThe High Court has also noted the allegations and rival allegations against\n\neach other made by the appellant no.1 and the respondent no.1. About the\n\nargument that the appellant no.1 is taking constant care of the minor child,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                    28</span>\n\n\nthe High Court referred to the said report of the USA Embassy.        In\n\nparagraphs 48 and 49 of the Judgment, the High Court has noted the\n\ncontents of the said report and has drawn conclusions which are recorded\n\nin paragraph 50. Paragraphs 48 to 50 of the impugned Judgment read\n\nthus:</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          “48. However, a perusal of the welfare report dated\n          17.12.2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy shows\n          that respondent No.2 told the Visiting Consular that\n          her aunt picks up minor child from school and brings\n          him home each day and stays with him throughout the\n          day while the mother and grand-parents are at work.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">          The minor child has a domestic helper who takes care\n          of his needs and plays with him. It is evident from the\n          report that even respondent No.2 and her parents are\n          not giving whole day personal care and attention to the\n          minor child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">          49. The petitioner has filed affidavit dated\n          15.06.2020 that the petitioner also has requisite skills\n          to care for his child in the USA. The petitioner has also\n          the option to work from home permanently, enabling\n          him to care for the child full time when required.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">          Further, the Petitioner’s mother Smt. Usha\n          Hanumantharayya has a valid US visa till 23.02.2024\n          and has expressed her willingness to take care of the\n          minor child to this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">          50. In these facts and circumstances, there is no\n          reasonable ground to believe that the minor child\n          cannot be given due personal care and attention in\n          USA and therefore, repatriation of the minor child\n          cannot be declined on the ground of lack of requisite\n          personal care and attention to the minor child in USA.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                     29</span>\n\n\n                                               (underline supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">29.   After considering the said aspects, the High Court issued directions in\n\nparagraphs 55, 57 and 58 which we have already quoted above. The\n\nfactors considered by the High Court were certainly relevant. The High\n\nCourt had the benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was\n\nappointed as Amicus Curiae. He interacted with the contesting parties. The\n\nreport of the Amicus Curiae has been considered by the High Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">30.   The learned Judge of the High Court noted that except for the case\n\nfiled by the respondent no.1 in USA Court regarding custody of the minor,\n\nthere are no proceedings pending between the appellant no.1 and the\n\nrespondent no.1.    It was also noted that the welfare report dated 17 th\n\nDecember, 2019 of Visiting Consular of US Embassy records that the\n\nappellant no.1 informed that her aunt picks up the minor child from school\n\nand brings him home each day and stays with him throughout the day while\n\nthe mother and grand-parents are at work. Moreover, a domestic helper is\n\ntaking care of the needs of the child. Therefore, the appellant no.1 is not\n\ndevoting her whole day to take personal care of the minor and to attend to\n\nthe needs of the minor child. The High Court noted that on the other hand,\n\nan affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.1 that an option to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                       30</span>\n\n\npermanently work from home is available to him and his mother has a valid\n\nvisa to stay in USA till 23rd February 2024 who has expressed willingness to\n\ntake care of the minor child in USA. The other factors considered by the\n\nHigh Court while holding a summary inquiry were that the stay of the minor\n\nchild in India has been for too short a period to facilitate his integration into\n\nthe social, physical, physiological, cultural and academic environment of\n\nIndia. Moreover, the minor child, if repatriated to USA, will not be subjected\n\nto an entirely foreign system of education. The High Court has also taken\n\ninto consideration the fact that the child is a citizen of USA who will have\n\nbetter future prospects on return to USA. It is observed that the natural\n\nprocess of grooming in the environment of the native country is\n\nindispensable for his comprehensive development. The High Court further\n\nobserved that it is not shown that return of the child to USA will be harmful\n\nto him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"53310178\" id=\"span_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_77\">31.   After having perused the material on record, we find that the High\n\nCourt has considered all relevant factors while holding a summary inquiry.\n\nThe High Court has given reasons for coming to the conclusion that it will\n\nbe in the interest and welfare of the child to return to USA. The High Court\n\nhas not treated the order of USA court as conclusive. The High Court had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">\f                                       31</span>\n\n\nthe benefit of the assistance of a learned Counsel who was appointed as\n\namicus. The exercise of power by the High Court cannot be said to be\n\nperverse or illegal. We find that the High Court has not overlooked the\n\nview taken by larger Benches of this Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_60\">Kanika</a> (supra)\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/53310178/\" id=\"a_61\">Nithya</a> (supra). We are in agreement with High Court when it came to\n\nthe conclusion that it will be in the welfare of the child to return to USA.</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"182690117\" id=\"span_79\">32.   The emphasis of the learned counsel appearing for appellants was\n\nmore on the rights of the appellant no.1 and on making a departure from the\n\nwell-known concept that the welfare of the minor is the paramount\n\nconsideration. The said submissions are contrary to the law <a href=\"/doc/53310178/\" id=\"a_62\">laid down by</a>\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/182690117/\" id=\"a_63\">Kanika</a> (supra) as observed by us earlier. As we\n\nhave noted earlier, the rights of the parents are irrelevant when a Court\n\ndecides the custody issue. It is not a consideration at all for deciding the\n\nissue.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">33.   A question was raised whether the High Court was justified in passing\n\nan order directing the appellant no.1 to return to USA along with the minor\n\nchild on or before a particular date.       The issue of custody of a minor,\n\nwhether in a petition seeking habeas corpus or in a custody petition, has to\n\nbe decided on the touchstone of the principle that the welfare of a minor is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                                       32</span>\n\n\nof paramount consideration. The Courts, in such proceedings, cannot\n\ndecide where the parents should reside as it will affect the right to privacy of\n\nthe parents. We may note here that a writ Court while dealing with the\n\nissue of habeas corpus cannot direct a parent to leave India and to go\n\nabroad with the child. If such orders are passed against the wishes of a\n\nparent, it will offend her/his right to privacy.   A parent has to be given an\n\noption to go abroad with the child. It ultimately depends on the parent\n\nconcerned to decide and opt for giving a company to the minor child for the\n\nsake of the welfare of the child. It will all depend on the priorities of the\n\nconcerned parent. In this case, on a conjoint reading of clauses (i) to (iii) of\n\nparagraph 55 of the judgment, it is apparent that such an option has been\n\ngiven to the appellant no.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">34.   We may record here that an email dated 18 th October, 2021\n\naddressed by the appellant no.1 to the respondent no.1 is placed on record\n\nalong with I.A. No. 147418 of 2021. In the said email, the appellant no.1\n\nhas informed the respondent no.1 that during her visa interview, if she is\n\nasked, she will clearly state that the intended purpose of visiting USA was\n\nalso to contest cases filed by the respondent no.1 and to file cases against\n\nthe respondent no.1. Therefore, an option has to be given to the appellant\n\nno.1 to return to USA along with the minor son though she cannot be forced\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                     33</span>\n\n\nto stay with the respondent no.1. Therefore, the respondent no.1 will have\n\nto make proper arrangements for a suitable residence for the comfortable\n\nstay of the appellant no.1 in USA. The reason is that the appellant no.1\n\ncannot work in USA on the basis of a B-2 visa. The respondent no.1 will\n\nhave to provide a reasonable amount per month to the appellant no.1 to\n\nmaintain herself and the child in USA. Necessary steps will have to be\n\ntaken by the respondent no.1 to secure admission for the child in a school\n\nin USA. To enable the appellant no.1 to contest the custody petition filed by\n\nthe respondent no.1, a direction will have to be issued to the respondent\n\nno.1 not to enforce and act upon the said order of USA Court in any\n\nmanner for a period of three months from the date on which the appellant\n\nno.1 reaches USA with the son. During the said period of three months,\n\nvisitation rights will have to be provided to the respondent no.1 to meet the\n\nminor child. If the appellant no.1 opts to go to USA and contest the custody\n\nproceedings, the parties will have to abide by the result of the said\n\nproceedings in so far as the issue of the custody of the minor child is\n\nconcerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">35.   The appellant no.1 will have to be given time of fifteen days from\n\ntoday to communicate the respondent no.1 her willingness to travel to USA\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">\f                                     34</span>\n\n\nwith the child. If she intends to visit USA, along with her willingness, she\n\nmust communicate possible dates of travel. The dates should be within\n\nmaximum period of three months from today. On receiving the same, the\n\nrespondent no.1 shall arrange for air tickets and make arrangements for\n\nthe comfortable stay of the appellant no.1 and the minor in USA. The\n\nrespondent no.1 shall, for the time being, transfer US$ 5,000 to the\n\nappellant no.1 for facilitating expenditure in USA. The respondent no.1, in\n\naddition, shall transfer US$ 1,500 to the appellant no.1 which can be used\n\nby the appellant no.1 for the benefit of the minor child in USA. The\n\nrespondent no.1 will have to also provide a proper health insurance to both\n\nof them. The respondent no.1 will also be under an obligation to take care\n\nof medical treatment of the minor son.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">36.   In the event the appellant no.1 fails to communicate her willingness to\n\ntravel to USA within fifteen days from today, it will be open for the\n\nrespondent no.1 to take the custody of the child. After the respondent no.1\n\narrives in India, the appellant no.1 shall hand over the custody of the minor\n\nson to the respondent no.1 to enable the respondent no.1 to take the minor\n\nson to USA. To the above extent, the order of the High Court requires\n\nmodification.   As noted earlier, now B-2 visa has been granted to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">\f                                     35</span>\n\n\nappellant no.1. The respondent no.1 will have to also facilitate extension of\n\nvisa granted to the appellant no.1, in case she desires to continue her stay\n\nin USA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">37.   Hence, we pass the following order:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           (i)    It will be open for the appellant no.1 to travel to USA\n\n           along with the minor child and to contest the proceedings\n\n           pending in USA.
