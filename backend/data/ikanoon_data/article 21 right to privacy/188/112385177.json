The relevant extract of the\n      report is as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      It is observed from the data on the complaints received at CICs that only 14 to\n      18 percent of the complaints raised by the customer required rectification /\n      modification in the databases of the CICs. As the decision to do the same vests\n      with the CICs and there may be some gap in such identification and acceptance\n      of complaints, and internal ombudsman (IO) as the head of their internal\n      grievance redressal mechanism may be appointed by CICs. The mandate of IO\n      shall, inter alia, include examination of customer complaints that are partly or\n      wholly rejected by the CICs. The CICs shall internally escalate all complaints,\n      which are not fully redressed to their respective IOs before conveying the final\n      decision to the complainant. The Customers need not approach the IO directly.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      It is also informed that the Internal Ombudsman (IO) mechanism was extended\n      to select banks in 2015 (later extended to all banks with more than 10 banking\n      outlets in India in 2018), Payment System Participants in 2019 and Non -\n      Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in 2021. The basic objective of the IO\n      mechanism is to strengthen the internal grievance redress mechanism in the\n      regulated entities by ensuring that all rejected or partially addressed customer\n      complaints were seen by the IO before conveying the final decision to the\n      customer. This is also intended to minimize the need for the customers to\n      approach other for a for redressal.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                            Page 4 of 10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">           With a view to strengthen the internal grievance redress of the Credit\n          Information Companies (CICs) and to make it more efficient, it was decided to\n          bring the CICs under the Internal Ombudsman (IO) framework,\n          You may refer\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">          1) Press release on &#x27; Statement of Developmental and Regulator Policies dated\n          August 5, 2022, available on www.rbi.org.in under &#x27;Press Releases&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          2) Press release on &#x27;The Reserve Bank introduces Internal Ombudsman\n          mechanism for Credit Information Companies (CICs)&#x27; dated October 6, 2022\n          available on www.rbi.org.in under &#x27;Press Releases&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">3.

In this connection, it is stated that we are not maintaining any\n      database which contains the list of all such e-mail correspondence with CICS/CIs.\n      Thus, in order to collate the information, there is need to get the name of the officers\n      who were then involved in the matter related to sharing of credit information and\n      have to filter their emails in order to compile the information as sought in the RTI\n      application.

The appellant and on behalf of the respondent Shri Deepak Chikale, CPIO; Shri\nHoney Khosla, Law Officer and Shri Sidhant, Assistant General Manager, attended the\nhearing through video conference.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                                   Page 6 of 10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"> 6.    The appellant inter alia submitted that the exemptions invoked by the respondent\nwere not applicable to the information sought by him by any stretch of imagination. He\nfurther argued that the FAA did not find it appropriate to comply with the principles of\nnatural justice and to follow procedural laws that evolved upon good consensus while\ntaking up the first appeal as a quasi-judicial authority. The appellant further submitted\nthat the respondent had wrongly denied the information on hyper-technical grounds and\nnon-disclosure of information on the ground that the records such as inward/outward\nregisters contained names of individuals that could vitiate the principles of transparency\nand accountability that ought to be maintained by the public authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">7.    The respondent while defending their case inter alia submitted that they had\nprovided point-wise reply to the appellant vide letter dated 29.11.2022. Besides, they\nrelied upon their written submissions dated 26.02.2024 and the relevant extracts thereof\nare reproduced as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;In the present second appeal, as regards query nos. 1 and 3, the appellant has\n      contended that he is aggrieved by the non-disclosure of information as exemptions\n      by no stretch of imagination could be evoked by the CPIO for denying the\n      information. He has again contended that the reply given by the CPIO as regards\n      query no. 2 is ambiguous. As regards the copy of letters provided in response to\n      query no. 4, the appellant has questioned the exemption claimed under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_13\">section\n      8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. Regarding query no. 5, the appellant has contended that\n      complete report and other relevant material papers ought to have been provided\n      by the CPIO. Further, the appellant has also claimed that he didn&#x27;t receive any\n      information as per the order passed by the FAA within 10 working days from the\n      date of the order as directed by the FAA and the FAA had disposed- off the First\n      Appeal without hearing the appellant in spite of a specific request for oral\n      hearing.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      8. It is humbly submitted that the order of the FAA was forwarded to the appellant\n      vide letter dated February 07, 2023 wherein it was mentioned that the compliance\n      as directed by the FAA would be provided in due course (copy enclosed and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                                Page 7 of 10</span>\n       marked as Annexure- &#x27;E&#x27;). Thereafter, vide letter dated February 20, 2023 (copy\n      enclosed and marked as Annexure- &#x27;F&#x27;) the compliance of the order of the FAA\n      was also forwarded to the appellant as Annex to the said letter. In the final\n      compliance, as directed by the FAA, reasons for seeking exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_14\">section\n      8(1)(g)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">RTI Act</a> were given stating that inward and outward registers\n      contain details (names and full addresses) of the senders of the letters received\n      and addressees of the letters sent and further the said registers contain details\n      (names, designation and Employees IDs) of the employees involved in processing\n      of the letters received (from the stage of inwarding till marking off from\n      register/portal). As regards query no 4, it was stated that all correspondence via\n      e-mail between DoR, RBI &amp; four CICs and CIs regarding sharing of customer\n      data with CICs for publishing and sharing of CIBIL scored reports during the\n      period between April 1, 2022 to November 30, 2022 is generic in nature and\n      database for this is not maintained which contains the list of all such e-mail\n      correspondence with CICs/CIs. Thus, it was stated that in order to collate the\n      information, there is need to get the name of the officers who were then involved in\n      the matter relating to sharing of credit information and then to filter their emails\n      in order to compile the information as sought in the RTI application. Accordingly,\n      it has been informed that the same would disproportionately divert the resources\n      of the public authority. Further, these mails would also contain certain\n      information exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_16\">section 8 (1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 and redaction of\n      such information would be a humongous process.

The\nCommission agrees with the respondent that the information sought by the appellant\ncontained details (names and full addresses) of the senders of the letters received and\naddressees of the letters, details (names, designation and Employees IDs) of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                                Page 8 of 10</span>\n employees involved in processing of the letters received (from the stage of inwarding till\nmarking off from register/portal), details of customers in reports, etc. and seeking\nconsent of third parties concerned in each of those cases was a voluminous process.\nTherefore, the respondent was not under an obligation to filter out information and\nrecords in the manner sought by the appellant in the RTI application. Therefore, the\nexemption claimed by the respondent was found sustainable in the eyes of law. Further,\nthe Commission would like to draw the appellant&#x27;s attention towards the observations of\nthe Apex Court in respect of the conflict between right to information and right to\nprivacy, highlighted in the judgment dated 26 September, 2018 in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_17\">Justice K.S.\nPuttaswamy (Retd) vs Union Of India</a>, reproduced hereunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;193. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/37517217/\" id=\"a_18\">Thalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited v State of Kerala</a> 2013\n      (16) SCC 82 , this Court dealt with a conflict between the right to information\n      [(protected by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1)(a)]</a> and the right to privacy (protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a>).</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      The Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">            &quot;61. The right to information and right to privacy are, therefore, not\n            absolute rights, both the rights, one of which falls under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_21\">Article\n            19(1)(a)</a> and the other under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, can\n            obviously be regulated, restricted and curtailed in the larger public interest.\n            Absolute or uncontrolled individual rights do not and cannot exist in any\n            modern State. Citizens&#x27; right to get information is statutorily recognised by\n            the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_23\">RTI Act</a>, but at the same time limitations are also provided in the Act\n            itself, which is discernible from the Preamble and other provisions of the\n            Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      The Court held that the balance between the right to information and the right to\nprivacy is drawn under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_24\">Right to Information Act</a> 2005: if the information which is\nsought is personal and has no relationship with a public activity or interest, a public\nauthority is not legally bound to provide such information. If the information which is\nsought is to be made available in the larger public interest, reasons have to be recorded\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                Page 9 of 10</span>\n because the person from whom the information is sought has a right to privacy\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21.&quot;</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">      In view of the above, the Commission finds no infirmity with the reply given by\nthe CPIO.
