The decision cited by the learned\n      Panel Counsel in GIRISH RAMACHANDRA DESHPANDE supra had a different\n      fact matrix and therefore the Apex Court held that personal information cannot be\n      furnished.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      5.

While hearing earlier second Appeal filed by the appellant against regarding\nthe RTI Application dated 13.01.2022, the Hon&#x27;ble CIC, dismissed the same vide its\nOrder dated 31.07.2023.

Perusal of the RTI application revealed that the complainant had sought\ninformation related to third party, the disclosure of which would have caused\nunwarranted invasion on the privacy of the individual and might be exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the RTI Act. Moreover, it was not a case that the RTI\napplication was not responded by the respondent. In view of the above, no mala fide\ncould be attributed to the CPIO and there appears to be no public interest in further\nprolonging the matter, Accordingly, the complaint is closed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      It may not be out of place to add that, Mr Tiwari i.e. the applicant in present case\nwas working with the respondent Bank. He had filed LPA No. 191 of 2018 before\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad, challenging the action of the Bank inter-\nalia not granting him promotion, which is decided by the Hon&#x27;ble Court and Bank has\nalready complied the said Order in its letter and spirit.

The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, hearing\nboth parties and perusal of records, observes that as far as the disclosure of the\ninformation entailing the &#x27;notes placed by the Head (HR Administration) before\nManaging Director &amp; CEO&#x27; regarding release of promotion of the averred third parties is\nconcerned, the denial citing the exemption of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act cannot be\nfaulted. The reliance placed by the Appellant on the judgement of the Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt of Karnataka in the matter of AS Mallikarjun Swamy VS State Information\nCommissioner, Bengaluru, Writ Petition No. 23695 of 2022 has been duly considered.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                Page 6 of 20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"> 9.    It is pertinent to note that the AS Mallikarjun Swamy (supra) matter based its\njudgment vis-à-vis the reliance placed by the Respondent in that case on the judgment of\nthe Apex Court in the matter of Girish Ramachandra Deshpande and rejected the\nreliance by observing that- &quot;The decision cited by the learned Panel Counsel in GIRISH\nRAMACHANDRA DESHPANDE supra had a different fact matrix and therefore the\nApex Court held that personal information cannot be furnished.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      The judgment further emphasizes that- &quot;It hardly needs to be stated that a\ndecision is an authority for the proposition that has been laid down in a given fact matrix\nof a case and not for all that which logically follows from what has been laid down.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">      Now, looking at the facts of the Girish Ramachandra case, the following contents\nspell out the nature of the information sought for that was under consideration and the\nreply provided by the CPIO in that case:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;3.

The performance of\nan employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and\nthe employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall\nunder the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has no\nrelationship to any public activity or public interest.

This observation highlights the status and importance of the right to privacy as a\nconstitutional right. The ratio as recorded in the two concurring judgments of 26 (2017)\n10 SCC 1 the learned judges (R.F. Nariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul, JJ.) are similar. It\nis observed that privacy involves a person&#x27;s right to his physical body; right to\ninformational privacy which deals with a person&#x27;s mind; and the right to privacy of\nchoice which protects an individual&#x27;s autonomy over personal choices. While physical\nprivacy enjoys constitutional recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a>,\npersonal informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> and right to privacy of choice is\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_27\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25 of the Constitution. In the\nconcurring opinion, there is a reference to &#x27;The Right to Privacy&#x27; by Samuel Warren and\nLouis D. Brandeis on an individual&#x27;s right to control the dissemination of personal\ninformation and that an individual has a right to limit access to such information/shield\nsuch information from unwarranted access. Knowledge about a person gives another\npower over that person, as personal data collected is capable of effecting\nrepresentations in his decision making process and shaping behaviour which can have\na stultifying effect on the expression of dissent which is the cornerstone of democracy.\nIn the said concurring judgment, it has been further held that the right to protection of\nreputation from being unfairly harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only against\nfalsehood but also against certain truths...

The mind that has to\nbe examined is not that of a reader in general, but that of the person who is affected by\nthe publicising/dissemination of his information. The question is what a reasonable\nperson of ordinary sensibilities would feel if he/she is subjected to such publicity.

The foregoing extrapolation of the averred Apex Court judgment read with the\ncase laws specific to determining what constitutes larger public interest as well as the\nobservation of the Court in the AS Mallikarjun Swamy case that- &quot;It hardly needs to be\nstated that a decision is an authority for the proposition that has been laid down in a\ngiven fact matrix of a case and not for all that which logically follows from what has\nbeen laid down.&quot; emphasizes rationale in upholding the denial of the information by the\nCPIO. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_32\">In other words, it will not be out of place to hold the view that the decision issued\nin the AS Mallikarjun Swamy case cannot be treated as binding in the facts of the instant\ncase when viewed from the perspective of the precedent laid down in the <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_46\">Subhash\nChandra Agarwal</a> case that took into consideration multiple nature of cases involving\nthird party service matter related requisition for information made by RTI Applicants.</span>\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                               Page 18 of 20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_34\">11.
