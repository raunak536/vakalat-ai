According to PW.1, the\n\n       victim, during assault on her, she raised cries and tried to\n\n       escape, but accused forcibly committed rape on her.\n\n       Even then, the prosecution did not examine any of the\n\n       neighbours;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">xii)   All the prosecution witnesses are interested witnesses;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">xiii) PW.5, crucial witness, did not support the prosecution\n\n       case;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                  10</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">                                                        KL,J &amp; PSS,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                          Crl.A.

The last menstrual period of the\n\n            victim is mentioned as 28.02.2013, but it is recorded as\n\n            28.11.2013. Absence of hymen may be due to several\n\n            reasons. But, total absence of hymen is not possible due\n\n            to other reasons other than sexual intercourse. Therefore,\n\n            medical evidence is not supported the prosecution case;\n\n      xvi) Without considering the said aspects, the trial Court\n\n            convicted the appellants for the aforesaid offences; and\n\n      xvii) The accused are in jail from 28.03.2014; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">      10.

She has also specifically stated that\n\naccused No.1 is the son-in-law of her maternal aunt (PW.5) and\n\naccused No.2 is distant relative. They have made PW.5 believe that\n\nPW.3 was in drunken condition, that they sought key. Therefore,\n\nPW.5 being the mother-in-law of accused No.1 believed their version\n\nand sent the victim along with accused on the motorcycle. They have\n\ncommitted rape on her one after other. But, the victim in her evidence\n\ndeposed that on 15.03.2013 at about 10.00 P.M., she and her father\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                  13</span>\n                                                       KL,J &amp; PSS,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                         Crl.A.

Accused\n\nNos.1 and 2 represented her father that the crop in their fields was\n\nbeing drying up and requested him to go to the agricultural well for\n\nwatering the fields. While leaving so, her father asked the victim to\n\nstay in the house of PW.5. Her father dropped her at the house of\n\nPW.5 and left to the fields along with accused Nos.1 and 2. At about\n\n1.00 A.M., PW.5 woke her up and informed her that her father was\n\nvomiting at the house and that the house keys were with her and\n\nrequested her to go to her house. However, she deposed that she went\n\nto her house along with accused Nos.1 and 2 on the motorcycle. Her\n\nfather was not there. Accused No.2 opened the doors, she entered into\n\nthe house. Thereafter, they have closed the doors, threatened her with\n\ndire consequences. Accused No.1 dragged her into the room and\n\nforcibly committed rape on her. Accused No.2 was staying in another\n\nroom. After committing rape by accused No.1, accused No.2 also\n\ncommitted rape on her. Thus, both the accused (accused Nos.1 and 2)\n\nhad committed rape on the victim (PW.1).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_57\">      i) It is not in dispute that the mother of the victim and other\n\nfamily members went to Vemulawada for pilgrimage.

The evidence of PW.1 has categorically\n\ncorroborated by the evidence of the doctor and FSL report. The trial\n\nCourt also considered that there was no consent of the victim for\n\ncommitting sexual intercourse. However, the said alleged consent has\n\nno relevancy since the victim was 15 years as on the date of incident.\n\nThe trial Court also gave a finding with regard to the injuries and also\n\nthe medical evidence including FSL report.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">      v) In the light of the aforesaid discussion, the trial Court on\n\nconsideration of the entire evidence convicted the appellants.

So,\n\nthe courts should deal with such cases sternly and severely. Sexual\n\nviolence, apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful\n\nintrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a\n\nserious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and\n\ndignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where the\n\nvictim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a\n\ntraumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries, but\n\nleaves behind a scar on the most cherished position of a woman i.e.\n\nher dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an\n\noffence against the person of a woman, rather a crime against the\n\nentire society. It is a crime against basic human rights and also\n\nviolates the most cherished fundamental right guaranteed under\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">20</span>\n  .
