The dignity of the individual, equality\nbetween human being and the quest for liberty are the foundational\npillars of the Indian Constitution. It has been further held that life and\npersonal liberty are not creations of the Constitution. These rights are\nrecognized by the Constitution as inhering in each individual as an\nintrinsic and inseparable part of the human element which dwells\nwithin.

Elements of privacy also arise in varying contexts\nfrom the other facets of freedom and dignity recognised and\nguaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III.

To appreciate what we have posed hereinabove, it is nec-\n         essary to dwell upon balancing the fundamental rights. It has\n         been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the\n         right conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> has to be kept at a differ-\n         ent pedestal than the individual reputation which has been\n         recognised as an aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In fact\n         the submission is that right to freedom of speech and expression\n         which includes freedom of press should be given higher status\n         and the individual&#x27;s right to have his/her reputation should\n         yield to the said right.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">         137. ....The issue herein is sustenance and balancing of the sep-\n         arate rights, one under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the other, under Ar-\n         ticle 21. Hence, the concept of equipoise and counterweighing\n         fundamental rights of one with other person. It is not a case of\n         mere better enjoyment of another freedom.

State of Gujarat, 1975 1 SCC 11, it has been observed\n         that a particular fundamental right cannot exist in isolation in a\n         watertight compartment. One fundamental right of a person\n         may have to coexist in harmony with the exercise of another\n         fundamental right by others and also with reasonable and valid\n         exercise of power by the State in the light of the directive princi-\n         ples in the interests of social welfare as a whole.

It is urged that to have defamation as a component of\n         criminal law is an anathema to the idea of free speech which is\n         recognised under the Constitution and, therefore, criminalisa-\n         tion of defamation in any form is an unreasonable restriction.\n         We have already held that reputation is an inextricable aspect of\n         right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and the State in\n         order to sustain and protect the said reputation of an individual\n         has kept the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 499</a> IPC alive as a part of\n         law. The seminal point is permissibility of criminal defamation\n         as a reasonable restriction as understood under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(2)</a> of\n         the Constitution. To elucidate, the submission is that criminal\n         defamation, a pre-Constitution law is totally alien to the concept\n         of free speech. As stated earlier, the right to reputation is a con-\n         stituent of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is an individual&#x27;s\n         fundamental right and, therefore, balancing of fundamental\n         right is imperative. The Court has spoken about synthesis and\n         overlapping of fundamental rights, and thus, sometimes con-\n         flicts between two rights and competing values. In the name of\n         freedom of speech and expression, the right of another cannot\n         be jeopardised......\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">         Reputation being an inherent component of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a>, we do\n         not think it should be allowed to be sullied solely because an-\n         other individual can have its freedom. It is not a restriction that\n         has an inevitable consequence which impairs circulation of\n         thought and ideas. In fact, it is control regard being had to an-\n         other person&#x27;s right to go to court and state that he has been\n         wronged and abused.

This right has two aspects which are but\ntwo faces of same coin i.e. (i)                  the general law of privacy which\naffords a tort action for damages resulting from an unlawful invasion\nof privacy and, (ii) Constitutional recognition given to the right of\nprivacy            which protects             personal privacy against unlawful\ngovernmental          invasion.

We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from\n         the above discussion:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">         (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and\n         liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">         21. It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to\n         safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage,\n         procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education\n         among other matters. None can publish anything\n         concerning the above matters without his consent whether\n         truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If\n         he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the\n         person concerned and would be liable in an action for\n         damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person\n         voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily\n         invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">         (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that\n         any publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\n         unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n         records including court records. This is for the reason that\n         once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right\n         to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate\n         subject for comment by press and media among others. We\n         are, however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency\n         (<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 19(2)</a>) an exception must be carved out to this\n         rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\n         kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be\n         subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident\n         being publicized in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">         (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\n         above - indeed, this is not an exception but an independent\n         rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\n         privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for\n         damages is simply not available with respect to their acts\n         and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official\n         duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon\n         facts and statements which are not true, unless the official\n         establishes that the publication was made (by the\n         defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/11/2021                       ::: Downloaded on - 23/11/2021 04:06:36 :::</span>\n hcs/Priya/Sonali\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                        32/50</span>\n                                                IAL-25975 - 2021 IN SUIT L 25974-2021.doc\n         it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press\n         or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n         verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove\n         that what he has written is true. Of course, where the\n         publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n         personal animosity, the defendant would have no defence\n         and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that\n         in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the\n         public official enjoys the same protection as any other\n         citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\n         reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power\n         to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and\n         legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_43\">Articles 105</a>\n         and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_44\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n         exceptions to this rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">         (4) So far as the Government, local authority and other\n         organs and institutions exercising governmental power are\n         concerned, they cannot maintain a suit for damages for\n         defaming them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">         (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_45\">Official\n         Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or any similar enactment or provision\n         having the force of law does not bind the press or media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">         (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials\n         to prohibit, or to impose a prior restraint upon the\n         press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">         27. We may hasten to add that the principles above\n         mentioned are only the broad principles. They are neither\n         exhaustive nor all-comprehending; indeed no such enunciation\n         is possible or advisable. As rightly pointed out by Mathew, J.,\n         this right has to go through a case-by-case development. The\n         concepts dealt with herein are still in the process of evolution.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">                                                    (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">13.

The name\n&quot;SAMEER&quot;           is clearly interpolation and is in different handwriting.\nThere are some other interpolations also.              The aforesaid allegation\nNo.1 is primarily made on the basis of said document at Page 42 of\nthe plaint clearly shows that the Defendant has not acted after\nreasonable verification of the facts.           As far as Page 43 is concerned\nwhich is allegedly profile picture of Wankhede Dawood, Mr.Shaikh,\nlearned Senior Advocate submitted that the same appears in that\nmanner as Plaintiff&#x27;s Cell number           is saved by the name &quot;Wankhede\nDawood&quot; in the cell from which same was accessed. As far as Nikah\nNama at Exhibit-I Page 45 is concerned, the same does not appears to\nbe from any public record. Thus, only document                      appearing from\nthe public record is Exhibit-F at Page 42 and there are interpolations\non the said document. Thus, if allegations are made on the basis of\nthat document then it cannot be said that the allegations are made\nafter reasonable verification of the facts. It is very important to note\nthat the Plaintiff has filed additional affidavit dated 12/11/2021 and\nproduced several documents              to substantiate     his contention          that\nname of the Plaintiff is Dnyandeo and he belongs to &quot;Mahar&quot; caste\nrecognised          as scheduled caste.

Thus, it is clear that the\nDefendant has not reasonably verified the facts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_122\">19.      It appears that the Defendant realised the above aspect after\narguments          were concluded on 12/11/2021 and the matter was\nadjourned for orders and therefore the Defendant filed praecipe dated\n16/11/2021 before the pronouncement of the order.                        In the said\npraecipe, it has been stated that additional affidavit of the Plaintiff\nwas served on the Defendant on 11/11/2021 and, therefore, the\nDefendant could not get time to reply the same. It is further stated\nin the said praecipe               that the Defendant      has obtained further\ninformation in respect of birth certificate of Plaintiff&#x27;s son, namely,\nSameer Wankhede. Along with said praecipe at Exhibit-A letter dated\n15/11/2021 of Health Officer, E-Ward, MCGM was produced. The\nsaid letter records that in 1979 in the birth certificate the father&#x27;s\nname was mentioned as &quot;Dawood K.

Ideally, in the first instance,\n         clarification ought to have been sought from the person against\n         whom the messages were intended to be posted.

Along with said tweet        two photographs were published.\nAdvocate Shaikh, learned Senior Counsel of the Plaintiff has submitted\nthat Plaintiff&#x27;s son had gone to Maldives with his family and the same\nis family vacation. As far as allegation at Exhibit-D page 40 which\nalleges that Sameer Wankhede&#x27;s photograph                 was taken         at Grant\nHyatt Hotel in Dubai on 10/12/2020, it is submitted by Mr.Shaikh,\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Plaintiff that said\nphotograph was taken at lounge of the Mumbai Airport.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">22.4.        Mr.Shaikh, the learned Senior Counsel has relied on the\nfollowing statement of Deputy Director General of the central agency\nMutha Ashok Jain published on 22/10/2021 by ANI:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">         &quot;Following Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik&#x27;s claim that\n         Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer\n         Wankhede visited Dubai to extort money, the Deputy Director\n         General of the central agency Mutha Ashok Jain on Thursday\n         said there was no application from Wankhede for going to\n         Dubai.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">         &quot;After joining NCB, there was no application from him (Sameer\n         Wankhede) for going to Dubai.

Thus, these aspects also show that the Defendant has not taken\ndue care and has not conducted reasonable verification.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_130\">23.      However at the same time it has to be seen that very serious\nallegations are made against Plaintiff&#x27;s son-Sameer Wankhede by\nPanch-Prabhakar Raghoji Sail in his affidavit dated 23/10/2021, the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/11/2021                       ::: Downloaded on - 23/11/2021 04:06:36 :::</span>\n hcs/Priya/Sonali\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                          45/50</span>\n                                                  IAL-25975 - 2021 IN SUIT L 25974-2021.doc\nrelevant portion of the same is already reproduced hereinabove.\nMr.Damle, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\nDefendant submitted that the evidence produced by the Defendant\nhas helped the Government machinery to take corrective steps\nagainst Sameer Wankhede, son of the Plaintiff. He submitted that\nSameer         Wankhede         is facing vigilance inquiry       and      that the\nDirector of Narcotics Control Bureau has transferred total of six\ncases from Mumbai Unit headed by Zonal Director Sameer\nWankhede            to    it&#x27;s operation unit in Delhi. He submitted that\nallegations made against Mr. Sameer Wankhede are now being\ninvestigated by Vigilance team of NCB and Special Investigation\nTeam (SIT) formed by Maharashtra Police.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">24.      It is also very important to note that admittedly the Defendant&#x27;s\nson-in-law was arrested on 13/01/2021 by NCB in NDPS case and\nhe was released on bail                 on 27/09/2021     and the tweets media\ncontent, videos, press conference etc. has started from 14/10/2021.\nThus, it is obvious              that the tweets media content, videos, press\nconference etc. are actuated by malice or personal animosity. The\nright to privacy is implicit in right to life and liberty guaranteed to\nthe citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21.</a>                 A citizen has right to\nsafeguard his privacy, however, the Defendant has made allegations\nagainst the Plaintiff&#x27;s son - Sameer Wankhede, who is presently posted\nas Zonal Director of Narcotics Control Bureau, Government of India\nand, therefore, he is public officer. The public have right to examine\nand comment on actions of public officials. However as held by the\nSupreme Court            it has to be done after reasonable verification of the\nfacts. Apart from that, it is necessary to balance Plaintiff&#x27;s right of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/11/2021                         ::: Downloaded on - 23/11/2021 04:06:36 :::</span>\n hcs/Priya/Sonali\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                          46/50</span>\n                                                  IAL-25975 - 2021 IN SUIT L 25974-2021.doc\nprivacy and also Defendant&#x27;s right of freedom of speech and\nexpression. Therefore, although the Plaintiff is not entitled for blanket\ninjunction as sought, however, when particularly it is in the facts and\ncircumstances of this case prima facie found that the Defendant&#x27;s\nactions are actuated by malice or personal animosity it is necessary\nthat the Defendant be directed to publish writing, speaking with\nmedia including electronic media and the social media or publishing\nin any manner whatsoever any content/material which is defamatory\nof the Plaintiff and/or his family members only after carrying out\nreasonable verification of the facts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"285448\" id=\"span_105\">25.      One of the contention raised by the Defendant is that it was\nincumbent upon the Plaintiff to comply with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_52\">Order\n1 Rule 8 of CPC</a> as                 the Plaintiff has filed present suit claiming\nalleged defamation of the Plaintiff and his family members. Mr.Damle,\nthe learned Senior Counsel              on behalf of the Defendant relied on\nDelhi High Court judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/285448/\" id=\"a_53\">Harsh Mandiratta</a> (supra)\nwherein it         has been held that an          action for the defamation is\nmaintainable only by the person who is defamed and not by his\nfriends, relatives and family members.</span> As against this Mr.Shaikh, the\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Plaintiff relied on\nthe judgment of Orissa High Court in the case of Navin Das and\nanother (supra) wherein the suit was filed by the wife regarding\nnews item published in the newspaper tarnishing the image of her\nfather-in-law and her husband. Mr.Shaikh,                   the learned Counsel\nappearing for the Plaintiff argued that in the said case the arguments\nwere advanced to the effect that the news item published would give\na definite impression that the image and reputation of the Plaintiff&#x27;s\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/11/2021                         ::: Downloaded on - 23/11/2021 04:06:36 :::</span>\n hcs/Priya/Sonali\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                        47/50</span>\n                                                IAL-25975 - 2021 IN SUIT L 25974-2021.doc\nfamily as a unit as well as members of the family as individuals has\nbeen tarnished by publication of such news and                    the same         was\naccepted. Following observations in para 8 of said Navin Das case\n(supra) are relevant.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">         &quot;8. On perusal of the news items reproduced in the plaint, it is\n         apparent that most of the news items/publications are relating\n         to either the husband and/or the father-in-law of the plaintiff-\n         respondent. But, there are some publications, more particularly,\n         the news items published on 2nd August, 2014 as referred to in\n         paragraph -24 of the plaint, publication dated 3rd August, 2014\n         referred to in paragraph- 25 of the plaint as well as publication\n         dated 5th August, 2014 referred to in paragraph -27 of the\n         plaint, relate to the family members of the plaintiff -respondent.\n         In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the publication\n         in the news paper was only relating to the husband and father-\n         in-law of the plaintiff -respondent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">                   The said observations are also applicable to the present\n         case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">25.1.        In the present case it is true that Plaintiff has come up with\nthe case that his family consisting of his daughter, son and daughter-\nin-law is defamed but he has also come up with positive case that he\nhimself has been defamed. Apart from that the allegation levelled is\nthat the Plaintiff is Muslim and inspite of that record has been\nchanged to make show that               the Plaintiff is belonging to          Mahar\ncommunity which is scheduled caste. In the present case it is the\nallegation that Plaintiff&#x27;s name is Dawood and not Dnyandev and\ntherefore, allegations are made against Plaintiff himself. Apart from\nthat prima facie even if allegations are made against Plaintiff&#x27;s son,\nin the facts and circumstances of this case the                 Plaintiff      is also\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">         ::: Uploaded on - 22/11/2021                       ::: Downloaded on - 23/11/2021 04:06:36 :::</span>\n hcs/Priya/Sonali\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                        48/50</span>\n                                                IAL-25975 - 2021 IN SUIT L 25974-2021.doc\ndefamed in the process.

Mr. Damle, the learned Senior Counsel has submitted that his\ncase is covered by Exception No.1, Exception No.2, Exception No.3\nand Exception No.9 to <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 499</a> of Indian Penal Code. On the\nother hand, Mr. Shaikh, the learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the\nPlaintiff submitted that the present case is civil action and it is a\nremedy in tort law and therefore, said <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_55\">section 499</a> of Indian Penal\nCode will have no application.
