Rathinam v.\n     Union of India (AIR 1994 SC 1844) held that the right to live of\n     which <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> speaks of can be said to bring in its trail the right not\n     to live a forced life, and therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_5\">section 309</a> violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21.</a>\n     This decision was, however, subsequently overruled in Gian Kaur v.\n     State of Punjab (AIR 1996 SC 946) by a Constitution Bench of the\n     Supreme Court, holding that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> cannot be construed to include\n     within it the &#x27;right to die&#x27; as a part of the fundamental right\n     guaranteed therein, and therefore, it cannot be said that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_8\">section 309</a> is\n     violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21.</a>\n\n           The Law Commission had undertaken revision of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian\n     Penal Code</a> as part of its function of revising Central Acts of general\n     application and importance. In its 42nd Report submitted in 1971, the\n\n\n                                      6\n Commission recommended, inter alia, repeal of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_11\">section 309</a>. The\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">Indian Penal Code</a> (Amendment) Bill, 1978, as passed by the Rajya\nSabha, accordingly provided for omission of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_13\">section 309</a>.\nUnfortunately, before it could be passed by the Lok Sabha, the Lok\nSabha was dissolved and the Bill lapsed. The Commission submitted\nits 156th Report in 1997 after the pronouncement of the judgement in\nGian Kaur, recommending retention of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_14\">section 309</a>.\n\n       However, it is felt that attempt to suicide may be regarded more\nas a manifestation of a diseased condition of mind deserving treatment\nand care rather than an offence to be visited with punishment. The\nSupreme Court in Gian Kaur focused on constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_15\">section\n309</a>. It did not go into the wisdom of retaining or continuing the same\nin the statute. In view of the views expressed by the World Health\nOrganization, the International Association for Suicide Prevention,\nFrance, decriminalization of attempted suicide by all countries in\nEurope and North America, the opinion of the Indian Psychiatric\nSociety, and the representations received by the Commission from\nvarious persons, the Commission has resolved to recommend to the\nGovernment to initiate steps for repeal of the anachronistic law\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_16\">section 309</a>, IPC, which would relieve the distressed of\nhis suffering. It needs mention here that only a handful of countries in\nthe world, like Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and India\nhave persisted with this undesirable law.\n\n       The criminal law must not act with misplaced overzeal and it is\nonly where it can prove to be apt and effective machinery to cure the\nintended evil that it should come into the picture.\n\n      With kind regards,\n\n                                                    (AR.

This indicates an increase of 3.7\nper cent over the previous year&#x27;s figure (1,13,914). The number of suicides\nin the country during the decade (1996-2006) has recorded an increase of\n33.9 per cent (from 88,241 in 1996 to 1,18,112 in 2006).2\n\n\n1.1.2 The overall male: female ratio of suicide victims for the year 2006\nwas 64:38; however, the proportion of boys: girls suicide victims (up to 14\nyears of age) was 48:52, i.e., almost equal number of young girls have\ncommitted suicide as their male counterparts. Youths (15-29 years) and\nlower middle-aged people (30-44 years) were the prime groups taking\nrecourse to the path of suicides. Around 35.7 per cent were youths in the age\ngroup of 15-29 years and 34.5 per cent were middle-aged persons in the age\ngroup of 30-44 years of the total suicide victims. Senior citizens have\naccounted for 7.7 per cent of the total victims. Social and economic causes\nhave led most of the males to commit suicides, whereas emotional and\npersonal causes have mainly driven females to end their lives.3\n\n\n1.2    Suicide (felo de se) means deliberate termination of one&#x27;s own\nphysical existence or self-murder, where a man of age of discretion and\ncompos mentis voluntarily kills himself. It is an act of voluntarily or\nintentionally taking one&#x27;s own life. Suicide needs to be distinguished from\neuthanasia or mercy-killing. Suicide by its very nature is an act of self-\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">  International Association for Suicide Prevention\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">2</span>\n  Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India - 2006, National Crime Records Bureau,\nMinistry of Home Affairs, Government of India\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">3</span>\n  ibid.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\"> killing or self-destruction, an act of terminating one&#x27;s own life sans the aid\nor assistance of any other human agency. Euthanasia, on the other hand,\ninvolves the intervention of other human agency to end the life. Euthanasia\nis nothing but homicide, and unless specifically excepted it is an offence. A\npriori, an attempt at mercy-killing is not an attempt to suicide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">1.3.1 Throughout history, suicide has been both condemned and\ncommended by various societies. Since the Middle Ages, society has used\nfirst the canonic and later the criminal law to combat suicide. Following the\nFrench Revolution of 1789 criminal penalties for attempting to commit\nsuicide were abolished in European countries, England being the last to\nfollow suit in 1961.4\n\n\n1.3.2 In England, the Suicide Act 1961 abrogated the law laying down that\nattempt to commit suicide is an offence. Although suicide is no longer an\noffence in itself, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide\nof another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, is guilty of an\noffence and liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to 14 years.5\n\n\n1.4.1 In India, not only abetment of suicide is an offence (vide <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_18\">section 306</a>,\nIPC), but also attempt to commit suicide is an offence (vide <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_19\">section 309</a>,\nIPC). <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 309</a>, IPC reads as under:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">4</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 11, Micropaedia, 15th ed.

Although completed act was not a crime,\nsurprisingly, attempt to commit the act was made an offence.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">1.5   Suicide is one of the important factors contributing to premature or\nunnatural end of precious human lives. It is a global problem and the World\nHealth Organization has in regard to attempted suicide expressed the view\nthat punishing with imprisonment a behaviour consequent to either a mental\ndisorder or a social difficulty gives completely a wrong message to the\npopulation, and that the WHO encourages efforts for the prevention of\nsuicide.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">1.6   The International Association for Suicide Prevention has also\nexpressed the view that attempted suicide should be decriminalized and that\nsuicidal individuals need to be helped and imprisonment only makes their\nproblems worse. The said Association on September 10 every year sponsors\n&#x27;World Suicide Prevention Day&#x27; as a part of its efforts to achieve effective\nsuicide prevention.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">1.7   In view of the above, the Law Commission suo motu decided to take\nup study of this important issue of suicide prevention.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      11</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> 2.

It is ironic that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 309</a> I.P.C. still\n         continues to be on our Penal Code. The result is that a young boy\n         driven to such frustration so as to seek one&#x27;s own life would have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">6</span>\n    1985 CriLJ 931\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                         12</span>\n          escaped human punishment if he had succeeded but is to be hounded\n         by the police, because attempt has failed. Strange paradox that in the\n         age of votaries of Euthanasia, suicide should be criminally\n         punishable. Instead of the society hanging its head in shame that\n         there should be such social strains that a young man (the hope of\n         tomorrow) should be driven to suicide compounds its inadequacy by\n         treating the boy as a criminal. Instead of sending the young boy to\n         psychiatric clinic it gleefully sends him to mingle with criminals, as if\n         trying its best to see that in future he does fall foul of the punitive\n         sections of the Penal Code. The continuance of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 309</a> I.P.C. is\n         an anachronism unworthy of a human society like ours. Medical\n         clinics for such social misfits certainly but police and prisons never.\n         The very idea is revolting. This concept seeks to meet the challenge of\n         social strains of modern urban and competitive economy by ruthless\n         suppression of mere symptoms - this attempt can only result in\n         failure. Need is for humane, civilized and socially oriented outlook\n         and penology. Many penal offences are the offshoots of an unjust\n         society and socially decadent outlook of love between young people\n         being frustrated by false consideration of code, community or social\n         pretensions. No wonder so long as society refuses to face this reality\n         its coercive machinery will invoke the provision like <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 309</a>\n         I.P.C. which has no justification right to continue remain on the\n         statute book.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"490515\" id=\"span_16\">2.4.1 In <a href=\"/doc/490515/\" id=\"a_30\">Maruti Shripati Dubal v. State of Maharashtra7</a>, the Bombay High\nCourt held that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_31\">section 309</a>, IPC is ultra vires the Constitution being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">7</span>\n    1987 CriLJ 743\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                         13</span>\n violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">21</a> thereof and must be struck down. It was\npointed out that the fundamental rights have their positive as well as\nnegative aspects. For example, the freedom of speech and expression\nincludes freedom not to speak and to remain silent. The freedom of\nassociation and movement likewise includes the freedom not to join any\nassociation or to move anywhere. The freedom of business and occupation\nincludes freedom not to do business and to close down the existing business.\nIf this is so, logically it must follow that right to live as recognized by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution will include also a right not to live or not to be\nforced to live. To put it positively, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> would include a right to die, or\nto terminate one&#x27;s life. The Court further pointed out that the language of\n<a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_36\">section 309</a>, IPC is sweeping in its nature. It does not define suicide. In fact,\nphilosophers, moralists and sociologists are not agreed upon what constitutes\nsuicide. What may be considered suicide in one community may not be\nconsidered so in another community and the different acts, though suicidal,\nmay be described differently in different circumstances and at different\ntimes in the same community. While some suicides are eulogized, others are\ncondemned. That is why perhaps wisely no attempt has been made by the\nlegislature to define either. The want of a plausible definition itself makes\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_37\">section 309</a> arbitrary and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 14.</a> There are\ndifferent mental, physical and social causes which may lead different\nindividuals to attempt to commit suicide for different ends and purposes,\nthere being nothing in common between them. <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 309</a> makes no\ndistinction between them and treats them alike, making the provisions\nthereof arbitrary. Further, the Court observed that if the purpose of the\npunishment for attempted suicide is to prevent the prospective suicides by\ndeterrence, the same is not achieved by punishing those who have made the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                       14</span>\n attempts, as no deterrence is going to hold back those who want to die for a\nsocial or political cause or to leave the world either because of the loss of\ninterest in life or for self-deliverance. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_40\">section 309</a> are\nunreasonable and arbitrary on this account also. As is rightly said,\narbitrariness and equality are enemies of each other. The blanket prohibition\non the right to die on pain of penalty, it was pointed out, is not reasonable.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">2.4.2 The High Court also observed that there is nothing unnatural about the\ndesire to die and hence the right to die. The means adopted for ending one&#x27;s\nlife may be unnatural varying from starvation to strangulation. But, the\ndesire which leads one to resort to the means is not unnatural. Suicide or an\nattempt to commit suicide is not a feature of a normal life. It is an incident of\nabnormality or of an extraordinary situation or of an uncommon trait of\npersonality. Abnormality and uncommonality are not unnatural merely\nbecause they are exceptional.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">2.4.3 The High Court further observed that the right to die or to end one&#x27;s\nlife is not something new or unknown to civilization. Some religions like\nHindu and Jain have approved of the practice of ending one&#x27;s life by one&#x27;s\nown act in certain circumstances while condemning it in other\ncircumstances. The attitude of Buddhism has been ambiguous though it has\nencouraged suicide under certain circumstances such as in the service of\nreligion and country. Neither the old nor the new Testament has condemned\nsuicide explicitly. However, Christianity has condemned suicide as a form of\nmurder. In contrast, the Quran has declared it a crime worse than homicide.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       15</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\"> 2.4.4 The High Court quoted the eminent French sociologist, Emile\nDurkheim&#x27;s threefold classification of suicides made on the basis of the\ndisturbance in the relationship between society and the individual: (i)\nEgoistic suicide which results when abnormal individualism weakens\nsociety&#x27;s control over him; the individual in such cases lacks concern for the\ncommunity with which he is inadequately involved; (ii) Altruistic suicide\nwhich is due to an excessive sense of duty to community; and (iii) Anomic\nsuicide which is due to society&#x27;s failure to control and regulate the behaviour\nof individuals. This classification is not regarded as adequate by many, but\ngives us the broad causative factors of suicide. It is estimated that about one-\nthird of the people who kill themselves have been found to have been\nsuffering from mental illness. The Court observed that those who make the\nsuicide attempt on account of the mental disorders require psychiatric\ntreatment and not confinement in the prison cells where their condition is\nbound to worsen leading to further mental derangement. Those on the other\nhand who make the suicide attempt on account of acute physical ailments,\nincurable diseases, torture or decrepit physical state induced by old age or\ndisablement need nursing homes and not prisons to prevent them from\nmaking the attempts again.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"542988\" id=\"span_21\">2.5.1 In <a href=\"/doc/542988/\" id=\"a_41\">P. Rathinam v.

Quoting from a lecture of Harvard University\nProfessor of Law and Psychiatry, Alan A Stone, the Supreme Court noted\nthat right to die inevitably leads to the right to commit suicide. However, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">8</span>\n    AIR 1994 SC 1844\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                      16</span>\n Supreme Court disagreed with the view of the Bombay High Court that\n<a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_44\">section 309</a> is also violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 14.</a> Dealing with the argument\nrelating to the want of a plausible definition of suicide, the Supreme Court\nobserved that irrespective of the differences as to what constitutes suicide,\nsuicide is capable of a broad definition and that there is no doubt that it is\nintentional taking of one&#x27;s life, as stated at page 1521 of Encyclopaedia of\nCrime and Justice, Volume IV, 1983 Edn. As for the reason that <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_46\">section 309</a>\ntreats all attempts to commit suicide by the same measure without regard to\nthe circumstances in which attempts are made, the Supreme Court held that\nthis also cannot make the said section as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 14</a>, inasmuch as\nthe nature, gravity and extent of attempt may be taken care of by tailoring\nthe sentence appropriately; in certain cases, even <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_48\">Probation of Offenders Act</a>\ncan be pressed into service, whose <a href=\"/doc/1678715/\" id=\"a_49\">section 12</a> enables the court to ensure that\nno stigma or disqualification is attached to such a person.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">2.5.2 The Supreme Court observed that suicide, the intentional taking of\none&#x27;s life has probably been a part of human behaviour since prehistory.\nVarious social forces, like the economy, religion and socio-economic status\nare responsible for suicides. There are various theories of suicide, to wit,\nsociological, psychological, biochemical and environmental. Suicide knows\nno barrier of race, religion, caste, age or sex. There is secularization of\nsuicide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">2.5.3 The Supreme Court further observed that suicide is a psychiatric\nproblem and not a manifestation of criminal instinct. What is needed to take\ncare of suicide-prone persons are soft words and wise counseling (of a\npsychiatrist), and not stony dealing by a jailor following harsh treatment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                      17</span>\n meted out by a heartless prosecutor. It is a matter of extreme doubt whether\nby booking a person who has attempted to commit suicide to trial, suicides\ncan be taken care of.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">2.5.4 The Supreme Court expressed the view that section 309 of the Penal\nCode deserves to be effaced from the statute book to humanize our penal\nlaws. It is a cruel and irrational provision, as it may result in punishing a\nperson again (doubly) who has suffered agony and would be undergoing\nignominy because of his failure to commit suicide. An act of suicide cannot\nbe said to be against religion, morality or public policy, and an act of\nattempted suicide has no baneful effect on society. Further, suicide or\nattempt to commit it causes no harm to others, because of which State&#x27;s\ninterference with the personal liberty of the concerned persons is not called\nfor.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">2.5.5 The Supreme Court also observed that the view taken by it would\nadvance not only the cause of humanization, which is a need of the day, but\nof globalization also, as by effacing section 309, we would be attuning this\npart of our criminal law to the global wavelength.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_25\">2.6      In <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_50\">Gian Kaur v.

The\n      antiquity and general prevalence of the practice may be inferred\n      from the fact that the Jaina ascetics, too, consider it particularly\n      meritorious.&quot;&#x27;\n\n\n16.32.

Thus even where the punishment\n      for attempt to commit suicide is not considered desirable, its\n      abetment is made a penal offence.           In other words assisted\n      suicide and assisted attempt to commit suicide are made\n      punishable for cogent reasons in the interest of society.

Right to life is a natural right\n      embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 21</a> but suicide is an unnatural termination\n      or extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and\n      inconsistent with the concept of &#x27;right to life&#x27;.     With respect\n      and in all humility, we find no similarity in the nature of the\n      other rights, such as the right to &#x27;freedom of speech&#x27; etc. to\n      provide a comparable basis to hold that the &#x27;right to life&#x27; also\n      includes the &#x27;right to die&#x27;.

On the question of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 14</a>, the Court agreed\nwith the view taken by Hansaria J. in <a href=\"/doc/542988/\" id=\"a_99\">P.

Verma J. further observed that the argument &quot;on the desirability\nof retaining such a penal provision of punishing attempted suicide,\nincluding the recommendation for its deletion by the Law\nCommission are not sufficient to indicate that the provision is\nunconstitutional being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 14.</a> Even if those facts are\nto weigh, the severity of the provision is mitigated by the wide\ndiscretion in the matter of sentencing since there is no requirement of\nawarding any minimum sentence and the sentence of imprisonment is\nnot even compulsory.      There is also no minimum fine prescribed as\nsentence, which alone may be the punishment awarded on conviction\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_101\">section 309</a>, IPC.     This aspect is noticed in P. Rathinam for\nholding that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 14</a> is not violated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">8.14. The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in Smt. Gian Kaur has thus\ncategorically affirmed that right to life in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 21</a> does not include\nthe right to die. Consequently section 309 which penalises attempt to\ncommit suicide is not unconstitutional.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">8.15. There    is   a   school   of   thought   which   advocates   the\ndecriminalization of the offence of attempt to commit suicide. They\nplead for a compassionate and sympathetic treatment for those who\nfail in their attempt to put an end to their lives.     They argue that\ndeletion of section 309 is not an invitation or encouragement to\nattempt to commit suicide. A person indulges in the act of attempt to\ncommit suicide for various reasons some of which at times are beyond\nhis control.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                 29</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">       8.16. On the other hand, certain developments such as rise in narcotic\n      drug-trafficking offences, terrorism in different parts of the country,\n      the phenomenon of human bombs etc. have led to a rethinking on the\n      need to keep attempt to commit suicide an offence.      For instance, a\n      terrorist or drug trafficker who fails in his/her attempt to consume the\n      cyanide pill and the human bomb who fails in the attempt to kill\n      himself or herself along with the targets of attack, have to be charged\n      under section 309 and investigations be carried out to prove the\n      offence. These groups of offenders under section 309 stand under a\n      different category than those, who due to psychological and religious\n      reasons, attempt to commit suicide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">      8.17. Accordingly, we recommend that section 309 should continue\n      to be an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_104\">Indian Penal Code</a> and clause 131 of the\n      Bill be deleted.&#x27;\n\n\n3.4   The Supreme Court upheld that constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_105\">section 309</a>,\nIPC only by applying the relevant principles to adjudge the constitutional\nvalidity of the provisions thereof.    It did not go into the desirability of\nhaving the same in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_106\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">4.    OTHER VIEWS\n\n\n4.1   Shri Justice Jahagirdar has expressed his view in his article entitled\n&quot;Attempt At Suicide - A Crime or A Cry&quot; in the following words:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                      30</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"> &quot;A man commits suicide for various reasons and in diverse\ncircumstances. The aim, in all cases, is to get deliverance from the\nseveral real or imaginary misfortunes to which that person is\nsubjected.    If he is successful in his attempt, it is regarded as\ndeliverance; if unsuccessful it is regarded as an offence. Survival is\nan offence.    It is impossible to find any rational justification for\ninflicting a punishment upon a person who has made an attempt to\nescape punishment which he thinks society is inflicting upon him. Is\nsurvival itself not sufficient punishment? ... Over a long period,\nfortunately, the attitude towards suicide and attempted suicide has\nchanged and most civilised countries have done away with the\nconcept of attempted suicide as an offence. &#x27;Suicide&#x27;, said Goethe, &#x27;is\nan incident in human life which, however much disputed and\ndiscussed, demands sympathy of every man and in every age must be\ndealt with anew&#x27;. That attempted suicide is a matter for treatment and\nnot punishment has been recognised by several countries.    After the\nFrench Revolution in 1789, attempted suicide was abolished as an\noffence in France and subsequently in all European countries.\nEngland, as usual, was laggard in reforms, but fortunately in 1961 by\nthe Suicide Act, the &#x27;crime&#x27; of attempted suicide was abolished. In\nUSSR and in most of the states in the US, it is not an offence. It was\naccepted that suicide is the result of psychological disturbances\nimpervious to rational deterrents. In England a society called The\nSamaritans provides psychological support to those contemplating\nsuicide. ... Most of the cases are psychiatric. ... The presence of\nSection 309 of the Penal Code is thus not only irrational and\nobnoxious but also positively harmful to the members of a society for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                               31</span>\n       whose benefit it is supposed to be on the statute book. As a result of\n      this provision existing on the statute book, people needing mental\n      treatment who are driven to commit suicide are prevented from\n      seeking the same for fear of being punished. ... Which is the theory of\n      punishment which informs <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_107\">section 309</a> of the IPC? It cannot be\n      deterrent because a man commits the act for reasons beyond his\n      control; it cannot be reformative because a sick man is thrown among\n      the felons. The punitive theory is wholly irrelevant because the person\n      attempting suicide does no wrong to others. In sum, the attempt to\n      commit suicide cannot and should not be regarded as an offence. It is\n      not committed by a person who wants to hurt anyone; it is not resorted\n      to by one with criminal intention. Suicide and attempted suicide are\n      difficult to define. An act which cannot be defined precisely cannot be\n      punished. Suicide is attempted by people for reasons beyond their\n      control. They need sympathy, care, love and treatment. By branding\n      such people as &#x27;criminals&#x27;, treatment is rendered difficult. Punishment\n      for attempted suicide is unsupportable by any recognized theory of\n      punishment. ... What the &#x27;abolitionists&#x27; of Section 309 are asking for\n      is a fair treatment for those unfortunate, hapless people who fail in\n      their attempts to commit suicide. The deletion of Section 309 is not an\n      invitation or encouragement to attempt to commit suicide. ... Do not\n      punish the helpless; help the helpless.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">4.2   The World Health Organization, on knowing the efforts of the NGO,\nthe SNEHA, Suicide Prevention Centre, for prevention of suicide, stated to\nthem that having suicidal behaviours specified by law as a punishable\noffence has many negative effects at a public health level. Moreover,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                      32</span>\n punishing with imprisonment a behaviour consequent to either a mental\ndisorder or a social difficulty gives a completely wrong message to the\npopulation. There is now evidence from countries that have repealed\nsimilarly old legislation, of the overall improvement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">4.3   The President of the International Association for Suicide Prevention,\nFrance, has, vide his letter of 9 October 2007 addressed to Hon&#x27;ble Minister\nof Law and Justice, Government of India, strongly supported withdrawal of\nthe status of attempted suicide as a punishable offence. He has stated that\nmost countries in the world who have had laws criminalizing attempted\nsuicide have withdrawn those laws in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, justifying the withdrawal by the belief that attempting suicide is not\na crime that should be punished but rather a desperate reaction to a difficult\nlife situation by people who usually suffer from a mental disorder. These\nchanges have indicated awareness that suicidal individuals need to be helped\nand imprisonment only makes their problem worse. One of the fears\nexpressed when all countries in Europe and North America decriminalized\nattempted suicide was that suicide rates may increase. There are no\nindications whatsoever that there was an increase in suicides following\ndecriminalization, and in many instances it is thought that suicide decreased\nsince more suicidal individuals received the help they need. Countries such\nas Singapore, which still imprison some suicide attempters, do not appear to\nhave any benefits from those practices. For example, in Singapore suicide\nrates have been increasing in recent years despite their having suicide as a\npunishable offence. The International Association for Suicide Prevention\nwishes India to join the countries of the world, who have decriminalized\nattempted suicide in order to clearly communicate to suicidal individuals\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                      33</span>\n that they should seek help, rather than avoid admitting to their problems for\nfear of imprisonment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">4.4   The SNEHA, Chennai is of the opinion that the continuance of the\narchaic law in India, like <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_108\">section 309</a>, IPC, is proving to be\ncounterproductive to the cause of suicide prevention. In many countries,\nincluding the whole of Europe, North America, much of South America and\nAsia, including neighbouring Sri Lanka, attempted suicide is not a criminal\noffence any more. Many who resort to suicide and who manage to survive\ndo not seek medical help for fear of being arrested and penalized. Suicide is\na &quot;cry for help&quot;. People who attempt suicide need extensive and sometimes\nlong-term psycho-social support. The panacea for them certainly cannot be\nimprisonment. They need compassion, emotional support and sometimes\neven psychiatric help. If the act of attempted suicide were to be\ndecriminalized it will make things more workable and easier for all to extend\ntheir hand and support in reducing suicide in India. It will encourage those\nwho attempted suicide to seek medical and professional help immediately\nwithout fear or inhibition. Only a handful of countries in the world, like\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and India have persisted with\nthis law. The apprehension that the repeal of the law would cause an\nincrease in suicides is belied by the fact that Sri Lanka repealed the law four\nyears ago and the suicide rate is showing a trend in reduction. In the opinion\nof the SNEHA, the persistence of this law leads to following difficulties:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      1.     Emergency treatment for those who have attempted suicide is\n             not readily accessible as they are referred by local hospitals and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                      34</span>\n             doctors to tertiary centres as it is termed as Medico Legal case.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">            The time lost in the golden hour will save many lives.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">      2.    Those who attempt suicide are already distressed and in\n            psychological pain and for them to face the ignominy of police\n            interrogation causes increased distress, shame, guilt and further\n            suicide attempt.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">      3.    At the time of family turmoil dealing with police procedure\n            adds to the woes of the family.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">      4.    It also leads to a gross under-reporting of attempted suicide and\n            the magnitude of the problem is not unknown.       Unless one is\n            aware of the nature of extent of the problem effective\n            intervention is not possible.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">      5.    As many attempted suicides are categorized in the guise of\n            accidental poisoning etc. emotional and mental health support is\n            not available to those who have attempted as they are unable to\n            access the services.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">4.5   It will be advantageous to quote the following paragraphs from\nRatanlal &amp; Dhirajlal&#x27;s Law of Crimes (26th Edn., 2007, pages 1825-1827):\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      &quot;Right to live: General - Every civilized legal system recognizes\n      right to life.

Thus,\n      right to life is also considered to be a duty to live.         Ordinarily,\n      therefore, an individual has no right to end his life. He has to perform\n      his duties towards himself and towards the society at large.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      Right to live: Ambit and scope - It is settled law that life does not\n      mean &#x27;animal existence&#x27;.

If a person is living a miserable life or is\nseriously sick or having incurable disease, it is improper as well as\nimmoral to ask him to live a painful life and to suffer agony. It is an\ninsult to humanity. Right to live means right to live peacefully as\nordinary human being.        One can appreciate the theory that an\nindividual may not be permitted to die with a view to avoiding his\nsocial obligations.     He should perform all duties towards fellow\ncitizens. At the same time, however, if he is unable to take normal\ncare of his body or has lost all the senses and if his real desire is to\nquit the world, he cannot be compelled to continue with torture and\npainful life.

RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n5.1   Suicide occurs in all ages. Life is a gift given by God and He alone\ncan take it. Its premature termination cannot be approved by any society. But\nwhen a troubled individual tries to end his life, it would be cruel and\nirrational to visit him with punishment on his failure to die. It is his deep\nunhappiness which causes him to try to end his life. Attempt to suicide is\nmore a manifestation of a diseased condition of mind deserving of treatment\nand care rather than punishment. It would not be just and fair to inflict\nadditional legal punishment on a person who has already suffered agony and\nignominy in his failure to commit suicide.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">5.2   The criminal law must not act with misplaced overzeal and it is only\nwhere it can prove to be apt and effective machinery to cure the intended\nevil that it should come into the picture.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">5.3   <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 309</a> of the Indian Penal Code provides double punishment for\na person who has already got fed up with his own life and desires to end it.\nSection 309 is also a stumbling block in prevention of suicides and\nimproving the access of medical care to those who have attempted suicide. It\nis unreasonable to inflict punishment upon a person who on account of\nfamily discord, destitution, loss of a dear relation or other cause of a like\nnature overcomes the instinct of self-preservation and decides to take his\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                       38</span>\n own life.    In such a case, the unfortunate person deserves sympathy,\ncounselling and appropriate treatment, and certainly not the prison.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">5.4   Section 309 needs to be effaced from the statute book because the\nprovision is inhuman, irrespective of whether it is constitutional or\nunconstitutional. The repeal of the anachronistic law contained in <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_115\">section\n309</a> of the Indian Penal Code would save many lives and relieve the\ndistressed of his suffering.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">5.5   The Commission is of the view that while assisting or encouraging\nanother person to (attempt to) commit suicide must not go unpunished, the\noffence of attempt to commit suicide under section 309 needs to be omitted\nfrom the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_116\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">5.6   We recommend accordingly.</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n\n\n\n\n                     (Dr. Justice AR.
