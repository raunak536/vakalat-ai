We, therefore, direct that the currency of a Suspension Order should not extend\n      beyond three months if within this period the Memorandum of Charges/Chargesheet is\n      not served on the delinquent officer/employee; if the Memorandum of\n      Charges/Chargesheet is served a reasoned order must be passed for the extension of\n      the suspension. As in the case in hand, the Government is free to transfer the\n      concerned person to any Department in any of its offices within or outside the State so\n      as to sever any local or personal contact that he may have and which he may misuse\n      for obstructing the investigation against him. The Government may also prohibit him\n      from contacting any person, or handling records and documents till the stage of his\n      having to prepare his defence. We think this will adequately safeguard the universally\n      recognized principle of human dignity and the right to a speedy trial and shall also\n      preserve the interest of the Government in the prosecution. We recognize that\n      previous Constitution Benches have been reluctant to quash proceedings on the\n      grounds of delay, and to set time limits to their duration. However, the imposition of a\n      limit on the period of suspension has not been discussed in prior case law, and would\n      not be contrary to the interests of justice. Furthermore, the direction of the Central\n      Vigilance Commission that pending a criminal investigation departmental proceedings\n      are to be held in abeyance stands superseded in view of the stand adopted by us.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                                                                                   Page No.# 6/43\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"8766447\" id=\"span_9\">12)       It has been submitted on behalf of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the\naforesaid decision in <a href=\"/doc/8766447/\" id=\"a_10\">Ajay Kumar Choudhury</a> (Supra) had laid down the law regarding the\nscope of continued suspension, whether the suspension order was issued in contemplation of\ndepartmental enquiry or deemed to have been issued upon the employee arrested in\nconnection with criminal offence.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">13)       It is the contention of the petitioners that as far as suspension is concerned,\nwhether be it under Rule 6 (1) or Rule 6 (2) of the Assam Services (Discipline and Appeal)\nRules, 1964, the nature of suspension is the same and these ought to be governed by the\nsame yardsticks as regards continuation as suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">14)      It is the submission advanced on behalf of the petitioners that irrespective of the\nnature of the suspension, whether in contemplation of a departmental enquiry or arising out\nof arrest in a criminal case, if there be no review of the suspension order within ninety (90)\ndays and if the departmental proceeding or the trial had not been initiated in the meantime, it\nwould be liable to interfere with.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15)       The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court accordingly, held that prolonged suspension                is\nundesirable and as a consequence, if any suspension has not been reviewed on completion of\nninety (90) days for continuation, the same would be vitiated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8766447\" id=\"span_10\">16)      The aforesaid contention of the petitioners has been refuted by Mr. M.

It has been mentioned under Para no. 2.1.1 read\nwith Para no. 2.1.8 of the Manual that where a suspension has been made in contemplation\nof a departmental enquiry, the charges should be served within a period of three (03)\nmonths, failing which the Government servant should be reinstated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">      It has been further provided that in event the same is not possible, the authority\nconcerned should move the Personnel Department through the Administrative Department\nwell before expiry of three (03) months by explaining the reasons with a letter detailing the\nnature of allegations and reasons for which charges could not be prepared, so that the\nPersonnel Department could advise whether any further extension of the period of suspension\nshould be permitted or not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">20)      Thus, the aforesaid executive instructions clearly lay down that under normal\ncircumstances, suspension issued under Rule 6 (1) of the Rules should not be extended\nbeyond three (03) months and if extension is necessary, the same must be done in\nconsultation with the Personnel Department.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">21)      However, no such time period nor requirement for consultation with the Personnel\nDepartment has been specifically provided in case of suspension arising out of detention in\npolice custody under Rule 6 (2) of the Assam Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">22)      On the other hand, Para 2.2.2 of the Manual dealing with Rule 6 (2) merely states\nthat a government servant who is detained in custody under any law or as a result of a\nproceeding either on a criminal charge or for his arrest for debt shall, if the period of\ndetention exceeds 48 hours and unless he is already under suspension, be deemed to be\n                                                                                    Page No.# 8/43\n\nunder suspension from the date of detention until further orders.\nIt has been accordingly, submitted that as regards deemed suspension because of arrest\nunder Rule 6 (2), there is no such limitation of time period for suspension or review,\nstipulated under the Manual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"234132\" id=\"span_12\">It has been submitted that it would be impermissible to read into the statute or rules,\nsomething which is not there, when the rules are clearly and unambiguous, as held in <a href=\"/doc/234132/\" id=\"a_13\">Rajiv\nKumar</a> (Supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">23)      Mr. M.

An order of suspension may be passed by way of\n            punishment in terms of the conduct rules. An order of suspension can also be\n            passed by the employer in exercise of its inherent power in the sense that it may\n            not take any work from the delinquent officer but in that event, the entire salary is\n            required to be paid. An order of suspension can also be passed, if such a provision\n            exists in the rule laying down that in place of the full salary, the delinquent officer\n            shall be paid only the subsistence allowance specified therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">35)      It is now thus, well settled that while an employee can be placed under suspension\nin contemplation of or during the pendency of a departmental enquiry or any criminal case, it\ncan be also issued as a mode of punishment depending on the service rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">36)      In the present cases we are not dealing with suspension of an employee as a\npunishment. In the present cases, the suspensions have been made either on the ground of\ncontemplation of a departmental proceeding or during the pendency of a criminal proceeding\nand after the petitioners were arrested and detained in criminal cases beyond 48 hours. The\ncommon denomination which runs through these petitions is that neither the enquiry in\nrespect of disciplinary proceedings nor the criminal trial has started.

[See <a href=\"/doc/1388803/\" id=\"a_24\">R.P. Kapur v.

Ashok Kumar Aggarwal</a>, (2013) 16 SCC 147 that,\n           &quot;27. Suspension is a device to keep the delinquent out of the mischief range. The\n           purpose is to complete the proceedings unhindered. Suspension is an interim\n           measure in the aid of disciplinary proceedings so that the delinquent may not gain\n           custody or control of papers or take any advantage of his position. .......................&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">38)       Even though suspension, in contemplation of a departmental enquiry or during the\npendency of enquiry or trial is not considered to be a punishment, there is overwhelming\nview of various High Courts and also of the Apex Court that suspension should not be\ncontinued for an unreasonably long period because of the disadvantageous position to which\na suspended employee is placed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">39)       Even when suspension may not be by way of punishment as in the present case, it\ncan be stigmatic.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">40)       Order of suspension issued in contemplation of or during a disciplinary proceeding or\ncriminal proceeding, though does not amount to punishment, because of the very nature of\nthe action, puts a mark on the functioning of an employee, in the sense that he is prevented\nfrom discharging his normal duties and functions and he does not enjoy his full entitlements\nin terms of salary, allowances and also stakes. To that extent, it has the attributes of a\nstigmatic action. Stigma as per Oxford Dictionary, means &quot; a mark of disgrace associated with\na           particular          circumstance,            quality,         or           person &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/stigma ].

Ashok Kumar Aggarwal</a>, (2013) 16 SCC 147 that the order of\nsuspension should be passed very carefully after taking into consideration all the relevant\nfactors and not in a mechanical and routine manner and by keeping into account the gravity\nof the misconduct. It was observed as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          &quot;19. During suspension, the relationship of master and servant continues between\n          the employer and the employee. However, the employee is forbidden to perform\n          his official duties. Thus, a suspension order does not put an end to the service.\n          Suspension means the action of debarring for the time being from a function or\n          privilege or temporary deprivation of working in the office. In certain cases,\n          suspension may cause stigma even after exoneration in the departmental\n          proceedings or acquittal by the criminal court, but it cannot be treated as a\n          punishment even by any stretch of imagination in the strict legal sense.

It would not be as an administrative routine or an\n                   automatic order to suspend an employee. It should be on consideration of\n                   the gravity of the alleged misconduct or the nature of the allegations\n                   imputed to the delinquent employee. The court or the Tribunal must\n                   consider each case on its own facts and no general law could be <a href=\"/doc/399238/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down\n                   in</a> that behalf. ...

It cannot be actuated by mala fide, arbitrariness,\n          or for ulterior purpose. Effect on public interest due to the employee&#x27;s continuation\n          in office is also a relevant and determining factor. The facts of each case have to\n          be taken into consideration as no formula of universal application can be <a href=\"/doc/399238/\" id=\"a_30\">laid down\n          in</a> this regard. However, suspension order should be passed only where there is a\n          strong prima facie case against the delinquent, and if the charges stand proved,\n          would ordinarily warrant imposition of major punishment i.e. removal or dismissal\n          from service, or reduction in rank, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">42)     In the aforesaid case of Ashok Kumar Aggarwal, (supra), the Supreme Court also\nnoted that suspension, because of the attending circumstances can be stigmatic, in the\nfollowing words,\n          &quot;29. ...................................However, as the suspension order constitutes a great\n          hardship to the person concerned as it leads to reduction in emoluments,\n          adversely affects his prospects of promotion and also carried a stigma, an order of\n          suspension should not be made in a perfunctory or in a routine and casual manner\n          but with due care and caution after taking all factors into account .&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">                                                                                Page No.# 15/43\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1769966\" id=\"span_26\">43)      It was also observed in <a href=\"/doc/1769966/\" id=\"a_31\">O.P.

It has\nbeen mentioned that suspension pending a department enquiry is only an administrative\nmeasure and is not a punishment and that public interest should be the guiding factor and\nthe disciplinary authority should not suspend a government servant lightly and without\nsufficient justification and the authority should exercise discretion with utmost care. [Paras\n2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of the Manual]\n                                                                                Page No.# 20/43\n\n      It has been also provided under Para 2.1.4 of the Manual that although suspension is\nnot a punishment by itself, it cannot be denied at the same time that in such cases the\nofficers placed under suspension suffers a lot. Apart from it, the suspension of a government\nservant is a liability to the Government. The purpose of placing a government servant under\nsuspension is not to inflict punishment but to safeguard against further loss to Government,\nmanipulation of records, intimation of witnesses or embarrassment to Government in the\npublic eye where moral turpitude is involved. It was accordingly, impressed upon that the\nperiod of suspension should be reduced to the barest minimum and therefore, it is necessary\nto conclude the proceedings drawn up as quickly as possible and in any case if it is not\npossible to do so due to reasons beyond control, the persons proceeded against may be\nallowed to resume their duties, whereever possible in places away from their former places of\nduty by vacating the suspension order as to save the Government expenditure in the event of\nhis acquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">      Para 2.1.5 further enunciates the general principles to be kept in mind while placing an\nemployee under suspension as referred to under Paras 2.1.6, 2.1.7 and 2.1.8 of the Manual.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">      The aforesaid paragraphs, being very relevant are reproduced herein below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       &quot;2.1.1.

In all cases of suspension the elementary justice demands that\nthe period of suspension should be reduced to the barest minimum. It is, therefore,\nnecessary to conclude proceedings drawn up as quickly as possible and in any case if it\nis not possible to do so due to reasons beyond control, the persons proceeded against\nmay be allowed to resume their duties, where possible in places away from their\nformer place of duty, vacating the suspension order so as to save Government\nexpenditure in the event of his acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">2.1.5.

Nath has harped on to contend that it is only in\nrespect of suspension made under Rule 6 (1), which would require review by the\nAdministrative Department with the advice of the Personnel Department within three months\nfrom the date of suspension during which time the charges and statement of allegations\nshould be served, failing which the government employee should be reinstated. According to\n                                                                                 Page No.# 24/43\n\nSri M. Nath, Learned Standing Counsel, such provisions not being provided in respect of\ndeemed suspension under Rule 6 (2) of the Rules, suspension under Rule 6 (2) beyond three\nmonths cannot be held to be illegal. According to him, suspension can continue till the\nAuthority revokes it as provided under Rule 6 (2) read with Para no. 2.2.2. referred to above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">58)      This Court having considered the relevant provisions of the rules and materials on\nrecord and judicial pronouncements referred to above, and after hearing the parties however,\nis unable to be persuaded to accept the plea of the State Government/Department that as\nthe rules do not specifically provide for furnishing charges/statement of allegations within\nthree months and also for undertaking any exercise of review within three months in the\nevent of failure to provide the same to the Government employee, continuation of deemed\nsuspension made under Rule 6(2) beyond three months would not be illegal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">59)      As far as suspension is concerned, there is no uniform set of rules applicable for all\nclasses of employees. Different services under the States and the Union have their respective\nservice rules which provide for different regulations. So is the case with suspension. However,\nthrough a long line of judicial decisions, certain principles have evolved as discussed above in\nthe preceding paragraphs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">      There is, however, almost unanimity in judicial decisions that, though suspension made\nin contemplation of or during enquiry/trial may not be punishment, it should be invoked very\ncarefully by weighing all the relevant factors and only in very serious cases of misconduct or\noffences which would normally result in dismissal, removal and termination from service and\nthat suspension should not be unduly prolonged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">      Of course, there seems to be no unanimity as regards the effect of prolonged\nsuspension. It also depends on the particular service rules governing the field. For example,\nin case of suspension under Rule 10 of the CCS (CCS) Rules, 1964, Sub-rule 7 has specifically\nprovided that an order of suspension made or deemed to have been made under Sub-rule (1)\nor (2) of Rule 10 shall not be valid after a period of ninety days unless it is extended after\nreview. In such a situation, any suspension covered by Sub-rule 7 may be liable to be set\naside after ninety days.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">                                                                                Page No.# 25/43\n\n\n\n      The issue is what is to be done where the rules do not specifically provide for the same,\nas in the present case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">60)      As observed above, if the suspension order was issued under Rule 6(1) of the Assam\nServices (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules, 1964, there would not be much difficulty. Rule 6 (1)\nread with the Manual would make it clear that if the charges/statement of allegations are not\nfurnished to the Government employee within three months, the employee would be entitled\nto be reinstated in service, provided that where these are not so furnished within three\nmonths, the suspension can be extended by holding a review and with the advice of the\nDepartment of Personnel.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">      In the present case, the issue relates to suspension orders deemed to be issued under\nRule 6(2) of the Assam Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules, 1964. Admittedly, the Rule\n6(2) as well as the Manual are silent on this issue. It is because of this reason that the\nState/Department has contended that suspension under Rule 6(2) beyond three months\nwithout furnishing the charges and without advice of the Department of Personnel does not\nnecessarily render such suspension bad in law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">61)      This Court however, is unable to accept this plea for the reasons discussed herein\nbelow.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">62)      Though suspension of a government employee can be made either under Rule 6(1)\nor Rule 6(2) of the Assam Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules, 1964, there is virtually no\ndifference between the two situations, except for the immediate cause triggering the\nsuspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">63)      In one case, under Rule 6 (1), it is made on the basis of certain complaint against\nthe government employee because of which the Authority contemplates to hold a\ndepartmental enquiry or when the employee is found to be engaged in activities prejudicial to\nthe interest or security of the State, (which obviously would necessitate holding a\ndepartmental enquiry) or where a case against him of any criminal offence is under\n                                                                                Page No.# 26/43\n\ninvestigation, inquiry or trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"234132\" id=\"span_28\">On the other hand, Rule 6(2) is automatically invoked when the Government employee\nis arrested and detained in custody beyond forty eight hours. By operation of law, such a\ndetained employee is deemed to have been placed under suspension from the date of\ndetention. Because of this deeming provision, even formal order of suspension need not be\nissued. [See: <a href=\"/doc/234132/\" id=\"a_33\">Union of India Vs. Rajiv Kumar</a> (2003) 6 SCC 516]\n      Thus, the difference is the circumstance immediately obtaining before an employee is\nplaced under suspension. Rule 6(2) comes into play when the employee has been arrested\nand detained in custody for more than 48 hrs.\n      Apart from the difference in the immediate cause or circumstance, leading to the\nsuspension, otherwise, once the suspension order has been issued/deemed to have been\nissued, there is no more difference as regards the effects, consequences, liabilities as far as\nthe suspended employees are concerned.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">An employee placed under suspension under Rule 6 (2) is not placed under a graver or\nstricter legal regime. He is subjected to the same liabilities and obligations as any other\nemployee suspended under Rule 6(1). In fact he enjoys the same rights. He will get similar\nsubsistence allowances and will be subjected to the same restrictions. The only difference\nmay be manner in which the suspended employee will be proceeded. In the case of the\nemployee suspended under Rule 6(2), he will be subjected to the normal criminal process. In\naddition, he may have to face departmental proceeding also. However, an employee\nsuspended under Rule 6(1) will be proceeded departmentally. He may however, be also liable\nto be proceeded under the criminal process, if he has been suspended under Sub-rule 1(c) of\nRule 6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">      Therefore, in the post suspension period, employees suspended under Rule 6(1) or Rule\n6(2) cannot be compartmentalized, and categorized separately and dealt with differently, as if\nthese two categories are different and mutually incompatible. In fact, in the post suspension\nperiod, there is no substantial difference between those two categories. Difference is only in\nthe pre-suspension period i.e. the reason for placing the employee under suspension.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">                                                                                Page No.# 27/43\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">64)       This difference in placing an employee under suspension is merely in the\nmethodology and semantic and not in substance, for the intention and purpose for placing an\nemployee under suspension under Rule 6(1) and Rule 6(2) are the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">      In the first case under Rule 6(1), an employee is placed by the Authority by a conscious\nact of the Authority upon receipt or becoming aware of certain misconduct which warrants\ndisciplinary proceeding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">      In the second situation, the Authority itself may not be aware of the misconduct but\ngets invoked by operation of law automatically after being arrested and detained in\nconnection with any criminal case beyond 48 hrs. In such a situation, Rule 6(2) gets activated\nby itself, by way of a legal fiction and he shall be deemed to have been placed under\nsuspension from the time of arrest and detention provided it is more than 48 hours, even if\nthe Authority does not become aware of the arrest and detention. Because of this it has been\nheld that even in absence of any formal order to this effect, a person will be deemed to be\nsuspended once he has been arrested and detained beyond 48 hrs. This deeming and\nenabling provision for suspension has been provided, for the law presumes that if an\nemployee gets arrested and is detained beyond 48 hours, the matter warrants serious\nconsideration by the Authority by keeping him away from active duty, as in the manner a\nperson is placed under Rule 6(1). The presumption is that an accused person has to be\ninvariably produced within 24 hours of his detention before a Magistrate and if he is not\nreleased on the first production, there is every possibility that there are some incriminating\nmaterial against him\n      Under Rule 6 (1), the Authority considers that the misconduct alleged is serious enough\nwhich warrants proceeding against him departmentally for punishment and accordingly,\nplaces him under suspension to ensure smooth holding of departmental enquiry and for\neffectuating the purposes mentioned under Para 2.1.2 to Para 2.1.7 of the Manual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">      Under Rule 6(2), the law gets activated without the initiative of the Authority and the\ndeeming provision comes into play once an employee is arrested and detained more than 48\nhrs in connection with any criminal case. Law contemplates that such a person should be also\nplaced under suspension to achieve the same purpose as contemplated under Para 2.1.4,\n                                                                                   Page No.# 28/43\n\n2.1.5, 2.1.6 and 2.1.7 of the Manual. Law presumes applicability of these situations\ncontemplated under the aforesaid paragraphs of the Manual even for deemed suspension\nunder Rule 6 (2).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">65)      It may be also noted that an employee can be placed under suspension under Rule 6\n(1) (c) if any criminal case is pending against him or is under criminal investigation, even if he\nis not arrested.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">Rule 6 (2) will come into play only when he is arrested and detained beyond 48 hrs. in\nconnection with the criminal case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">There may be also a situation, where an employee may be arrested and detained but\nreleased on bail before completing 48 hrs. In such a situation, Rule 6 (2) will not come into\nplay for suspending the employees. Yet, nothing prevents the Authority to invoke Rule 6 (1)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">(c) to suspend the employee and the Authority can certainly suspend the employee under\nRule 6 (1) (c).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">      Therefore, from the above, it is clearly evident that Rule 6 (2) is not exclusively meant\nfor those employees who get involved in criminal case. Rule 6 (1) (c) also deals with those\nemployees who get involved in criminal cases. To that extent, there is a common denominator\nwhich is present in both Rule 6 (2) and 6 (1) (c), i.e. involvement in criminal cases.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">66)      It may be observed that the deeming provision for suspension under Rule 6(2) has\nbeen made as the rule making authority considered that arrest of an employee in any criminal\ncase for more than 48 hours is a serious matter which warrants serious actions from the\nAuthority by providing for automatic suspension in such a situation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">67)      It may be also noted that merely because an employee is arrested and detained\nmore than 48 hours does not ipso facto lead to the inference that the employee is guilty of\nthe offences. There may or may not be prima facie case against him but may be arrested and\ndetained more than 48 hours on mere suspicion and his involvement. It may be also noted\nunder criminal jurisprudence till charge sheet is filed, it cannot be also presumed that there is\na prima facie case against an accused. However, irrespective of the nature of charges,\ncontinuation of suspension of a person who had been arrested and detained would be guided\n                                                                                   Page No.# 29/43\n\nby similar considerations as enumerated in Para 2.1.4 to 2.1.8 of the Manual.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">68)       Otherwise, there is no difference in substance of the suspensions made under Rule\n6(1) or Rule (2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">       If there is no difference between the suspensions effected under Rule 6(1) and under\nRule 6(2), and also if there is no difference in the service conditions in the post suspension\nperiod as regards their liabilities and rights, there is no cogent reason why different standards\nwould apply and why similar principles should not govern the continuation of suspension in\nthese two situations, unless the Rules provide otherwise. The Assam Services (Disciplinary\nand Appeal) Rules, 1964 do not specifically provide for different treatment for these two\ncategories of suspended employees, one under Rule 6(1) and other under Rule 6(2), except\nthat the Manual is silent on the duration and the requirement of review of the suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">69)       It may, however, be noted that the Manual cannot govern the substantive provisions\nof the principal Rules and if it is inconsistent with the principal Rules, will be invalid to that\nextent. Therefore, the silence of the Manual as regards suspension under Rule 6 (2) may not\nbe decisive, considering the conclusion arrived at by this Court that there is no substantive\ndifference between the suspensions made under Rule 6 (1) and Rule 6 (2) except for the\nimmediate cause for suspension. In view of the above, in respect of suspensions issued under\nRule 6 (1) or deemed to have issued under Rule 6 (2), similar principles and yardsticks ought\nto apply while dealing with the issue of continuation of the suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">70)       Apart from the silence in the Manual about Rule 6(2) regarding the duration of the\nsuspension and requirement of review, as discussed above, the Rules are also silent about\nany differentiation in the scope, effect, consequences of the suspensions under these two\nSub-rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_139\">71)       The differentiation sought to be introduced by the Department is also without any\nbasis and it could lead to very iniquitous results which cannot be countenanced under the\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">       As contended by the Department, suspension order under Rule 6(1) is liable to be\n                                                                                  Page No.# 30/43\n\ninvalidated after three months if charges are not filed by then and if no review also held.\nThus the employee would be entitled to be reinstated in service.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">      As mentioned above, Rule 6(1) does not deal only with situations arising out of\ncontemplated departmental enquiry but also with cases where there is already a criminal\ninvestigation going on or trial going on [vide Rule 6(1)(c)]. In such case of suspension under\nRule 6(1) (c), if the charge sheet is not filed before the competent Court, within three months\nand if no review is held, the employee would be entitled to be reinstated as per the Manual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">      However, in respect of suspension under Rule 6(2) where the suspension is also in\nconnection with some criminal case pending, if charge is not filed within three months, yet he\ncannot get the benefit of reinstatement because he was detained more than 48 hrs, if the\ncontention of the State/Department is to be accepted. Can the employees suspended under\nRule 6 (1) be placed in a higher pedestal than those suspended under Rule 6 (2)? This Court\nis of the opinion that it cannot be.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">72)          This Court is of the view the immediate cause for placing an employee under\nsuspension will not have any relevance about the continuation of the suspension. The\ncontinuation of suspension has to be based on factors and considerations as contemplated\nunder Para 2.1.4 to Para 2.1.8 of the Manual quoted above. The immediate circumstance of\nhis being arrested and detained for more than 48 hrs. would not have much relevance to\ndecide on the continuation of the suspension, as the involvement of the employee would\ndepend upon the material gathered against him showing prima facie involvement in the\noffence/crime and other factors mentioned in Para 2.1.4 to Para 2.1.8 of the Manual and not\nhis arrest\n      Therefore, making the factum of arrest and detention for more than 48 hours to be the\ndeterminative factor to decide whether suspension has to be continued or not, does not\nappeal to reason and seems to be arbitrary.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">73)      Therefore, the natural question that would arise is, whether it would be permissible\nto classify two categories of suspended employees, one under Rule 6(1) and another under\nRule 6(2)? Can this classification made by the States pass the test of permissible classification\nso as to avoid the reprobation of equality clause of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 14?</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_145\">                                                                                   Page No.# 31/43\n\nIt is now well settled that in order to pass the said test, two conditions must be fulfilled,\nnamely,\nFirstly, that the classification must be founded on intelligible differentia which distinguishes\npersons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group, and\n\nSecondly, that the differentia must have a rational relation or nexus to the object sought to\nbe achieved by the statute in question.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">74)       This Court will now proceed to examine this differentiation from this angle. As the\nState/Department would have it, those suspended under Rule 6(1) and Rule 6(2) form two\ndifferent groups. In one case, for those who are suspended under Rule 6(1), memorandum of\ncharges is to furnished within three months, failing which the employee has to be reinstated\nto service and if the suspension is to be extended beyond three months, review will be\nnecessary and only on relevant considerations and factors as indicated in the Manual, and not\nonly because of the reason leading to suspension. These requirements, however, will not be\napplicable to those suspended under Rule 6(2), because the Manual does not provide so, if\nthe contention of the State is to be accepted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">      But can this differentiation pass the aforesaid twin test to overcome the mandate of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 14?</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">75)       As will be seen, as regards the first test, the State contend that the classification is\nbased on the immediate circumstance leading to the suspension.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">      The classification can be traced to the Rules, which have been incorporated to meet the\ntwo situations. One, when an employee is arrested and detained beyond 48 hours in a\ncriminal case, who shall be deemed to have been suspended from the date of detention. The\nintent of the rule making authority is that a person who has been detained in connection with\nany criminal case needs to be dealt with seriously and firmly, for which he needs to be\nproceeded, for which he would be liable to be suspended and accordingly, a deeming\nprovision has been incorporated providing that such an employee shall be deemed to be\nsuspended. The presumption is that no one would be arrested and detained for more than 48\nhours, unless there are some prima facie case against him. However, the object of the statute\n                                                                                   Page No.# 32/43\n\nof placing such person under suspension having achieved, there is no other purpose sought\nto be achieved except that such person should face the law, either through the normal\ncriminal process or departmental proceeding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">      The purpose of placing an employee under suspension under Rule 6(1) is also same.\nSuch an employee, against whom there are credible information of having committed serious\nmisconduct or offence, is liable to be proceeded against departmentally for which such an\nemployee needs to be placed under suspension.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_151\">Therefore, the purpose and intent of the authorities for placing an employee under\nsuspension under both the Rules are same, except for the immediate circumstance under\nwhich the suspension is affected as discussed earlier. As also discussed above, there are\notherwise no distinguishing attributes between these two categories of suspended\nemployees.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">The intent and purpose of the law to keep such persons under suspension covered under\nboth the Rules 6(1) and 6(2), is to ensure smooth conduct of the enquiry or trial for the\nalleged misconduct or criminal acts, as the case may be, and for achieving the purposes\nenumerated under Paras 2.1.4 to 2.1.8 of the Manual quoted above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">76)         However, this Court is not able to fathom any reasonable relation to the object of the\nstatute with the classification and for treating these two groups differently. There is no\nrational basis for the classification of these suspended employees and for giving different\ntreatment vis-à-vis the purpose of suspending them and continuing the suspension. It cannot\nbe said that those who are arrested and detained more than 48 hours will be considered to\nhave committed a more serious or heinous crime which would obviate any requirement for\nreview or placing time limit on the duration of suspension. An employee may have committed\na very serious act of financial misappropriation also, but not arrested, and suspended under\nRule 6 (1), which will not make such misconduct less serious merely because he was not\narrested.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">77)         This Court also observes that the Rules under the Assam Rules have not provided\nany different regime to deal with those who have been arrested and detained and are\ndeemed to have placed under suspension. The Rules have provided similar provisions for\n                                                                                   Page No.# 33/43\n\nproceeding either under departmental proceedings or criminal trial in respect of both the\ncategories of suspended employees. After they are suspended, they are subject to similar\nliabilities and hence, providing different treatment for the purpose of extension of the period\nof suspension for these two categories, one favourable to the other, is plainly discriminatory.\nIt cannot be said that the intent of law for putting a time limit on the duration of suspension\nand requiring furnishing of memorandum of charges within three months and for holding a\nreview if the authority wishes to continue the suspension beyond three months for those\nsuspended under Rule 6(1) cannot be said to be irrelevant for those who had been deemed\nto have suspended under Rule 6(2).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">78)      It may be noted that CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 have not made any distinction between\nthese two categories of suspensions and provide for review of the suspension irrespective of\nwhether the suspension was issued under Rule 10(2) in contemplation of any disciplinary\nproceeding or deemed to be suspended under Rule 6(2). Sub-rule (6) of Rule 10 of CCS\n(CCA) Rules provides that an order of suspension made or deemed to have been made under\nRule 10 shall be reviewed by the authority which is competent to modify or revoke the\nsuspension, before expiry of ninety days from the effective date of suspension, on the\nrecommendation of the Review Committee constituted for the purpose and pass orders either\nextending or revoking the suspension. Similarly, it has been provided under Sub-rule 7 of\nRule 10 of the CCS (CCA) Rules that an order of suspension made or deemed to have been\nmade under Sub-rule (1) or (2) of Rule 10 shall not be valid after a period of ninety days\nunless it is extended after review, for a further period before the expiry of ninety days.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">79)      In view of the above, this Court holds that the aforesaid classification sought to be\nintroduced by the State/Departments has no reasonable nexus with the purpose or intent of\nthe Rules, and tested on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 14</a>, fails to satisfy the test of reasonable\nclassification. Accordingly, this Court holds that such classification it is violative of the\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 14</a> of the Constitutions and hence, illegal and impermissible.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">80)      It may be also noted that merely because a person is deemed to be suspended\nunder Rule 6(2), the Rules do not prevent initiating departmental proceedings against the\nemployee relating to the same charges. If the Authority decides to initiate department\n                                                                                   Page No.# 34/43\n\nenquiry also and furnishes the statement of allegations against the employee after three\nmonths, will the Authority be relieved of the obligation to undertake a review as to whether\nthe suspension should be continued or not?. If the contention of the Department is to be\naccepted, in respect of suspension under Rule 6(2) the Department will not be under any\nobligation to undertake the said exercise even if it decides to hold a parallel domestic enquiry,\nmerely on the ground that the employee was deemed to be under suspension under Rule\n6(2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">        Thus, this contention of the Department is fraught with inconsistencies and\nincongruities apart from being patently discriminatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">81)      This contention of the Department does not appeal to this Court for another reason.\nIt cannot be said that the suspension under Rule 6(2) has to continue till closure of the\ncriminal trial either in acquittal or conviction. If the criminal investigation gets prolonged and\nfor some reasons the trial also drags on, would the employee be without any redress?\nObviously, the Authority has to take a call at some point of time whether to continue or\ndiscontinue the suspension. It may be observed that it has been mentioned in Para 2.1.4 of\nthe Manual that it is necessary to conclude proceedings drawn up as quickly as possible and\nin any case if it is not possible to do so due to reasons beyond control, the persons\nproceeded against may be allowed to resume their duties, wherever possible in places away\nfrom their former place of duty, vacating the suspension order so as to save Government\nexpenditure in the event of his acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">82)       Then the question which will arise is, at what point of time, the Authority has to\nundertake the exercise? If no time frame is provided, it would be left to the absolute\ndiscretion of the Authorities. If not within three months, then when it can be undertaken,\nafter four months, six months? Can it be left to the ipse dixit of the Authority without any\ntime frame? This would lead to untrammeled and unguided power of the Authority to\nundertake the review according to their whim which would offend <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 14</a>, the overarching\nConstitutional provision. If the exercise of review has to be taken by the Authority, it must be\ndone within a reasonable time and fairly. If silence pervades Rule 6(2) as regards\ncontinuation of suspension, the vacuum must be filled with the language of Rule 6(1) spoken\n                                                                                 Page No.# 35/43\n\nthrough the Manual. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that even the suspension affected\nunder Rule 6(2) must be reviewed before the expiry of three months, if in the meantime, the\ncharge sheet could not be filed before the competent Court, otherwise, continued suspension\nwill be vitiated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8766447\" id=\"span_29\">83)         It is for this reason that this Court would refer to the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court <a href=\"/doc/234132/\" id=\"a_39\">referred to above</a> in <a href=\"/doc/8766447/\" id=\"a_40\">Ajay Kumar Choudhury</a> (Supra).

It is in that context that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt brought in this principle to hold that even suspension should not be unduly prolonged.\nThe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also had referred the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 167 (2)</a> CrPC, which\nprovides that where investigation is not completed within the statutory period of 90 days or\n60 days as the case may be, the accused may be released on bail. The aforesaid provision\nhas been inserted in <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the CrPC to uphold personal freedom as well as\nhuman dignity, so that no one should remain incarcerated beyond a reasonable period during\na criminal investigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has also invoked <a href=\"/doc/609139/\"

nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation and\nthat everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\nThe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has also invoked <a

id=\"p_165\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8766447\" id=\"span_31\">84)       It may be observed that though there are other decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in which it has been held that prolonged suspension does not ipso facto result in\ninvalidation of the suspension order, it may be noted that keeping in tune with the mandate\nof <a

href=\"/doc/8766447/\" id=\"a_50\">Ajay\nKumar Choudhury</a> (Supra), would seem to be more in tune with the requirement of law\nand it would have a more pursuance value in the present

case that suspension for a prolonged time renders the suspension invalid, was\nheld to be untenable, it was also observed that the period of suspension should not be\nunnecessarily prolonged but if

                                                                 Page No.# 37/43\n\nmay be also mentioned that the aforesaid decision was rendered in the context of the rules\napplicable to the said organization namely, UP Rajya Krishi Utpadan Mandi Parishad and in the\nsaid case also, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court found that there was a preliminary enquiry held\nwhich found certain defalcation committed either with the active involvement of the\nsuspended employee concerned or with his connivance and in any case, he was found guilty\nof dereliction of duty for not scrutinizing the accounts of the Market Committee properly and\nas such, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court noted that there was a prima-facie case against the said\nsuspended employee on the basis of which, the said employee was placed under suspension\nand the fresh suspension order was passed along with the charge-sheet and did not interfere\nwith the continued suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">89)       The aforesaid decision was rendered on 29.03.1993 and as such, it is doubtful\nwhether the aforesaid decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court would be also applicable in the\npresent case where different service Rules provide for the manner in which suspension has to\nbe dealt with as discussed above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">90)      Coming to the case of Dipak Kr. Bhola (Supra), it may be also noted that the\naforesaid decision was rendered on 13.03.1997 and also it was with reference to the steps\ntaken by the Allahabad Bank Authorities for prosecuting the respondent therein under Clause\n19.3 (a) of the first bi-partite settlement 1966 between the Management and the Union.\nFrom the perusal of the said decision it is also evident that suspension was issued on\n23.09.1987 and soon thereafter the charge-sheet was also filed on 29.09.1987 before the\nconcerned court against the respondent and as such, this Court is also of the view that the\nobservation made in the said decision may not be also applicable as charge-sheet was filed\nwithin few days of the order of suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">91)      As regards reliance on Ashok Kumar Agrawal (Supra), it may be stated that the\naforesaid decision rather than supporting the case of the Department supports the case of\nthe petitioners.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">92)      In the said case, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court had extensively dealt with the issue of\n                                                                                Page No.# 38/43\n\nsuspension and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court impressed upon the authorities not to invoke the\npower of suspension in a ordinary manner and without any reasonable ground as otherwise,\nit would be vindictive and misuse of power. It was also held that suspension should be made\nonly in the case where there is a strong prima-facie case on the delinquent against the\nemployee against whom there are allegations involving grave misconduct or indiscipline or\nrefusal to carry out the orders of superior authority and where there is a strong prima-facie\ncase against him, if proved would ordinarily result in reduction in rank, removal or dismissal\nfrom service. Though the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also made observation that long period of\nsuspension does not make the order of suspension invalid, it was also observed that where\nfor any reason it is not possible to proceed with the domestic enquiry, the delinquent may not\nbe kept under suspension.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">93)      It may be noted that in the said case, the respondent therein was placed under\nsuspension in connection with 2 (two) criminal cases which were investigated by the Central\nBureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with which he was arrested and accordingly he\nwas under deemed suspension and the suspension order was reviewed subsequently which\nwas challenged before the Administrative Tribunal, which was allowed by the Tribunal with a\ndirection to the authorities to pass fresh appropriate order.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_176\">94)      The authorities pursuant to the direction of the Tribunal again passed an order for\ncontinuation of the suspension, which was again challenged by the respondent before the\nTribunal.

As a\nconsequence, if such review is not held within three months where charge-sheet is not filed\nbefore the competent Court, the suspended employee would be entitled to be reinstated in\nservice.

Nankhu, 2005 4 SCC 480 held that,\nthough the aforesaid provision stipulating the maximum period of ninety days for filing\nwritten statement seems to be mandatory, in a case defendant may face extreme hardships\nin not being able to file the written statement within ninety days and as such the provision is\nnot to be strictly followed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">But, it was also emphasized that the defendant may be permitted to file the written\nstatement after expiry of ninety days only in exceptional situation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_190\">103)     Similarly in the present case also under normal circumstances if charge-sheet is not\nfiled against the suspended employee under Rule 6 (2), who is accused and arrested in a\ncriminal case within ninety days, he would normally be entitled to be reinstated in service.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_191\">104)     However, the aforesaid ninety days is not to be counted with mathematical precision\n\nthat with the striking of the clock on the 90 th day indicating completion of ninety days, the\nsuspension order will be deemed to have been automatically invalidated.\nIf the review could not be held within ninety days, but the Disciplinary Authority is able to\nexplain with cogent and germane reasons in writing as to the inability to undertake the\nexercise of review within the aforesaid period, and charge-sheet could not be filed,\ncontinuation of suspension beyond three months would not vitiate the suspension\nautomatically.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">However, the Disciplinary Authority must undertake the said exercise of review at earliest\npossible by explaining the reasons for delay to be recorded in writing and only in exceptional\ncases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">105)     The aforesaid ninety days period mentioned in para 2.1.8 of the Manual cannot be\nheld to be an inflexible rule which would render any order of suspension illegal the moment\nthree months period gets expired.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_194\">However, to ensure compliance with such provision requiring the review within three months,\nconducting review of suspension order beyond ninety days must be only in exceptional\ncircumstances supported by cogent reasons to be recorded in writing. Otherwise, it would be\n                                                                                Page No.# 42/43\n\nrendered invalid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_195\">Just to give an example, if a person remains under custody for more than ninety days merely,\nbecause review was not held within ninety days of the deemed suspension under Rule 6 (2),\nsuch deemed suspension cannot be declared to be invalid, for the reason that the employee\ncontinues to be in custody.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_196\">106)    In the light of the above discussions and principles which can be culled from various\njudicial pronouncements, this Court would proceed to dispose of the three petitions in the\nfollowing manner:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(i)     The petitioner in WP (C) 6842/2018 was placed under suspension vide order dated\n26.06.2018 w.e.f. 24.05.2018, when he was detained by the police in connection with an FIR\ncase. However, the charge-sheet in connection with the FIR has not been filed within three\nmonths and also no review was held. The petitioner was furnished with a show cause notice\ndated 15.11.2018, i.e., after about five months of the formal order of suspension and about\nsix months of the effective date of suspension, thus after more than three months as\nstipulated under Para 2.1.8 of the Manual. Since, no review of the suspension order had been\nheld within three months or immediately on completion of three months, the continued\nsuspension is illegal the petitioner would be entitled to be      reinstated in service. The\nimpugned suspension order dated 26.6.2018 is, accordingly, liable to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_197\">(ii)    As regards the petitioner in WP (C) 8695/2018, the petitioner was placed under\nsuspension vide order dated 12.09.2018 w.e.f. 11.09.2018 in connection with a criminal case,\nwhen he was arrested. In his case also the memorandum of charges have not been framed\nnor furnished to the petitioner, nor the charge-sheet has been filed before the concerned\ncriminal court within three months and as the Disciplinary Authority has not undertaken any\nreview for continuation of his suspension within three months or immediately on completion\nof three months, the continued suspension is illegal. Accordingly, the petitioner would be\nentitled to be reinstated in service and the impugned suspension order dated 26.6.2018 is\nliable to be set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">                                                                                Page No.# 43/43\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_199\">(iii)   The petitioner in WP (C) 711/2019 was also suspended from service vide order dated\n24.08.2017 after he was arrested by the police on 21.08.2017 in connection with vigilance\ncase. In this case also charge-sheet has not been filed before the competent criminal court\nwithin three months, nor the memorandum of charges have been framed and furnished to\nhim in connection with the contemplated disciplinary proceeding within three months. Neither\nthe authorities have undertaken any review for continuation of the suspension order within\nthree months or on immediately on completion of three months.
