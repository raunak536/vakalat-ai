Money has often been claimed, by \n\neconomists, to only be a veil that covers the real value and \n\nthe economy. As a medium of exchange, money is vital for \n\nthe   smooth   functioning   of   exchange   in   the   market   place. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                          2</span>\n\n\n\nHowever, increasing monetization of most social transactions \n\nhas   been   viewed   as   potentially   problematic   for   the   social \n\norder, in as much as it signifies a move to evaluating value, \n\nand   ethical   desirability,   of   most   areas   of   social   interaction \n\nonly in terms of price obtained in the market place.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">2. Price   based   notions   of   value   and   values,   as   propounded \n\n   by   some   extreme   neo-liberal   doctrines,   implies   that   the \n\n   values   that   ought   to   be   promoted,   in   societies,   are   the \n\n   ones   for   which   people   are   willing   to   pay   a   price   for. \n\n   Values, and social actions, for which an effective demand \n\n   is not expressed in the market, are neglected, even if lip \n\n   service is paid to their essentiality. However, it cannot be \n\n   denied that not everything that can be, and is transacted, \n\n   in   the   market   for   a   price   is   necessarily   good,   and \n\n   enhances  social  welfare.  Moreover,  some  activities,  even \n\n   if costly and without being directly measurable in terms of \n\n   exchange value, are to be rightly viewed as essential. It is \n\n   a well established proposition, of political economy, and of \n\n   statecraft,   that   the   State   has   a   necessary   interest   in \n\n   determining,   and   influencing,   the   kinds   of   transactions, \n\n   and  social  actions,   that   occur  within  a   legal   order.

Whether   such   activities   by \n\n   the State result  in directly  measurable  benefits  or  not is \n\n   often   not   the  most   important   factor   in  determining   their \n\n   desirability;   their   absence,   or   their   substantial \n\n   evisceration, are to be viewed as socially destructive.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">3. The   scrutiny,   and   control,   of   activities,   whether   in   the \n\n   economic, social or political contexts, by the State, in the \n\n   public interest as posited by modern constitutionalism, is \n\n   substantially   effectuated   by   the   State   &quot;following   the \n\n   money.&quot; In modern societies very little gets accomplished \n\n   without transfer of money. The incidence of crime, petty \n\n   and   grand,   like   any   other   social   phenomena   is   often \n\n   linked   to   transfers   of   monies,   small   or   large.   Money,   in \n\n   that   sense,   can   both   power,   and   also   reward,   crime.   As \n\n   noted by many scholars, with increasing globalization, an \n\n   ideological   and   social   construct,   in   which   transactions \n\n   across   borders   are  accomplished   with  little  or   no   control \n\n   over   the   quantum,   and   mode   of   transfers   of   money   in \n\n   exchange   for   various   services   and   value   rendered,   both \n\n   legal   and   illegal,   nation-states   also   have   begun   to \n\n   confront   complex   problems   of   cross-border   crimes   of   all \n\n   kinds.

The worries of this Court that arise, in the context of the \n\n  matters placed before us, are with respect to transfers of \n\n  monies,   and   accumulation   of   monies,   which   are \n\n  unaccounted   for   by   many   individuals   and   other   legal \n\n  entities   in   the   country,   in   foreign   banks.   The   worries   of \n\n  this   Court   relate   not   merely   to   the   quantum   of   monies \n\n  said   to   have   been   secreted   away   in   foreign   banks,   but \n\n  also the manner in which they may have been taken away \n\n  from   the   country,   and   with   the   nature   of   activities   that \n\n  may  have engendered  the accumulation  of such  monies. \n\n  The   worries   of   this   Court   are   also   with   regard   to   the \n\n  nature of activities that such monies may engender, both \n\n  in terms of the concentration of economic power, and also \n\n  the   fact   that   such   monies   may   be   transferred   to   groups \n\n  and individuals who may use them for unlawful activities \n\n  that   are   extremely   dangerous   to   the   nation,   including \n\n  actions   against  the   State.  The   worries   of   this   Court  also \n\n  relate   to   whether   the   activities   of   engendering   such \n\n  unaccounted   monies,   transferring   them   abroad,   and   the \n\n  routing them back to India may not actually be creating a \n\n  culture   that   extols   the   virtue   of   such   cycles,   and   the \n\n  activities   that   engender   such   cycles   are   viewed   as \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                           5</span>\n\n\n\n  desirable   modes   of   individual   and   group   action.   The \n\n  worries   of   this   court   also   relate   to   the   manner,   and   the \n\n  extent to which such cycles are damaging to both national \n\n  and   international   attempts   to   combat   the   extent,   nature \n\n  and intensity of cross-border criminal activity. Finally, the \n\n  worries of this Court are also with respect to the extent of \n\n  incapacities,   system   wide,   in   terms   of   institutional \n\n  resources,   skills,   and   knowledge,   as   well   as   about \n\n  incapacities of ethical nature, in keeping an account of the \n\n  monies generated by various facets of social action in the \n\n  country, and thereby developing effective mechanisms of \n\n  control.   These   incapacities   go   to   the   very   heart   of \n\n  constitutional   imperatives   of   governance.   Whether   such \n\n  incapacities are on account of not having devoted enough \n\n  resources towards building such capacities, or on account \n\n  of   a   broader   culture   of   venality   in   the   wider   spheres   of \n\n  social and political action, they run afoul of constitutional \n\n  imperatives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">5. Large   amounts   of   unaccounted   monies,   stashed   away   in \n\n  banks located in jurisdictions that thrive on strong privacy \n\n  laws   protecting   bearers   of   those   accounts   to   avoid \n\n  scrutiny,   raise   each   and   every   worry   delineated   above. \n\n  First   and   foremost,   such   large   monies   stashed   abroad, \n\n  and   unaccounted   for   by   individuals   and   entities   of   a \n\n  country,   would   suggest   the   necessity   of   suspecting   that \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                        6</span>\n\n\n\n  they   have   been   generated   in   activities   that   have   been \n\n  deemed to be unlawful. In addition, such large amounts of \n\n  unaccounted   monies   would   also   lead   to   a   natural \n\n  suspicion   that   they   have   been   transferred   out   of   the \n\n  country   in   order   to   evade   payment   of   taxes,   thereby \n\n  depleting   the   capacity   of   the   nation   to   undertake   many \n\n  tasks that are in public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6. Many schools of thought exist with regard to the primary \n\n  functions of the State, and the normative expectations of \n\n  what   the   role   of   the   State   ought   to   be.   The   questions \n\n  regarding   which   of   those   schools   provide   the   absolutely \n\n  correct view cannot be the criteria to choose or reject any \n\n  specific   school   of   thought   as   an   aid   in   constitutional \n\n  adjudication. Charged with the responsibility of having to \n\n  make   decisions   in   the   present,   within   the   constraints   of \n\n  epistemic   frailties   of   human   knowledge,   constitutional \n\n  adjudicators willy-nilly are compelled to choose those that \n\n  seem to provide a reasoned basis for framing of questions \n\n  relevant,   both   with   respect   to   law,   and   to   facts. \n\n  Institutional economics gives one such perspective which \n\n  may   be   a   useful   guide   for   us   here.   Viewed   from   a \n\n  functional perspective, the State, and governments, may \n\n  be seen as coming into existence in order to solve, what \n\n  institutional   economists   have   come   to   refer   to   as,   the \n\n  coordination   problems   in   providing   public   goods,   and \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         7</span>\n\n\n\n  prevent the disutility that emerges from the moral hazard \n\n  of   a   short   run   utility   maximizer,   who   may   desire   the \n\n  benefits of goods and services that are to be provided in \n\n  common   to   the   public,   and   yet   have   the   interest   of   not \n\n  paying for their production.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">7. Security   of   the   nation,   infrastructure   of   governance, \n\n  including those that relate to law making and law keeping \n\n  functions,   crime   prevention,   detection   and   punishment, \n\n  coordination of the economy, and ensuring minimal levels \n\n  of material, and cultural goods for those who may not be \n\n  in a position to fend for themselves or who have been left \n\n  by   the   wayside   by   the   operation   of   the   economy   and \n\n  society, may all be cited as some examples of the kinds of \n\n  public goods that the State is expected to provide for, or \n\n  enable   the   provision   of.   In   as   much   as   the   market   is \n\n  primarily   expected   to   cater   to   purely   self   centered \n\n  activities   of   individuals   and   groups,   markets   and   the \n\n  domain of purely  private social action significantly  fail to \n\n  provide   such   goods.   Consequently,   the   State,   and \n\n  government, emerges to rectify the coordination problem, \n\n  and provide the public goods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8. Unaccounted   monies,   especially   large   sums   held   by \n\n  nationals and entities with a legal presence in the nation, \n\n  in   banks   abroad,   especially   in   tax   havens   or   in \n\n  jurisdictions with a known history of silence about sources \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                       8</span>\n\n\n\nof monies, clearly indicate a compromise of the ability of \n\nthe State to manage its affairs in consonance with what is \n\nrequired   from   a   constitutional   perspective.   This   is   so   in \n\ntwo respects. The quantum of such monies by itself, along \n\nwith the numbers of individuals or other legal entities who \n\nhold such monies, may indicate in the first instance that a \n\nlarge volume of activities, in the social and the economic \n\nspheres within the country are unlawful and causing great \n\nsocial   damage,   both   at   the   individual   and   the   collective \n\nlevels. Secondly, large quanta of monies stashed abroad, \n\nwould also indicate a substantial weakness in the capacity \n\nof  the State  in  collection   of taxes  on   incomes  generated \n\nby individuals and other legal entities within the country. \n\nThe generation of such revenues is essential for the State \n\nto undertake the various public goods and services that it \n\nis constitutionally mandated, and normatively expected by \n\nits   citizenry,   to   provide.   A   substantial   degree   of \n\nincapacity,   in   the   above   respect,   would   be   an   indicia   of \n\nthe degree of failure of the State; and beyond a particular \n\npoint, the State may spin into a vicious cycle of declining \n\nmoral authority, thereby causing the incidence of unlawful \n\nactivities   in   which   wealth   is   sought   to   be   generated,   as \n\nwell   as   instances   of   tax   evasion,   to   increase   in   volume \n\nand in intensity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                           9</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9. Consequently,   the   issue   of   unaccounted   monies   held   by \n\n  nationals, and other legal entities, in foreign banks, is of \n\n  primordial  importance to the welfare  of the  citizens.  The \n\n  quantum of such monies may  be rough indicators  of the \n\n  weakness of the State, in terms of both crime prevention, \n\n  and   also   of   tax   collection.   Depending   on   the   volume   of \n\n  such monies, and the number of incidents through which \n\n  such   monies   are   generated   and   secreted   away,   it   may \n\n  very well reveal the degree of &quot;softness of the State.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">10.The concept of a &quot;soft state&quot; was famously articulated by \n\n  the   Nobel   Laureate,   Gunnar   Myrdal.   It   is   a   broad   based \n\n  assessment   of   the   degree   to   which   the   State,   and   its \n\n  machinery, is equipped to deal with its responsibilities of \n\n  governance.   The   more   soft   the   State   is,   greater   the \n\n  likelihood that there is an unholy nexus between the law \n\n  maker, the law keeper, and the law breaker.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">11.When a catchall word like &quot;crimes&quot; is used, it is common \n\n  for   people,   and   the   popular   culture   to   assume   that   it   is \n\n  &quot;petty   crime,&quot;   or   crimes   of   passion   committed   by \n\n  individuals. That would be a gross mischaracterization of \n\n  the   seriousness   of   the   issues   involved.   Far   more \n\n  dangerous are the crimes that threaten national security, \n\n  and   national   interest.   For   instance,   with   globalization, \n\n  nation   states   are   also   confronted   by   the   dark   worlds   of \n\n  international   arms   dealers,   drug   peddlers,   and   various \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                             1</span>\n\n\n\n  kinds   of   criminal   networks,   including   networks   of   terror. \n\n  International   criminal   networks   that   extend   support   to \n\n  home-grown   terror   or   extremist   groups,   or   those   that \n\n  have   been   nurtured   and   sustained   in   hostile   countries, \n\n  depend   on   networks   of   formal   and   informal,   lawful   and \n\n  unlawful   mechanisms   of   transfer   of   monies   across \n\n  boundaries  of nation-states.  They  work  in  the  interstices \n\n  of   the   micro-structures   of   financial   transfers   across   the \n\n  globe,  and  thrive  in  the   lacunae,  the gaps in  law  and  of \n\n  effort. The loosening of control over those mechanisms of \n\n  transfers,   guided   by   an   extreme   neo-liberal   thirst   to \n\n  create   a  global   market   that   is   free   of   the   friction   of  law \n\n  and   its   enforcement,   by   nation-states,   may   have   also \n\n  contributed   to   an   increase   in   the   volume,   extent   and \n\n  intensity   of   activities   by   criminal   and   terror   networks \n\n  across the globe.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">12.Increasingly, on account of &quot;greed is good&quot; culture that \n\n  has   been   promoted   by   neo-liberal   ideologues,   many \n\n  countries face the situation where the model of capitalism \n\n  that the State is compelled to institute, and the markets it \n\n  spawns,   is   predatory   in   nature.   From   mining   mafias   to \n\n  political   operators   who,   all   too   willingly,   bend   policies   of \n\n  the   State   to   suit   particular   individuals   or   groups   in   the \n\n  social   and   economic   sphere,   the   raison   d&#x27;etre   for \n\n  weakening the capacities and intent to enforce the laws is \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                           1</span>\n\n\n\n  the  lure  of  the  lucre.   Even   as   the   State   provides  violent \n\n  support   to   those   who   benefit   from   such   predatory \n\n  capitalism, often violating the human rights of its citizens, \n\n  particularly it&#x27;s poor, the market begins to function like a \n\n  bureaucratic machine dominated by big business; and the \n\n  State begins to function like the market, where everything \n\n  is available for sale at a price.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">13.The paradigm of governance that has emerged, over the \n\n  past three decades, prioritizes the market, and its natural \n\n  course, over any degree of control of it by the State. The \n\n  role   for   the   State   is   visualized   by   votaries   of   the   neo-\n\n  liberal   paradigm   as   that   of   a   night   watchman;   and \n\n  moreover it is also expected to take its hands out of the \n\n  till   of   the   wealth   generating   machinery.   Based   on   the \n\n  theories of Arthur Laffer, and pushed by the Washington \n\n  Consensus, the prevailing wisdom of the elite, and of the \n\n  policy   makers,   is   that   reduction   of   tax   rates,   thereby \n\n  making   tax   regimes   regressive,   would   incentivise   the \n\n  supposed   genius   of   entrepreneurial   souls   of   individuals, \n\n  actuated   by   pursuit   of   self-interest   and   desire   to \n\n  accumulate   great   economic   power.   It   was   expected   that \n\n  this   would   enable   the   generation   of   more   wealth,   at   a \n\n  more rapid pace, thereby enabling the State to generate \n\n  appropriate   tax   revenues   even   with   lowered   tax   rates. \n\n  Further, benefits were also expected in moral terms - that \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                              1</span>\n\n\n\n  the   lowering  of   tax  rates   would   reduce  the   incentives   of \n\n  wealth   generators   to   hide   their   monies,   thereby   saving \n\n  them   from   the   guilt   of   tax   evasion.   Whether   that   is   an \n\n  appropriate model of social organization or not, and from \n\n  the   perspective   of   constitutional   adjudication,   whether   it \n\n  meets the requirements of constitutionalism as embedded \n\n  in the texts of various constitutions, is not a question that \n\n  we want to enter in this matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">14.Nevertheless, it would be necessary to note that there is \n\n  a   fly   in   the   ointment   of   the   above   story   of   friction   free \n\n  markets that would always clear, and always work to the \n\n  benefit   of   the   society.   The   strength   of   tax   collection \n\n  machinery   can,   and   ought   to   be,   expected   to   have   a \n\n  direct bearing on the revenues  collected  by the State. If \n\n  the   machinery   is   weak,   understaffed,   ideologically \n\n  motivated to look the other way, or the agents motivated \n\n  by   not   so   salubrious   motives,   the   amount   of   revenue \n\n  collected by the State would decline, stagnate, or may not \n\n  generate the revenue for the State that is consonant with \n\n  its responsibilities. From within the neo-liberal paradigm, \n\n  also   emerged   the   under-girding   current   of   thought   that \n\n  revenues   for   the   State   implies   a   big   government,   and \n\n  hence   a   strong   tax   collecting   machinery   itself   would   be \n\n  undesirable. Where the elite lose out in democratic politics \n\n  of   achieving   ever   decreasing   tax   rates,   it   would   appear \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                          1</span>\n\n\n\n   that  state  machineries  in  the   hands  of the  executive,  all \n\n   too   willing   to   promote   the   extreme   versions   of   the   neo-\n\n   liberal paradigm and co-opt itself in the enterprises of the \n\n   elite,   may   also   become   all   too   willing   to   not   develop \n\n   substantial   capacities   to   monitor   and   follow   the   money, \n\n   collect   the   lawfully   mandated   taxes,   and   even   look   the \n\n   other   way.   The   results,   as   may   be   expected,   have   been \n\n   disastrous across many nations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">15.In   addition,   it   would   also   appear   that   in   this   miasmic \n\n   cultural   environment   in   which   greed   is   extolled, \n\n   conspicuous   consumption   viewed   as   both   necessary   and \n\n   socially   valuable,   and   the   wealthy   viewed   as   demi-gods, \n\n   the agents of the State may have also succumbed to the \n\n   notions   of   the   neo-liberal   paradigm   that   the   role   of   the \n\n   State ought to only be an enabling one, and not exercise \n\n   significant   control.   This   attitude  would   have   a  significant \n\n   impact on exercise of discretion, especially in the context \n\n   of   regulating   economic   activities,   including   keeping   an \n\n   account   of   the   monies   generated   in   various   activities, \n\n   both   legal   and   illegal.   Carried   away   by   the   ideology   of \n\n   neo-liberalism, it is entirely possible that the agents of the \n\n   State entrusted with the task of supervising the economic \n\n   and social activities may err more on the side of extreme \n\n   caution, whereby signals of wrong doing may be ignored \n\n   even when they are strong. Instances of the powers that \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                       1</span>\n\n\n\n   be ignoring publicly visible stock market scams, or turning \n\n   a blind eye to large scale illegal mining have become all \n\n   too familiar, and may be readily cited. That such activities \n\n   are   allowed   to   continue   to   occur,   with   weak,   or   non-\n\n   existent,   responses   from   the   State   may,   at   best,   be \n\n   charitably ascribed to this broader culture of permissibility \n\n   of all manner of private activities in search of ever more \n\n   lucre. Ethical compromises, by the elite - those who wield \n\n   the powers of the state, and those who fatten themselves \n\n   in   an   ever   more   exploitative   economic   sphere-   can   be \n\n   expected   to  thrive   in   an   environment   marked   by  such   a \n\n   permissive attitude, of weakened laws, and of weakened \n\n   law enforcement machineries and attitudes.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">16.To   the   above,   we   must   also   add   the   fragmentation   of \n\n   administration. Even as the range of economic, and social \n\n   activities   have   expanded,   and   their   sophistication \n\n   increased by leaps and bounds, the response in terms of \n\n   administration by the State has been to create ever more \n\n   specialized   agencies,   and   departments.   To   some   degree \n\n   this   has   been   unavoidable.   Nevertheless,   it   would   also \n\n   appear that there is a need to build internal capacities to \n\n   share   information   across   such   departments,   lessen   the \n\n   informational asymmetries between, and friction to flow of \n\n   information   across   the   boundaries   of   departments   and \n\n   agencies, and reduce the levels of consequent problems in \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                           1</span>\n\n\n\n  achieving coordination. Life, and social action within which \n\n  human life becomes possible, do not proceed on the basis \n\n  of   specialized   fiefdoms   of   expertise.  They   cut   across  the \n\n  boundaries   erected   as   a   consequence   of   an   inherent \n\n  tendency   of   experts   to   specialize.   The   result,   often,   is   a \n\n  system   wide   blindness,   while   yet   being   lured   by   the \n\n  dazzle   of   ever   greater   specialization.   Many   dots   of \n\n  information,   now   collected   in   ever   increasing   volume   by \n\n  development   of   sophisticated   information   technologies, \n\n  get   ignored   on   account   of   lack   of   coordination   across \n\n  agencies,   and   departments,   and   tendency   within \n\n  bureaucracy   to   jealously   guard   their   own   turfs.   In   some \n\n  instances,   the   failure   to   properly   investigate,   or   to \n\n  prevent,   unlawful   activities   could   be   the   result   of   such \n\n  over-specialization, frictions in sharing of information, and \n\n  coordination   across   departmental   and   specialized   agency \n\n  boundaries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">17.If the State is soft to a large extent, especially in terms \n\n  of   the   unholy   nexus   between   the   law   makers,   the   law \n\n  keepers,  and  the   law breakers,  the moral  authority,  and \n\n  also the moral incentives, to exercise suitable control over \n\n  the   economy   and   the   society   would   vanish.

Further, \n\n   the Petitioners also contend that the efforts to prosecute \n\n   the   individuals,   and   other   entities,   who   have   secreted \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                       2</span>\n\n\n\n   such   monies   in   foreign   banks,   have   been   weak   or   non-\n\n   existent.   It   was   strongly   argued   that   the   efforts   at \n\n   identification of such monies in various bank accounts in \n\n   many   jurisdictions   across   the   globe,   attempts   to   bring \n\n   back   such   monies,   and   efforts   to   strengthen   the \n\n   governance framework to prevent further outflows of such \n\n   funds, have been sorely lacking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">26.The   Petitioners   also   made   allegations   about   certain \n\n   specific   incidents   and   patterns   of   dereliction   of   duty, \n\n   wherein   the   Government   of   India,   and   its   various \n\n   agencies, even though in possession of specific knowledge \n\n   about   the   monies   in   certain   bank   accounts,   and   having \n\n   estimated   that   such   monies   run   into   many   scores   of \n\n   thousands   of   crores,   and   upon   issuance   of   show   cause \n\n   notices   to   the   said   individual,   surprisingly   have   not \n\n   proceeded   to   initiate,   and   carry   out   suitable \n\n   investigations,   and   prosecute   the   individuals.   The \n\n   individual specifically named is one Hassan Ali Khan. The \n\n   Petitioners also contended that Kashinath Tapuria, and his \n\n   wife   Chandrika   Tapuria,   are   also   party   to   the   illegal \n\n   activities of Hassan Ali Khan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">27.Specifically,   it   was   alleged   that   Hassan   Ali   Khan   was \n\n   served   with   an   income   tax   demand   for   Rs.   40,000.00 \n\n   Crores   (Rupees   Forty   Thousand   Crores),   and   that   the \n\n   Tapurias were served an income tax demand notice of Rs. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                    2</span>\n\n\n\n20,580.00   Crores   (Rupees   Twenty   Thousand   and   Five \n\nHundred   and   Eighty   Crores).   The   Enforcement \n\nDirectorate,  in 2007, disclosed that Hassan Ali Khan had \n\n&quot;dealings   amounting   to   1.6   billion   US   dollars&quot;   in   the \n\nperiod 2001-2005. In January 2007, upon raiding Hassan \n\nAli&#x27;s   residence   in   Pune,   certain   documents   and   evidence \n\nhad   been   discovered   regarding   deposits   of   8.04   billion \n\ndollars with UBS bank in Zurich. It is the contention of the \n\nPetitioners that, even though such evidence was secured \n\nnearly four and half years ago, (i) a proper investigation \n\nhad   not   been   launched   to   obtain   the   right   facts   from \n\nabroad; (ii) the individuals  concerned, though present in \n\nIndia, and subject to its jurisdiction, and easily available \n\nfor   its   exercise,   had   not   even   been   interrogated \n\nappropriately; (iii) that the Union of India, and its various \n\ndepartments,   had   even   been   refusing   to   divulge   the \n\ndetails and information that would reveal the actual status \n\nof   the   investigation,   whether   in   fact   it   was   being \n\nconducted at all, or with any degree of seriousness; (iv) \n\ngiven the magnitude of amounts in question, especially of \n\nthe   demand   notice   of   income   tax,   the   laxity   of \n\ninvestigation   indicates   multiple   problems   of   serious   non-\n\ngovernance,   and   weaknesses   in   the   system,   including \n\npressure from political quarters to hinder, or scuttle, the \n\ninvestigation,   prosecution,   and   ultimately   securing   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                          2</span>\n\n\n\n  return of such monies; and (v) given the broadly accepted \n\n  fact   that   within   the   political   class   corruption   is   rampant, \n\n  ill-begotten  wealth has begun  to be amassed in massive \n\n  quantities   by   many   members   in   that   class,   it   may   be \n\n  reasonable   to   suspect,   or   even   conclude,   that \n\n  investigation   was   being   deliberately   hindered   because \n\n  Hassan   Ali   Khan,   and   the   Tapurias,   had   or   were \n\n  continuing to handle the monies of such a class. The fact \n\n  that   both   Income   Tax   department,   and   the   Enforcement \n\n  Directorate  routinely,   and   with   alacrity,   seek   the   powers \n\n  for long stretches of custodial interrogation of even those \n\n  suspected   of   having   engaged   in   money   laundering,   or \n\n  evaded taxes, with respect to very small amounts, ought \n\n  to   raise   the   reasonable   suspicion   that   inaction   in   the \n\n  matters   concerning   Hassan   Ali   Khan,   and   Tapurias,   was \n\n  deliberately engineered, for nefarious reasons.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">28.In addition, the Petitioners also state that in as much as \n\n  the   bank   in   which   the   monies   had   been   stashed   by \n\n  Hassan Ali Khan was UBS Zurich, the needle of suspicion \n\n  has   to   inexorably  turn   to  high   level   political  interference \n\n  and hindrance to the investigations. The said bank, it was \n\n  submitted,   is   the   biggest   or   one   of   the   biggest   wealth \n\n  management companies in the world. The Petitioners also \n\n  narrated the mode, and the manner, in which the United \n\n  States   had   dealt   with   UBS,   with   respect   to   monies   of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                         2</span>\n\n\n\n  American   citizens   secreted   away   with   the   said   bank.   It \n\n  was   also   alleged   that   UBS   had   not   cooperated   with   the \n\n  U.S.   authorities.   Contrasting   the   relative   alacrity,   and \n\n  vigour,   with   which   the   United   States   government   had \n\n  pursued the matters, the Petitioners contend the inaction \n\n  of Union of India is shocking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">29.The Petitioners further  allege that in 2007, the Reserve \n\n  Bank   of   India   had   obtained   some   &quot;knowledge   of   the \n\n  dubious character&quot; of UBS Security India Private Limited, \n\n  a   branch   of   UBS,   and   consequently   stopped   this   bank \n\n  from   extending   its   business   in   India   by   refusing   to \n\n  approve its takeover of Standard Chartered Mutual Funds \n\n  business   in   India.   It   was  also   claimed   by  the   Petitioners \n\n  that   the  SEBI  had  alleged  that  UBS  played  a role  in   the \n\n  stock   market   crash   of   2004.   The   said   UBS   Bank   has \n\n  apparently   applied   for   a   retail   banking   license   in   India, \n\n  which was approved in principle by RBI initially. In 2008, \n\n  this license was withheld on the ground that &quot;investigation \n\n  of   its   unsavoury   role   in   the   Hassan   Ali   Khan   case   was \n\n  pending   investigation   in   the   Enforcement   Directorate.&quot; \n\n  However,   it   seems   that   the   RBI   reversed   its   decision   in \n\n  2009,   and   no   good   reasons   seem   to   be   forthcoming   for \n\n  the reversal of the decision of 2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">30.The Petitioners contend that such a reversal of decision \n\n  could   only   have   been   accomplished   through   high   level \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                         2</span>\n\n\n\n  intervention,   and   that   it   is   further   evidence   of   linkages \n\n  between members of the political class, and possibly even \n\n  members   of   the   bureaucracy,   and   such   banking \n\n  operations,   and   the   illegal   activities   of   Hassan   Ali   Khan \n\n  and   the   Tapurias.   Hence,   the   Petitioners   argued,   in   the \n\n  circumstances   it  would   have  to  be   necessarily   concluded \n\n  that the investigations into the affairs of Hassan Ali Khan, \n\n  and  the  Tapurias,  would  be  severely   compromised  if  the \n\n  Court   does   not   intervene,   and   monitor   the   investigative \n\n  processes   by   appointing   a   special   investigation   team \n\n  reporting directly to the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">31.The learned senior counsel for the Petitioners sought that \n\n  this   Court   intervene,   order   proper   investigations,   and \n\n  monitor   continuously,   the   actions   of   the   Union   of   India, \n\n  and any and all governmental departments and agencies, \n\n  in these matters. It was submitted that their filing of this \n\n  Writ Petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 32</a> is proper, as the inaction of \n\n  the   Union   of   India,   as   described   above,   violates   the \n\n  fundamental rights - to proper governance, in as much as \n\n  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Article  14</a> provides for equality before the law and equal \n\n  protection   of   the   law,  and   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article   21</a>   promises   dignity   of \n\n  life to all citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">32.We   have   heard   the   learned   senior   counsel   for   the \n\n  Petitioners,   Shri.

Gopal   Subramaniam, \n\n   on behalf of the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">33.Shri. Divan, specifically argued that, having regard to the \n\n   nature of the investigation, its slow pace so far, and the \n\n   non-seriousness on the part of the respondents, there is a \n\n   need   to   constitute   a   Special   Investigation   Team   (&quot;SIT&quot;) \n\n   headed by a former judge or two of this court. However, \n\n   this particular plea has been vociferously resisted by the \n\n   Solicitor General. Relying on the status reports submitted \n\n   from   time   to   time,   the   learned   Solicitor   General   stated \n\n   that all possible steps were being taken to bring back the \n\n   monies   stashed   in   foreign   banks,   and   that   the \n\n   investigations   in   cases   registered   were   proceeding   in   an \n\n   appropriate   manner.   He   expressed   his   willingness   for   a \n\n   Court  monitored  investigation.  He  also   further  submitted \n\n   that   the   Respondents,   in   principle,   have   no   objections \n\n   whatsoever   against   the   main   submissions   of   the \n\n   Petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">34.The   real   point   of   controversy   is,   given   above,   as   to \n\n   whether there is a need to constitute a SIT to be headed \n\n   by   a   judge   or   two,   of   this   court,   to   supervise   the \n\n   investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                          2</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">35.We   must   express   our   serious   reservations   about   the \n\n   responses   of   the   Union   of   India.   In   the   first   instance, \n\n   during   the   earlier   phases   of   hearing   before   us,   the \n\n   attempts were clearly evasive, confused, or originating in \n\n   the   denial   mode.   It   was   only   upon   being   repeatedly \n\n   pressed by us did the Union of India begin to admit that \n\n   indeed   the   investigation   was   proceeding   very   slowly.   It \n\n   also became clear to us that in fact the investigation had \n\n   completely   stalled,  in   as   much  as   custodial   interrogation \n\n   of   Hassan   Ali   Khan   had   not   even   been   sought   for,   even \n\n   though   he   was   very   much   resident   in   India.   Further,   it \n\n   also now appears that even though his passport had been \n\n   impounded, he was able to secure another passport from \n\n   the   RPO   in   Patna,   possibly   with   the   help   or   aid   of   a \n\n   politician.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">36.During   the   course   of   the   hearings   the   Union   of   India \n\n   repeatedly   insisted   that   the   matter   involves   many \n\n   jurisdictions, across the globe, and a proper investigation \n\n   could be accomplished only through the concerted efforts \n\n   by   different   law   enforcement   agencies,   both   within   the \n\n   Central Government, and also various State governments. \n\n   However,   the   absence   of   any   satisfactory   explanation   of \n\n   the slowness of the pace of investigation, and lack of any \n\n   credible   answers   as   to   why   the   respondents   did   not   act \n\n   with   respect   to   those   actions   that   were   feasible,   and \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                       2</span>\n\n\n\nwithin the ambit of powers of the Enforcement Directorate \n\nitself, such as custodial investigation, leads us to conclude \n\nthat   the   lack   of   seriousness   in   the   efforts   of   the \n\nrespondents are contrary to the requirements of laws and \n\nconstitutional obligations of the Union of India. It was only \n\nupon the insistence and intervention of this Court has the \n\nEnforcement   Directorate   initiated   and   secured   custodial \n\ninterrogation   over   Hassan   Ali   Khan.   The   Union   of   India \n\nhas   explicitly   acknowledged   that   there   was   much   to   be \n\ndesired   with   the   manner   in   which   the   investigation   had \n\nproceeded prior to the intervention of this court. From the \n\nmore   recent   reports,   it   would   appear   that   the   Union   of \n\nIndia, on account of its more recent efforts to conduct the \n\ninvestigation with seriousness, on account of the gravitas \n\nbrought   by   this   Court,   has   led   to   the   securing   of \n\nadditional   information,   and   leads,   which   could   aid   in \n\nfurther   investigation.   For   instance,   during   the  continuing \n\ninterrogation   of   Hassan   Ali   Khan   and   the   Tapurias, \n\nundertaken for the first time at the behest of this Court, \n\nmany   names   of   important   persons,   including   leaders   of \n\nsome   corporate   giants,   politically   powerful   people,   and \n\ninternational   arms   dealers   have   cropped   up.   So   far,   no \n\nsignificant   attempt   has   been   made   to   investigate   and \n\nverify   the   same.   This   is   a   further   cause   for   the   grave \n\nconcerns   of   this   Court,   and   points   to   the   need   for \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                         3</span>\n\n\n\n  continued,  effective  and  day to day monitoring  by a SIT \n\n  constituted   by   this   Court,   and   acting   on   behalf,   behest \n\n  and direction of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">37.In light of the fact that the issues are complex, requiring \n\n  expertise   and   knowledge   of   different   departments,   and \n\n  the   necessity   of   coordination   of   efforts   across   various \n\n  agencies and departments, it was submitted to us that the \n\n  Union   of   India   has   recently   formed   a   High   Level \n\n  Committee,   under   the   aegis   of   the   Department   of \n\n  Revenue   in   the   Ministry   of   Finance,   which   is   the   nodal \n\n  agency   responsible   for   all   economic   offences.   The \n\n  composition of the High Level Committee (&quot;HLC&quot;) is said \n\n  to   be   as   follows:   (i)   Secretary,   Department   of   Revenue, \n\n  as the Chairman; (ii) Deputy Governor,  Reserve Bank of \n\n  India;   (iii)   Director   (IB);   (iv)   Director,   Enforcement;   (v) \n\n  Director,   CBI;   (vi)   Chairman,   CBDT;   (vii)   DG,   Narcotics \n\n  Control   Bureau;   (vii)   DG,   Revenue   Intelligence;   (ix) \n\n  Director, Financial Intelligence Unit; and (x) JS (FT &amp; TR-\n\n  I), CBDT.

The \n\n  Union   of   India   also   claims   that   the   formation   of   such   a \n\n  committee   indicates   the   seriousness   with   which   it   is \n\n  viewing the entire matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">38.While   it   would   appear,   from   the   Status   Reports \n\n  submitted to this Court, that the Enforcement Directorate \n\n  has   moved   in   some   small   measure,   the   actual   facts   are \n\n  not   comforting   to   an   appropriate   extent.   In   fact   we   are \n\n  not   convinced   that   the   situation   has   changed   to   the \n\n  extent   that   it   ought   to   so   as   to   accept   that   the \n\n  investigation would now be conducted with the degree of \n\n  seriousness  that  is  warranted.  According  to the Union  of \n\n  India the HLC was formed in order to take charge of and \n\n  direct   the   entire   investigation,   and   subsequently,   the \n\n  prosecution.   In   the   meanwhile   a   charge   sheet   has   been \n\n  filed   against   Hassan   Ali   Khan.   Upon   inquiry   by   us   as   to \n\n  whether   the   charge-sheet   had   been   vetted   by   the   HLC, \n\n  and its inputs secured, the counsel for Union of India were \n\n  flummoxed.   The   fact   was   that   the   charge-sheet   had   not \n\n  been   given   even   for   the   perusal   of   the       HLC,   let   alone \n\n  securing   its   inputs,   guidance   and   direction.   We   are   not \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                            3</span>\n\n\n\n   satisfied by the explanation offered by the Directorate of \n\n   Enforcement   by   way   of   affidavit   after   the   orders   were \n\n   reserved.   Be   it   noted   that   a   nodal   agency   was   set   up, \n\n   pursuant to directions of this Court in Vineet Narain case \n\n   given many years ago. Yet the same was not involved and \n\n   these matters were never placed before it. Why?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">39.From   the   status   reports,   it   is   clear   that   the   problem   is \n\n   extremely complex, and many agencies and departments \n\n   spread   across   the   country   have   not   responded   with   the \n\n   alacrity,   and   urgency,   that   one   would   desire.   Moreover, \n\n   the Union of India has been unable to answer any of the \n\n   questions   regarding   its   past   actions,   and   their \n\n   implications, such as the slowness of the investigation, or \n\n   about grant of license  to conduct  retail  banking  by UBS, \n\n   by reversing the decision taken earlier to withhold such a \n\n   license   on   the   grounds   that   the   said   bank&#x27;s   credentials \n\n   were suspect. To this latter query, the stance of the Union \n\n   of India has been that entry of UBS would facilitate flow of \n\n   foreign investments into India. The question that arises is \n\n   whether   the   task   of   bringing   foreign   funds   into   India \n\n   override all other constitutional concerns and obligations?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">40.The   predominant   theme   in   the   responses   of   Union   of \n\n   India before this court has been that it is doing all that it \n\n   can   to   bring   back   the   unaccounted   monies   stashed   in \n\n   various banks abroad. To this is added the qualifier that it \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                          3</span>\n\n\n\n  is   an   extremely   complex   problem,   requiring   the \n\n  cooperation   of   many   different   jurisdictions,   and   an \n\n  internationally   coordinated   effort.   Indeed   they   are \n\n  complex.   We   do   not   wish   to   go   into   the   details   of \n\n  arguments about whether the Union of India is, or is not, \n\n  doing necessary things to achieve such goals. That is not \n\n  necessary for the matters at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">41.What is important is that the Union of India had obtained \n\n  knowledge,   documents   and   information   that   indicated \n\n  possible   connections   between   Hassan   Ali   Khan,   and   his \n\n  alleged   co-conspirators   and   known   international   arms \n\n  dealers. Further, the Union of India was also in possession \n\n  of   information   that   suggested   that   because   the \n\n  international arms dealing network, and a very prominent \n\n  dealer   in   it,   could   not   open   a   bank   account   even   in   a \n\n  jurisdiction   that   is   generally   acknowledged   to   lay   great \n\n  emphasis on not asking sources of money being deposited \n\n  into its banks, Hassan Ali Khan may have played a crucial \n\n  role   in  opening   an   account   with   the   branch  of   the  same \n\n  bank   in   another   jurisdiction.   The   volume   of   alleged \n\n  income  taxes  owed  to  the  country,  as  demanded  by the \n\n  Union of India itself, and the volume of monies, by some \n\n  accounts   US   $8.04   billion,   and   some   other   accounts   in \n\n  excess  of  Rs.  70,000   crores,  that   are  said   to  have  been \n\n  routed through various bank accounts of Hassan Ali Khan, \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                       3</span>\n\n\n\n  and   Tapurias.   Further,   from   all   accounts   it   has   been \n\n  acknowledged   that   none   of   the   named   individuals   have \n\n  any known and lawful sources for such huge quantities of \n\n  monies.   All   of   these   factors,   either   individually   or \n\n  combined,   ought   to   have   immediately   raised   questions \n\n  regarding   the   sources   being   unlawful   activities,   national \n\n  security, and transfer of funds into India for other illegal \n\n  activities, including acts against the State. It was only at \n\n  the   repeated   insistence   by   us   that   such   matters   have \n\n  equal,   if  not   even   greater  importance   than   issues   of  tax \n\n  collection, has the Union of India belatedly concluded that \n\n  such   aspects   also   ought   to   be   investigated   with \n\n  thoroughness.   However,   there   is   still   no   evidence   of   a \n\n  really serious investigation into these other matters from \n\n  the national security perspective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">42.The fact remains that the Union of India has struggled in \n\n  conducting   a   proper   investigation   into   the   affairs   of \n\n  Hassan Ali Khan and the Tapurias. While some individuals, \n\n  whose names have come to the adverse knowledge of the \n\n  Union   of   India,   through   the   more   recent   investigations, \n\n  have   been   interrogated,   many   more   are   yet   to   be \n\n  investigated. This highly complex investigation has in fact \n\n  just begun. It is still too early to conclude that the Union \n\n  of India has indeed placed all the necessary machinery to \n\n  conduct a proper investigation. The formation of the HLC \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                         3</span>\n\n\n\n  was a necessary step, and may even be characterized as \n\n  a welcome step. Nevertheless, it is an insufficient step.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">43.In light of the  above, we had proposed to the  Union  of \n\n  India   that   the   same   HLC   constituted   by   it   be   converted \n\n  into a Special Investigation Team, headed by two retired \n\n  judges of the Supreme Court of India. The Union of India \n\n  opposes   the   same,   but   provides   no   principle   as   to   why \n\n  that would be undesirable, especially in light of the many \n\n  lapses and lacunae in its actions in these matters spread \n\n  over the past four years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">44.We   are   of   the   firm   opinion   that   in   these   matters \n\n  fragmentation   of   government,   and   expertise   and \n\n  knowledge,   across   many   departments,   agencies   and \n\n  across various jurisdictions, both within the country, and \n\n  across the globe, is a serious impediment to the conduct \n\n  of   a   proper   investigation.   We   hold   that   it   is   in   fact \n\n  necessary to create a body that coordinates, directs, and \n\n  where   necessary   orders   timely   and   urgent   action   by \n\n  various   institutions   of   the   State.   We   also   hold   that   the \n\n  continued involvement of this Court in these matters, in a \n\n  broad   oversight   capacity,   is   necessary   for   upholding   the \n\n  rule   of   law,   and   achievement   of   constitutional   values. \n\n  However,   it   would   be   impossible   for   this   Court   to   be \n\n  involved   in   day   to   day   investigations,   or   to   constantly \n\n  monitor each and every aspect of the investigation.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                           3</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">45.The   resources   of   this   court   are   scarce,   and   it   is   over-\n\n   burdened with the task of rendering justice in well over a \n\n   lakh   of   cases   every   year.   Nevertheless,   this   Court   is \n\n   bound   to   uphold   the   Constitution,   and   its   own   burdens, \n\n   excessive as they already are, cannot become an excuse \n\n   for it to not perform that task. In a country where most of \n\n   its   people   are   uneducated   and   illiterate,   suffering   from \n\n   hunger   and   squalor,   the   retraction   of   the   monitoring   of \n\n   these matters by this Court would be unconscionable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">46.The   issue   is   not   merely   whether   the   Union   of   India   is \n\n   making   the   necessary   effort   to   bring   back   all   or   some \n\n   significant part of the alleged monies. The fact that there \n\n   is   some   information   and   knowledge   that   such   vast \n\n   amounts may have been stashed away in foreign banks, \n\n   implies   that   the   State   has   the   primordial   responsibility, \n\n   under the Constitution, to make every effort to trace the \n\n   sources   of   such   monies,   punish   the   guilty   where   such \n\n   monies   have   been   generated   and/or   taken   abroad \n\n   through   unlawful   activities,   and   bring   back   the   monies \n\n   owed to the Country. We do recognize that the degree of \n\n   success,   measured   in   terms   of   the   amounts   of   monies \n\n   brought   back,   is   dependent   on   a   number   of   factors, \n\n   including   aspects   that   relate   to   international   political \n\n   economy and relations, which may or may not be under \n\n   our   control.   The   fact   remains   that   with   respect   to   those \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                        3</span>\n\n\n\n   factors that were within the powers of the Union of India, \n\n   such as investigation of possible criminal nexus, threats to \n\n   national security etc., were not even attempted. Fealty to \n\n   the Constitution is not a matter of mere material success; \n\n   but, and probably more importantly from the perspective \n\n   of the moral authority of the State, a matter of integrity \n\n   of effort on all the dimensions that inform a problem that \n\n   threatens the constitutional projects. Further, the degree \n\n   of seriousness with which efforts are made with respect to \n\n   those   various   dimensions   can   also   be   expected   to   bear \n\n   fruit in terms of building capacities, and the development \n\n   of necessary attitudes to take the law enforcement part of \n\n   accounting or following the money seriously in the future.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">47.The   merits   of   vigour   of   investigations,   and   attempts   at \n\n   law   enforcement,   cannot   be   measured   merely   on   the \n\n   scale   of   what   we   accomplish   with   respect   to   what   has \n\n   happened in the past. It would necessarily also have to be \n\n   appreciated from the benefits that are likely to accrue to \n\n   the country in preventing such activities in the future. Our \n\n   people   may   be   poor,   and   may   be   suffering   from   all \n\n   manner   of   deprivation.   However,   the   same   poor   and \n\n   suffering masses are rich, morally and from a humanistic \n\n   point of view. Their forbearance of the many foibles and \n\n   failures of those who wield power, no less in their name \n\n   and  behalf  than  of the rich and  the empowered, is itself \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                             3</span>\n\n\n\n    indicative of their  great qualities,  of humanity,  trust  and \n\n    tolerance.   That   greatness   can   only   be   matched   by \n\n    exercise of every sinew, and every resource, in the broad \n\n    goal of our constitutional project of bringing to their lives \n\n    dignity. The efforts that this Court makes in this regard, \n\n    and will make in this respect and these matters, can only \n\n    be conceived as a small  and minor,  though nevertheless \n\n    necessary,   part.   Ultimately   the   protection   of   the \n\n    Constitution and striving to promote its vision and values \n\n    is an elemental mode of service to our people.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"310431\" id=\"span_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28754420\" id=\"span_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1203995\" id=\"span_40\">48. We note that in many instances, in the past, when issues \n\n\n    referred to the Court have been very complex in nature, \n\n    and   yet   required   the   intervention   of   the   Court,   Special \n\n    Investigation Teams have been ordered and constituted in \n\n    order to enable the Court, and the Union of India and/or \n\n    other   organs   of   the   State,   to   fulfill   their   constitutional \n\n    obligations.

These   documents,   including \n\n  names   and   bank   particulars,   relate   to   various   bank \n\n  accounts,   of   Indian   citizens,   in   the   Principality   of \n\n  Liechtenstein   (&quot;Liechtenstein&quot;),   a   small   landlocked \n\n  sovereign   nation-state   in   Europe.   It   is   generally \n\n  acknowledged that Liechtenstein is a tax haven.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">52.Apparently,   as   alleged   by   the   Petitioners,   a   former \n\n  employee of a bank or banks in Liechtenstein secured the \n\n  names of some 1400 bank account holders, along with the \n\n  particulars of such accounts, and offered the information \n\n  to various entities. The same was secured by the Federal \n\n  Republic   of   Germany   (&quot;Germany&quot;),   which   in   turn,   apart \n\n  from   initiating   tax   proceedings   against   some   600 \n\n  individuals,   also   offered   the   information   regarding \n\n  nationals and citizens of other countries to such countries. \n\n  It is the contention of the Petitioners that even though the \n\n  Union   of   India   was   informed   about   the   presence   of   the \n\n  names of a large number of Indian  citizens  in the list of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                           4</span>\n\n\n\n   names revealed by the former bank employee, the Union \n\n   of   India   never   made   a   serious   attempt   to   secure   such \n\n   information and proceed to investigate such individuals. It \n\n   is   the   contention   of   the   Petitioners   that   such   names \n\n   include the identities of prominent and powerful Indians, \n\n   or   the   identities   of   individuals,   who   may   or   may   not   be \n\n   Indian   citizens,   but   who   could   lead   to   information   about \n\n   various   powerful   Indians   holding   unaccounted   monies   in \n\n   bank   accounts   abroad.   It   is   also   the   contention   of   the \n\n   Petitioners   that,   even   though   they   had   sought   the \n\n   information   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">Right   to   Information   Act</a>   (2005), \n\n   the Respondents had not revealed the names nor divulged \n\n   the relevant documents. The Petitioners argue that such a \n\n   reluctance   is   only   on   account   of   the   Union   of   India   not \n\n   having   initiated   suitable   steps   to   recover   such   monies, \n\n   and   punish   the   named   individuals,   and   also   because \n\n   revelation of names of individuals on the list would lead to \n\n   discovery of powerful persons engaged in various unlawful \n\n   activities, both in generation of unlawful and unaccounted \n\n   monies, and their stashing away in banks abroad.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">53.It   was   also   alleged   by   the   Petitioners   that   in   fact \n\n   Germany   had   offered   such   information,   freely   and \n\n   generally to any country that requests the same, and did \n\n   not   specify   that   the   names   and   other   information \n\n   pertaining   to   such   names   ought   to   be   requested   only \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                          4</span>\n\n\n\n  pursuant   to   any   double   taxation   agreements   it   has   with \n\n  other countries. The Petitioners also alleged that Union of \n\n  India has chosen to proceed under the assumption that it \n\n  could   have   requested   such   information   only   pursuant   to \n\n  the double taxation agreement it has with Germany. The \n\n  Petitioners   contend   that   the   Government   of   India   took \n\n  such   a   step   primarily   to   conceal   the   information   from \n\n  public gaze.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">54.The response of the Union of India may be summed up \n\n  briefly: (i) that they secured the names of individuals with \n\n  bank accounts in banks in Liechtenstein, and other details \n\n  with   respect   to   such   bank   accounts,   pursuant   to   an \n\n  agreement of India with Germany for avoidance of double \n\n  taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion; (ii) that the said \n\n  agreement   proscribes   the   Union   of   India   from   disclosing \n\n  such   names,   and   other   documents   and   information   with \n\n  respect to such bank accounts, to the Petitioners, even in \n\n  the   context   of   these   ongoing   proceedings   before   this \n\n  court;   (iii)   that   the   disclosure   of   such   names,   and   other \n\n  documents   and   information,   secured   from   Germany, \n\n  would   jeopardize   the   relations   of   India   with   a   foreign \n\n  state;   (iv)   that   the   disclosure   of   such   names,   and   other \n\n  documents   and   information,   would   violate   the   right   to \n\n  privacy of those individuals who may have only deposited \n\n  monies in a lawful manner; (v) that disclosure of names, \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                          4</span>\n\n\n\n   and  other  documents  and  information  can  be made  with \n\n   respect   to   those   individuals   with   regard   to   whom \n\n   investigations  are completed,  and    proceedings initiated; \n\n   and (vi) that contrary to assertions by the Petitioners, it \n\n   was Germany which had asked the Union of India to seek \n\n   the   information   under   double   taxation   agreement,   and \n\n   that this was in response to an earlier request by Union of \n\n   India for the said information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">55.For   the   purposes   of   the   instant   order,   the   issue   of \n\n   whether the Union of India could have sought and secured \n\n   the names, and other documents and information, without \n\n   having to take recourse to the double taxation agreement \n\n   is not relevant. For the purposes of determining whether \n\n   Union of India is obligated to disclose the information that \n\n   it   obtained,   from   Germany,   with   respect   to   accounts   of \n\n   Indian   citizens   in   a   bank   in   the   Principality   of \n\n   Liechtenstein,   we   need   only   examine   the   claims   of   the \n\n   Union of India as to whether it is proscribed by the double \n\n   taxation   agreement   with   Germany   from   disclosing   such \n\n   information. Further, and most importantly, we would also \n\n   have   to   examine   whether   in   the   context   of   <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_8\">Article   32</a> \n\n   proceedings   before   this   court,   wherein   this   court   has \n\n   exercised   jurisdiction,   the   Union   of   India   can   claim \n\n   exemption   from   providing   such   information   to   the \n\n   Petitioners,   and   also   with   respect   to   issues   of   right   to \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                       4</span>\n\n\n\n  privacy   of   individuals   who   hold   such   accounts,   and   with \n\n  respect   of   whom   no   investigations   have   yet   been \n\n  commenced, or only partially conducted, so that the State \n\n  has   not   yet   issued   a   show   cause   and   initiated \n\n  proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">56.We have perused the said agreement with Germany. We \n\n  are convinced that the said agreement, by itself, does not \n\n  proscribe   the   disclosure   of   the   relevant   documents   and \n\n  details of the same, including the names of various bank \n\n  account holders in Liechtenstein. In the first instance, we \n\n  note that the names of the individuals are with respect to \n\n  bank   accounts   in   the   Liechtenstein,   which   though \n\n  populated   by   largely   German   speaking   people,   is   an \n\n  independent   and   sovereign   nation-state.   The   agreement \n\n  between   Germany   and   India   is   with   regard   to   various \n\n  issues   that   crop   up   with   respect   to   German   and   Indian \n\n  citizens&#x27; liability to pay taxes to Germany and/or India. It \n\n  does not even remotely touch upon information regarding \n\n  Indian   citizens&#x27;   bank   accounts   in   Liechtenstein   that \n\n  Germany  secures  and  shares  that  have  no  bearing  upon \n\n  the   matters   that   are   covered   by   the   double   taxation \n\n  agreement   between   the   two   countries.   In   fact,   the \n\n  &quot;information&quot; that is referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 26</a> is that which \n\n  is   &quot;necessary   for   carrying   out   the   purposes   of   this \n\n  agreement&quot;,   i.e.   the   Indo-German   DTAA.   Therefore,   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                         4</span>\n\n\n\n   information  sought   does  not   fall  within   the  ambit   of  this \n\n   provision. It is disingenuous for the Union of India, under \n\n   these circumstances, to repeatedly claim that it is unable \n\n   to   reveal   the   documents   and   names   as   sought   by   the \n\n   Petitioners on the ground that the same is proscribed by \n\n   the   said   agreement.   It   does   not   matter   that   Germany \n\n   itself   may   have   asked   India   to   treat   the   information \n\n   shared as being subject to the confidentiality and secrecy \n\n   clause   of   the   double   taxation   agreement.   It   is   for   the \n\n   Union   of   India,   and   the   courts,   in   appropriate \n\n   proceedings,   to   determine   whether   such   information \n\n   concerns matters that are covered by the double taxation \n\n   agreement   or   not.   In   any   event,   we   also   proceed   to \n\n   examine the provisions of the double taxation agreement \n\n   below,   to   also   examine   whether   they   proscribe   the \n\n   disclosure   of   such   names,   and   other   documents   and \n\n   information,   even   in   the   context   of   these   instant \n\n   proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">57.Relevant   portions   of   <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_10\">Article   26</a>   of   the   double   taxation \n\n   agreement with Germany, a copy of which was submitted \n\n   by Union of India, reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">            &quot;1.

Consequently,   unless   constitutional   grounds \n\n   exist, the State may not act in a manner that hinders this \n\n   Court   from   rendering   complete   justice   in   such \n\n   proceedings.

Considerable care has to be exercised in \n\n   this process, particularly where governments which come \n\n   into   being   on   account   of   a   constitutive   document,   enter \n\n   into   treaties.   The   actions   of   governments   can   only   be \n\n   lawful   when   exercised   within   the   four   corners   of \n\n   constitutional   permissibility.   No   treaty   can   be   entered \n\n   into,   or   interpreted,   such   that   constitutional   fealty   is \n\n   derogated from. The redundancy, that the Union of India \n\n   presses, with respect to the last sentence of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 26(1)</a> \n\n   of   the   double   taxation   agreement   with   Germany, \n\n   necessarily transgresses  upon the boundaries  erected  by \n\n   our Constitution. It cannot be permitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">72.We have perused the documents in question, and heard \n\n   the   arguments   of   Union   of   India   with   respect   to   the \n\n   double taxation  agreement with Germany as an obstacle \n\n   to   disclosure.   We   do   not   find   merit   in   its   arguments \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                         5</span>\n\n\n\n  flowing from the provisions of double taxation agreement \n\n  with   Germany.   However,   one   major   constitutional   issue, \n\n  and concern  remains. This is with regard to whether the \n\n  names of individuals, and details of their bank accounts, \n\n  with   respect   to   whom   there   has   been   no   completed \n\n  investigations   that   reveal   wrong   doing   and   proceedings \n\n  initiated,   and   there   is   no   other   credible   information   and \n\n  evidence currently available with the Petitioners that there \n\n  has   been   any   wrong   doing,   may   be   disclosed   to   the \n\n  Petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">73.Right to privacy is an integral part of right to life. This is \n\n  a cherished  constitutional  value,  and  it is important  that \n\n  human   beings   be   allowed   domains   of   freedom   that   are \n\n  free   of   public   scrutiny   unless   they   act   in   an   unlawful \n\n  manner. We understand and appreciate the fact that the \n\n  situation with respect to unaccounted monies is extremely \n\n  grave.   Nevertheless,   as   constitutional   adjudicators   we \n\n  always   have   to   be   mindful   of   preserving   the   sanctity   of \n\n  constitutional values, and hasty steps that derogate from \n\n  fundamental   rights,   whether   urged   by   governments   or \n\n  private   citizens,   howsoever   well   meaning   they   may   be, \n\n  have   to   be   necessarily   very   carefully   scrutinised.   The \n\n  solution   for   the   problem   of   abrogation   of   one   zone   of \n\n  constitutional   values   cannot   be   the   creation   of   another \n\n  zone of abrogation of constitutional values. The rights of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                                            6</span>\n\n\n\n  citizens, to effectively seek the protection of fundamental \n\n  rights, under Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 32</a> have to be balanced \n\n  against the rights of citizens and persons under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21.</a> \n\n  The latter cannot be sacrificed on the anvil of fervid desire \n\n  to find instantaneous solutions to systemic problems such \n\n  as   unaccounted   monies,   for   it   would   lead   to   dangerous \n\n  circumstances,   in   which   vigilante   investigations, \n\n  inquisitions   and   rabble   rousing,   by   masses   of   other \n\n  citizens  could  become  the order  of the day. The right  of \n\n  citizens to petition this Court for upholding of fundamental \n\n  rights is granted in order that citizens, inter-alia, are ever \n\n  vigilant   about   the   functioning   of   the   State   in   order   to \n\n  protect   the   constitutional   project.   That   right   cannot   be \n\n  extended   to   being   inquisitors   of   fellow   citizens.   An \n\n  inquisitorial   order,   where   citizens&#x27;   fundamental   right   to \n\n  privacy   is   breached   by   fellow   citizens   is   destructive   of \n\n  social order. The notion of fundamental rights, such as a \n\n  right to privacy as part of right to life, is not merely that \n\n  the State is enjoined from derogating from them. It also \n\n  includes   the   responsibility   of   the   State   to   uphold   them \n\n  against   the   actions   of   others   in   the   society,   even   in   the \n\n  context of exercise of fundamental rights by those others.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">74.An   argument   can   be   made   that   this   Court   can   make \n\n  exceptions under the peculiar circumstances of this case, \n\n  wherein the State has acknowledged that it has not acted \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                                                           6</span>\n\n\n\n  with   the   requisite   speed   and   vigour   in   the   case   of   large \n\n  volumes   of   suspected   unaccounted   monies   of   certain \n\n  individuals.   There   is   an   inherent   danger   in   making \n\n  exceptions to fundamental principles and rights on the fly. \n\n  Those   exceptions,   bit   by   bit,   would   then   eviscerate   the \n\n  content   of   the   main   right   itself.   Undesirable   lapses   in \n\n  upholding of fundamental rights by the legislature, or the \n\n  executive,   can   be   rectified   by   assertion   of   constitutional \n\n  principles by this Court. However, a decision by this Court \n\n  that   an   exception   could   be   carved   out   remains \n\n  permanently   as   a   part   of   judicial   canon,   and   becomes   a \n\n  part   of   the   constitutional   interpretation   itself.   It   can   be \n\n  used   in   the   future   in   a   manner   and   form   that   may   far \n\n  exceed   what   this   Court   intended   or   what   the \n\n  Constitutional   text   and   values   can   bear.   We   are   not \n\n  proposing   that   Constitutions   cannot   be   interpreted   in   a \n\n  manner   that   allows   the   nation-state   to   tackle   the \n\n  problems it faces. The principle is that exceptions cannot \n\n  be   carved   out   willy-nilly,   and   without   forethought   as   to \n\n  the damage they may cause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">75.One   of   the   chief   dangers   of   making   exceptions   to \n\n  principles  that have  become  a part of constitutional  law, \n\n  through aeons of human experience, is that the logic, and \n\n  ease of seeing exceptions, would become entrenched as a \n\n  part   of   the   constitutional   order.   Such     logic   would   then \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                                        6</span>\n\n\n\n  lead   to   seeking   exceptions,   from   protective   walls   of   all \n\n  fundamental rights, on grounds of expediency and claims \n\n  that there are no solutions to problems that the society is \n\n  confronting   without   the   evisceration   of   fundamental \n\n  rights. That same logic could then be used by the State in \n\n  demanding   exceptions   to   a   slew   of   other   fundamental \n\n  rights, leading to violation of human rights of citizens on a \n\n  massive scale.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">76.It   is   indeed   true   that   the   information   shared   by \n\n  Germany,   with   regard   to   certain   bank   accounts   in \n\n  Liechtenstein,   also   contains   names   of   individuals   who \n\n  appear   to   be   Indians.   The   Petitioners   have   also   claimed \n\n  that  names  of all   the   individuals  have  been  made public \n\n  by certain segments of the media. However,  while some \n\n  of   the   accounts,   and   the   individuals   holding   those \n\n  accounts,   are   claimed   to   have   been   investigated,   others \n\n  have not been. No conclusion can be drawn as to whether \n\n  those   who   have   not   been   investigated,   or   only   partially \n\n  investigated   and   proceedings   not   initiated   have \n\n  committed any wrong doing. There is no presumption that \n\n  every account holder in banks of Liechtenstein has acted \n\n  unlawfully.   In   these   circumstances,   it   would   be \n\n  inappropriate for this Court to order the disclosure of such \n\n  names, even in the context  of proceedings under Clause \n\n  (1) of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 32.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                           6</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">77.The revelation of details of bank accounts of individuals, \n\n  without   establishment   of   prima   facie   grounds   to   accuse \n\n  them of wrong doing, would be a violation of their rights \n\n  to privacy. Details of bank accounts can be used by those \n\n  who   want   to   harass,   or   otherwise   cause   damage,   to \n\n  individuals.  We cannot  remain blind to such  possibilities, \n\n  and   indeed   experience   reveals   that   public   dissemination \n\n  of banking details, or availability to unauthorized persons, \n\n  has led to abuse. The mere fact that a citizen has a bank \n\n  account   in   a   bank   located   in   a   particular   jurisdiction \n\n  cannot be a ground for revelation of details of his or her \n\n  account   that   the   State   has   acquired.   Innocent   citizens, \n\n  including   those   actively   working   towards   the   betterment \n\n  of   the   society   and   the   nation,   could   fall   prey   to   the \n\n  machinations   of   those   who   might   wish   to   damage   the \n\n  prospects   of   smooth   functioning   of   society.   Whether   the \n\n  State itself can access details of citizens bank accounts is \n\n  a   separate   matter.   However,   the   State   cannot   compel \n\n  citizens   to   reveal,   or   itself   reveal   details   of   their   bank \n\n  accounts to the public at large, either to receive benefits \n\n  from   the   State   or   to   facilitate   investigations,   and \n\n  prosecutions   of   such   individuals,   unless   the   State   itself \n\n  has, through properly conducted investigations, within the \n\n  four  corners  of  constitutional  permissibility,  been  able   to \n\n  establish prima facie grounds to accuse the individuals of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                                           6</span>\n\n\n\n  wrong   doing.  It  is  only   after  the  State  has   been  able  to \n\n  arrive at a prima facie conclusion of wrong doing, based \n\n  on   material   evidence,   would   the   rights   of   others   in   the \n\n  nation   to   be   informed,   enter   the   picture.   In   the   event \n\n  citizens,   other   persons   and   entities   have   credible \n\n  information that a wrong doing could be associated with a \n\n  bank   account,   it   is   needless   to   state   that   they   have   the \n\n  right, and in fact the moral duty, to inform the State, and \n\n  consequently   the   State   would   have   the   obligation   to \n\n  investigate   the   same,   within   the   boundaries   of \n\n  constitutional permissibility. If the State fails to do so, the \n\n  appropriate courts can always intervene.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">78.The major problem, in the matters before us, has been \n\n  the inaction of the State. This is so, both with regard to \n\n  the   specific   instances   of   Hassan   Ali   Khan   and   the \n\n  Tapurias,   and   also   with   respect   to   the   issues   regarding \n\n  parallel   economy,   generation   of   black   money   etc.   The \n\n  failure is not of the Constitutional values or of the powers \n\n  available   to   the   State;   the   failure   has   been   of   human \n\n  agency.   The   response   cannot   be   the   promotion   of \n\n  vigilantism,   and   thereby   violate   other   constitutional \n\n  values.   The   response   has   to   necessarily   be   a   more \n\n  emphatic   assertion   of   those   values,   both   in   terms   of \n\n  protection of an individual&#x27;s right to privacy and also the \n\n  protection of individual&#x27;s right to petition this Court, under \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                         6</span>\n\n\n\n  Clause   (1)   of   <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_37\">Article   32</a>,   to   protect   fundamental   rights \n\n  from   evisceration   of   content   because   of   failures   of   the \n\n  State.
