Furthermore, the Impugned Order is\n                      mechanical as it is a verbatim reproduction of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\n                      Telegraph Act.

The aforementioned Rule mandates that any order\n                      issued under sub rule (1) of 419 shall accord reasons for such direction.\n                      However, as stated above, no such reasons were accorded in the\n                      Impugned Order. Furthermore, Rule 419A(2) also places mandatory\n                      requirement on the competent authority to forward any such order to be\n                      passed by them to the Review Committee within a period of 7 days.\n                      There was no document filed by the Respondents to show compliance\n                      with this mandatory procedure established by the law. Thus, the\n                      Impugned Order was violative of Rule 419A(2) of the Indian Telegraph\n                      Rules.

Therefore, the\n                      Impugned Order is bad in law since there is no examination of the\n                      Impugned Order on the touchstone of the principles of proportionality\n                      and legitimacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">                      10.      It is submitted that the Impugned Order is also violative of Rule\n                      419 A (8) and (17). Under Rule 419 A (8), it is mandatory for the\n                      authorized officer to create a comprehensive record of the data that has\n                      been intercepted.

As per the Affidavit\n                      filed by the Respondents dated 13th October, 2020, it was said that &quot;the\n                      records pertaining to lawful interception including the Minutes of the\n                      Review Committee, for the period from 01.01.2018 to 21.12.2018 have\n                      been destroyed on 22.07.19, whereas the CBI registered complaint on\n                      07.02.18 after review of lawful interception order of the periods by the\n                      Review Committee.&quot; This is violative of Rule 419 A (18) which states that\n                      destruction of records pursuant to an order shall be done ―unless there, or\n                      likely to be required for functional requirements‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                      12.

Furthermore, since the\n                      Minutes of the Meeting is destroyed, the veracity of fact that the\n                      Impugned Order was referred to the Review Committee can never be\n                      tested which amounts to grave prejudice to the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1147/2020                                      Page 7 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">By:DAMINI YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Signing Date:13.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">16:41:41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_48\">13.

P.C, although in effect, both orders have the effect of „infringing‟\n                      the fundamental right of privacy of a person. Under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 144</a> of the\n                      Cr.P.C, the order passed requires that it must be in writing and must\n                      necessarily state the material facts of the case. Further, the said order has\n                      to be passed in accordance with the procedure laid down under <a href=\"/doc/338555/\" id=\"a_47\">Section\n                      134</a> of the Cr.P.C.

The only requirement under Sub\n                      Rule (2) of 419A is that an order for interception should contain the\n                      reason for such direction which was already mentioned n the Impugned\n                      Order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                      22.

Moreover, Affidavit dated 23rd September,\n                      2020, filed by respondent no. 1 clearly reflects that the order was\n                      forwarded to the Review Committee and decision was taken by the\n                      Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">                      24.

The Affidavits were filed\n                      by Senior Executives of the Union of India in their official capacity. The\n                      mere filing of Affidavits herein is sufficient compliance of the Telegraph\n                      Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">                      26.

Moreover, Respondent- CBI had retained the\n                      hard disk and the other records for functional purpose. The order of\n                      interception was also passed before the registration of the FIR and the\n                      Review Committee was said to review the order as per the current\n                      circumstances that prevailed and not on the basis of subsequent events i.e.\n                      registration of the FIR, conduct of the investigation and filing of report\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 173</a> of the Cr.P.C.

Therefore,\n                      keeping in view the public interest the order of interception was just and\n                      fair.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                      30.

It is submitted that even if the call recordings in the present case\n                      are illegal, even then if any evidence is procured, there is no bar to its\n                      admissibility if it is relevant and its genuineness is proved. If the evidence\n                      is admissible, it does not matter how it has been obtained. The same has\n                      been most recently re-affirmed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in\n                      <a href=\"/doc/26499003/\" id=\"a_67\">Yashwant Sinha vs. CBI Through Director</a>, AIR 2019 SC 1802, and\n                      Pooran Mal v.

It followed that since there was no dispute as to\n                      the authenticity, content or effect of the taped conversations, the quality\n                      of evidence was not affected by any unlawfulness in the conduct of the\n                      police and hence there is no basis for excluding the evidence.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1147/2020                                     Page 16 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">By:DAMINI YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Signing Date:13.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">16:41:41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_111\">Furthermore, even <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_68\">Puttaswamy - I</a> (supra) has not imposed any embargo\n                      on the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence nor does <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_69\">the said\n                      judgment</a> rule on the principles of evidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_112\">32.

To substantiate the said contention, it was submitted by the\n                      Ld SPP that it is trite law that a Rule framed within the confines of an\n                      Act, cannot override the Act itself.

A person is said to &quot;instigate&quot; another to an act when he actively\n                      suggests or stimulates him to act by any means or language, direct or\n                      indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints,\n                      insinuation or encouragement.

A mere\n                      intention or preparation to instigate is neither instigation nor abetment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                      The offence is complete as soon as the abettor has incited another to\n                      commit a crime, whether the latter consents or not or whether, having\n                      consented, he commits the crime or not. It depends upon the intention of\n                      the person who abets and not upon the act which is actually done by the\n                      person whom he abets.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">                      39.      The offence of abetment is also committed by &quot;engaging in a\n                      conspiracy for doing of a thing&quot; and only if act or illegal omission takes\n                      place pursuant to such a conspiracy. In order to constitute an offence of\n                      abetment by conspiracy, there must be a combination of two or more\n                      persons in the conspiracy and an act or illegal omission must take place in\n                      pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to doing of that thing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                      40.      Lastly, the offence of abetment may also be committed by\n                      intentional aid. A person abets by aiding when by act done either prior to,\n                      or at the time of the commission of an act he intends to facilitate and does\n                      in fact facilitate the commission thereof. In order to constitute abetment\n                      by aiding within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 107</a> of the IPC, the abettor must\n                      be shown to have intentionally aided the commission of crime. Further,\n                      the aid given must be with the intention to facilitate the commission of\n                      the crime. However, mere giving of aid will not make the act of abetment\n                      an offence, if the person who gave the aid did not know that an offence\n                      was being committed or contemplated. The intention should be to aid an\n                      offence or to facilitate the commission of crime.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1147/2020                                    Page 26 of 32</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">By:DAMINI YADAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">Signing Date:13.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">16:41:41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">                       41.
