The two petitions, one by the party in person and the other by\n     one Sunil Shantisarup Gupta, seek a common relief, viz., that this\n     Court should issue directions to arrange for video recording of the\n     proceedings in Criminal Appeal No. 951 of 2015, and generally\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n     should direct that adequate steps and measures be initiated for video\n                             \n     recording the proceedings of this Court and all Courts subordinate\n     to it so also Tribunals within its jurisdiction. The prayer in the\n                            \n     petition by Sunil Shantisarup Gupta goes further to say that this\n     Court should allow all copies of the records to be issued to the\n     public on demand and on payment of costs so also allow the Court\n      \n\n\n     proceedings to be telecast by the media. The prayer also is that these\n     proceedings be uploaded on the Internet, and if this prayer is not\n   \n\n\n\n     maintainable then this Court should alternatively allow the\n     Petitioner/Petitioners        to    video     record     non-intrusively          the\n\n\n\n\n\n     proceedings in which he/they are parties at his/their own costs and\n     efforts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">     2.

The Petitioner states that in an era of information, and\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n     especially one driven by technology, the judiciary cannot turn a\n     blind eye or be anaemic to change. This Court being one of record,\n     it should, apart from conventional methods, allow digitial video\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n     recording of Court proceedings. The proceedings could only then\n     become more responsive and accountable. There are general\n     averments in the Writ Petition from paragraph 7 and the foundation\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     of all this is that judicial proceedings are public affairs and the public\n                             \n     at large is entitled to witness them. Unless and until the proceedings\n     are to be held in camera, like the Parliament of India, recording and\n                            \n     telecasting of the judicial proceedings be also permitted. The\n     instances of such nature and where recordings are permitted abroad\n     are then set out in the petition. It is stated that even in the United\n      \n\n     Kingdom, the Supreme Court proceedings are recorded and\n     telecast, they are available on the Internet. Annexure-A is the\n   \n\n\n\n     material in that behalf.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">     4.      It is then claimed that in a country like ours in which majority\n\n\n\n\n\n     of the population is not professionally qualified or trained, many of\n     them are illiterate, allowing people to see and hear Judges will\n     increase their understanding of the Court proceedings without\n\n\n\n\n\n     undermining the proper administration of justice. Given the\n     complexity of the legal issues in judicial proceedings, the Petitioner\n     believes that allowing an Advocate&#x27;s argument to be filmed in\n     addition to judgments would improve the functioning of the\n     judiciary and ensure accuracy of Court records.

The\n                             \n     counsel tried to impress us further by submitting that many times,\n     the Court proceedings are abused and there is ulterior intent and\n                            \n     motive behind initiating or prosecuting cases in court. With such\n     openness as would be brought by a live telecast, many people and\n     their causes would be exposed. It was also submitted that by\n      \n\n     broadcast we can reduce overcrowding in the court premises. In\n     cases which attract enormous public interest and people are keen to\n   \n\n\n\n     know the outcome thereof that there is a tendency to rush to court\n     buildings and crowd the court halls. By telecasting or video\n     recording, the congestion can be reduced. Reliance is placed on\n\n\n\n\n\n     paragraphs 10 to 21 of the petition and the annexures referred\n     therein. Our attention is also invited to the fact that if the\n     misunderstandings about Court proceedings have to be removed\n\n\n\n\n\n     and faith and trust of the people in the system is to be strengthened,\n     then, we should open up the Court proceedings to such an extent as\n     would enable educating the masses.

Some jurisdictions have both the political will\n             power financial means. Others struggle to cover the\n             high costs of sophisticated , verbatim recording\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n             machines. In the State of Maryland in the USA and in\n             the Republic of Kazakhstan, both the political will\n             power, and the financial means were present and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             transition from traditional recording means to new\n             technologically advanced recording systems was\n             successful. Maryland transitioned from paying annual\n             salaries to 14 court reporters plus additional fees for\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n             each transcript (ranging from $8 - $9 a page for\n             overnight fees) to an expensive, sophisticated,\n                             \n             centralized sound recording system. The State of\n             Maryland justified the up front cost on the basis of the\n                            \n             long-term expected benefits including low maintenance\n             fees, long-term life of equipment, reduced personnel\n             and salary costs, and greater control over recording\n             and transcript production. As the Maryland case study\n      \n\n             demonstrates, the up front costs of installing new\n             recording systems may be justified cue to offsetting\n   \n\n\n\n             long-term benefits. Nevertheless, up front costs still\n             remain a challenge. Some countries overcome this\n             financial challenge by building partnerships with\n\n\n\n\n\n             international institutions. In Kazakhstan, powerful\n             political will was instrumental in forging a partnership\n             with the United States Agency for International\n             Development (USAID) to finance the new recording\n             system. While the actual cost of installing high tech\n\n\n\n\n\n             recording systems in key courts may seem relatively\n             affordable, especially in light of the long-term benefits,\n             scaling up an initial pilot project may be prohibitively\n             expensive in certain cases. In Nigeria, it cost a modest\n             $140,000 to install four pilot project e-recorder\n             machines. Nigeria was able to cover these costs with a\n             combination of assistance from international institutions\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       Page 7 of 72</span>\n                                      7 January 2016\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">    ::: Uploaded on - 11/05/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 00:03:37 :::</span>\n                          Sunil S.

The primary purpose of a\n             writ of mandamus, is to protect and establish rights and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n             to impose a corresponding imperative duty existing in\n             law. It is designed to promote justice (ex debito\n             justiceiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n             discretion of the court. The writ cannot be granted\n             unless it is established that there is an existing legal\n             right of the Applicant, or an existing duty of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             Respondent. Thus, the writ does not lie to create or to\n             establish a legal right, but to enforce one that is already\n             established. While dealing with a writ petition, the court\n             must exercise discretion, taking into consideration a\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n             wide variety of circumstances, inter-alia, the facts of the\n             case, the exigency that warrants such exercise of\n                             \n             discretion, the consequences of grant or refusal of the\n             writ, and the nature and extent of injury that is likely to\n                            \n             ensue by such grant or refusal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             15.    Hence, discretion must be exercised by the court\n             on grounds of public policy, public interest and public\n      \n\n             good. The writ is equitable in nature and thus, its\n             issuance is governed by equitable principles. Refusal of\n   \n\n\n\n             relief must be for reasons which would lead to injustice.\n             The prime consideration for the issuance of the said\n             writ is, whether or not substantial justice will be\n             promoted. Furthermore, while granting such a writ, the\n\n\n\n\n\n             court must make every effort to ensure from the\n             averments of the writ petition, whether there exist\n             proper pleadings. In order to maintain the writ of\n             mandamus, the first and foremost requirement is that\n\n\n\n\n\n             the petition must not be frivolous, and must be filed in\n             good faith. Additionally, the Applicant must make a\n             demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It must\n             be made to an officer having the requisite authority to\n             perform the act demanded. Furthermore, the authority\n             against whom mandamus is issued, should have\n             rejected the demand earlier.

The\n             principle underlying the insistence on hearing causes in\n      \n\n             open court is to protect and assist fair, impartial and\n             objective administration of justice; but if the\n   \n\n\n\n             requirement of justice itself sometimes dictates the\n             necessity of trying the case in camera, it cannot be said\n             that the said requirement should be sacrificed because\n\n\n\n\n\n             of the principle that every trial must be held in open\n             court. In this connection it is essential to remember that\n             public trial of causes is a means, though important and\n             valuable, to ensure fair administration of justice; it is a\n             means, not an end. It is the fair administration of justice\n\n\n\n\n\n             which is the end of judicial process, and so, if ever a\n             real conflict arises between fair administration of justice\n             itself on the one hand, and public trial on the other,\n             inevitably, public trial may have to be regulated or\n             controlled in the interest of administration of justice.\n             That, in our opinion, is the rational basis on which the\n             conflict of this kind must be harmoniously resolved.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                       Page 31 of 72</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">                                      7 January 2016\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">    ::: Uploaded on - 11/05/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 00:03:37 :::</span>\n                          Sunil S.

The same principle has been enunciated by the\n             other Law Lords, though they have differed in their\n             approach as well as in their emphasis. We do not\n             propose to refer to the statements made in the\n      \n\n             speeches of the other Law Lords, because it is clear\n             that on the whole, the principles laid down by Viscount\n   \n\n\n\n             Haldane, L.C., appear to have received general approval\n             from the other Law Lords. There are, no doubt, certain\n             observations in the speeches of some Law Lords which\n\n\n\n\n\n             seem to suggest that there would be no power in the\n             court to hear a case in camera, except in the\n             recognised cases of exceptional character to which\n             Viscount Haldane referred.

It will be clear from these decisions that the\n             mandatory exclusion of the press and public to criminal\n             trials in all cases violates the First Amendment to the\n\n\n\n\n\n             United States Constitution.

Public access is essential\n             if trial adjudication is to achieve the objective of\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             maintaining public confidence in the administration of\n             justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">             134.

People have inherent distrust for the secret trials.\n             One of the demands of the democratic society is that\n             public should know what goes on in court while being\n      \n\n\n             told by the press or what happens there, to the end\n   \n\n\n\n             that the public may judge whether our system of\n             criminal justice is fair and right. Criminal trial is a public\n             event. What transpires is a public property. Therefore, I\n             have no difficulty in concluding that open trial is the\n\n\n\n\n\n             universal rule and must be scrupulously adhered to.\n             The right to public trial has also been recognized under\n             section 327 of the Code.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">             136.

The test as laid down by this Court in Kehar\n             Singh&#x27;s case is whether public could have reasonable\n             access to the court room. The court noted: (SCC p. 701,\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n             para 186)\n                             \n                      &quot;186. It may now be stated without\n                      contradiction that jail is not a prohibited\n                      place for trial of criminal cases. Nor the jail\n                            \n                      trial can be regarded as an illegitimate trial.\n                      There can be trial in jail premises for\n                      reasons of security to the parties, witnesses\n                      and for other valid reasons. The enquiry or\n      \n\n\n                      trial, however, must be conducted in open\n   \n\n\n\n                      Court.

The dynamics of judicial process\n\n\n\n\n\n                      should be thrown open to the public at\n                      every stage. The public must have\n                      reasonable access to the place of trial.

One must sound a note of caution and need not be necessarily\n     enthusiastic given the state of literacy and understanding of the\n     Court proceedings in India. The repercussions and ramifications of\n      \n\n\n     allowing live telecast or live recordings of certain cases or in general\n   \n\n\n\n     would be far too serious bearing in mind the sensitivity of matters in\n     Court. Criminal and civil trials involving individual dignity,\n     reputation and status if telecast live and as a matter of routine not\n\n\n\n\n\n     only exposes parties before the Court but provides opportunity to\n     the viewers to peep into their private disputes and render judgments\n     about their conduct and character. We have already seen in\n\n\n\n\n\n     numerous instances of famous trials and Court cases inviting\n     strange reactions and responses from the viewing public. Sometimes\n     a trial of a criminal or a civil case evinces so much interest and\n     generates such feelings that people in India are known to perform\n     extreme acts.

But what is called for today in the present times is a\n             proper balancing of the freedom of press and said laws\n             consistent with the democratic way of life ordained by\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n             the Constitution. Over the last few decades, press and\n             electronic media have emerged as major factors in our\n             nation&#x27;s life. They are still expanding and in the process\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             becoming more inquisitive. Our system of Government\n             demands as do the systems of Government of the\n             United States of America and United Kingdom constant\n             vigilance over exercise of governmental power by the\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n             press and the media among others. It is essential for a\n             good Government. At the same time, we must\n                             \n             remember that our society may not share the degree of\n             public awareness obtaining in United Kingdom or\n                            \n             United States. The sweep of the First Amendment to the\n             United States Constitution and the freedom of speech\n             and expression under our Constitution is not identical\n             though similar in their major premises. All this may call\n      \n\n             for some modification of the principles emerging from\n             the English and United States decisions in their\n   \n\n\n\n             application to our legal system. The broad principles\n             set out hereinafter are evolved keeping in mind the\n             above considerations.

In the case of public officials, it is\n             obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy\n                            \n             of action for damages is simply not available with\n             respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\n             discharge of their official duties. This is so even where\n      \n\n             the publication is based upon facts and statements\n             which are not true, unless the official establishes that\n   \n\n\n\n             the publication was made (by the Defendant) with\n             reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be\n             enough for the Defendant (member of the press or\n             media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n\n\n\n\n\n             verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n             prove that what he has written is true.

With the advance of\n             technology, the number of channels available has\n             grown enormously. National borders have become\n\n\n\n\n\n             meaningless. The reach of some of the major networks\n             is international; they are not confined to one country or\n             one region. It is no longer possible for any government\n             to control or manipulate the news, views and\n             information available to its people. In a manner of\n             speaking, the technological revolution is forcing inter-\n             nationalism upon the world.

Such control is bound to\n             colour the views, information and opinions conveyed by\n             the media. The free speech right of the citizens is\n\n\n\n\n\n             better served in keeping the broadcasting media under\n             the control of public. Control by public means control\n             by an independent public corporation or corporations,\n             as the case may be, formed under a statute. As held by\n\n\n\n\n\n             the Constitutional Court of Italy, broadcasting provides\n             an essential service in a democratic society and could\n             legitimately be reserved for a public institution,\n             provided certain conditions are met.

While,\n             the freedom guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> does include\n                            \n             the right to receive and impart information, no one can\n             claim the fundamental right to do so by using or\n             employing public property. Only where the statute\n             permits him to use the public property, then only - and\n      \n\n             subject to such conditions and restrictions as the law\n             may impose - he can use the public property, viz.,\n   \n\n\n\n             airwaves. In other words, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> does not enable\n             a citizen to impart his information, views and opinions\n             by using the airwaves. He can do so without using the\n\n\n\n\n\n             airwaves. It need not be emphasised that while\n             broadcasting cannot be effected without using\n             airwaves, receiving the broadcast does not involve any\n             such use. Airwaves, being public property must be\n             utilised to advance public good. Public good lies in\n\n\n\n\n\n             ensuring plurality of opinions, views and ideas and that\n             would scarcely be served by private broadcasters, who\n             would be and who are bound to be actuated by profit\n             motive. There is a far greater likelihood of these private\n             broadcasters          indulging     in     mis-information,\n             disinformation and manipulation of news and views\n             than the government-controlled media, which is at least\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                      Page 55 of 72</span>\n                                      7 January 2016\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">    ::: Uploaded on - 11/05/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 00:03:38 :::</span>\n                          Sunil S.

Even with the best of\n             programme controls it may prove counter-productive at\n             the present juncture of our development; the\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             implementation machinery in our country leaves much\n             to be desired which as is shown by the ineffectiveness\n             of the several enactments made with the best of the\n             intentions and with most laudable provisions; this is a\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n             reality which cannot be ignored. It is true that even if\n             private broadcasting is not allowed from Indian soil,\n                             \n             such stations may spring up on the periphery of or\n             outside our territory, catering exclusively to the Indian\n                            \n             public. Indeed, some like stations have already come\n             into existence. The space, it is said, is saturated with\n             communication satellites and that they are providing\n             and are able to provide any number of channels and\n      \n\n             frequencies. More technological developments must be\n             in the offing. But that cannot be a ground for enlarging\n   \n\n\n\n             the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> It may be a factor in favour\n             of allowing private broadcasting - or it may not be. It\n             may also be that the Parliament decides to increase the\n\n\n\n\n\n             number of channels under the Doordarshan,\n             diversifying them into various fields, commercial,\n             educational, sports and so on. Or the Parliament may\n             decide to permit private broadcasting, but if it does so\n             permit, it should not only keep in mind the experience\n\n\n\n\n\n             of the countries where such a course has been\n             permitted but also the conditions in this country and\n             the compulsions of technological developments and\n             the realities of situation resulting from technological\n             developments.

Both Mr. Chugani and Mr. Nedumpara have instead\n     restricted themselves to a single facet: the imperative for video\n     recording and broadcasting live the daily proceedings of our Courts.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                       \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">     Understandably, Mr. Chhugani comes at this from a very personal\n     experience. He seems embittered by his personal experience in a\n     litigation that he has battled himself for some time. He claims, in\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     essence, that there is at least one instance when, had the Court&#x27;s\n                             \n     proceedings been recorded, matters might have turned out very\n     differently for him. I do not think it is necessary to expand on this\n                            \n     any further, for what lies before us is a test of whether what Mr.\n     Chhugani suggests is viable as general standard or practice.\n</p>      \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">     36.     But before I assess the relative merits and demerits of the\n     proposal, I believe it is necessary to note that both Petitions, coming\n   \n\n\n\n     though from divergent backgrounds, are based on a single central\n     postulate: that our courts, and the judges who preside over them, are not\n     to be trusted. Both are Petitions of mistrust. Both are Petitions of\n\n\n\n\n\n     suspicion. Mr. Nedumpara&#x27;s brief says this in so many words, and\n     then advocates a &#x27;cure&#x27;, ostensibly to put courts and judges beyond\n     suspicion. For instance, in paragraph 21 of his Petition, Mr.\n\n\n\n\n\n     Nedumpara says that we need a &#x27;strong, transparent and\n     trustworthy&#x27; judiciary, meaning of course that it is none of those\n     things; and, perhaps more importantly, that it is not even capable of\n     any of those things. In paragraph 31, his Petition speaks of &#x27;greater\n     transparency&#x27;, as if to suggest there is something clandestine,\n     surreptitious or secretive about the judicial process, as a rule; that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                      Page 59 of 72</span>\n                                      7 January 2016\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">    ::: Uploaded on - 11/05/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 00:03:38 :::</span>\n                          Sunil S. Gupta v Dept Of Legal Affairs &amp; Ors.\n                  With Indur Kartar Chhugani V State Of Maharashtra &amp; Ors\n                                     OSWP-1587-15-F.DOC\n\n\n\n     judges work in the shadows like some medieval cabal or a secret\n     guild from a fictional potboiler. Then, in paragraph 32, he Advocates\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n     video recording to &#x27;monitor&#x27; and &#x27;improve performances&#x27; of judges\n     and parties. Note this language; it is telling: &#x27;monitor&#x27;; &#x27;improve\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n     performance&#x27;. Ergo, without exception, all judges are recalcitrant\n     truants, and so in need of constant monitoring, always sub-par and\n     so in need of improvement. I notice that there is no mention of\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n     monitoring or improving the &#x27;performances&#x27; of lawyers. I will have\n     more to say on this in a bit. But ex hypothesi, the Petition supposes\n     that all judicial processes in our Courts are shut; effectively that\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     they are in camera when they should be on camera. Once it is shown,\n                             \n     as Dharmadhikari J has, that there is simply no basis for any such\n     supposition; that our law leans toward open trials and not in camera\n                            \n     proceedings, the Petition loses its substratum.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">     37.     In paragraph 41, Mr. Nedumpara speaks of the &#x27;right of a\n      \n\n     Petitioner&#x27; (presumably any litigant) to record the proceedings,\n     albeit unobtrusively. Dharmadhikari J has already dealt with this\n   \n\n\n\n     aspect of a vested legal right, and quite correctly pointed out that\n     there is no such legal right, let alone one that vests, and therefore no\n     question of its enforcement by the issue of a mandamus, a high\n\n\n\n\n\n     prerogative remedy to be used with caution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">     38.     There is then, in Mr. Nedumpara&#x27;s Petition, a lengthy\n\n\n\n\n\n     dissertation on what is described as a worldwide trend toward\n     permitting not just video recording but also the live televising and\n     broadcasting of court proceedings. This is spoken of as the norm in\n     various jurisdictions, including Liberia, Nigeria, Kazakhstan,\n     Bulgaria, Thailand and so on. There is no reason, it is argued, why\n     our judiciary should be &#x27;left behind&#x27;.

The\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n     reasoning seems to be this: a digital recording is modern technology.\n     Its benefits are many. It can be stored almost indefinitely. It can\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n     prove useful as a reference should the need ever arise. It lends itself\n     to accurate transcription. It is, therefore, fully objective. Nothing is\n     lost by keeping a recording and, conceivably, much is gained.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                       \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">     39.     These two arguments are distinct, and in these Petitions,\n     needlessly confused. The first argument speaks of the need for such\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     recordings, and it is, as I have noted, founded on a wholly\n                             \n     unfounded suspicion and distrust. The second is seemingly more\n     innocuous: all other reasons apart, if other jurisdictions have\n                            \n     adopted these modern methods, we should follow suit; they are a\n     likely convenience, equally useful to judge, lawyer and litigant.\n</p>      \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">     40.     It is difficult to accept any part of this argument, as its\n     foundational construct is so utterly and egregiously misdirected.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">     Nobody suggests that courts are free from error. Throughout\n     recorded human history, they never have been. The annals of\n     mankind&#x27;s progress are littered with instances of courts in error. Yet\n\n\n\n\n\n     judicial systems, adversarial or otherwise, have endured and are an\n     integral to what we now accept it means to be a &#x27;civilized&#x27; and &#x27;civil&#x27;\n     society. All known and recognized judicial systems acknowledge the\n\n\n\n\n\n     possibility of error. Therefore: courts of appeal, and provisions for\n     review and revision, all in-built corrective mechanisms. There are\n     permissible and legitimate steps available to all courts to correct\n     course. This has worked for two millenia. It works still. There is no\n     basis for the assertion that without video recording some great evil\n     will continue to be perpetrated.

They operate only on a single, fatally flawed\n     assumption: that while Courts and judges are arbitrary,\n     unreasonable and untrustworthy, other pillars of a free, open and\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     democratic society are always and invariably balanced and\n                             \n     responsible. In particular, public media is reliable, fair and even-\n     handed. Nothing in our collective experience suggests this to be\n                            \n     even remotely true. There is no dearth of recent experience that\n     speaks to wholly unbalanced &#x27;trials by media&#x27;, where the legitimate\n     and legally sound determination of cases is attempted to be forced\n      \n\n     into imbalance by creating a fear of whipped up public odium. We\n     note, with no little dismay, that there is no reflection of this at all in\n   \n\n\n\n     the Petitions before us. Structurally and operationally, the\n     submissions assume that there is not the slightest risk of\n     misrepresentation or misinformation were judicial proceedings to be\n\n\n\n\n\n     sent out &#x27;live&#x27;; that viewers would watch the entire process through;\n     that there is not the least chance of a lopsided or sensationalist\n     media coverage of a single incident, assertion or piece of evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n     affecting the judicial determination of a complex case. We do not\n     think this is accurate. We have already seen much second-guessing\n     of judicial orders and a resultant undermining of public confidence\n     in the judiciary.

We may ourselves be at some distance ideologically from\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n     Justice Scalia on any number of matters, but on this issue we find\n     ourselves in complete accord with him. He was repeatedly asked this\n     question.10 Over and over again he pointed to the dangers of\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n     televised proceedings being reduced to mere entertainment,11 and of\n     this being wholly opposed to the traditional role of judges as &#x27;having\n     retired&#x27; from public view, of not being prominent in the public\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     domain, qualities that are as eminently sensible as they are\n     necessary. In India, we do not, of course, use gavels. But a gavel is a\n                             \n     mere accessory. The point being made is hard to resist: there is\n     nothing to convince us that the televising or video recording of court\n                            \n     proceedings would be viewed in the holistic, dispassionate and\n     detached manner that is necessary to the judging process. Federal\n     Rule 53 has prohibited cameras in the courtroom since 1946. That\n      \n\n\n     rule was expanded in 1972 to include TV cameras. In 1999,\n   \n\n\n\n     legislation was introduced that would have allowed cameras into\n     courtrooms. The US Supreme Court responded by releasing audio\n     recordings -- but only after arguments concluded. This is a vital point\n\n\n\n\n\n     of distinction: sending out the &#x27;feed&#x27; in real-time, live; and releasing\n     it at a later stage, in whole. We find it difficult to discern any logical\n     basis for the former; and given the nature of our record keeping,\n     even the latter is unnecessary as an invariable rule.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">     10      http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4495954/justices-scalia-cameras-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">             supreme-court\n     11      Statements in various for a between 1988 and 2006.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                      Page 64 of 72</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">                                      7 January 2016\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">    ::: Uploaded on - 11/05/2016                         ::: Downloaded on - 31/07/2016 00:03:38 :::</span>\n                          Sunil S.

Lawyers and judges\n\n\n\n\n                                               \n     are trained to take this in their stride, and to make no assessment till\n                             \n     the entire trial is complete and all the evidence is in. Then begins\n     the process of analysing that evidence, collating it, and presenting it\n                            \n     to the Judge in a particular fashion, of advocating a particular\n     interpretation, suggesting one particular sequence of causality as\n     preferrable to another, and cushioning all this in the framework of\n     what the law allows and does not allow. These are necessary\n      \n\n\n     safeguards; and it is to prevent a &#x27;splicing&#x27;, a stripped-from-context\n   \n\n\n\n     dissemination of nuggets of evidence yet in the process of being\n     gathered, that we in this Court do not allow the public availability of\n     evidence transcripts. Ensuring that the right to a fair and impartial\n\n\n\n\n\n     hearing or a trial is never compromised is the paramount\n     responsibility       of       a   court.   That       responsibility     is    entirely\n     compromised, and those essential rights threatened and curtailed,\n\n\n\n\n\n     by allowing televising of our proceedings. The impact on parties,\n     witnesses and judges is bound to be severe.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">     53.

We all know of some who lost their lives\n                            \n     because of the sheer strain. And we all know, too, of the kind of\n     pressures that are brought to bear on them and just how vulnerable\n     these judges are. These are, of course, pressures that attempt to\n     operate in the shadows. We combat them as best we can.

Paragraph 42 of Mr. Nedumpara&#x27;s petition is indeed strangely\n\n\n\n\n\n     worded. It speaks of recording every utterance, every gesture during\n     the course of a hearing. I can think of little more reprehensible than\n     this. What, in short, the Petitioners seek is to strait-jacket the\n\n\n\n\n\n     proceedings in court for one and only one purpose: to develop a\n     weapon with which to pillory and terrorize judges and so to wholly\n     compromise the judicial decision-making process.
