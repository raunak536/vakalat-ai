The     prosecution         case    in    brief    is    that,   the\n\npetitioner/accused demanded a bribe of Rs.52,000/- for\n\nissuing necessary records from the Village Office, so as\n\nto enable the defacto complainant to apply for &#x27;Pattayam&#x27;\n\nin respect of 35 cents of land.

The Order impugned is assailed on various grounds by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner.

Simultaneous with this point, it was pointed out that\n\nthe petitioner was not in the custody of the Investigating\n\nOfficer, for which reason also, his voice sample cannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                                  ..4..\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">                                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"172105947\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"187283766\" id=\"span_4\">2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\nmandated. It was then pointed out that the phenolphthalein\n\ntest turned negative as against the petitioner and that\n\nthe decoy notes were not seized from the custody of the\n\npetitioner, but from a window which is away from the seat\n\nof the petitioner. It was suggested that the original\n\nconversation as available in the phone could have been\n\nproduced, instead of producing a C.D., which allegedly\n\nretrieved such conversation. Learned counsel would submit\n\nthat Annexure-A application preferred by the Investigating\n\nOfficer     would    not    reveal    as    to    (1)    how   the   alleged\n\nconversation        was    downloaded      from    the    mobile     phone?;\n\n(2) who did it?; and (3) whether it was downloaded from\n\nthe phone of the defacto complainant&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son? The\n\nC.D. produced was unaccompanied by a certificate under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 65B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, for which\n\nreason, the CD cannot be accepted.

Basheer</a>     [(<a href=\"/doc/172105947/\" id=\"a_4\">2014)     10    SCC     473]   and    Arjun     Panditrao\n\nKhotkar v.

Reliance             was placed on a judgment               of the\n\nChhattisgarh High Court in <a href=\"/doc/162736673/\" id=\"a_5\">Aasha Lata Soni v. Durgesh\n\nSoni</a>    [2023    SCC       Online    Chh    3959],    to   point    out     that\n\nrecording       a     conversation          without    the      petitioner&#x27;s\n\nknowledge, behind his back, amounts to violation of his\n\nright to privacy, guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, wherefore, the instant application to take\n\nthe voice sample should have been refused. Thus, according\n\nto the learned counsel, without any material, whatsoever,\n\nthe petitioner has been directed to supply voice sample,\n\nwhich renders the impugned Annexure-C Order unsustainable\n\nin law. The petitioner seeks the same to be set aside.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">6.     Per    contra,        learned        Special    Public      Prosecutor\n\n(Vigilance)         would    submit     that    the    mobile      phones     in\n\nquestion were seized by the Investigating Officer, as\n\ncould be seen from the recitals in paragraph no.10 of the\n\nimpugned Order. According to the learned Special Public\n\nProsecutor, the F.I.R. was registered on 20.06.2024, that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                           ..6..\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_8\">2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\nis to say before the coming into force of the Bharatiya\n\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (&#x27;B.N.S.S.&#x27;, for short).\n\nThus, the investigation which commenced as per the old\n\nCode, will continue as such, as per the provisions of\n\nSection 531(2)(a) of the B.N.S.S. Thus reckoned, the voice\n\nsample is taken, not on the strength of any enabling\n\nprovision, but by virtue of the decision of a three Judges\n\nBench decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_7\">Ritesh\n\nSinha v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another</a>   [2019 (8) SCC\n\n1]. The Bench held that until explicit provisions are\n\nen-grafted to the Code, a Judicial Magistrate must be\n\nconceded the power to order a person to give sample of his\n\nvoice for the purpose of investigation of a crime. This\n\ndirection was issued by the Supreme Court in exercise of\n\nits powers under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution. Thus,\n\nthere is no requirement that the petitioner should be an\n\naccused, or for that matter, he should have been arrested\n\nand in custody at the relevant time. Nevertheless, the\n\npetitioner was both an accused and was also arrested, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                               ..7..</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">                                                      2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\nconnection with the subject crime, though he was not in\n\ncustody at the time when the alleged conversation took\n\nplace, or at the time when, the impugned Order was passed.\n\nAccording to the learned Special Public Prosecutor, there\n\nis no reason, whatsoever, to interfere with the impugned\n\nOrder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">7.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespective parties, this Court finds little merit in the\n\ninstant Criminal Miscellaneous Case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_10\">The first aspect to\n\nbe noticed is that the impugned Order has been passed on\n\nthe basis of the declaration of law made by <a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_9\">Ritesh Sinha</a>\n\n(supra), which is specifically quoted in paragraph no.11\n\nof the impugned Order. This Court finds little force in\n\nthe submission that the petitioner was not an accused at\n\nthe time when the alleged conversation took place, or for\n\nthat matter, the petitioner was not in judicial custody at\n\nthe time when the impugned order was passed. Neither of\n\nthe   above     is   a     legal   requirement   to   pass   an   order\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                            ..8..</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">                                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_12\">2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\nmandating an accused person to give his voice sample. As\n\nregards the former, usually, a conversation which takes\n\nplace before the crime, will be propounded as a piece of\n\nevidence, wherefore, the argument that he was not an\n\naccused at the time of the alleged conversation is devoid\n\nof any merit or substance. Similarly, no legal requirement\n\ncan be read into the declaration of law made in <a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_10\">Ritesh\n\nSinha</a> (supra), or for that matter Section 349 of the\n\nB.N.S.S, that the accused person should have been in\n\ncustody at the time when an order for voice sample has to\n\nbe made.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_13\"><a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_11\">While Ritesh Sinha</a> (supra) uses the language &#x27;any\n\nperson&#x27;, Section 349 B.N.S.S. would separately deal with\n\n&#x27;any person&#x27;, by suffixing with the expression &#x27;including\n\nan accused person&#x27;. Similarly, the language in the first\n\nproviso to Section 349 is that the person should have been\n\narrested       at    some   time    in   connection   with   the\n\ninvestigation, which requirement is amply satisfied in the\n\ngiven facts.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_14\">If this Court has to go by <a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_12\">Ritesh Sinha</a>\n\n(supra), there is no such requirement that the person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                                  ..9..</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18061439\" id=\"span_16\">2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\nshould have been in the custody at the time when the order\n\nfor voice sample is made. The requirement in <a href=\"/doc/18061439/\" id=\"a_13\">Ritesh Sinha</a>\n\n(supra) is that such an order has to be passed &#x27;for the\n\npurpose of investigation of a crime&#x27;. Under Section 349,\n\nthe criteria is the satisfaction of the Magistrate that it\n\nis expedient to direct any person to provide his voice\n\nsample, again, for the purposes of any investigation or\n\nproceeding under B.N.S.S. Therefore, the thrust is upon\n\nthe question whether the voice sample is required for the\n\npurpose of investigation in a crime.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">8.    In the instant facts, this Court notice that the\n\ncrime in question was registered pursuant to a trap. If,\n\nas contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\nthe phenolphthalein test has turned negative, that is all\n\nthe more a reason for the Investigating Agency to produce\n\nwhatever evidence possible in support of the prosecution\n\ncase. If, as claimed by the Investigating Officer, there\n\nexists     a    voice      clip    containing   the   voice   of   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Crl.M.C.No. 9284 of 2024</span>\n\n                                 ..10..\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                                                       2024:KER:85215\n\n\n\npetitioner, wherein, he had allegedly demanded bribe, the\n\nsame would constitute an important evidence in the armoury\n\nof the prosecution. Such an attempt cannot be shut down,\n\nsince it has to be conceded that it is fully within the\n\nrealm and prerogative of the Investigating Officer to\n\nsearch,     explore        and   furnish   all   and   whatever   legal\n\nevidence possible in support of the prosecution case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172105947\" id=\"span_18\">9.    Coming to the contention with respect to Section 65B,\n\nthe case is only at the investigation stage and the\n\nquestion of Section 65B applies, when an electronic record\n\nis tendered in the Court for the purpose of evidence. That\n\napart, in <a href=\"/doc/172105947/\" id=\"a_14\">Arjun Panditrao</a> (supra), it was held by the\n\nSupreme Court that a certificate under Section 65B can be\n\nproduced subsequently, if the same was omitted to be\n\nproduced along with the electronic record, earlier.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162736673\" id=\"span_19\">10.

It is the lookout of the Investigating\n\nOfficer to adduce satisfactory evidence in this regard,\n\nduring the course of trial, at which point of time the\n\naccused/petitioner - needless to say - will get adequate\n\nopportunity to confront the Investigating Officer or such\n\nother witnesses as regards the modality and the way and\n\nmanner in which the conversation was retrieved. At the\n\npresent stage, such contentions cannot be propounded as a\n\nreason for not giving the voice sample.
