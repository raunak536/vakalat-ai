Since all the petitioners have challenged the same complaint and the\nimpugned order, therefore, this Court has decided to dispose of all the\npetitions by a common judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.      The allegations against the petitioners are that they entered into a\ncriminal conspiracy with each other with a view to cheat the complainant and\ncause harm to the reputation of the College. In furtherance of this intention,\nthe petitioners forged the inspection report and the words „„NOT\nRECOMMENDED‟‟ were added later on. The complainant led the pre-\nsummoning evidence of two witnesses.        One of the witnesses, i.e., Mr.\nDevender Gupta (CW1) is the Founder-cum-Chairperson of the College and\nother is Mr.Sitanshu Gupta (CW2), a friend of CW1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.      Mr. Parag P. Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe petitioners submitted that the above said witnesses in their oral evidence\nhave merely tried to prove one telephonic conversation which is stated to\nhave taken place on 21.08.2009 between Mr. Devender Gupta (CW1) and\none Dr. Surinder Singh, the latter was one of the members of the Joint\nInspection Team that had inspected the premises of the Complainant Institute\non 20.08.2009.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl. M.C. Nos. 3999 &amp; 4037-39 of 2011                             Page 3 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\"> 6.      He submitted, past history of the case is that on 21.05.2009, the\npremises of the Complainant Institute was inspected as a Ist inspection by the\nabove Committee and since the said Committee found deficiencies, therefore,\naffiliation was denied.            The Complainant Institute challenged the Ist\ninspection report vide W.P.(C) No. 9706/2009, which was dismissed by the\nlearned Single Judge of this Court. The complainant challenged the same by\nway of LPA No. 384/2009, wherein the Division Bench of this Court directed\nthat a joint inspection to be conducted by the All India Council for Technical\nEducation (AICTE) and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIP\nUniversity) as the 2nd inspection. Accordingly, on 20.08.2009, the joint\ninspection was conducted and same deficiencies, as were in the Ist inspection,\nwere found again. A copy of the report was handed over to the Complainant\nInstitute in the Court on 21.08.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.      On 25.08.2009, the Complainant Institute had filed objections to the\nreport. As the aforesaid LPA No. 384/2009 was disposed of without granting\nany relief, thus, the objections of the Complainant Institute were deemed to\nhave been rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8.      Learned counsel pointed out that in collateral proceedings being\nW.P.(C) No. 12724/2009, Single Bench of this Court on 22.03.2010 directed\nyet another inspection of the Complainant Institute by Sh. C.K. Mahajan, a\nretired Judge of this Court. This was the third inspection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">9.      On 27.03.2010, above named retired Judge found that the Complainant\nInstitute was not fit to be run as an educational institute to conduct the\nB.Pharma Course. Accordingly, this Court while accepting the findings,\npassed an order dated 05.05.2010 in W.P.(C) No.12724/2009 that students\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl. M.C.

This order was made absolute on\n11.05.2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">10.     Further submitted, the Complainant Institute filed an appeal being LPA\nNo. 540/2010 challenging the order dated 11.05.2010, the same was\ndismissed on 15.07.2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">11.     Thereafter, the Complainant Institute filed contempt petitions, which\nwere dismissed by this Court on different dates, i.e., 11.03.2010, 26.04.2010\nand 16.08.2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">12.     Meanwhile, on 03.01.2009, complainant filed impugned complaint\nbefore the learned Magistrate against ten individuals including the\npetitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">13.     Vide order dated 14.12.2009, not being satisfied with the pre-\nsummoning evidence led by the complainant, the learned Trial Court directed\nthe local police to investigate the allegations made in the complaint.\nAccordingly, after investigation, on 13.01.2010 the police filed their report in\nwhich they found that no case was made out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">14.     Learned senior counsel further submitted that an enquiry was\nconducted by an officer of the level of Assistant Commissioner of Police.\nThe said ACP, inter alia, recorded the statement of said Dr. Surinder Singh,\nwho was supposed to have admitted to Mr. Devender Gupta over the\ntelephone that the words „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟ were added later on.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Crl. M.C. Nos. 3999 &amp; 4037-39 of 2011                               Page 5 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"> 15.     In his statement to the Police, he categorically stated that &quot;final\nconclusion &#x27;„NOT RECOMMENDED‟&#x27; was mentioned before all the\nmembers of the Committee. It is submitted that Mr. Devender Gupta had\ntelephonic discussion with me and I never told him that the report is\ntempered because the final conclusion „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟&#x27; was made\nin the report before all the members signed it.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">16.     He has further stated that &quot;as far as recording of my voice on\ntelephone, we usually ignore such calls and try to get rid of this as soon as\npossible. So whatever the conversation has been cited by Mr. Devender\nGupta is meaningless and without any substance and allegation&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">17.     Thereafter, the local police filed a report on 13.01.2010 with the\nopinion that no offence was made out. The learned Trial Court allowed the\ncomplainant to file the objections against the said report, which objections\nwere in the nature of a protest petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">18.     Considering the report filed by the police and the evidence led by the\ncomplainant, the learned Trial Court vide order dated 15.01.2010 issued\nsummons against six persons out of total implicated by the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">19.     The learned Trial Court passed the aforesaid order primarily on the\nground that the police had not investigated the case properly and there is\nevidence against the petitioners to be summoned for the offences under\n<a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 465</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1827979/\" id=\"a_4\">469</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_5\">471</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 120-B</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">20.     The petitioners have raised the issue of jurisdiction that the inspection\nreport has received the imprimatur of the Division Bench of this Court and\nthus any allegations of forgery etc. could have been raised only before the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.

The inspection was conducted on 20.08.2009 and the\nreport was produced before the Division Bench, a copy whereof was also\nprovided to the complainant on 21.08.2009. As a result, the complainant filed\ntheir objections on 25.08.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">21.     Accordingly, after perusing the inspection report and the objections,\nthough the LPA was disposed of by this Court vide order dated 01.09.2009,\nhowever, no relief was granted to the complainant. Thus, the inspection\nreport has received the imprimatur of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">22.     Learned counsel submitted that the allegations of forgery etc. against\nthe inspecting team or any of the officers of the AICTE or the GGSIP\nUniversity ought to have been raised before the Division Bench of this Court\nand not by way of a private compliant under <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 200</a> of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (for short „<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_8\">Cr.P.C</a>.‟). The filing of the said\ncomplaint amounts to overreaching the process of this Court and is, therefore,\ncontumacious.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">23.     He further submitted that perusal of the inspection report dated\n20.08.2009 would show that last page is only a conclusion of the findings\nrecorded in the preceding pages. Thus, the allegation of forgery is completely\nfalse as the words „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟is the only possible conclusion\nof what is recorded in the earlier pages of the report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">24.     Learned counsel submitted that in other words even if the words\n„„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟had not been written on the said report, the only\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl. M.C. Nos. 3999 &amp; 4037-39 of 2011                             Page 7 of 31</span>\n conclusion that any reasonable person could have drawn from the finding of\nthe report was that the inspection team did not find the Complainant Institute\nfit for affiliation as a teaching institute. Therefore, there was no need for any\nmember of the team or anybody else to forge the words „„NOT\nRECOMMENDED‟‟on the last page of the inspection report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"855018\" id=\"span_7\">25.     To strengthen his arguments, learned counsel has relied upon a case of\n&quot;<a href=\"/doc/855018/\" id=\"a_9\">Inder Mohan Goswami &amp; Anr. Vs. State of Uttaranchal &amp; Ors.</a> (2007) 12\nSCC 1 wherein it was held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;&quot;Every High Court has inherent power to act ex debetio\n        justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the\n        administration of which alone it exists, or to prevent abuse of\n        the process of the Court ...

Learned counsel further submitted that the Complainant Institute was\ninspected on three different occasions in quick succession. The first\ninspection was conducted on 21.05.2009, second inspection was conducted\non 20.08.2009, which is the subject matter of the complaint and the third was\nconducted on 27.03.2010 by Justice C.K.

Mr.Tripathi has argued that since findings of all the three inspecting\ncommittees were almost identical, the present case is clearly a case of no\nevidence, therefore, the complaint and the summoning order dated\n15.01.2011 deserves to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">30.     He has raised the legal issue that <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 65-B</a> of the Indian Evidence\nAct, 1872 deals with the admissibility of the electronic record. The said\nprovision squarely applies to the present case since the only evidence led by\nthe complainant in his deposition is a so called tape recorded conversation\nbetween the Founder-cum-Chairman of the Complainant Institute and one\nmember of the inspecting team.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">31.     He submitted that the said tape recorded conversation clearly falls\nwithin the definition of „electronic record‟, as defined by the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_11\">Information\nTechnology Act, 2000</a> and adopted by the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_12\">Indian Evidence Act, 1972</a>.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Crl.

It is submitted that none of the conditions <a href=\"/doc/855018/\" id=\"a_13\">laid down in</a> Section 65-B of\nthe said Act were fulfilled by the complainant and its witnesses.\nConsequently, the said electronic record cannot be read in evidence and is\nliable to be ignored. The learned Court ought to have held that there was no\nevidence led by the complainant in support of the complaint in view of the\nconditions <a href=\"/doc/855018/\" id=\"a_14\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 65-B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">33.     He further raised another legal issue that no sanction was obtained\nfrom the Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCT of Delhi), which had\nappointed the petitioners.              <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. specifically requires that\nbefore taking cognizance of any offence, the Court ought to have required the\ncomplainant to obtain previous sanction from the GNCT of Delhi.                     The\npetitioners can only be removed from their office only after obtaining the\nsanction of the GNCT of Delhi. The GGSIP University has been created by\nan Act of the State Legislature of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and\nthe petitioner, Dilip K. Bandopadhyay is employed in connection with the\naffairs of the said State. Moreover, the local police duly enquired into the\ncomplaint by an officer of the level of Assistance Commissioner of Police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">34.     He has argued that the Trial Court had found that there was not\nsufficient evidence led by the complainant and, thus, directed the local police\nto inquire into the matter. Consequently, the Trial Court could not have taken\ncognizance or issued summons unless the police report revealed any fresh\nevidence to incriminate the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">35.     Learned counsel submitted that the complainant/respondent No.2 has\nsuppressed material facts deliberately that neither report dated 04.04.2010\nsubmitted by Justice Mahajan (Retired) in Writ Petition (C) No. 12724/2009,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Crl.

On the other hand, Mr. Aseem Mehrotra, learned counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the complainant/respondent No.2 submitted that the complainant\nmade out a case for summoning of the petitioners as on 03.08.1999, the\nCollege was granted approval by AICTE for starting a B. Pharmacy Degree\nCourse for the session 1999-2000 with 60 admissions. Thereafter, for the\nsessions 2000-01, 2001-02, 2005-06 and 2006-07, the College was granted\nextension of approval by AICTE with 30 admissions for each session.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">44.     Pursuant to order dated 21.02.2007 passed in W.P.(C) No. 13751/2006,\nthis Court directed the University not to insist upon the factors which are\ncovered by <a href=\"/doc/30550664/\" id=\"a_25\">AICTE Act</a> or Regulations. Accordingly, the college was granted\nextension of approval by AICTE for session 2007-08; and University granted\nprovisional affiliation to the College and made 27 admissions to the College.\nThereafter, on 19.05.2008, College was granted further extension of approval\nby AICTE for two years, i.e., session 2008-09 and 2009-10 with 30\nadmissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">45.     Learned counsel further submitted that for the session 2008-09,\ninspection report of the University shows College was awarded 1708 marks\nout of 2000. University made admissions of 30 students for the sessions\n2008-09 through centralized counseling. Thereafter, in June, 2009, College\nwas inspected by the University and it awarded 335 marks out of 900 towards\nbuilding and 645 marks out of 1000 towards faculty and infrastructure.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Crl.

The University did not recommend for admission for the session 2009-\n10, though AICTE approval was for the session 2008-09 and 2009-10. He\nsubmitted that the non-grant of admission was subject matter of challenge in\nW.P. (C) No. 9706/2009, wherein joint inspection was ordered on\n20.08.2009, in which the words „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟were mentioned.\nThereafter, Justice C.K. Mahajan ( Retd.) was appointed to carry out the\ninspection, who submitted his report, which was accepted by this Court and\nthe students were transferred to other College.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">47.     The complainant filed its complaint on 05.11.2009 with the grievance\nthat the report dated 20.08.2009 was tampered with, in which summons have\nbeen issued against the petitioners and other accused persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">48.     The respondent No.2 had led pre-summoning evidence by examining\nthe Chairman of the College and another witness to prove that the words\n„„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟ were added later on. In the pre-summoning\nevidence,       a tape recorded conversation which was recorded in a CD was\nexhibited to prove that the Chairman of the College had spoken to three\nexperts in regard to the inspection carried out on 20.08.2009 and that these\nexperts had categorically stated that the words „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟\nwere not there when they signed the report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">49.     Learned counsel has asserted that the conversation between the\nChairman of the College and three experts, who were part of the inspecting\nteam, is crucial for deciding the subject matter of the present petition. The\nconversation between the Chairman of the College and Dr. Surinder Singh,\nan expert from AIIMS is crucial as he stated that words „„NOT\nRECOMMENDED‟‟ were not written by them.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Crl. M.C. Nos. 3999 &amp; 4037-39 of 2011                            Page 17 of 31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\"> 50.     Moreover, the conversation between the Chairman of the College and\nProf. P.K. Sahu also shows that the report was written by three persons. The\nconversation further also shows that the University officials were annoyed\nwith the College. The last paragraph of the conversation with Prof. P.K. Sahu\nnotes that Prof. Sahu says that the Vice-Chancellor was annoyed with the\nChairman       of the       College and   being   experts   they cannot      write\n„recommended‟.             Thus, the evidence which the complainant led\nunequivocally establishes that the words „„NOT RECOMMENDED‟‟ were\nnot there, when at least two experts, i.e., Prof. P.K. Sahu and Dr. Surendra\nSingh had signed it, which establishes that it had been tampered with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">51.     Learned counsel submitted that the other accused Nos. 3 and 7 have\nnot challenged the summoning order.         Therefore, the order of the learned\nMagistrate does not call for any interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">52.     He submitted that both the experts do not deny the converstation as\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        &quot;a)     That they spoke to the Chairman of the College;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        b)      They do not dispute that the transcript / conversation was\n                not spoken between them and the Chairman of the\n                College;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        c)      They do not say that the conversation set out in the\n                transcript is not correct;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        d)      That their voice has been tampered or has been dubbed\n                or erased.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">53.     Learned counsel submitted that in view of the above facts, the only\nconclusion that the Chairman of the college and the experts spoke what has\nbeen stated in the transcript.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Crl.

He further submitted that there was positive evidence in shape of\nrecorded conversation.           The IO had misdirected himself in carrying the\ninvestigation. The entire emphasis of the investigation was whether College\nhad approval or not, which is evident from the status report. The second\nstatus report dated 07.01.2010 is based on the statements of two experts,\nnamely, Prof. R.K. Khar and Dr. Surendra Singh, which was contrary to what\nthey spoke to the Complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">55.

On maintainability of the complaint, the test is whether the allegations\nin the complaint disclose a criminal offence or not.        Learned counsel has\nrelied upon a case of <a href=\"/doc/39679/\" id=\"a_26\">Indian Oil Corporation Vs.

The power cannot be invoked\n        to &#x27;stifle or scuttle a legitimate prosecution.

The Court should apply the test as to whether the\n        uncontroverted allegations as made from the record of the case\n        and the documents submitted therewith prima facie establish\n        the offence or not. If the allegations are so patently absurd and\n        inherently improbable that no prudent person can ever reach\n        such a conclusion and where the basic ingredients of a criminal\n        offence are not satisfied then the Court may interfere.\n        27.8. Where the allegations made as and they appeared from\n        the record and documents annexed therewith to predominantly\n        give rise and constitute a &quot;civil wrong&quot; with no &quot;element of\n        criminality&quot; and does not satisfy the basic ingredients of a\n        criminal offence, the court may be justified in quashing the\n        charge. Even in such cases, the court would not embark upon\n        the critical analysis of the evidence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        27.9. Another very significant caution that the courts have to\n        observe is that it cannot examine the facts, evidence and\n        materials on record to determine whether there is sufficient\n        material on the basis of which the case would end in a\n        conviction; the court is concerned primarily with the\n        allegations taken as a whole whether they will constitute an\n        offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the process of court leading\n        to injustice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        27.10. It is neither necessary nor is the court called upon to\n        hold a full-fledged enquiry or to appreciate evidence collected\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Crl. M.C.

Where allegations give rise to a civil claim and also\n         amount to an offence, merely because a civil claim is\n         maintainable, does not mean that a criminal complaint cannot\n         be maintained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">         27.12.       In exercise of its jurisdiction, under Section 228\n         and/or under Section 482, the Court cannot take into\n         consideration external materials given by an accused for\n         reaching the conclusion that no offence was disclosed or that\n         there was possibility of his acquittal. The Court has to consider\n         the record and documents annexed therewith by the\n         prosecution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">         27.16. These are the principles which individually and\n         preferably cumulatively ( one or more) be taken into\n         consideration as precepts to exercise of extraordinary and wide\n         plenitude and jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code by the\n         High Court. Where the factual foundation for an offence has\n         been laid down, the courts should be reluctant and should not\n         hasten to quash the proceedings even on the premise that one\n         or two ingredients have not been stated or do not appear to be\n         satisfied if there is substantial compliance with the\n         requirements of the offence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1798503\" id=\"span_29\">59.

While <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 2(xi)</a> of the\nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988 defines „Public Servant‟ to include Vice-\nChancellor, Professor, Reader of any University, the definition of „Public\nServant‟ under <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 21</a> of IPC does not define Vice-Chancellor or any\nother employee of University to be a Public Servant, therefore, there is no\nmerit in the instant petitions and they may be dismissed with heavy costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">64.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties.             Case of the\nrespondent/complainant is that the petitioner entered into a criminal\nconspiracy with each other with a view to cheat the complainant and cause\nharm to the reputation of the College. In furtherance of this intention, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Crl. M.C.

To this effect, the complainant\nfiled the complaint before the Trial Court and vide order dated 15.01.2011,\nthe learned Magistrate issued summons against the petitioners. Earlier for the\nsession 1999-2000, the College was granted approval by AICTE with 60\nadmissions and thereafter, for the sessions 2000-01, 2001-02, 2005-06 and\n2006-07, the College was granted extension of approval by AICTE with 30\nadmissions for each session. Thereafter, the College was granted extension of\napproval by AICTE for session 2007-08 and University granted provisional\naffiliation to the College and accordingly made 27 admissions to the College.\nOn 19.05.2008, the College granted further extension of approval by AICTE\nfor two years, i.e., sessions 2008-09 and 2009-10 with 30 admissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">65.

On 27.03.2010, above named retired Judge found that the\nComplainant Institute was not fit to be run as an educational institute to\nconduct B.Pharma Course.                Accordingly, this Court while accepting the\nfindings, passed an order dated 05.05.2010 in W.P.(C) No.12724/2009 that\nstudents admitted to the roll of the College should be transferred to some\nother Institute affiliated with the University.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_78\">69.      Being aggrieved, the complainant filed an appeal being LPA No.\n540/2010 challenging the order dated 11.05.2010. The same was dismissed\non 15.07.2010. Thereafter, the Complainant Institute filed contempt petitions\nwhich were dismissed by this Court on different dates as noted above.\nMeanwhile, on 03.01.2009 complainant filed impugned complaint before the\nlearned Magistrate against ten individuals including the petitioners. Not\nbeing satisfied with the pre- summoning evidence led by the complainant, the\nlearned Trial Court vide order dated 14.12.2009 directed the local police to\ninvestigate the allegations made in the complaint.               Accordingly, after\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Crl. M.C. Nos. 3999 &amp; 4037-39 of 2011                                   Page 25 of 31</span>\n investigation, on 13.01.2010 the police filed their report in which they found\nthat no case was made out against the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\">70.     It is pertinent to mention here that enquiry was conducted by an officer\nof the level of Assistant Commissioner of Police. The said officer recorded\nthe statement of Dr. Surinder Singh, who was supposed to have admitted the\nconversation with Mr. Devender Gupta over the telephone that the words\n„NOT RECOMMENDED‟ were added later on.               Whereas, he categorically\nstated that final conclusion „NOT RECOMMENDED‟ was mentioned before\nall the members of the Committee. He further submitted that Mr. Devender\nGupta had telephonic discussion with him and he never told him that report is\ntempered because the final conclusion „NOT RECOMMENDED‟ was made\nin the report before all the members signed it. He even stated in his statement\nthat as far as recording of his voice on telephone, they usually ignore such\ncalls and try to get rid of this as soon as possible. So whatever the\nconversation has been cited by Mr. Devender Gupta, i.e., the complainant is\nmeaningless and without any substance and allegation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">71.     Considering the report dated 13.01.2010 filed by the police with the\nopinion that no offence was made out, the learned Trial Court allowed the\ncomplainant to file the objections against the said report. In view of the\nreport filed by the police and the evidence led by the complainant, the learned\nTrial Court vide order dated 15.01.2010 issued summons against six persons\nout of total ten implicated by the complainant primarily on the ground that\nthe police had not investigated the case properly and there is evidence against\nthe petitioners to be summoned for the offences under Sections 465/469/471\nread with 120-B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Crl.

Undisputedly, the joint inspection was conducted pursuant to\ndirections issued by a Division Bench of this Court vide its order dated\n18.08.2009 in LPA No. 384/2009. The issue before this Court is that whether\nthe words „NOT RECOMMENDED‟ were added subsequently after signing\nthe report by all the members. Though on perusal of the conversation it\ntranspires that Dr. Surender Singh had stated in telephonic discussion that the\nVice-Chancellor of the University was not happy with the Institute and words\n„NOT RECOMMENDED‟ were not written when they signed the report. But\non perusal of the inspection reports, one joint inspection carried out by\nAICTE and the University and another by Justice C.K. Mahajan, retired\nJudge of this Court, one can make out that the Complainant Institute could\nnot be extended any approval. The discrepancies found in two reports have\nbeen shown in the comparative chart in para 28 above of this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">73.     On perusal of the telephonic conversation between Dr. Surender Singh\nand Mr. Devender Gupta, the complainant, it seems that the complainant is\nvery friendly with Dr. Surender Singh and Professor P.K.Sahu, members of\nthe Inspection Team. It appears that they never wanted to displease the\ncomplainant, therefore, Dr. Surender Singh in a casual manner has stated that\nthe words „NOT RECOMMENDED‟ were added later on. They did not\nmention the words „NOT RECOMMENDED‟ and the same have been\nwritten later on. If the said Dr.Singh had any legitimacy in his statement he\nwould have stated the same before the Assistant Commissioner of Police who\ninvestigated the complaint pursuant to the directions issued by the Trial\nCourt. He categorically denied that the words „NOT RECOMMENDED‟\nwere discussed before the members and they signed the said report only after\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Crl. M.C.

If something was written\nor added later on<a href=\"/doc/193792759/\" id=\"a_39\">, <a href=\"/doc/193792759/\" id=\"a_40\">in that case</a></a>, Dr. Surender Singh and Professor P.K.

I am conscious the law is settled in the case of <a href=\"/doc/166329624/\" id=\"a_41\">Amit Kapoor</a> (supra)\nwhich has been relied upon by the respondent/complainant that if the records\ndisclose commission of a criminal offence and the ingredients of the offence\nare satisfied, then such criminal proceedings cannot be quashed merely\nbecause a civil wrong has been committed. The power cannot be invoked\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. to stifle or scuttle a legitimate prosecution.\nHowever, in the above cited case, it is also observed that though there are no\nlimits of power of the Court under Section 482 of the Code but the more the\npower, the more due care and caution is to be exercised in invoking these\npowers. If the allegations are so patently absurd and inherently improbable\nthat no prudent person can ever reach such a conclusion and where the basic\ningredients of a criminal offence are not satisfied then the Court may\ninterfere. Where the factual foundation of an offence has been laid down, the\nCourts should be reluctant and should not hasten to quash the proceedings\neven on the premise that one or two ingredients have not been stated or do\nnot appear to be satisfied if there is substantial compliance with the\nrequirements of the offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">75.

Power under Section 482 has to be exercised sparingly and in the\ninterest of justice but allowing the criminal proceedings to continue even\nwhere the complaint petition do not make out any offence would be\ntantamount to an abuse of the process of court, and therefore, there cannot be\nany dispute that in such case power under Section 482 of the Code can be\nexercised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">77.     Undisputedly,        the    words   „final   recommendation‟   and    „NOT\nRECOMMENDED‟ were not part of the format of the inspection report. The\ninspecting team adopted the format of the University.             Since the joint\ninspection was conducted on the directions of this Court, therefore, it was\nnecessary to give a final conclusion for the consideration of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">78.     It is pertinent to mention here that this was not so required in the first\ninspection report since the same was to be placed before a body of experts\n(the Board of Affiliation of the University) which takes the final decisions\nwhether to affiliate or not to affiliate the concerned Institute. Thus, merely\nbecause the first inspection report does not contain any remarks against the\nheading &quot;Final Recommendation&quot;, it does not show that the said remarks in\nthe second inspection report were inserted later on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">79.     It is also pertinent to mention here that the first inspection report was\nconducted by a team constituted by the University, whereas the second\ninspection team was a joint team comprising of nominees of the GGSIP\nUniversity as well as the AICTE, as directed by this Court vide its order\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Crl.

Thus, joint team deviated from the earlier pattern of not\nhaving any remarks under the heading of &quot;Final Recommendation&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">80.     In the present case, the tape recorded conversation being sought to be\nled in evidence by the complainant is between the complainant and some\nthird party. Interestingly, subsequently during investigation, the said third\nparty has clarified that there was no forgery and the words „NOT\nRECOMMENDED‟ were written in his presence. In the given situation, if\nthis Court allows continuing the proceedings before the Trial Court; firstly,\nthe conversation would not be proved and; secondly, there will be harassment\nto the petitioners. Moreover, precious public time would be wasted without\nany fruitful result.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">81.     Initially, the Trial Court had found that there was no sufficient\nevidence led by the complainant, therefore, directed the local police to\nenquire into the matter.           Admittedly, the police filed the report wherein\nspecifically stated that no case is made out. In that eventuality, neither the\nsufficient evidence led by the complaint is on record nor any fresh evidence\nrelied by the police to incriminate the petitioners is on record. In such\neventuality, the learned Trial Court should not have issued the summons\nagainst the petitioners until and unless some substantial evidence has come\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">82.     It is also pertinent to note that had the complainant brought each and\nevery proceeding and orders passed by this Court before the learned Trial\nCourt, the said court would not have passed the impugned order. If for a\nmoment it is assumed that the joint inspection report submitted by the\nCommittee was in favour of the Complainant College and thereafter,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Crl.
