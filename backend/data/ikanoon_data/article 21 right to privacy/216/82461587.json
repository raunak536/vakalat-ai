INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n               “It was the best of times, it was the worst\n              of times,\n\n              it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of\n              foolishness,\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">              it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch\n              of incredulity,\n\n              it was the season of Light, it was the\n              season of Darkness,\n\n              it was the spring of hope, it was the winter\n              of despair,\n\n              we had everything before us, we had\n              nothing before us,\n\n              we were all going direct to Heaven, we\n              were all going direct the other way­\n\n              in short, the period was so far like the\n              present period, that some of its noisiest\n              authorities insisted on its being received,\n              for good or for evil, in the superlative\n              degree of comparison only.”\n\n                        ­Charles Dickens in A Tale of Two Cities\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                   2</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">\f1.   Although cherished in our heart as a “Paradise on Earth”, the\n\n     history of this beautiful land is etched with violence and\n\n     militancy. While the mountains of Himalayas spell tranquillity,\n\n     yet   blood   is   shed   every   day.   In   this   land   of   inherent\n\n     contradictions, these petitions add to the list, wherein two sides\n\n     have shown two different pictures which are diametrically\n\n     opposite and factually irreconcilable. In this context, this Court’s\n\n     job is compounded by the magnitude of the task before it. It goes\n\n     without saying that this Court will not delve into the political\n\n     propriety of the decision taken herein, which is best left for\n\n     democratic forces to act on. Our limited scope is to strike a\n\n     balance between the liberty and security concerns so that the\n\n     right to life is secured and enjoyed in the best possible manner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">2.   Liberty and security have always been at loggerheads. The\n\n     question before us, simply put, is what do we need more, liberty\n\n     or security? Although the choice is seemingly challenging, we\n\n     need to clear ourselves from the platitude of rhetoric and provide\n\n     a meaningful answer so that every citizen has adequate security\n\n     and sufficient liberty. The pendulum of preference should not\n\n     swing in either extreme direction so that one preference\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                             3</span>\n\f     compromises the other. It is not our forte to answer whether it is\n\n     better to be free than secure or be secure rather than free.\n\n     However, we are here only to ensure that citizens are provided all\n\n     the rights and liberty to the highest extent in a given situation\n\n     while ensuring security at the same time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   The genesis of the issue starts with the Security Advisory issued\n\n     by the Civil Secretariat, Home Department, Government of\n\n     Jammu and Kashmir, advising the tourists and the Amarnath\n\n     Yatris to curtail their stay and make arrangements for their\n\n     return in the interest of safety and security. Subsequently,\n\n     educational institutions and offices were ordered to remain shut\n\n     until further orders. On 04.08.2019, mobile phone networks,\n\n     internet services, landline connectivity were all discontinued in\n\n     the valley, with restrictions on movement also being imposed in\n\n     some areas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.   On 05.08.2019, Constitutional Order 272 was issued by the\n\n     President, applying all provisions of the Constitution of India to\n\n     the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and modifying <a href=\"/doc/579323/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 367\n\n     (Interpretation)</a> in its application to the State of Jammu and\n\n     Kashmir. In light of the prevailing circumstances, on the same\n\n     day, the District Magistrates, apprehending breach of peace and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                      4</span>\n\f     tranquillity, imposed restrictions on movement and public\n\n     gatherings by virtue of powers vested under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C.\n\n     Due to the aforesaid restrictions, the Petitioner in W.P. (C) No.\n\n     1031 of 2019 claims that the movement of journalists was\n\n     severely restricted and on 05.08.2019, the Kashmir Times\n\n     Srinagar Edition could not be distributed. The Petitioner has\n\n     submitted that since 06.08.2019, she has been unable to publish\n\n     the Srinagar edition of Kashmir Times pursuant to the aforesaid\n\n     restrictions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">5.   Aggrieved by the same, the Petitioners (Ms. Anuradha Bhasin and\n\n     Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad) approached this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 32</a>\n\n     of the Constitution seeking issuance of an appropriate writ for\n\n     setting aside or quashing any and all order(s), notification(s),\n\n     direction(s) and/or circular(s) issued by the Respondents under\n\n     which any/all modes of communication including internet,\n\n     mobile and fixed line telecommunication services have been shut\n\n     down or suspended or in any way made inaccessible or\n\n     unavailable in any locality. Further, the Petitioners sought the\n\n     issuance    of   an   appropriate   writ   or   direction   directing\n\n     Respondents to immediately restore all modes of communication\n\n     including mobile, internet and landline services throughout\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                        5</span>\n\f     Jammu     and   Kashmir    in   order   to   provide   an   enabling\n\n     environment for the media to practice its profession. Moreover,\n\n     the Petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 1031 of 2019 also pleaded to pass\n\n     any appropriate writ or direction directing the Respondents to\n\n     take necessary steps for ensuring free and safe movement of\n\n     reporters and journalists and other media personnel. Lastly, she\n\n     also pleaded for the framing of guidelines ensuring that the rights\n\n     and means of media personnel to report and publish news is not\n\n     unreasonably curtailed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.   Moreover, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad (Petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 1164\n\n     of 2019), alleges that he was stopped from travelling to his\n\n     constituency in Jammu and Kashmir. In this context, he alleges\n\n     that due to the aforesaid restrictions, he is not able to\n\n     communicate with the people of his constituency.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.   When W.P. (C) No. 1164 of 2019 (by Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad), was\n\n     listed before a Co­ordinate Bench of this Court on 16.09.2019,\n\n     the following order was passed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               “Issue notice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               We permit the petitioner to go to Srinagar and\n               visit the following districts, subject to\n               restrictions, if any:­\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               (i) Srinagar, (ii) Anantnag, (iii) Baramulla and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">               (iv) Jammu.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                        6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\f               The petitioner has undertaken before the Court\n               on his own volition that he will not indulge in\n               any political rally or political activity during his\n               visit. The visit will solely be concerned with\n               making an assessment of the impact of the\n               present situation on the life of the daily wage\n               earners, if any.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">               So far as prayers (2) and (3) of the writ petition\n               are concerned, the State as well as, the Union\n               of India will respond within two weeks hence.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8.   When W.P. (C) No. 1031 of 2019, was listed on 16.08.2019, the\n\n     matter was ordered to be tagged along with W.P. (C) No. 1013 of\n\n     2019 (five­Judge Bench) and was later de­tagged. On 16.09.2019,\n\n     a Co­ordinate Bench of this Court ordered the following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               “The State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, keeping in\n               mind the national interest and internal\n               security, shall make all endeavours to ensure\n               that normal life is restored in Kashmir; people\n               have access to healthcare facilities and\n               schools, colleges and other educational\n               institutions and public transport functions and\n               operates normally. All forms of communication,\n               subject to overriding consideration of national\n               security, shall be normalized, if required on a\n               selective basis, particularly for healthcare\n               facilities.”\n\n     When the said writ petition was listed before this Bench on\n\n     01.10.2019, in light of expediency, this Bench directed that no\n\n     further intervention applications shall be entertained. However,\n\n     liberty was granted to file additional documents in support of\n\n     applications for intervention. When the matter came up for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                      7</span>\n\fhearing on the next date on 16.10.2019, the following order was\n\npassed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          “When these matters came up for hearing\n          today, learned Solicitor General appearing for\n          the Union of India made a submission that\n          after filing the counter affidavit in these\n          matters, certain further developments have\n          taken place and some of the restrictions\n          imposed have been relaxed, particularly with\n          reference to mobile connectivity as well as the\n          landlines services etc. and, therefore, he wants\n          to file another additional affidavit indicating\n          the steps taken by the Government about\n          relaxation of some restrictions. He also made a\n          request to accommodate him for a week only.\n          During the course of hearing, we are informed\n          by the learned\n\n          Senior counsel appearing for the petitioners\n          that the orders which are issued by the\n          authorities relating to the restrictions imposed\n          have not been provided to them so far.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          When we asked the learned Solicitor General\n          about the non­ supply of orders issued by the\n          authorities relating to the restrictions imposed,\n          particularly with respect to the cell phone\n          services as well as <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 144</a> proceedings, he\n          claims privilege over those orders.

CONTENTIONS\n\n\nMs. Vrinda Grover, Counsel for the Petitioner in W.P. (C) No.\n\n1031 of 2019\n\n\n   It was contended that the petitioner, being executive editor\n    of one of the major newspapers, was not able to function\n    post 05.08.2019, due to various restrictions imposed on the\n    press.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">   Print media came to a grinding halt due to non­availability\n    of internet services, which in her view, is absolutely\n    essential for the modern press.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">   Curtailment of the internet, is a restriction on the right to\n    free speech, should be tested on the basis of reasonableness\n    and proportionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">   The procedure that is to be followed for restricting Internet\n    services is provided under the Temporary Suspension of\n    Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Service)\n    Rules, 2017 [hereinafter “Suspension Rules”], which were\n    notified under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_6\">Telegraph Act</a>.

Public order is not the\n    same as law and order, and the situation at the time when\n    the orders were passed did not warrant the passing of the\n    orders resulting in restrictions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">Mr. Kapil Sibal, Senior Counsel for the Petitioner in W.P. (C)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">No. 1164 of 2019</span>\n\n\n   Learned senior counsel submitted that the orders of the\n    authorities had to be produced before the Court, and cannot\n    be the subject of privilege, as claimed by the State.\n   It was submitted that the conduct of the State, in producing\n    documents and status reports during argumentation, was\n    improper, as it did not allow the Petitioners with sufficient\n    opportunity to rebut the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">   Learned senior counsel submitted that the Union of India\n    can declare an emergency only in certain limited situations.\n    Neither any ‘internal disturbance’ nor any ‘external\n    aggression’ has been shown in the present case for the\n    imposition of restrictions which are akin to the declaration\n    of Emergency.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">   With respect to the orders restricting movement passed\n    under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C., the learned senior counsel\n    contended that such an order is made to deal with a ‘law\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                              10</span>\n\f    and order’ situation, but the orders do not indicate any\n    existing law and order issue, or apprehension thereof.\n   Learned senior counsel pointed out that the order of the\n    Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C. cannot be passed to\n    the public generally, and must be specifically against the\n    people or the group which is apprehended to disturb the\n    peace. It is necessary for the State to identify the persons\n    causing the problem, and an entire State cannot be brought\n    to a halt. Moreover, he has contended that there was no\n    application of mind before passing those orders.\n   While submitting that it could be assumed that there was\n    some material available for the purpose of passing the\n    orders under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C., the question which then\n    arises is how the State balances the rights of individuals.\n   The learned senior counsel, with respect to the\n    communications’ restrictions, submitted that the State had\n    not indicated as to the necessity to block landline services.\n    He further submitted that the communications/Internet\n    restrictions which were imposed under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian Telegraph\n    Act, 1885</a> [hereinafter “<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_11\">Telegraph Act</a>”] needs to follow the\n    provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5</a> of the Telegraph Act, in line with\n    <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. While there can be some\n    restrictions, there can be no blanket orders, as it would\n    amount to a complete ban. Instead, a distinction should be\n    drawn while imposing restrictions on social media/mass\n    communication and the general internet. The least\n    restrictive option must be put in place, and the State should\n    have taken preventive or protective measures. Ultimately,\n    the State needs to balance the safety of the people with their\n    lawful exercise of their fundamental rights.\n   On internet restrictions, the learned senior counsel\n    submitted that such restrictions not only impact the right to\n    free speech of individuals but also impinges on their right to\n    trade. Therefore, a less restrictive measure, such as\n    restricting only social media websites like Facebook and\n    Whatsapp, should and could have been passed, as has been\n    done in India while prohibiting human trafficking and child\n    pornography websites. The learned senior counsel pointed\n    to orders passed in Bihar, and in Jammu and Kashmir in\n    2017, restricting only social media websites, and submitted\n    that the same could have been followed in this case as well.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                               11</span>\n\f   Indicating that the State can impose restrictions, the\n    learned senior counsel focussed on the question of the\n    “least restrictive measure” that can be passed. The learned\n    senior counsel submitted that while imposing restrictions,\n    the rights of individuals need to be balanced against the\n    duty of the State to ensure security. The State must ensure\n    that measures are in place that allows people to continue\n    with their life, such as public transportation for work and\n    schools, to facilitate business, etc.\n\nMr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Counsel for Intervenor in I.A. No.\n\n139141 of 2019 in W.P.

These restrictions need to be tested on\n    the anvil of the test of proportionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">   Learned senior counsel submitted that <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C.\n    orders should be based on some objective material and not\n    merely on conjectures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">Mr. Dushyant Dave, Senior Counsel for the Intervenor in I.A.\n\nNo. 139555 in W.P. (C) No. 1031 of 2019\n\n\n   Learned senior counsel attempted to highlight that the issue\n    of balancing the measures necessary for ensuring national\n    security or curbing terrorism, with the rights of the citizens,\n    is an endeavour that is not unique, and has been\n    undertaken by Courts in various jurisdictions. Learned\n    senior counsel relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court\n    of Israel concerning the Legality of the General Security\n    Service&#x27;s Interrogation Methods in Public Committee\n    Against Torture in Israel v. Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471\n    (1999) relating to the question of whether torture during\n    interrogation of an alleged terrorist was permissible. In that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                12</span>\n\f      case, the Israeli Supreme Court held that such acts were\n      unconstitutional, and could not be justified in light of the\n      freedoms and liberties afforded to the citizens of Israel.\n     Learned senior counsel drew parallels between the situation\n      faced by the Israeli Supreme Court in the abovementioned\n      case, and that before this Court, wherein, according to the\n      learned senior counsel, the State is attempting to justify the\n      restrictions due to the circumstances prevailing in the State\n      of Jammu and Kashmir. The learned senior counsel\n      submitted that such a justification merits rejection as it\n      would amount to granting too much power to the State to\n      impose broad restrictions on fundamental rights in varied\n      situations. It would amount to individual liberty being\n      subsumed by social control.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">     The learned senior counsel emphasized on the seriousness\n      of the present matter, stating that such restrictions on the\n      fundamental rights is the reason for the placement of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_17\">Article\n      32</a> of the Constitution in Part III, as a fundamental right\n      which allows for the enforcement of the other fundamental\n      rights. He referred to the Constituent Assembly debates to\n      highlight the import of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 32</a>, as contemplated by the\n      Members of the Constituent Assembly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">     The learned senior counsel also placed before this Court the\n      Government of India National Telecom Policy, 2012, and\n      submitted that the wide restrictions imposed by the State\n      are in contravention of the aforementioned policy. He\n      submitted that the freedom of speech and expression is\n      meant to allow people to discuss the burning topic of the\n      day, including the abrogation of <a href=\"/doc/666119/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 370</a> of the\n      Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">     Lastly, the learned senior counsel emphasized that the\n      restrictions that were imposed are meant to be temporary in\n      nature, have lasted for more than 100 days, which fact\n      should be taken into account by this Court while deciding\n      the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">Ms. Meenakshi Arora, Senior Counsel for the Intervenor in\n\nI.A.

The\n    necessity of publication of law is a part of the rule of natural\n    justice. Not only must the orders be published, it is also\n    necessary that these orders be made available and\n    accessible to the public. The State cannot refuse to produce\n    the orders before the Court or claim any privilege.\n   The learned senior counsel further submitted that,\n    notwithstanding the expediency of the situation, the\n    necessity of a measure must be shown by the State. The\n    people have a right to speak their view, whether good, bad\n    or ugly, and the State must prove that it was necessary to\n    restrict the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_21\"> On the point of proportionality, the learned senior counsel\n    submitted that the test of proportionality was upheld by this\n    Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_22\">K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India</a>,\n    (2017) 10 SCC 1 (hereinafter “K. S. Puttaswamy (Privacy­\n    9J.)”) and therefore the proportionality of a measure must\n    be determined while looking at the restrictions being\n    imposed by the State on the fundamental rights of citizens.\n    The learned senior counsel pointed out that it is not just the\n    legal and physical restrictions that must be looked at, but\n    also the fear that these sorts of restrictions engender in the\n    minds of the populace, while looking at the proportionality\n    of measures.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">Mr. Sanjay Hegde, Senior Counsel for the Petitioner in W.P.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">(Crl.)

The\n    learned senior counsel submitted on behalf of the Petitioner\n    that although he and his family were law abiding citizens,\n    yet they are suffering the effects of the restrictions. Citing\n    the House of Lords judgment of Liversidge v. Anderson,\n    (1941) 3 All ER 338 the learned senior counsel submitted\n    that it was the dissent by Lord Atkin, upholding the\n    fundamental rights of the citizens of the United Kingdom,\n    which is now the law of the land.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"117627977\" id=\"span_24\">Mr. K.

He submitted that the\n    background of terrorism in the State of Jammu and\n    Kashmir needs to be taken into account. Relying on\n    <a href=\"/doc/117627977/\" id=\"a_23\">National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah\n    Watali</a>, 2019 (5) SCC 1, the learned Attorney General\n    submitted that this Court while deciding the aforementioned\n    case, has taken cognizance of the problem of terrorism in\n    the State before.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">   According to the learned Attorney General, keeping in mind\n    the facts regarding cross border terrorism and internal\n    militancy, it would have been foolish to have not taken any\n    preventive measures in the circumstances. The necessity of\n    the orders under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C. are apparent from the\n    background facts and circumstances, when there can be\n    huge violence if the Government did not take these kinds of\n    measures.

He further\n  submitted that the facts relied on by the Petitioners and the\n  Intervenors were incorrect, as they did not have the correct\n  information about the factual position on the ground in the\n  State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\"> The learned Solicitor General submitted that the historical\n  background of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is\n  necessary to be looked at to understand the measures taken\n  by the State. The State has been a victim of both physical\n  and digital cross border terrorism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\"> The abrogation of <a href=\"/doc/666119/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 370</a> of the Constitution on\n  05.08.2019 was a historic step, which resulted not in the\n  taking away of the rights of the citizens of Jammu and\n  Kashmir, but conferment of rights upon them which they\n  never had. Now, with the abrogation, 106 people friendly\n  laws have become applicable to the State of Jammu and\n  Kashmir.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\"> The learned Solicitor General submitted that the Petitioners\n  were incorrect to state that public movement was restricted.\n  In fact, individual movement had never been restricted.\n  Additionally, while schools were closed initially, they have\n  now been reopened. Depending on the facts, circumstances\n  and requirements of an area, restrictions were put in place\n  which are now being relaxed gradually.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\"> On the orders passed by the Magistrates under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 144</a>,\n  Cr.P.C., in their respective jurisdictional areas, the learned\n  Solicitor General submitted that they were best placed to\n  know the situation on the ground, and then took their\n  respective decisions accordingly. Currently, there is nearly\n  hundred percent relaxation of restrictions. Restrictions were\n  being relaxed on the basis of the threat perception.\n  Restrictions were never imposed in the Ladakh region. This\n  fact shows that there was application of mind while passing\n  the orders by the officers on the ground, and that there was\n  no general clampdown, as is being suggested by the\n  Petitioners.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\"> Further, the learned Solicitor General pointed to various\n  figures to indicate that people were leading their ordinary\n  lives in the State. He submitted that all newspapers,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                             16</span>\n\f    television and radio channels are functioning, including\n    from Srinagar, where the Petitioner in W.P.

The Magistrate can\n    pass the order even on the basis of personal knowledge, and\n    the same is supposed to be a speedy mechanism. The\n    orders passed must be considered keeping in mind the\n    history and the background of the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"496236\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"690805\" id=\"span_28\">   Relying on <a href=\"/doc/690805/\" id=\"a_28\">Babulal Parate v.

Regarding the\n    Petitioners’ submission that the restrictions could have\n    been imposed on specific individuals, the learned Solicitor\n    General submitted that it was impossible to segregate, and\n    control, the troublemakers from the ordinary citizens.\n   The learned Solicitor General submitted that there were\n    enough facts in the knowledge of the Magistrate to pass the\n    orders under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C. There was sufficient\n    speculation on the ground to suggest that there might be a\n    move to abrogate <a href=\"/doc/666119/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 370</a> of the Constitution, and they\n    were aware of the situation on the ground. Provocative\n    speeches and messages were being transmitted. This\n    information is all available in the public domain.\n   It was further submitted that the Court does not sit in\n    appeal of the decision to impose restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_32\">Section\n    144</a>, Cr.P.C. and has limited jurisdiction to interfere,\n    particularly when there are no allegations of mala fide made\n    against the officers and when the question involved is of\n    national security. The level of restriction required is best left\n    to the officers who are on the ground with the requisite\n    information and knowledge, and the same is not to be\n    replaced by the opinion of the Courts.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                  17</span>\n\f        With respect to the communications and internet shutdown,\n         the learned Solicitor General submitted that internet was\n         never restricted in the Jammu and Ladakh regions. Further,\n         he submitted that social media, which allowed people to\n         send messages and communicate with a number of people\n         at the same time, could be used as a means to incite\n         violence. The purpose of the limited and restricted use of\n         internet is to ensure that the situation on the ground would\n         not be aggravated by targeted messages from outside the\n         country. Further, the internet allows for the transmission of\n         false news or fake images, which are then used to spread\n         violence. The dark web allows individuals to purchase\n         weapons and illegal substances easily.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">        The learned Solicitor General submitted that the\n         jurisprudence on free speech relating to newspapers cannot\n         be applied to the internet, as both the media are different.\n         While newspapers only allowed one­way communication,\n         the internet makes two­way communication by which\n         spreading of messages are very easy. The different context\n         should be kept in mind by the Court while dealing with the\n         restrictions with respect to the two media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">        While referring to various photographs, tweets and\n         messages of political leaders of Kashmir, he stated that\n         these statements are highly misleading, abrasive and\n         detrimental to the integrity and sovereignty of India.\n        Further, it is not possible to ban only certain websites/parts\n         of the Internet while allowing access to other parts. Such a\n         measure was earlier attempted in 2017, but it was not\n         successful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">        Lastly, the learned Solicitor General submitted that the\n         orders passed under the Suspension Rules were passed in\n         compliance with the procedure in the Suspension Rules,\n         and are being reviewed strictly in terms of the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">9.

The Petitioners and Intervenors claim that the orders\n\n    were not available, which is why they could not place them on\n\n    record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">12. At the same time, while the non­availability of orders was not\n\n    denied by the Respondent­State, they did not produce the said\n\n    orders. In fact, when this Court by order dated 16.10.2019 asked\n\n    them to produce the orders, the Respondent­State placed on\n\n    record only sample orders, citing difficulty in producing the\n\n    numerous orders which were being withdrawn and modified on a\n\n    day­to­day basis. The Respondent­State also claimed that the\n\n    plea to produce orders by the Petitioners was an expansion of the\n\n    scope of the present petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">13. At the outset, a perusal of the prayers in the Writ Petitions before\n\n    us should be sufficient to reject the aforementioned contention of\n\n    the Respondent­State. In W.P.

Further, production of all orders by way of\n\n    which communication has been blocked in State of Jammu and\n\n    Kashmir has also been sought.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_33\">14. On the obligation of the State to disclose information, particularly\n\n    in a writ proceeding, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_34\">Ram Jethmalani v. Union of\n\n    India</a>, (2011) 8 SCC 1, observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">               “75. In order that the right guaranteed by\n               clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 32</a> be meaningful, and\n               particularly because such petitions seek the\n               protection of fundamental rights, it is\n               imperative that in such proceedings the\n               petitioners are not denied the information\n               necessary for them to properly articulate\n               the case and be heard, especially where\n               such information is in the possession of the\n               State.”\n\n\n                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">15. We may note that there are two separate types of reasoning that\n\n    mandates us to order production of the orders passed by the\n\n    authorities in this case. First, <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution has\n\n    been interpreted to mandate right to information as an important\n\n    facet of the right to freedom of speech and expression. A\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                     21</span>\n\f   democracy, which is sworn to transparency and accountability,\n\n   necessarily mandates the production of orders as it is the right of\n\n   an individual to know. Moreover, fundamental rights itself\n\n   connote a qualitative requirement wherein the State has to act in\n\n   a responsible manner to uphold Part III of the Constitution and\n\n   not to take away these rights in an implied fashion or in casual\n\n   and cavalier manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">16. Second, there is no dispute that democracy entails free flow of\n\n   information. There is not only a normative expectation under the\n\n   Constitution, but also a requirement under natural law, that no\n\n   law should be passed in a clandestine manner. As Lon L. Fuller\n\n   suggests in his celebrated article “there can be no greater legal\n\n   monstrosity than a secret statute”.1 In this regard, Jeremy\n\n   Bentham spoke about open justice as the “keenest spur to\n\n   exertion”. In the same context, James Madison stated “a popular\n\n   government, without popular information, or the means of\n\n   acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps\n\n   both. Knowledge will forever govern the ignorance and a people\n\n\n\n\n   1Lon L. Fuller, Positivism and Fidelity to Law: A Reply to Professor Hart, The Harvard Law\n   Review, 71(4), 630, 651 [February, 1958].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                                         22</span>\n\f    who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with\n\n    the power which knowledge gives”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">17. As a general principle, on a challenge being made regarding the\n\n    curtailment of fundamental rights as a result of any order passed\n\n    or action taken by the State which is not easily available, the\n\n    State should take a proactive approach in ensuring that all the\n\n    relevant orders are placed before the Court, unless there is some\n\n    specific ground of privilege or countervailing public interest to be\n\n    balanced, which must be specifically claimed by the State on\n\n    affidavit. In such cases, the Court could determine whether, in\n\n    the facts and circumstances, the privilege or public interest claim\n\n    of the State overrides the interests of the Petitioner. Such portion\n\n    of the order can be redacted or such material can be claimed as\n\n    privileged, if the State justifies such redaction on the grounds, as\n\n    allowed under the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">18. In the present case, while the State initially claimed privilege, it\n\n    subsequently dropped the claim and produced certain sample\n\n    orders, citing difficulty in producing all the orders before this\n\n    Court. In our opinion, this is not a valid ground to refuse\n\n    production of orders before the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                     23</span>\n\fE. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS UNDER PART III AND RESTRICTIONS\n\nTHEREOF\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">19. The petitioners have contended that the impugned restrictions\n\n    have affected the freedom of movement, freedom of speech and\n\n    expression and right to free trade and avocation. In this context,\n\n    we have to first examine the nature of the fundamental rights\n\n    provided under the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">20. The nature of fundamental rights under Part III of the\n\n    Constitution   is   well     settled.   The   fundamental     rights    are\n\n    prescribed as a negative list, so that “no person could be denied\n\n    such   right   until   the     Constitution    itself   prescribes     such\n\n    limitations”. The only exception to the aforesaid formulation is\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/154644006/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21A</a> of the Constitution, which is a positive right that\n\n    requires an active effort by the concerned government to ensure\n\n    that the right to education is provided to all children up to the\n\n    age of 16 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">21. The positive prescription of freedom of expression will result in\n\n    different consequences which our own Constitution has not\n\n    entered into. Having different social and economic backgrounds\n\n    and existing on a different scale of development, the human\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                             24</span>\n\f    rights enshrined therein have taken a different role and purpose.\n\n    The framers of the Indian Constitution were aware of the\n\n    situation of India, including the socio­economic costs of such\n\n    proactive duty, and thereafter took an informed decision to\n\n    restrict the application of fundamental rights in a negative\n\n    manner. This crucial formulation is required to be respected by\n\n    this Court, which has to uphold the constitutional morality\n\n    behind utilization of such negative prescriptions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">22. Now, we need to concern ourselves about the freedom of\n\n    expression over the medium of internet. There is no gainsaying\n\n    that in today’s world the internet stands as the most utilized and\n\n    accessible medium for exchange of information. The revolution\n\n    within the cyberspace has been phenomenal in the past decade,\n\n    wherein the limitation of storage space and accessibility of print\n\n    medium has been remedied by the usage of internet.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">23. At this point it is important to note the argument of Mr. Vinton\n\n    G. Cerf, one of the ‘fathers of the internet’. He argued that while\n\n    the internet is very important, however, it cannot be elevated to\n\n    the status of a human right.2 Technology, in his view, is an\n\n    enabler of rights and not a right in and of itself. He distinguishes\n    2 Vinton G. Cerf, Internet Access is not a Human Right, The New York Times (January 04,\n    2012).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                                              25</span>\n\f   between placing technology among the exalted category of other\n\n   human rights, such as the freedom of conscience, equality etc.\n\n   With great respect to his opinion, the prevalence and extent of\n\n   internet proliferation cannot be undermined in one’s life.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">24. Law and technology seldom mix like oil and water. There is a\n\n   consistent criticism that the development of technology is not met\n\n   by equivalent movement in the law. In this context, we need to\n\n   note that the law should imbibe the technological development\n\n   and accordingly mould its rules so as to cater to the needs of\n\n   society. Non recognition of technology within the sphere of law is\n\n   only a disservice to the inevitable. In this light, the importance of\n\n   internet cannot be underestimated, as from morning to night we\n\n   are encapsulated within the cyberspace and our most basic\n\n   activities are enabled by the use of internet.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_40\">25. We need to distinguish between the internet as a tool and the\n\n   freedom of expression through the internet. There is no dispute\n\n   that freedom of speech and expression includes the right to\n\n   disseminate information to as wide a section of the population as\n\n   is possible. The wider range of circulation of information or its\n\n   greater impact cannot restrict the content of the right nor can it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                     26</span>\n\f   justify its denial.

In this context, we\n\n   may note that this Court, in a catena of judgments, has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                   27</span>\n\f    recognized   free   speech      as   a   fundamental       right,   and,    as\n\n    technology has evolved, has recognized the freedom of speech\n\n    and expression over different media of expression. Expression\n\n    through the internet has gained contemporary relevance and is\n\n    one of the major means of information diffusion. Therefore, the\n\n    freedom of speech and expression through the medium of\n\n    internet is an integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and accordingly, any\n\n    restriction on the same must be in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 19(2)</a>\n\n    of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">27. In this context, we need to note that the internet is also a very\n\n    important tool for trade and commerce. The globalization of the\n\n    Indian economy and the rapid advances in information and\n\n    technology   have      opened    up      vast   business     avenues       and\n\n    transformed India as a global IT hub. There is no doubt that\n\n    there are certain trades which are completely dependent on the\n\n    internet. Such a right of trade through internet also fosters\n\n    consumerism and availability of choice. Therefore, the freedom of\n\n    trade and commerce through the medium of the internet is also\n\n    constitutionally protected under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>, subject to the\n\n    restrictions provided under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 19(6).</a>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                                28</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">\f28. None of the counsels have argued for declaring the right to access\n\n    the internet as a fundamental right and therefore we are not\n\n    expressing any view on the same. We are confining ourselves to\n\n    declaring that the right to freedom of speech and expression\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, and the right to carry on any trade or\n\n    business under 19(1)(g), using the medium of internet is\n\n    constitutionally protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">29. Having explained the nature of fundamental rights and the utility\n\n    of internet under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution, we need to\n\n    concern ourselves with respect to limitations provided under the\n\n    Constitution on these rights. With respect to the freedom of\n\n    speech and expression, restrictions are provided under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_51\">Article\n\n    19(2)</a> of the Constitution, which reads as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">              “(2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall\n              affect the operation of any existing law, or\n              prevent the State from making any law, in so\n              far as such law imposes reasonable\n              restrictions on the exercise of the right\n              conferred by the said sub­clause in the\n              interests of the sovereignty and integrity of\n              India, the security of the State, friendly\n              relations with foreign States, public order,\n              decency or morality or in relation to contempt\n              of court, defamation or incitement to an\n              offence.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                   29</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">\f30.

The second prong of the test, wherein this Court is required to\n\n   find whether the imposed restriction/prohibition was least\n\n   intrusive,   brings   us   to   the   question   of   balancing   and\n\n   proportionality. These concepts are not a new formulation under\n\n   the Constitution.

There is no doubt\n\n   that Jammu and Kashmir has been a hot bed of terrorist\n\n   insurgencies for many years.

The geopolitical struggle cannot be played\n\n   down or ignored. In line with the aforesaid requirement, we may\n\n   note that even the broadest guarantee of free speech would not\n\n   protect the entire gamut of speech. The question which begs to be\n\n   answered is whether there exists a clear and present danger in\n\n   restricting such expression.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_77\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">36. Modern terrorism heavily relies on the internet. Operations on\n\n   the internet do not require substantial expenditure and are not\n\n   traceable easily. The internet is being used to support fallacious\n\n   proxy     wars      by     raising     money,       recruiting       and     spreading\n\n   propaganda/ideologies. The prevalence of the internet provides\n\n   an easy inroad to young impressionable minds. In this regard,\n\n   Gregory S.

Brenner,4 NCR Distinguished Professor of Law and\n\n   Technology, University of Dayton School of Law, also notes that\n\n   the traditional approach has not worked satisfactorily on\n\n   terrorism due to the proliferation of the internet. It is the\n\n   contention of the respondents that the restriction on the freedom\n\n   of speech was imposed due to the fact that there were national\n\n   security issues over and above a law and order situation, wherein\n\n   there were problems of infiltration and support from the other\n\n   side of the border to instigate violence and terrorism. The learned\n\n   Solicitor General pointed out that the ‘war on terrorism’ requires\n\n   imposition of such restriction so as to nip the problem of\n\n   terrorism in the bud. He submitted that in earlier times,\n\n   sovereignty and integrity of a State was challenged only on\n\n   occurrence of war. In some cases, there have been instances\n\n   4 Susan W.

However, the traditional conceptions of warfare\n\n   have undergone an immense change and now it has been\n\n   replaced by a new term called ‘war on terror’. This war, unlike the\n\n   earlier ones, is not limited to territorial fights, rather, it\n\n   transgresses into other forms affecting normal life. The fight\n\n   against terror cannot be equated to a law and order situation as\n\n   well.   In      this   light,   we    observe   that   this   confusion    of\n\n   characterising terrorism as a war stricto sensu or a normal law\n\n   and     order     situation     has   plagued   the    submission   of    the\n\n   respondent Government and we need to carefully consider such\n\n   submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">38. Before analysing the restrictions imposed on the freedom of\n\n   speech and expression in the Indian context, we need to have a\n\n   broad analysis of the state of affairs in the United States of\n\n   America (hereinafter ‘US’) where freedom of expression under the\n\n   First Amendment is treated to be very significant with the US\n\n   being perceived to be one of the liberal constituencies with\n\n   respect to free speech jurisprudence.

During the US civil war, a dramatic confrontation over free\n\n   speech arose with respect to the speech of Clement L.\n\n   Vallandigham, who gave a speech calling the civil war ‘wicked,\n\n   cruel and unnecessary’. He urged the citizens to use ballot boxes\n\n   to hurl ‘President Lincoln’ from his throne. As a reaction, Union\n\n   soldiers arrested Mr. Vallandigham and he had to face a five­\n\n   member military commission which charged him with ‘declaring\n\n   disloyal sentiments and opinions with the object and purpose of\n\n   weakening the power of the government in its efforts to suppress\n\n   an unlawful rebellion’. [Ex parte Vallandigham, 28 F. Cas. 874\n\n   (1863)] The commission found Mr. Vallandigham guilty and\n\n   imposed    imprisonment     during     the   war.     The     aforesaid\n\n   imprisonment was met with demonstrations and publications\n\n   calling   such   imprisonment   as     a   crime    against   the   US\n\n   Constitution. President Lincoln, having regard to the US\n\n   Constitution, commuted the imprisonment and converted the\n\n   same to banishment.

During World War I, many within the US had strong feelings\n\n   against the war and the draft imposed by the administration of\n\n   President Woodrow Wilson. During this period, the US enacted\n\n   the Espionage Act, 1917 which penalised any person who wilfully\n\n   caused or attempted to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny\n\n   by refusal from duty or naval services. In any case, in Abraham\n\n   v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919), Justice Holmes even in\n\n   his dissent observed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">             “I do not doubt for a moment that, by the same\n             reasoning that would justify punishing\n             persuasion to murder, the United States\n             constitutionally may punish speech that\n             produces or is intended to produce a clear and\n             imminent danger that it will bring about\n             forthwith certain substantive evils that the\n             United States constitutionally may seek to\n             prevent.

During the Cold War, the attention of the American Congress was\n\n   on the increase of communism. In 1954, Congress even enacted\n\n   the Communist Control Act, which stripped the Communist party\n\n   of all rights, privileges and immunities. During this time, Dennis\n\n   v.

At the same time, we need to note that when it comes to\n\n   balancing national security with liberty, we need to be cautious.\n\n   In the words of Lucia Zedner7:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                 “Typically, conflicting interests are said to be\n                 ‘balanced’ as if there were a self­evident\n                 weighting of or priority among them.

The suitability of proportionality analysis under Part III, needs to\n\n    be observed herein. The nature of fundamental rights has been\n\n    extensively commented upon. One view is that the fundamental\n\n    rights apply as ‘rules’, wherein they apply in an ‘all­or­nothing\n\n    fashion’. This view is furthered by Ronald Dworkin, who argued\n\n    in his theory that concept of a right implies its ability to trump\n\n    over a public good.8 Dworkin’s view necessarily means that the\n\n    rights themselves are the end, which cannot be derogated as they\n\n    represent the highest norm under the Constitution. This would\n\n    imply that if the legislature or executive act in a particular\n\n    manner, in derogation of the right, with an object of achieving\n\n    public good, they shall be prohibited from doing so if the\n\n    aforesaid action requires restriction of a right. However, while\n\n    such an approach is often taken by American Courts, the same\n\n    may not be completely suitable in the Indian context, having\n\n    regard to the structure of Part III which comes with inbuilt\n\n    restrictions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n    8Ronald Dworkin, “Rights as Trumps” in Jeremy Waldron (ed.), Theories of Rights (1984)\n    153 (hereinafter Dworkin, “Rights as is trumps”).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                                                       42</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">\f52. However, there is an alternative view, held by Robert Alexy,\n\n   wherein the ‘fundamental rights’ are viewed as ‘principles’, 9\n\n   wherein the rights are portrayed in a normative manner. Rules\n\n   are norms that are always either fulfilled or not; whereas\n\n   principles are norms which require that something be realized to\n\n   the    greatest      extent      possible       given     the     legal    and      factual\n\n   possibilities.10 This characterisation of principles has implications\n\n   for how to deal with conflicts between them: it means that where\n\n   they conflict, one principle has to be weighed against the other\n\n   and a determination has to be made as to which has greater\n\n   weight in this context.11 Therefore, he argues that nature of\n\n   principles implies the principle of proportionality. 12\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">53.

Even in\n          respect of such rights, there is a thinking\n          that in larger public interest, the extent of\n          their    protection can        be diminished.\n          However, so far such attempts of the States\n          have been thwarted by the judiciary.] … In\n          fact, such a provision in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 19</a> itself on the\n          one hand guarantees some certain freedoms in\n          clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19</a> and at the same time\n          empowers the State to impose reasonable\n          restrictions on those freedoms in public\n          interest.

In the aforesaid case, this Court was posed with a dilemma as to\n\n    how to treat competing rights. The Court attempted to resolve the\n\n    conflict by holding that rights and limitations must be interpreted\n\n    harmoniously so as to facilitate coexistence. This Court observed\n\n    therein:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">               “62… On the one hand is the right’s element,\n               which constitutes a fundamental component of\n               substantive democracy; on the other hand is\n               the people element, limiting those very rights\n               through their representatives. These two\n               constitute a fundamental component of the\n               notion of democracy, though this time in its\n               formal aspect. How can this tension be\n               resolved? The answer is that this tension is\n               not resolved by eliminating the “losing”\n               facet from the Constitution. Rather, the\n               tension is resolved by way of a proper\n               balancing of the competing principles. This\n               is one of the expressions of the multi­faceted\n               nature of democracy. Indeed, the inherent\n               tension between democracy’s different\n               facets is a “constructive tension”. It\n               enables each facet to develop while\n               harmoniously coexisting with the others.\n               The best way to achieve this peaceful\n               coexistence is through balancing between\n               the competing interests. Such balancing\n               enables each facet to develop alongside the\n               other facets, not in their place. This tension\n               between the two fundamental aspects—rights\n               on the one hand and its limitation on the other\n               hand—is to be resolved by balancing the two\n               so that they harmoniously coexist with each\n               other. This balancing is to be done keeping\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                                    48</span>\n\f                 in mind the relative social values of each\n                 competitive aspects when considered in\n                 proper context.”\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">56. The next conundrum faced by the Court was in achieving the\n\n   requisite balance, the solution for which was derived from the\n\n   principle of proportionality. The eminent constitutional jurist, Kai\n\n   Möller states that the proportionality principle is the doctrinal\n\n   tool which guides Judges through the process of resolving these\n\n   conflicts.13 One of the theories of proportionality widely relied\n\n   upon by most theorists is the version developed by the German\n\n   Federal Constitutional Court. The aforesaid doctrine lays down a\n\n   four pronged test wherein, first, it has to be analysed as to\n\n   whether the measure restricting the rights serves a legitimate\n\n   goal (also called as legitimate goal test), then it has to be\n\n   analysed whether the measure is a suitable means of furthering\n\n   this goal (the rational connection stage), next it has to be\n\n   assessed whether there existed an equally effective but lesser\n\n   restrictive alternative remedy (the necessity test) and at last, it\n\n   should be analysed if such a measure had a disproportionate\n\n   impact on the right­holder (balancing stage). One important\n\n   13Kai Möller, The Global Model of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press,\n   2012).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                                         49</span>\n\f   feature of German test is the last stage of balancing, which\n\n   determines the outcome as most of the important issues are\n\n   pushed to the balancing stage and the same thereby dominates\n\n   the legal analysis. Under this approach, any goal which is\n\n   legitimate will be accepted; as usually a lesser restrictive measure\n\n   might have the disadvantage of being less effective and even\n\n   marginal contribution to the goal will suffice the rational\n\n   connection test.14\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">57. The aforesaid test needs to be contrasted with its Canadian\n\n   counterpart also known as the Oakes test. According to the said\n\n   doctrine, the object of the measure must be compelling enough to\n\n   warrant overriding of the constitutionally guaranteed freedom; a\n\n   rational nexus must exist between such a measure and the object\n\n   sought to be achieved; the means must be least restrictive; and\n\n   lastly, there must be proportionality between the effects of such\n\n   measure and the object sought to be achieved. This doctrine of\n\n   proportionality is elaborately propounded by Dickson, C.J., of the\n\n   Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Oakes, (1986) 1 SCR 103\n\n   (Can) SC, in the following words (at p. 138):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">   14Kai Möller, Constructing the Proportionality Test: An Emerging Global Conversation,\n   Reasoning Rights Comparative Judicial Engagement (Hart Publishing, 2014).\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                                                     50</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\f             “To establish that a limit is reasonable and\n             demonstrably justified in a free and democratic\n             society, two central criteria must be satisfied.\n             First, the objective, which the measures,\n             responsible for a limit on a Charter right or\n             freedom are designed to serve, must be “of\n             sufficient importance to warrant overriding a\n             constitutionally protected right or freedom” …\n             Second … the party invoking <a href=\"/doc/455327/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 1</a> must\n             show that the means chosen are reasonable\n             and demonstrably justified.

The    more     severe   the\n             deleterious effects of a measure, the more\n             important the objective must be if the measure\n             is to be reasonable and demonstrably justified\n             in a free and democratic society.”\n\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">58.

While some scholars such as Robert Alexy 16 call for a strong\n\n   interpretation of the necessity stage as it has direct impact upon\n\n   the realisation and optimisation of constitutional rights while\n\n   others such as David Bilchitz 17 found significant problems with\n\n   this approach.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">63. First, Bilchitz focuses on the issues arising out of both the\n\n   German test and the Oakes test, wherein the former treats all\n\n   policies    to    be    necessary       by    justifying     that    the     available\n\n   alternatives may not be equally effective, while the latter applies\n\n   the “minimal impairment test” narrowing the constitutionally\n\n   permissible       policies     and    places      a   strong     burden       on    the\n\n   Government to justify its policies. Therefore, Bilchitz argues that\n\n   if the necessity stage is interpreted strictly, legislations and\n\n   policies no matter how well intended will fail to pass the\n\n   proportionality inquiry if any other slightly less drastic measure\n\n   exists. Bilchitz, therefore, indicates that Alexy’s conclusion may\n\n   be too quick.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">\n\n\n   16Robert Alexy, A Theory of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">   47.\n   17David Bilchitz, Necessity and Proportionality: Towards A Balanced Approach? in L.\n   Lazarus, C.

Moreover, this also leads to the issue regarding the doctrine of\n\n    separation of power, as Courts would often substitute the views\n\n    of the legislature in deciding what is the “least restrictive\n\n    measure”. Taking the aforesaid issues into consideration, Bilchitz\n\n    proposed a moderate interpretation of the necessity test wherein\n\n    Courts may no longer be required to assess policies and\n\n    measures against impractical and unreasonable standards. He\n\n    states that “[n]ecessity involves a process of reasoning designed to\n\n    ensure that only measures with a strong relationship to the\n\n    objective they seek to achieve can justify an invasion of\n\n    fundamental rights. That process thus requires courts to reason\n\n    through the various stages of the moderate interpretation of\n\n    necessity.”18 He therefore recommends a four­step inquiry which\n\n    is listed below:19\n\n                  (MN1) All feasible alternatives need to be\n                  identified, with courts being explicit as to\n                  criteria of feasibility;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">                  (MN2)     The     relationship   between    the\n                  government measure under consideration, the\n                  alternatives identified in MN1 and the objective\n                  sought to be achieved must be determined.

Admittedly, fundamental rights may not be absolute, however,\n\n   they require strong protection, thereby mandating a sensible\n\n   necessity test as the same will prevent the fundamental right\n\n   from becoming either absolute or to be diminished. Bilchitz,\n\n   describes the aforesaid test to be neither factual nor mechanical,\n\n   but rather normative and qualitative.

The\nproportionality standard must be met by the\nprocedural and substantive aspects of the law.\nSanjay Kishan Kaul, J., in his concurring\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                    60</span>\n\f              opinion, suggested a four­pronged test as\n              follows: (SCC p. 632, para 638)\n\n                     “(i) The action must be sanctioned\n                           by law;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">                     (ii) The proposed action must be\n                           necessary in a democratic\n                           society for a legitimate aim;\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">                     (iii) The      extent      of     such\n                           interference        must      be\n                           proportionate to the need for\n                           such interference;\n                     (iv) There must be procedural\n                           guarantees against abuse of\n                           such interference.”\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n68.

In view of the aforesaid discussion, we may summarize the\n\n   requirements of the doctrine of proportionality which must be\n\n   followed by the authorities before passing any order intending on\n\n   restricting fundamental rights of individuals. In the first stage\n\n   itself, the possible goal of such a measure intended at imposing\n\n   restrictions must be determined. It ought to be noted that such\n\n   goal must be legitimate. However, before settling on the aforesaid\n\n   measure, the authorities must assess the existence of any\n\n   alternative mechanism in furtherance of the aforesaid goal. The\n\n   appropriateness of such a measure depends on its implication\n\n   upon the fundamental rights and the necessity of such measure.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_138\">   It is undeniable from the aforesaid holding that only the least\n\n   restrictive measure can be resorted to by the State, taking into\n\n   consideration the facts and circumstances.

To consider the immediate impact of restrictions upon the\n\n    realization of the fundamental rights, the decision maker must\n\n    prioritize the various factors at stake. Such attribution of relative\n\n    importance is what constitutes proportionality. It ought to be\n\n    noted that a decision which curtails fundamental rights without\n\n    appropriate justification will be classified as disproportionate.\n\n    The concept of proportionality requires a restriction to be tailored\n\n    in accordance with the territorial extent of the restriction, the\n\n    stage of emergency, nature of urgency, duration of such\n\n    restrictive   measure   and   nature   of   such   restriction.

However, we\n\n   may just point out that the proportionality test needs to be\n\n   applied in the context of facts and circumstances, which are very\n\n   different in the case at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">74.

data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\">85. Rule 2(1) specifies the competent authority to issue an order\n\n    under the Suspension Rules, who in ordinary circumstances\n\n    would be the Secretary to the Ministry of Home Affairs,\n\n    Government of India, or in the case of the State Government, the\n\n    Secretary to the Home Department of the State Government. The\n\n    sub­rule    also   provides    that   in   certain    “unavoidable”\n\n    circumstances an officer, who is duly authorised, not below the\n\n    rank of a Joint Secretary, may pass an order suspending\n\n    services. The two provisos to Rule 2(1) are extremely relevant\n\n    herein, creating an internal check as to orders which are passed\n\n    by an authorised officer in “unavoidable” circumstances, as\n\n    opposed to the ordinary mechanism envisaged, which is the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                    72</span>\n\f    issuing of the order by the competent authority. The provisos\n\n    together provide that the orders passed by duly authorised\n\n    officers in “unavoidable” circumstances need to be confirmed by\n\n    the competent authority within twenty­four hours, failing which,\n\n    as per the second proviso, the order of suspension will cease to\n\n    exist. The confirmation of the order by the competent authority is\n\n    therefore essential, failing which the order passed by a duly\n\n    authorised officer will automatically lapse by operation of law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">86. Rule 2(2) is also extremely important, as it lays down twin\n\n    requirements for orders passed under Rule 2(1). First, it requires\n\n    that every order passed by a competent authority under Rule 2(1)\n\n    must be a reasoned order. This requirement must be read to\n\n    extend not only to orders passed by a competent authority, but\n\n    also to those orders passed by an authorised officer which is to\n\n    be sent for subsequent confirmation to the competent authority.\n\n    The reasoning of the authorised officer should not only indicate\n\n    the necessity of the measure but also what the “unavoidable”\n\n    circumstance was which necessitated his passing the order. The\n\n    purpose of the aforesaid rule is to integrate the proportionality\n\n    analysis within the framework of the Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                                       73</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_169\">\f87. Only in such an event would the requirement of confirmation by\n\n    the competent authority have any meaning, as it would allow the\n\n    competent authority to properly consider the action taken by the\n\n    authorised officer. Further, the confirmation must not be a mere\n\n    formality, but must indicate independent application of mind by\n\n    the competent authority to the order passed by the authorised\n\n    officer, who must also take into account changed circumstances\n\n    if any, etc. After all, it is the competent authority who has been\n\n    given the power under the Suspension Rules to suspend telecom\n\n    services, with the authorised officer acting under the Suspension\n\n    Rules only due to some exigent circumstances.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">88. The second requirement under Rule 2(2) is the forwarding of the\n\n    reasoned order of the competent authority to a Review Committee\n\n    which has been set up under the Suspension Rules, within one\n\n    working day. The composition of the Review Committee is\n\n    provided under Rule 2(5), with two distinct review committees\n\n    contemplated for the Union and the State, depending on the\n\n    competent authority which issued the order under Rule 2(1).\n\n    Rule 2(6) is the final internal check under the Suspension Rules\n\n    with respect to the orders issued thereunder. Rule 2(6) requires\n\n    the concerned Review Committee to meet within five working\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                                                   74</span>\n\f     days of issuance of the order suspending telecom services, and\n\n     record its findings about whether the order issued under the\n\n     Suspension Rules is in accordance with the provisions of the\n\n     main statute, viz., <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_171\">89. This last requirement, of the orders issued under the Rules being\n\n     in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 5(2)</a>, Telegraph Act, is very relevant to\n\n     understand the circumstances in which the suspension orders\n\n     may be passed. <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 5(2)</a>, Telegraph Act is as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">               “5.

This Court has had prior occasion to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 5</a> of the\n\n    Telegraph Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76884\" id=\"span_120\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_120\">Hukam Chand Shyam Lal v.\n\n    Union of India</a>, (1976) 2 SCC 128, a Four­Judge Bench of this\n\n    Court interpreted <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 5</a> of the Telegraph Act and observed as\n\n    follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">               “13. <a href=\"/doc/593470/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 5(1)</a> if properly construed, does\n               not confer unguided and unbridled power on\n               the Central Government/State Government/\n               specially authorised officer to take possession\n               of any telegraphs. Firstly, the occurrence of\n               a “public emergency” is the sine qua non\n               for the exercise of power under this section.\n               As a preliminary step to the exercise of further\n               jurisdiction under this section the Government\n               or the authority concerned must record its\n               satisfaction as to the existence of such an\n               emergency. Further, the existence of the\n               emergency which is a pre­requisite for the\n               exercise of power under this section, must be a\n               “public emergency” and not any other kind of\n               emergency. The expression public emergency\n               has not been defined in the statute, but\n               contours broadly delineating its scope and\n               features are discernible from the section which\n               has to be read as a whole. In sub­section (1)\n               the phrase ‘occurrence of any public\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                                  76</span>\n\f              emergency’ is connected with and is\n              immediately followed by the phrase “or in\n              the interests of the public safety”. These\n              two phrases appear to take colour from\n              each other. In the first part of sub­section\n              (2) those two phrases again occur in\n              association with each other, and the\n              context further clarifies with amplification\n              that a “public emergency” within the\n              contemplation of this section is one which\n              raises problems concerning the interest of\n              the public safety, the sovereignty and\n              integrity of India, the security of the State,\n              friendly relations with foreign States or\n              public   order     or   the   prevention    of\n              incitement to the commission of an\n              offence. It is in the context of these matters\n              that the appropriate authority has to form an\n              opinion with regard to the occurrence of a\n              public emergency with a view to taking further\n              action under this section...”\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_122\">91.

Keeping in mind the wordings of the section, and the above two\n\n    pronouncements of this Court, what emerges is that the pre­\n\n    requisite for an order to be passed under this sub­section, and\n\n    therefore the Suspension Rules, is the occurrence of a “public\n\n    emergency” or for it to be “in the interest of public safety”.\n\n    Although the phrase “public emergency” has not been defined\n\n    under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_127\">Telegraph Act</a>, it has been clarified that the meaning of\n\n    the phrase can be inferred from its usage in conjunction with the\n\n    phrase “in the interest of public safety” following it. <a href=\"/doc/76884/\" id=\"a_128\">The Hukam\n\n    Chand Shyam Lal</a> case (supra) further clarifies that the scope of\n\n    “public emergency” relates to the situations contemplated under\n\n    the sub­section pertaining to “sovereignty and integrity of India,\n\n    the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                                      78</span>\n\f     public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of an\n\n     offence”.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">93. The word ‘emergency’ has various connotations. Everyday\n\n     emergency, needs to be distinguished from the type of emergency\n\n     wherein events which involve, or might involve, serious and\n\n     sometimes widespread risk of injury or harm to members of the\n\n     public or the destruction of, or serious damage to, property.\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 4</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\n     Rights, notes that ‘[I]n time of public emergency which threatens\n\n     the life of the nation and the existence of which is officially\n\n     proclaimed...’. Comparable language has also been used in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_130\">Article\n\n     15</a> of the European Convention on Human Rights which says­ &quot;In\n\n     time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the\n\n     nation&quot;. We may only point out that the ‘public emergency’ is\n\n     required to be of serious nature, and needs to be determined on a\n\n     case to case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">94. The second requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act is for\n\n     the authority to be satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to\n\n     pass the orders in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of\n\n     India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                     79</span>\n\f    states or public order or for preventing incitement to the\n\n    commission of an offence, and must record reasons thereupon.\n\n    The term ‘necessity’ and ‘expediency’ brings along the stages an\n\n    emergency is going to pass through usually. A public emergency\n\n    usually would involve different stages and the authorities are\n\n    required to have regards to the stage, before the power can be\n\n    utilized under the aforesaid rules. The appropriate balancing of\n\n    the factors differs, when considering the stages of emergency and\n\n    accordingly, the authorities are required to triangulate the\n\n    necessity of imposition of such restriction after satisfying the\n\n    proportionality requirement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_177\">95. A point canvassed by the learned counsel for the Petitioner, Ms.\n\n    Vrinda Grover, with regard to the interpretation of the proviso to\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act. The proviso to the section\n\n    specifies that a class of messages, i.e., press messages intended\n\n    to be published in India of correspondents accredited to the\n\n    Central Government or a State Government, will be treated\n\n    differently from other classes of messages. The learned counsel\n\n    contended that this separate classification necessitates that an\n\n    order interfering with the press would be in compliance with\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act only if it specifically states that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                                      80</span>\n\f    the press is also to be restricted. However, the aforesaid\n\n    interpretation could not be supported by the petitioner with any\n\n    judgments of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_178\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"465322\" id=\"span_128\">96. It must be noted that although the Suspension Rules does not\n\n    provide for publication or notification of the orders, a settled\n\n    principle of law, and of natural justice, is that an order,\n\n    particularly one that affects lives, liberty and property of people,\n\n    must be made available. Any law which demands compliance of\n\n    the people requires to be notified directly and reliably. This is the\n\n    case regardless of whether the parent statute or rule prescribes\n\n    the same or not. We are therefore required to read in the\n\n    requirement of ensuring that all the orders passed under the\n\n    Suspension Rules are made freely available, through some\n\n    suitable   mechanism.      [See   <a href=\"/doc/465322/\" id=\"a_134\">B.K.   Srinivasan   v.   State   of\n\n    Karnataka</a>, (1987) 1 SCC 658]</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">97. The above requirement would further the rights of an affected\n\n    party to challenge the orders, if aggrieved. Judicial review of the\n\n    orders issued under the Suspension Rules is always available,\n\n    although no appellate mechanism has been provided, and the\n\n    same cannot be taken away or made ineffective. An aggrieved\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                                       81</span>\n\f    person has the constitutional right to challenge the orders made\n\n    under the Suspension Rules, before the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_135\">Article\n\n    226</a> of the Constitution or other appropriate forum.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">98.

Lastly, we think it necessary to reiterate that complete broad\n\n    suspension of telecom services, be it the Internet or otherwise,\n\n    being a drastic measure, must be considered by the State only if\n\n    ‘necessary’ and ‘unavoidable’. In furtherance of the same, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                 82</span>\n\f     State must assess the existence of an alternate less intrusive\n\n     remedy. Having said so, we may note that the aforesaid\n\n     Suspension Rules have certain gaps, which are required to be\n\n     considered by the legislature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">100. One of the gaps which must be highlighted relates to the usage of\n\n     the word “temporary” in the title of the Suspension Rules.\n\n     Despite the above, there is no indication of the maximum\n\n     duration for which a suspension order can be in operation.\n\n     Keeping in mind the requirements of proportionality expounded\n\n     in the earlier section of the judgment, we are of the opinion that\n\n     an order suspending the aforesaid services indefinitely is\n\n     impermissible. In this context, it is necessary to lay down some\n\n     procedural safeguard till the aforesaid deficiency is cured by the\n\n     legislature to ensure that the exercise of power under the\n\n     Suspension Rules is not disproportionate. We therefore direct\n\n     that the Review Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the\n\n     Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic review within seven\n\n     working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements\n\n     under Rule 2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only\n\n     look into the question of whether the restrictions are still in\n\n     compliance with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                    83</span>\n\f    Act, but must also look into the question of whether the orders\n\n    are still proportionate, keeping in mind the constitutional\n\n    consequences of the same. We clarify that looking to the fact that\n\n    the restrictions contemplated under the Suspension Rules are\n\n    temporary in nature, the same must not be allowed to extend\n\n    beyond that time period which is necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">101. Coming to the orders placed before us regarding restrictions on\n\n    communication and Internet, there are eight orders that are\n\n    placed before us. Four orders have been passed by the Inspector\n\n    General of Police, of the respective zone, while the other four\n\n    orders are confirmation orders passed by the Principal Secretary\n\n    to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Home Department,\n\n    confirming the four orders passed by the Inspector General of\n\n    Police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_184\">102. The learned Solicitor General has apprised the Bench that the\n\n    authorities are considering relaxation of the restrictions and in\n\n    some places the restrictions have already been removed. He also\n\n    pointed that the authorities are constantly reviewing the same. In\n\n    this case, the submission of the Solicitor General that there is\n\n    still possibility of danger to public safety cannot be ignored, as\n\n    this Court has not been completely apprised about the ground\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                   84</span>\n\f     situation by the State. We believe that the authorities have to\n\n     pass their orders based on the guidelines provided in this case\n\n     afresh. The learned Solicitor General had submitted, on a query\n\n     being put to him regarding the feasibility of a measure blocking\n\n     only social media services, that the same could not be done.\n\n     However, the State should have attempted to determine the\n\n     feasibility of such a measure. As all the orders have not been\n\n     placed before this Court and there is no clarity as to which orders\n\n     are in operation and which have already been withdrawn, as well\n\n     as the apprehension raised in relation to the possibility of public\n\n     order situations, we have accordingly moulded the relief in the\n\n     operative portion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">\n\n G.

In response, the learned Solicitor General, on behalf of the\n\n    Respondent, argued that the volatile history, overwhelming\n\n    material available even in the public domain about external\n\n    aggressions, nefarious secessionist activities and the provocative\n\n    statements given by political leaders, created a compelling\n\n    situation which mandated passing of orders under Section 144,\n\n    Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">105.

In view of the above, ‘law and order’, ‘public order’ and ‘security\n\n     of State’ are distinct legal standards and the Magistrate must\n\n     tailor the restrictions depending on the nature of the situation.

The\n\n     Magistrate cannot apply a straitjacket formula without assessing\n\n     the gravity of the prevailing circumstances; the restrictions must\n\n     be proportionate to the situation concerned.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"496236\" id=\"span_165\">124.

This would be the\n              requirement of law for more than one reason.\n              Firstly, it is an order placing a restriction\n              upon the fundamental rights of a citizen\n              and, thus, may adversely affect the\n              interests of the parties, and secondly, under\n              the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_199\">CrPC</a>, such an order is\n              revisable and is subject to judicial review.\n              Therefore, it will be appropriate that it\n              must be an order in writing, referring to the\n              facts and stating the reasons for imposition\n              of such restriction.

It is true that we do not sit in appeal, however, the existence of\n\n     the power of judicial review is undeniable.

The State is best placed to make an assessment of threat\n\n     to public peace and tranquillity or law and order. However, the\n\n     law requires them to state the material facts for invoking this\n\n     power. This will enable judicial scrutiny and a verification of\n\n     whether there are sufficient facts to justify the invocation of this\n\n     power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\">133. In a situation where fundamental rights of the citizens are being\n\n     curtailed, the same cannot be done through an arbitrary exercise\n\n     of power; rather it should be based on objective facts. The\n\n     preventive/remedial measures under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C. should\n\n     be based on the type of exigency, extent of territoriality, nature of\n\n     restriction and the duration of the same. In a situation of\n\n     urgency, the authority is required to satisfy itself of such material\n\n     to base its opinion on for the immediate imposition of restrictions\n\n     or measures which are preventive/remedial. However, if the\n\n     authority is to consider imposition of restrictions over a larger\n\n     territorial   area   or   for   a   longer   duration,   the   threshold\n\n     requirement is relatively higher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">134. An order passed under <a href=\"/doc/930621/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 144</a>, Cr.P.C. should be indicative\n\n     of proper application of mind, which should be based on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                                                         114</span>\n\f     material facts and the remedy directed. Proper reasoning links\n\n     the application of mind of the officer concerned, to the\n\n     controversy involved and the conclusion reached. Orders passed\n\n     mechanically or in a cryptic manner cannot be said to be orders\n\n     passed in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">135. During the course of hearing, on 26.11.2019, the learned\n\n     Solicitor General sought the permission of this Court to produce\n\n     certain confidential documents to be perused by this Court.\n\n     However, he objected to revealing certain documents to the\n\n     Petitioners, claiming sensitivity and confidentiality. Learned\n\n     senior counsel Mr. Kapil Sibal stated that the Court could\n\n     assume the existence of such intelligence inputs and materials.\n\n     In view of such stand, we have not gone into the adequacy of the\n\n     material placed before this Court; rather, we have presumed\n\n     existence of the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"189192867\" id=\"span_179\">136. One of the important criteria to test the reasonableness of such a\n\n     measure is to see if the aggrieved person has the right to make a\n\n     representation against such a restriction. It is a fundamental\n\n     principle of law that no party can be deprived of his liberty\n\n     without   being   afforded   a   fair,   adequate   and   reasonable\n\n     opportunity of hearing. Therefore, in a situation where the order\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                                                     115</span>\n\f    is silent on the material facts, the person aggrieved cannot\n\n    effectively challenge the same. Resultantly, there exists no\n\n    effective mechanism to judicially review the same. [See <a href=\"/doc/189192867/\" id=\"a_208\">State of\n\n    Bihar v. Kamla Kant Misra</a>, (1969) 3 SCC 337]. In light of the\n\n    same, it is imperative for the State to make such orders public so\n\n    as to make the right available under <a href=\"/doc/190828/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 144(5)</a>, Cr.P.C. a\n\n    practical reality.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_240\">137. One thing to remember is that no mala fide has been alleged by\n\n    the Petitioners. It was not denied by the Petitioners that the State\n\n    has the power to pass such restrictive order. Additionally, the\n\n    Respondents contended that the historical background of the\n\n    State­ cross border terrorism, infiltration of militants, security\n\n    issues, etc., cannot be forgotten and must be kept in mind while\n\n    testing the legality of the orders. Further, the Respondent\n\n    submitted that the orders were passed in the aforementioned\n\n    context and in the anticipated threat to law and order, to prevent\n\n    any loss of life, limb and property. However, these orders do not\n\n    explain the aforesaid aspects.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">138. Although the restrictions have been allegedly removed on\n\n    27.09.2019, thereby rendering the present exercise into a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                                                    116</span>\n\f    virtually academic one, we cannot ignore non­compliance of law\n\n    by the State. As learned senior counsel Mr. Kapil Sibal\n\n    submitted, this case is not just about the past or what has\n\n    happened in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir, but also\n\n    about the future, where this Court has to caution the\n\n    Government. Hence, we direct that the authorities must follow\n\n    the principles <a href=\"/doc/189192867/\" id=\"a_210\">laid down by</a> this Court and uphold the rule of law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_242\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"189192867\" id=\"span_182\">139. It is contended by the Petitioners that while the Respondents\n\n    stated that there are no prohibitory orders during the day and\n\n    there are certain restrictions in certain areas during the night, on\n\n    the ground, the situation is different as the police is still\n\n    restricting the movement of the people even during the day. If\n\n    that is so, it is not proper and correct for the State to resort to\n\n    such type of acts. A Government, if it thinks that there is a threat\n\n    to the law and order situation or any other such requirement,\n\n    must follow the procedure <a href=\"/doc/189192867/\" id=\"a_211\">laid down by</a> law, taking into\n\n    consideration the rights of the citizens, and pass appropriate\n\n    need­based orders. In view of the same, appropriate directions\n\n    are provided in the operative part of this judgment.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">140.

We may note that the argument of chilling effect has been\n\n     utilized in various contexts, from being purely an emotive\n\n     argument to a substantive component under the free speech\n\n     adjudication. The usage of the aforesaid principle is chiefly\n\n     adopted for impugning an action of the State, which may be\n\n     constitutional, but which imposes a great burden on the free\n\n     speech. We may note that the argument of chilling effect, if not\n\n     tempered    judicially,   would   result   in   a   “self­proclaiming\n\n     instrument”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_261\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                                                      123</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">\f148. The principle of chilling effect was utilized initially in a limited\n\n     context, that a person could be restricted from exercising his\n\n     protected right due to the ambiguous nature of an overbroad\n\n     statute. In this regard, the chilling effect was restricted to the\n\n     analysis of the First Amendment right. The work of Frederick\n\n     Schauer provides a detailed analysis in his seminal work on the\n\n     First Amendment.22 This analysis was replicated in the context of\n\n     privacy and internet usage in a regulatory set up by Daniel J.\n\n     Solove. These panopticon concerns have been accepted in the\n\n     case of K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy­9J.) (supra).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">149. We need to concern ourselves herein as to theoretical question of\n\n     drawing lines as to when a regulation stops short of impinging\n\n     upon free speech. A regulatory legislation will have a direct or\n\n     indirect impact on various rights of different degrees. Individual\n\n     rights cannot be viewed as silos, rather they should be viewed in\n\n     a cumulative manner which may be affected in different ways.\n\n     The technical rule of causal link cannot be made applicable in\n\n     the case of human rights. Human rights are an inherent feature\n\n     of every human and there is no question of the State not\n\n     22 Frederick Schauer, Fear, Risk and the First Amendment: Unraveling the Chilling Effect\n     (1978).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                                                                                        124</span>\n\f    providing for these rights. In one sense, the restrictions provided\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution follow a utilitarian\n\n    approach wherein individualism gives way for commonality of\n\n    benefit, if such restrictions are required and demanded by law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_195\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_196\">In\n\n    this context, the test of ‘direct impact’ as <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_229\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_230\">A.K\n\n    Gopalan v.

As this is not a case\n\n    wherein a detailed analysis of chilling effect is required for the\n\n    reasons given below, we leave the question of law open as to the\n\n    appropriate standard for establishing causal link in a challenge\n\n    based on chilling effect.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_265\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_266\">150. The widening of the ‘chilling effect doctrine’ has always been\n\n    viewed with judicial scepticism. At this juncture, we may note the\n\n    decision in Laird v. Tantum, 408 U.<a href=\"/doc/455327/\" id=\"a_232\">S. 1 (1972)</a>, wherein the\n\n    respondent brought an action against the authorities to injunct\n\n    them from conducting surveillance of lawful and peaceful civilian\n\n    political activity, based on the chilling effect doctrine. The United\n\n    States Supreme Court, in its majority decision, dismissed the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                                                     125</span>\n\f     plea of the respondent on the ground of lack of evidence to\n\n     establish such a claim. The Court observed that:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">                  “Allegations of a subjective &quot;chill&quot; are not an\n                  adequate substitute for a claim of specific\n                  present objective harm or a threat of specific\n                  future harm.”\n\n\n     Therefore,     to   say   that   the   aforesaid   restrictions   were\n\n     unconstitutional because it has a chilling effect on the freedom of\n\n     press generally is to say virtually nothing at all or is saying\n\n     something that is purely speculative, unless evidence is brought\n\n     before the Court to enable it to give a clear finding, which has not\n\n     been placed on record in the present case. [refer to Clapper v\n\n     Amnesty Int’l, USA, 568 U.S. 113 (2013)]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_267\">151. In this context, one possible test of chilling effect is comparative\n\n     harm. In this frame­work, the Court is required to see whether\n\n     the impugned restrictions, due to their broad­based nature, have\n\n     had a restrictive effect on similarly placed individuals during the\n\n     period. It is the contention of the Petitioner that she was not able\n\n     to publish her newspaper from 06­08­2019 to 11­10­2019.\n\n     However, no evidence was put forth to establish that such other\n\n     individuals were also restricted in publishing newspapers in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                                                       126</span>\n\f     area. Without such evidence having been placed on record, it\n\n     would be impossible to distinguish a legitimate claim of chilling\n\n     effect from a mere emotive argument for a self­serving purpose.\n\n     On the other hand, the learned Solicitor General has submitted\n\n     that there were other newspapers which were running during the\n\n     aforesaid time period. In view of these facts, and considering that\n\n     the aforesaid Petitioner has now resumed publication, we do not\n\n     deem it fit to indulge more in the issue than to state that\n\n     responsible Governments are required to respect the freedom of\n\n     the press at all times. Journalists are to be accommodated in\n\n     reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of\n\n     Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_268\">     I.
