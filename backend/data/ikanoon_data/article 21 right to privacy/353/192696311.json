Thus, the Competition Commission of India\n\n                     formed an opinion that it is a fit case for Director General investigation. The\n\n                     Director General has to investigate the matter for violation of any / all\n\n                     provisions of the Competition At and the said proceedings of initiation states\n\n                     that “Nothing stated in this order shall tantamount to a final expression of\n\n                     opinion on merit of the case and the Director General shall conduct the\n\n                     investigation without being swayed in any manner whatsoever by the\n\n                     observations made herein”.

It needs\n                                  to be reiterated that RJIL has approached the DoT in relation\n                                  to its alleged grievance of augmentation of POIs which in turn\n                                  had informed RJIL vide letter dated 6-9-2016 that the matter\n                                  related to interconnectivity between service providers is\n                                  within the purview of TRAI. RJIL thereafter approached TRAI;\n                                  TRAI intervened and issued show-cause notice dated 27-9-\n                                  2016; and post issuance of show-cause notice and directions,\n                                  TRAI issued recommendations dated 21-10-2016 on the issue\n                                  of interconnection and provisioning of POIs to RJIL. The\n                                  sectoral authorities are, therefore, seized of the matter. TRAI,\n                                  being a specialised sectoral regulator and also armed with\n                                  sufficient power to ensure fair, non-discriminatory and\n                                  competitive market in the telecom sector, is better suited to\n                                  decide the aforesaid issues. After all, RJIL&#x27;s grievance is that\n                                  interconnectivity is not provided by the IDOs in terms of the\n                                  licences granted to them. <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_24\">The TRAI Act</a> and Regulations\n                                  framed thereunder make detailed provisions dealing with\n                                  intense obligations of the service providers for providing\n                                  POIs.

Only when the jurisdictional facts in the\n                                  present matter as mentioned in this judgment particularly in\n                                  paras 72 and 102 above are determined by TRAI against the\n                                  IDOs, the next question would arise as to whether it was a\n                                  result of any concerted agreement between the IDOs and\n                                  COAI supported the IDOs in that endeavour. It would be at\n                                  that stage CCI can go into the question as to whether violation\n                                  of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_27\">TRAI Act</a> amounts to “abuse of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                     13/52</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                                         W.P.No.35047 of 2013</span>\n\n\n                                  dominance” or “anti-competitive agreements”.

The issue can be examined from another angle as\n                                  well. If CCI is allowed to intervene at this juncture, it will\n                                  have to necessarily undertake an exercise of returning the\n                                  findings on the aforesaid issues/aspects which are mentioned\n                                  in para 102 above. Not only TRAI is better equipped as a\n                                  sectoral regulator to deal with these jurisdictional aspects,\n                                  there may be a possibility that the two authorities, namely,\n                                  TRAI on the one hand and CCI on the other, arrive at\n                                  conflicting views. Such a situation needs to be avoided. This\n                                  analysis also leads to the same conclusion, namely, in the first\n                                  instance it is TRAI which should decide these jurisdictional\n                                  issues, which come within the domain of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_30\">TRAI Act</a> as they\n                                  not only arise out of the telecom licences granted to the\n                                  service providers, the service providers are governed by the\n                                  <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_31\">TRAI Act</a> and are supposed to follow various regulations and\n                                  directions issued by TRAI itself.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">                                        113.

At the same time, since the\n                                  matter pertains to the telecom sector which is specifically\n                                  regulated by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_32\">TRAI Act</a>, balance is maintained by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                     14/52</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                                                       W.P.No.35047 of 2013</span>\n\n\n                                  permitting TRAI in the first instance to deal with and decide\n                                  the jurisdictional aspects which can be more competently\n                                  handled by it. Once that exercise is done and there are\n                                  findings returned by TRAI which lead to the prima facie\n                                  conclusion that the IDOs have indulged in anti-competitive\n                                  practices, CCI can be activated to investigate the matter going\n                                  by the criteria <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_33\">laid down in</a> the relevant provisions of the\n                                  <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_34\">Competition Act</a> and take it to its logical conclusion. This\n                                  balanced approach in construing the two Acts would take care\n                                  of <a href=\"/doc/264874/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 60</a> of the Competition Act as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">                                        120.

While the industries in Chennai region get power supply for 22\n\n                     hours a day at Rs. 5.50 per unit rate charged by the Respondent, the\n\n                     Industries outside Chennai do not have such advantage and spend Rs. 15/-\n\n                     on per unit of electricity because they are compelled to using diesel gensets.\n\n                     This has resulted in distortion in level playing field for industrial units\n\n                     situated in others parts of Tamil Nadu (except Chennai) because of escalated\n\n                     operating cost as a result of high per unit of electricity consumed by these\n\n                     industrial units.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_83\">                                  37.

Further, the existence of holding-subsidiary relation\n\n                     between TNEB Ltd, TANTRANSCO and Opposite Party makes the\n\n                     electricity sector vertically integrated in the state of Tamil Nadu. Opposite\n\n                     Party is the only distribution licensee, having considerable market share in\n\n                     the electricity distribution in the state.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_87\">                                  39. Dealing with the question of abuse, it is important to note that\n\n                     electricity is the backbone of industrial units. For a free flow of\n\n                     manufacturing processes, it is important to have a non-discriminatory and an\n\n                     equitable availability or electricity. The difference in the load shedding in\n\n                     Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu was enormous, as shown in the\n\n                     information. Whereas, Chennai was facing 2-3 hours of load shedding, other\n\n                     parts of Tamil Nadu were facing 14-16 hours of load shedding, which\n\n                     undoubtedly would adversely affect the functioning of industries in those\n\n                     areas. The reliance on the gensets (diesel run generators) by industrial units\n\n                     located in other parts of Tamil Nadu escalates their cost of production,\n\n                     making their products, uncompetitive with similar products manufactured in\n\n                     Chennai. It was also stated in the information that many industries outside\n\n                     of Chennai were likely to go out of production or suffer loss of orders, owing\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                     38/52</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">\f                                                                                     W.P.No.35047 of 2013</span>\n\n                     to inability to run their operations continuously or owing to increased cost of\n\n                     production. There seems to be no justification to extend uninterrupted power\n\n                     supply for the whole of Chennai and to all consumers merely on the ground\n\n                     of maintenance of certain specific essential services and ignoring other parts\n\n                     of Tamil Nadu.
