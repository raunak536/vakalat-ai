The prosecution has examined as many as\nseven witnesses in support of its case. The statement of\nthe accused was also recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 313</a> of\nCr.P.C. He denied the case of the prosecution. The trial\ncourt acquitted the accused vide the impugned judgment\ndated 05.08.2010. Hence, the State has come up in appeal\nbefore this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.        Mr. Amit Bhatt, learned A.G.A. for the State\n/appellant has vehemently argued that the prosecution\nhas proved its case against the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.        Mr. Mohd. Umar, learned counsel for the\nrespondent/accused, has supported the judgment dated\n05.08.2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">6.

The Police has taken into possession the burnt\nhair, sweater, jeans and shirt of the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8.         PW1 Kunwar Singh, in his cross examination,\nhas admitted that he was not the eyewitness of the\nincident. He received the information from his daughter on\ntelephone between 2.30 P.M. to 3.00 P.M. He reached his\nhouse with his colleagues. He took his daughter to the\nhospital. His daughter was admitted for a night in the\nhospital. Thereafter, the matter was reported to the Police.\nThe complaint was lodged by his friend.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">9.         PW2    Kavita,   the     victim,   has   categorically\ntestified in her examination-in-chief that when she was\ncoming back from the tuitions on 18.12.2009, at about\n2.30 P.M., the accused, whom she recognized in the Court,\nwas standing in the street. He was carrying a box\n(container) in his hand. He started chasing her. The\naccused,   at   an   isolated   place,   near   the   house    of\nShahnawaz, Advocate poured acid on her. She tried to\nsave herself. The acid had fallen on her body. She felt\nburning sensation. Her clothes were also burnt. The\naccused was shouting that if she did not belong to him, he\nwould ruin her life. She shouted. Thereafter, the accused\nran away. She further deposed that the accused used to\nstalk her. His brother had warned the accused to mend his\nways but to no avail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">10.        She has also admitted in her cross examination\nthat she was taken to the hospital by her father on the\nmotorcycle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">11.        The statement of P.W.2 has been corroborated\nby her brother P.W.3 Pankaj.           According to him, the\naccused used to harass his sister. He requested him not to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                4</span>\n\n\n\n\ndo so. Thereafter, the accused stopped coming to their\nhouse.

She medically examined the victim PW2 and has\nfound burn injuries on the person of the victim. The same\nare being reproduced below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;1.

Opinion- reserved.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">13.         PW4 Dr. Swati Murari has proved the medical\nreport. According to her statement, PW2 has received burn\ninjuries due to acid. Burn injuries were fresh, superficial\nand not fatal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">14.         PW5 Constable, Gambhir Singh, in his cross\nexamination has deposed that the box (container), which\nwas taken in possession, was not sent to the Forensic\nScience Laboratory for examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">15.         P.W. 6 &amp; 7 namely Vijay Pal Singh and Dinesh\nSingh Bhandari are formal witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">16.         What   emerges    from   the   facts   enumerated\nhereinabove is that the accused used to stalk the victim\nPW2 Kavita. When PW2 Kavita was coming back to her\nhouse from tuitions, she was chased by the accused. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                5</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused threatened her to kill and poured acid on her\nbody. PW2 Kavita received burn injuries. Her clothes were\nalso burnt. Her sister informed PW1 Kunwar Singh about\nthe incident. PW1 Kunwar Singh took PW2 Kavita to the\nhospital. She was examined by PW4 Dr. Swati Murari. The\nincident was also narrated by PW2 to her father PW1\nKunwar Singh as well as her brother PW3 Pankaj.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">17.          It has come on the record that the accused used\nto visit the house of the victim. He used to harass her.\nPW2 apprised his brother about his misbehavior. PW3\nPankaj told the accused not to harass his sister. He\nstopped coming to their house. The accused poured acid\non the body of PW2. PW2 received the burn injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">18.          According to PW4, Dr. Swati Murari, she noticed\na number of burn injuries on the body of PW2. According\nto her testimony, these injuries were caused by acid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">19.          The prosecution has proved its case beyond\nreasonable doubt that the accused had thrown acid on\nP.W.2 Kavita Devi, which led to burn injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">20.          PW2 Kavita Devi has deposed that the accused\nwas forcing her to stop but she did not stop and thereafter\naccused proclaimed that he would ruin her life. The Police\nhas taken in possession the burnt clothes of the victim,\nwhich were duly proved in the court. The Trial Court has\nacquitted the accused, primarily on the ground that the\nbox (container), which was recovered from the spot, was\nnot   sent    to   the   Forensic   Science   Laboratory   for\nexamination. The statement of P.W.2, Kavita Devi has\nbeen duly corroborated by her father PW1 Kunwar Singh\nand brother PW3 Pankaj. Merely, that the container was\nnot sent for forensic examination, it could not result in the\nacquittal of the accused. The case of the prosecution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 6</span>\n\n\n\n\ncannot    be     thrown   out   on    the   basis     of   defective\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">21.        Learned Trial Court has also taken a very\nhyper-technical view that there was some overwriting in\nthe FIR and the person, who has written the complaint i.e.\nShri Yadav, was not examined. Shri Yadav is not the\nmaterial witness. Learned Trial Court was required to read\nthe statement of Doctor as a whole. The observation of\nlearned Trial Court that the petitioner could be carrying\nhot water is perverse, in view of the overwhelming evidence\nled by the prosecution that the accused was carrying acid\nin the container and threw the same on the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">22.        The accused had preplanned to throw acid on\nPW2, knowing fully well that acid would cause serious\ninjuries to her which could also be life threatening. In the\ncase under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 307</a> I.P.C., it is not the injuries, which\nmatters but it is the intention/knowledge to kill.            It has\ncome, as noticed hereinabove that the accused was\nshouting at the time of throwing acid on the body of PW2\nthat he would ruin her life. PW4. Dr. Swati Murari has\nduly testified that the burn injuries were received by the\nvictim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">23.        After a judgment was rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court, the State Government has framed the\nRules called &quot;The Uttarakhand Poisons (Possession and\nSale) Rules, 2015&quot;.       Rule 14 lays down that a licence\nholder shall not sell any poison to any single person,\nunless accompanied by minimum one companion as\nwitness to disclose the purpose of purchase.

Factors such as the duration of contact,\ntemperature, volume of chemical, and voltage influence\nthe severity of the injury. The notable influence the\nseverity of the injury. The notable pathologic changes are\ndenaturation of protein and coagulation of blood vessel.\nLocal destruction of tissue leads to bacterial invasion and\ninfection, loss of fluid, electrolytes, and protein; loss of\ntemperature control: and pain. Systemic reactions include\naltered blood flow and temperature regulation, fluid\ncatabolism.      Associated     problems-other     illnesses\n(particularly cardiopulmonary), trauma, and injuries\ncaused by inhaling carbon monoxide, smoke, and\noccasionally heat- may be lethal or contribute significantly\nto mortality and morbidity from burn injuries.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      Classification. Burns are classified according to\nlocation, percentage of total body surface involved, and\ndepth of injury\n\n      First -degree burns, for example, sunburn, are\nsuperficial burns that result in some redness, pain, and\nswelling. Blister formation and necrosis (tissue death) do\nnot extend beyond the epidermis (outer layer of skin).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               11</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Healing is competed in a few days, and there is no\nscarring.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      Second-degree burns, for example, scalds, are burns\nthat show destruction of the entire epidermis and variable\nportions of the dermis (inner layer of skin); blistering and\nswelling occur and pain is severe. The degree of scarring\ndepends on the depth of injury to the dermis. Skin grafting\nmay be necessary if burns are deep or if trauma or\nsecondary infection ensues and deepens the necrosis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     Third-degree burns, for example, flame burns, are\ncharacterized by necrosis of the epidermis and dermis,\nincluding the dermal appendages (hair follicles and sweat\nglands). A pearly white, tan, or brownish-black eschar\n(&quot;scab&quot;) with coagulated dermal blood vessels results. After\n14 to 21 days, the eschar sloughs, leaving a raw surface.\nSkin grafting is usually necessary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      Fourth-degree burns, for example, severe electrical\ninjuries, involve all layers of skin, as well as the underlying\nfat, muscle, nerves, or bone.

We must therefore proceed to consider whether any\n     of the fundamental rights of the detenu are violated by\n     sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause 3(b) so as to result in\n     their invalidation wholly or in part. We will first take up\n     for consideration the fundamental right of the detenu\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> because that is a fundamental right\n     which has, after the decision in Maneka Gandhi case1 a\n     highly activist magnitude and it embodies a constitutional\n     value of supreme importance in a democratic society. It\n     provides that no one shall be deprived of his life or\n     personal liberty except according to procedure established\n     by law and such procedure shall be reasonable, fair and\n     just. Now what is the true scope and ambit of the right to\n     life guaranteed under this article? While arriving at the\n     proper meaning and content of the right to life, we must\n     remember that it is a constitutional provision which we\n     are expounding and moreover it is a provision enacting a\n     fundamental right and the attempt of the court should\n     always be to expand the reach and ambit of the\n     fundamental right rather than to attenuate its meaning\n     and content. The luminous guideline in the interpretation\n     of a constitutional provision is provided by the Supreme\n     Court of United States in Weems v.U.<a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_10\">S.13</a>\n         &quot;Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is\n     enacted, it is true, from an experience of evils, but its\n     general language should not, therefore, be necessarily\n     confined to the form that evil had, therefore taken. Time\n     works changes, brings into existence new conditions and\n     purposes. Therefore, a principle, to be vital, must be\n     capable of wider application than mischief which gave it\n     birth. This is peculiarly true of Constitutions. They are\n     not ephemeral enactments designed to meet passing\n     occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice\n     Marshall, &#x27;designed to approach immortality as nearly as\n     human institutions can approach it&#x27;. The future is their\n     care, and provisions for events of good and bad\n     tendencies of which no prophecy can be made. In the\n     application      of  a    Constitution,    therefore,   our\n     contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but of\n     what may be. Under any other rule a Constitution would\n     indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in\n     efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little\n     value, and be converted by precedent into impotent and\n     lifeless formulas.

The meaning and\nvitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow\nand restrictive construction.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">    This principle of interpretation which requires that a\nconstitutional provision must be construed, not in a\nnarrow and constricted sense, but in a wide and liberal\nmanner so as to anticipate and take account of changing\nconditions and purposes so that the constitutional\nprovision does not get atrophied or fossilized but remains\nflexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and\nchallenges, applies with greater force in relation to a\nfundamental right enacted by the Constitution. The\nfundamental right to life which is the most precious\nhuman right and which forms the ark of all other rights\nmust therefore be interpreted in a broad and expansive\nspirit so as to invest it with significance and vitality which\nmay endure for years to come and enhance the dignity of\nthe individual and the worth of the human person.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">6. Now obviously, the right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a>\ncannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It means\nsomething much more than just physical survival. In\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P.14 Subba Rao, J. quoted\nwith approval the following passage from the judgment of\nField, J. in Munn v. Illinois15 to emphasize the quality of\nlife covered by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21 : 16 &quot;</a>By the term &quot;life&quot; as here\nused something more is meant than mere animal\nexistence. The inhibition against its deprivation extends\nto all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed.\nThe provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body\nor amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an\neye or the destruction of any other organ of the body\nthrough which the soul communicates with the outer\nworld&quot; and this passage was again accepted as laying\ndown the correct law by the Constitution Bench of this\nCourt in the first Sunil Batra case4. Every limb or faculty\nthrough which life is enjoyed is thus protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article\n21</a> and a fortiorari, this would include the faculties of\nthinking and feeling. Now deprivation which is inhibited\nby <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> may be total or partial, neither any limb or\nfaculty can be totally destroyed nor can it be partially\ndamaged. Moreover it is every kind of deprivation that is\nhit by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a>, whether such deprivation be permanent\nor temporary and, furthermore, deprivation is not an act\nwhich is complete once and for all: it is a continuing act\nand so long as it lasts, it must be in accordance with\nprocedure established by law. It is therefore clear that\nany act which damages or injures or interferes with the\nuse of, any limb or faculty of a person, either permanently\nor even temporarily, would be within the inhibition of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21.</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">       7. But the question which arises is whether the\nright to life is limited only to protection of limb or faculty\nor does it go further and embrace something more. We\nthink that the right to life includes the right to live with\nhuman dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the\nbare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition,\nclothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and\nexpressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   14</span>\n\n\n\n\n      and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings.\n      Of course, the magnitude and content of the components\n      of this right would depend upon the extent of the\n      economic development of the country, but it must, in any\n      view of the matter, include the right to the basic\n      necessities of life and also the right to carry on such\n      functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum\n      expression of the human-self. Every act which offends\n      against or impairs human dignity would constitute\n      deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would\n      have to be in accordance with reasonable, fair and just\n      procedure established by law which stands the test of\n      other fundamental rights. Now obviously, any form of\n      torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment would\n      be offensive to human dignity and constitute an inroad\n      into this right to live and it would, on this view, be\n      prohibited by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> unless it is in accordance with\n      procedure prescribed by law, but no law which authorises\n      and no procedure which leads to such torture or cruel,\n      inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the test\n      of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness: it would plainly\n      be unconstitutional and void as being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles\n      14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">21.</a> It would thus be seen that there is implicit in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> the right to protection against torture or cruel,\n      inhuman or degrading treatment which is enunciated in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 5</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n      and guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 7</a> of the International Covenant\n      on Civil and Political Rights. This right to live which is\n      comprehended within the broad connotation of the right\n      to life can concededly be abridged according to procedure\n      established by law and therefore when a person is\n      lawfully imprisoned, this right to live is bound to suffer\n      attenuation to the extent to which it is incapable of\n      enjoyment by reason of incarceration. The prisoner or\n      detenu obviously cannot move about freely by going\n      outside the prison walls nor can he socialise at his free-\n      will with persons outside the jail. But, as part of the right\n      to live with human dignity and therefore as a necessary\n      component of the right to life, he would be entitled to\n      have interviews with the members of his family and\n      friends and no prison regulation or procedure laid down\n      by prison regulation regulating the right to have\n      interviews with the members of the family and friends can\n      be upheld as constitutionally valid under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_23\">Articles 14</a> and\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">21</a>, unless it is reasonable, fair and just.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">30.

Social justice\n      is not a simple or single idea of a society but is an\n      essential part of complex social change to relieve the poor\n      etc. from handicaps, penury to ward off distress, and to\n      make their life livable, for greater good of the society at\n      large. In other words, the aim of social justice is to attain\n      substantial degree of social, economic and political\n      equality, which is the legitimate expectations. Social\n      security, just and humane conditions of work and leisure\n      to workman are part of his meaningful right to life and to\n      achieve self- expression of his personality and to enjoy the\n      life with dignity, the State should provide facilities and\n      opportunities to enable them to reach at least minimum\n      standard of health, economic security and civilised living\n      while sharing according to the capacity, social and\n      cultural heritage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">      24.

Such\n      deprivation would not only denude the life of its effective\n      content of meaningfulness but it would make life\n      impossible to live, leave aside what makes life livable. The\n      right to life with human dignity encompasses within its\n      fold, some of the finer facets of human civilisation which\n      makes life worth living.

In a developing society like ours, steeped with\n      unbridgeable and ever-widening gaps of inequality in\n      status and of opportunity, law is a catalyst, rubicon to\n      the poor etc. to reach the ladder of social justice. What is\n      due cannot be ascertained by an absolute standard which\n      keeps changing, depending upon the time, place and\n      circumstance. The constitutional concern of social justice\n      as an elastic continuous process is to accord justice to all\n      sections of the society by providing facilities and\n      opportunities to remove handicaps and disabilities with\n      which the poor, the workmen etc. are languishing and to\n      secure dignity of their person. The Constitution,\n      therefore, mandates the State to accord justice to all\n      members of the society in all facets of human activity. The\n      concept of social justice embeds equality to flavour and\n      enliven the practical content of life. Social justice and\n      equality are complementary to each other so that both\n      should maintain their vitality. Rule of law, therefore, is a\n      potent instrument of social justice to bring about equality\n      in results.

We would reach the same conclusion for a\ndifferent reason altogether. The 1st respondent while\nsubmitting a reply to the charge-sheet dated April 14,\n1975 requested the Chairman of the appellant to permit\nhim assistance of an advocate at the enquiry. This\nrequest was refused and the decision was conveyed by the\nDock Manager as per his letter dated March (sic) 1975.\nThe enquiry opened on April 13, 1976. By May 8, 1976\nevidence of only one out of 25 witnesses of the employer\nwas offered and the second witness was under\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">examination. On that date Bombay Port Trust Employees\nRegulations, 1976 admittedly came into force. The\nrelevant <a href=\"/doc/1066594/\" id=\"a_34\">Regulation 12(8)</a> is extracted herein before. The\nlatter portion of the regulation practically borrows the\nlanguage of sub-rule (5) of Rule 15 referred to herein\nbefore, in that it provides that the delinquent officer may\nnot engage a legal practitioner for the purpose unless the\nPresenting Officer appointed by the Disciplinary Authority\nis the legal practitioner or the Disciplinary Authority\nhaving regard to the circumstances of the case so\npermits. Now the 1st respondent had already submitted\nhis request for appearing through a legal practitioner at\nthe enquiry. This eminently just request was turned down\non untenable grounds, and to make matters worse for the\ndelinquent employee two Law Officers of the appellant\nwere appointed Presenting-cum-Prosecuting Officers.\nAssuming that in the absence of rules the Chairman has\na discretion which was required to be exercised wisely yet\ntaking shelter behind legal facade it was exercised against\nthe 1st respondent because he was not under any\nstatutory obligation to grant this request. However, when\n<a href=\"/doc/1066594/\" id=\"a_35\">Regulation 12(8)</a> came into force, the situation materially\naltered and the large number of witnesses almost all\nexcept one were examined after the regulation came into\nforce and which made it obligatory to grant the request of\nthe 1st respondent because the regulation provided\ngranting of permission to appear and defend by a legal\npractitioner once the department was represented by\nlegally trained minds. A very feeble submission was made\nby Mr Nariman that after the <a href=\"/doc/1066594/\" id=\"a_36\">Regulation 12(8)</a> came into\nforce, the request was not renewed. In our opinion, that is\nhardly relevant. The unjustly refused request was already\nthere and obligation under the regulation coupled with\nfair play in action demanded that the employer should\nhave suo motu reviewed his order refusing the request. In\nfact one can go so far as to say that the Enquiry Officer in\norder to be fair and just, whenever he finds the employer\nappointing legally trained persons as Presenting-cum-\nProsecuting Officers must enquire from the delinquent\nemployee before commencement of enquiry whether he\nwould like to take assistance of a legal practitioner. The\noption then is with the delinquent employee. In this\nconnection, we would like to refer to a weighty\nobservation on this point where despite constitutional\ninhibition this Court conceded such a right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"875590\" id=\"span_24\">In <a href=\"/doc/875590/\" id=\"a_37\">A.K.

While noting this\n      constitutional mandate, the learned Chief Justice\n      proceeded to examine, what would be the effect if the\n      department is represented before the Advisory Board by a\n      legally trained person. It was held that in such a situation\n      despite the inhibition of <a href=\"/doc/188658956/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 22(3)(b)</a> the fair procedure\n      as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21</a> requires that a detenu be\n      permitted to appear by a legal practitioner. Thus spoke\n      the learned Chief Justice:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">             &quot;We must therefore make it clear that if the\n      detaining authority or the government takes the aid of a\n      legal practitioner or a legal adviser before the Advisory\n      Board, the detenu must be allowed the facility of\n      appearing before the Board through a legal practitioner.\n      We are informed that officers of the Government in the\n      concerned departments often appear before the Board\n      and assist it with a view to justifying the detention orders.\n      If that be so, we must clarify that the Boards should not\n      permit the authorities to do indirectly what they cannot\n      do directly; and no one should be enabled to take shelter\n      behind the excuse that such officers are not &#x27;legal\n      practitioners&#x27; or legal advisers.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">             And this view was taken as flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a>\n      which mandates that no one shall be deprived of his life\n      or liberty except in accordance with the procedure\n      prescribed by law. The expression &quot;life&quot; does not merely\n      connote animal existence or a continued drudgery\n      through life. The expression &quot;life&quot; has a much wider\n      meaning.

Their lordships have held\nas under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           &quot;9. Shri Rana appearing for the State strenuously\n     contended that the High Court has committed a grave\n     error in holding that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 307</a> IPC\n     was not made out merely because the injuries inflicted on\n     the witnesses were in the nature of a simple hurt and in\n     these circumstances it is not possible to hold any of the\n     accused persons guilty in respect of that offence. We find\n     considerable force in this contention. A bare perusal of\n     <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 307</a> IPC would show that the reasons given by the\n     High Court for acquitting the accused of the offence\n     under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 307</a> were not tenable. <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 307</a> IPC\n     reads:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                  &quot;Whoever does any act with such intention or\n           knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if\n           he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of\n           murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of\n           either description for a term which may extend to\n           ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if\n           hurt is caused to any person by such act, the\n           offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for\n           life, or to such punishment as is hereinbefore\n           mentioned.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">           To justify a conviction under this section it is not\n     essential that bodily injury capable of causing death\n     should have been inflicted. Although the nature of injury\n     actually caused may often give considerable assistance in\n     coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused,\n     such intention may also be deduced from other\n     circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be\n     ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds.\n     The section makes a distinction between an act of the\n     accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be\n     attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is\n     concerned, but still there may be cases in which the\n     culprit would be liable under this section. It is not\n     necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of\n     the assault should be sufficient under ordinary\n     circumstances to cause the death of the person\n     assaulted. What the Court has to see is whether the act,\n     irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or\n     knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in this\n     section. An attempt in order to be criminal need not be\n     the penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if there is\n     present an intent coupled with some overt act in\n     execution thereof.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                   21</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"498126\" id=\"span_29\">37.

There can be no second opinion that\n      preservation of human life is of paramount importance.\n      That is so on account of the fact that once life is lost, the\n      status quo ante cannot be restored as resurrection is\n      beyond the capacity of man. The patient whether he be an\n      innocent person or be a criminal liable to punishment\n      under the laws of the society, it is the obligation of those\n      who are in-charge of the health of the community to\n      preserve life so that the innocent may be protected land\n      the guilty may be punished. Social laws do not\n      contemplate death by negligence to tantamount to legal\n      punishment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      8. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution casts the obligation on\n      the State to preserve life. The provision as explained by\n      this Court in scores of decisions has emphasised and\n      reiterated with gradually increasing emphasis that\n      position. A doctor at the Government hospital positioned\n      to meet this State obligation is, therefore, duty-bound to\n      extend medical assistance for preserving life. Every doctor\n      whether at a Government hospital or otherwise has the\n      professional obligation to extend his services with due\n      expertise for protecting life. No law or State action can\n      intervene to avoid/delay the discharge of the paramount\n      obligation cast upon members of the medical profession.\n      The obligation being total, absolute and paramount, laws\n      of procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which\n      would interfere with the discharge of this obligation\n      cannot be sustained and must, therefore, give way. On\n      this basis, we have not issued, notices to the States and\n      Union Territories for affording them an opportunity of\n      being heard before we accepted the statement made in\n      the affidavit of the Union of India that there is no\n      impediment in the law. The matter is extremely urgent\n      and in our view, brooks no delay to remind every doctor of\n      his total obligation and assure him of the position that he\n      does not contravene the law of the land by proceeding to\n      treat the injured victim on his appearance before Him •\n      either by himself or being carried by others. We must\n      make it clear that zonal regulations and classifications\n      cannot also operate as fetters in the process of discharge\n      of the obligation and irrespective of the fact whether\n      under instructions or rules, the victim has to be sent\n      elsewhere or how the police shall be contacted, the\n      guideline indicated in the 1985 decision of the\n      Committee, as extracted above, is to become operative.\n      We order accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      10.

It could not be forgotten that seeing an injured man\nin a miserable condition the human instinct of every\ncitizen moves him to rush for help and do all that can be\ndone to save the life. It could not be disputed that in spite\nof development economical, political and cultural still\ncitizens are human beings and all the more when a man\nin such a miserable state hanging between life and death\nreaches the medical practitioner either in a hospital (run\nor managed by the State) public authority or a private\nperson or a medical professional doing only private\npractice he is always called upon to rush to help such an\ninjured person and to do all that is within his power to\nsave life. So far as this duty of a medical professional is\nconcerned its duty coupled with human instinct, it needs\nno decision nor any code of ethics nor any rule or law.\nStill in the Code of Medical Ethics framed by the Medical\nCouncil of India Item 13 specifically provides for it Item\n13 reads as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">        13. The Patient must not be neglected.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">A physician is free to choose whom he will serve. He\nshould, however, respond to any request for his\nassistance in an emergency or whenever temperate public\nopinion expects the service. Once having undertaken a\ncase, the physician should not neglect the patient, nor\nshould he withdraw from the case without giving notice to\nthe patient, his relatives or his responsible friends\nsufficiently long in advance of his withdrawal to allow\nthem to secure another medical attendant. No\nprovisionally or fully registered medical practitioner shall\nwilfully commit an act of negligence that may deprive his\npatient or patients from necessary medical care.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">16. Some apprehensions were expressed because of some\nmisunderstanding about the law of procedure and the\npolice regulations and the priorities in such situations.\nOn the basis of the affidavit filed by the Union of India\nand considering the matter it is clear that there is no legal\nimpediment for a medical professional when he is called\nupon or requested to attend to an injured person needing\nhis medical assistance immediately. There is also no\ndoubt that the effort to save the person should be the top\npriority not only of the medical professional but even of\nthe police or any other citizen who happens to be\nconnected with the matter or who happens to notice such\nan incident or a situation. But on behalf of the medical\nprofession there is one more apprehension which\nsometimes prevents a medical professional in spite of his\ndesire to help the person, as he apprehends that he will\nbe a witness and may have to face the police interrogation\nwhich sometimes may need going to the police station\nrepeatedly and waiting and also to be a witness in a court\nof law where also he apprehends that he may have to go\non number of days and may have to wait for a long time\nand may have to face sometimes long unnecessary cross-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                   23</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">      examination which sometimes may even be humiliating\n      for a man in the medical profession and in our opinion it\n      is this apprehension which prevents a medical\n      professional who is not entrusted with the duty of\n      handling medico-legal cases to do the needful, he always\n      tries to avoid and even if approached directs the person\n      concerned to go to a State hospital and particularly to the\n      person who is in-charge of the medico-legal cases. We\n      therefore have no hesitation in assuring the persons in\n      the medical profession that these apprehensions, even if\n      have some foundation, should not prevent them from\n      discharging their duty as a medical professional to save a\n      human life and to do all that is necessary but at the same\n      time we hope and trust that with this expectation from\n      the members of the medical profession, the police, the\n      members of the legal profession, our law courts and\n      everyone concerned will also keep in mind that a man in\n      the medical profession should not be unnecessarily\n      harassed for purposes of interrogation or for any other\n      formalities and should not be dragged during\n      investigations at the police station and it should be\n      avoided as far as possible. We also hope and trust that\n      our law courts will not summon a medical professional to\n      give evidence unless the evidence is necessary and even if\n      he is summoned, attempt should be made to see that the\n      men in this profession are not made to wait and waste\n      time unnecessarily and it is known that our law courts\n      always have respect for the men in the medical profession\n      and they are called to give evidence when necessary and\n      attempts are made so that they may not have to wait for\n      long. We have no hesitation in saying that it is expected of\n      the members of the legal profession which is the other\n      honourable profession to honour the persons in the\n      medical profession and see that they are not called to give\n      evidence so long as it is not necessary. It is also expected\n      that where the facts are so clear it is expected that\n      unnecessary harassment of the members of the medical\n      profession either by way of request for adjournments or\n      by cross-examination should be avoided so that the\n      apprehension that the men in the medical profession have\n      which prevents them from discharging their duty to a\n      suffering person who needs their assistance utmost, is\n      removed and a citizen needing the assistance of a man in\n      the medical profession receives it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">      17. We would also like to mention that whenever on such\n      occasions a man of the medical profession is approached\n      and if he finds that whatever assistance he could give is\n      not sufficient really to save the life of the person but some\n      better assistance is necessary it is also the duty of the\n      man in the medical profession so approached to render all\n      the help which he could and also see that the person\n      reaches the proper expert as early as possible.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">38.

Right to shelter does not mean a\nmere right to a roof over one&#x27;s head. It is something more\nthan a mere protection of one&#x27;s life and limb.

In any organised society, right to live as a\n      human being is not ensured by meeting only the animal\n      needs of man. It is secured only when he is assured of all\n      facilities to develop himself and is freed from restrictions\n      which inhibit his growth. All human rights are designed\n      to achieve this object. Right to live guaranteed in any\n      Civilised society implies the right to food, water, decent\n      environment education, medical care and shelter. These\n      are basic human rights known to any civilised society. All\n      civil, political, social and cultural rights enshrined in the\n      Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Convention\n      or under the Constitution of India cannot be exercised\n      without these basic human rights. Shelter for a human\n      being, therefore, is not a mere protection of his life and\n      limb. It is home where he has opportunities to grow\n      physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually. Right\n      to shelter, therefore, includes adequate living space, safe\n      and decent structure, clean and decent surroundings,\n      sufficient light, pure air and water, electricity, sanitation\n      and other civic amenities like roads etc. so as to have\n      easy access to his daily avocation. The right to shelter,\n      therefore, does not mean a mere right to a roof over one&#x27;s\n      head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to\n      enable them to live and develop as a human being. Right\n      to shelter when used as an essential requisite to the right\n      to live, should be deemed to have been guaranteed as a\n      fundamental right. As is enjoined in the Directive\n      Principles, the State should be deemed to be under an\n      obligation to secure it for its citizens, of course subject to\n      its economic budgeting. In a democratic society as a\n      member of the organised civic community one should\n      have permanent shelter so as to physically, mentally and\n      intellectually equip to improve his excellence as a useful\n      citizen as enjoined in the Fundamental Duties and to be\n      useful citizen and equal participant in democracy. The\n      ultimate object of making a man equipped with a right to\n      dignity of person and equality of status is to enable him\n      to develop himself into a cultured being. Want of decent\n      residence, therefore, frustrates the very object of the\n      Constitutional animation of right to equality, economic\n      justice, fundamental right to residence, dignity of person\n      and right to live itself. To bring the Dalits and Tribes into\n      the mainstream of national life providing these facilities\n      and opportunities to them is the duty of the State as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                   25</span>\n\n\n\n\n      fundamental to their basic human and constitutional\n      rights.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_35\">40.

The section is\n      only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive\n      offence. The distinctive feature of the section is the\n      element of participation in action. The liability of one\n      person for an offence committed by another in the course\n      of criminal act perpetrated by several persons arises\n      under <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 34</a> if such criminal act is done in\n      furtherance of a common intention of the persons who\n      join in committing the crime. Direct proof of common\n      intention is seldom available and, therefore, such\n      intention can only be inferred from the circumstances\n      appearing from the proved facts of the case and the\n      proved circumstances. In order to bring home the charge\n      of common intention, the prosecution has to establish by\n      evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was\n      plan or meeting of minds of all the accused persons to\n      commit the offence for which they are charged with the\n      aid of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 34</a>, be it pre-arranged or on the spur of the\n      moment; but it must necessarily be before the\n      commission of the crime. The true concept of the section\n      is that if two or more persons intentionally do an act\n      jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of\n      them has done it individually by himself. As observed in\n      <a href=\"/doc/673120/\" id=\"a_67\">Ashok Kumar v. State of Punjab1</a> the existence of a\n      common intention amongst the participants in a crime is\n      the essential element for application of this section. It is\n      not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged\n      with commission of an offence jointly must be the same\n      or identically similar. The acts may be different in\n      character, but must have been actuated by one and the\n      same common intention in order to attract the provision.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"865810\" id=\"span_39\">10.

It is very difficult to define the term &quot;liberty&quot;. It has\nmany facets and meanings. The philosophers and\nmoralists have praised freedom and liberty but this term\nis difficult to define because it does not resist any\ninterpretation. The term &quot;liberty&quot; may be defined as the\naffirmation by an individual or group of his or its own\nessence. It needs the presence of three factors, firstly,\nharmonious balance of personality, secondly, the absence\nof restraint upon the exercise of that affirmation and\nthirdly, organisation of opportunities for the exercise of a\ncontinuous initiative.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">    40. &quot;Liberty&quot; may be defined as a power of acting\naccording to the determinations of the will. According to\nHarold Laski, &quot;liberty&quot; was essentially an absence of\nrestraints and John Stuart Mill viewed that &quot;all restraint,\nqua restraint is an evil&quot;. In the words of Jonathon\nEdwards, the meaning of &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; is:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">    &quot;Power, opportunity or advantage that any one has to\ndo as he pleases, or, in other words, his being free from\nhindrance or impediment in the way of doing, or\nconducting in any respect, as he wills.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1108032\" id=\"span_57\">41. It can be found that &quot;liberty&quot; generally means the\nprevention of restraints and providing such opportunities,\nthe denial of which would result in frustration and\nultimately disorder. Restraints on man&#x27;s liberty are <a href=\"/doc/1108032/\" id=\"a_105\">laid\ndown by</a> power used through absolute discretion, which\nwhen used in this manner brings an end to &quot;liberty&quot; and\nfreedom is lost. At the same time &quot;liberty&quot; without\nrestraints would mean liberty won by one and lost by\nanother. So &quot;liberty&quot; means doing of anything one desires\nbut subject to the desire of others.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">    68. Life and personal liberty has been given prime\nimportance in the United Kingdom. It was in 1215 that\nthe people of England revolted against King John and\nenforced their rights; first time the King had\nacknowledged that there were certain rights of the subject\nwhich could be called Magna Carta, in 1215. In 1628 the\nPetition of Rights was presented to King Charles I which\nwas the first step in the transfer of sovereignty from the\nKing to Parliament. It was passed as the Bill of Rights in\n1689.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">    69. In the Magna Carta, it is stated &quot;no free man shall\nbe taken, or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or\nbanished or any ways destroyed, nor will the King pass\nupon him or commit him to prison, unless by the\njudgment of his peers or the law of the land&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"861688\" id=\"span_58\">70. Right to life is the most fundamental of all human\nrights and any decision affecting human right or which\nmay put an individual&#x27;s life at risk must call for the most\nanxious scrutiny. (See <a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_106\">R. v. Secy. of State</a> for the Home\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                             31</span>\n\n\n\n\nDeptt., ex p Bugdaycay23.)

[The &#x27;due process&#x27;\nclause was adopted in Section 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of\nRights Act, 1960. In the Canada Act, 1982, this\nexpression has been substituted by &#x27;the principles of\nfundamental justice&#x27; (<a href=\"/doc/1597655/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 7</a>).]&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">    72. The Fourteenth Amendment imposes similar\nlimitation on the State authorities. These two provisions\nare conveniently referred to as the &quot;due process clauses&quot;.\nUnder the above clauses the American judiciary claims to\ndeclare a law as bad, if it is not in accordance with &quot;due\nprocess&quot;, even though the legislation may be within the\ncompetence of the legislature concerned. Due process\nconveniently understood means procedural regularity and\nfairness. (Constitutional Interpretation by Craig R.

Section 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights Act,\n1960 adopted the &quot;due process&quot; clause from the American\nConstitution. But the difference in the Canadian set-up\nwas due to the fact that this Act was not a constitutional\ninstrument to impose a direct limitation on the legislature\nbut only a statute for interpretation of Canadian statutes,\nwhich, again, could be excluded from the purview of the\nAct of 1960, in particular cases, by an express declaration\nmade by the Canadian Parliament itself (<a href=\"/doc/915147/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 2</a>).

While the State of Bihar\n      has provided for compensation of Rs 25,000 in such\n      Scheme, the State of Rajasthan has provided for Rs 2\n      lakhs of compensation. In our view, the compensation\n      provided in the Scheme by most of the States/Union\n      Territories is inadequate. It cannot be overlooked that\n      acid attack victims need to undergo a series of plastic\n      surgeries and other corrective treatments.

Leave     granted.    Reputation     is\n                  fundamentally a glorious amalgam and\n                  unification of virtues which makes a man\n                  feel proud of his ancestry and satisfies him\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                              37</span>\n\n\n\n\n                to bequeath it as a part of inheritance on\n                the posterity. It is a nobility in itself for\n                which a conscientious man would never\n                barter it with all the tea of China or for that\n                matter all the pearls of the sea. The said\n                virtue has both horizontal and vertical\n                qualities. When reputation is hurt, a man is\n                half-dead. It is an honour which deserves to\n                be equally preserved by the down trodden\n                and the privileged. The aroma of reputation\n                is an excellence which cannot be allowed to\n                be sullied with the passage of time. The\n                memory of nobility no one would like to\n                lose; none would conceive of it being\n                atrophied. It is dear to life and on some\n                occasions it is dearer than life. And that is\n                why it has become an inseparable facet of\n                <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. No one would\n                like to have his reputation dented. One\n                would like to perceive it as an honour rather\n                than popularity. When a court deals with a\n                matter that has something likely to affect a\n                person&#x27;s     reputation,      the   normative\n                principles of law are to be cautiously and\n                carefully adhered to.

Section 357-A came to be inserted in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_152\">Code of\n      Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 by Act 5 of 2009 w.e.f. 31-12-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_145\">      2009. Inter alia, this section provides for preparation of a\n      scheme for providing funds for the purpose of compensation\n      to the victim or his dependants who have suffered loss or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                           39</span>\n\n\n\n\ninjury as a result of the crime and who require\nrehabilitation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">   13. We are informed that pursuant to this provision, 17\nStates and 7 Union Territories have prepared &#x27;Victim\nCompensation Scheme&#x27; (for short &#x27;the Scheme&#x27;). As regards\nthe victims of acid attacks, the compensation mentioned in\nthe Scheme framed by these States and Union Territories is\nun-uniform. While the State of Bihar has provided for\ncompensation of Rs 25,000 in such Scheme, the State of\nRajasthan has provided for Rs 2 lakhs of compensation. In\nour view, the compensation provided in the Scheme by most\nof the States/Union Territories is inadequate. It cannot be\noverlooked that acid attack victims need to undergo a series\nof plastic surgeries and other corrective treatments. Having\nregard to this problem, the learned Solicitor General\nsuggested to us that the compensation by the States/Union\nTerritories for acid attack victims must be enhanced to at\nleast Rs 3 lakhs as the aftercare and rehabilitation cost. The\nsuggestion of the learned Solicitor General is very fair.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">   14. We, accordingly, direct that the acid attack victims\nshall be paid compensation of at least Rs 3 lakhs by the\nState Government/Union Territory concerned as the\naftercare and rehabilitation cost. Of this amount, a sum of\nRs 1 lakh shall be paid to such victim within 15 days of\noccurrence of such incident (or being brought to the notice of\nthe State Government/Union Territory) to facilitate\nimmediate medical attention and expenses in this regard.\nThe balance sum of Rs 2 lakhs shall be paid as expeditiously\nas may be possible and positively within two months\nthereafter. The Chief Secretaries of the States and the\nAdministrators of the Union Territories shall ensure\ncompliance with the above direction.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">10. On 3-12-2013, in Laxmi case2, when the affidavit of the\nState of Haryana was placed before the Bench, in which it\nstated that the Government of Haryana is in the process of\nframing a scheme for full medical treatment, short term as\nwell as long term, for specialised plastic surgery, corrective\nsurgeries, providing specialised psychological treatment to\nthe acid attack victims to help them to come out of the\nhorror and trauma of the acid attack and their\nrehabilitation, this Court directed the Chief Secretaries of the\nStates (other than Haryana) and the administrators of the\nUnion Territories to file affidavit and indicate to this Court,\nthe State&#x27;s view in bearing 100% cost of treatment of the acid\nattack victims in line with the decision taken by the\nGovernment of Haryana and also with regard to framing of\nscheme on the lines of the Haryana Government for medical\ntreatment at specialised hospitals having facility for plastic\nsurgery, corrective surgery and psychological as well as other\ntreatment to the acid attack victims. This Court further\ndirected the Chief Secretaries of the States and\nAdministrators of the Union Territories to issue necessary\ninstructions to the police stations within their respective\nState/Union Territory that as and when an FIR is lodged\nwith the police relating to acid attack, the police station\nconcerned will send a communication to the jurisdictional\nSDM about receipt of such information. Upon receipt of such\ninformation, the jurisdictional SDM shall then make an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                           40</span>\n\n\n\n\ninquiry into the procurement of acid by the wrongdoer and\ntake appropriate action in the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1402035\" id=\"span_78\">11. While disposing of the writ petition in <a href=\"/doc/1402035/\" id=\"a_153\">Laxmi v. Union of\nIndia3</a>, this Court inter alia held, thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1402035\" id=\"span_79\">&quot;10. We have gone through the chart annexed along with\nthe affidavit filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and we find\nthat despite the directions given by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1402035/\" id=\"a_154\">Laxmi v.\nUnion of India1</a>, the minimum compensation of Rs 3,00,000\n(Rupees three lakhs only) per acid attack victim has not been\nfixed in some of the States/Union Territories. In our opinion,\nit will be appropriate if the Member Secretary of the State\nLegal Services Authority takes up the issue with the State\nGovernment so that the orders passed by this Court are\ncomplied with and a minimum of Rs 3,00,000 (Rupees three\nlakhs only) is made available to each victim of acid attack.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">    11. From the figures given above, we find that the amount\nwill not be burdensome so far as the State\nGovernments/Union          Territories  are   concerned    and,\ntherefore, we do not see any reason why the directions given\nby this Court should not be accepted by the State\nGovernments/Union Territories since they do not involve any\nserious financial implication.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">    **      *\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">    13. Insofar as the proper treatment, aftercare and\nrehabilitation of the victims of acid attack is concerned, the\nmeeting convened on 14-3-2015 notes unanimously that full\nmedical assistance should be provided to the victims of acid\nattack and that private hospitals should also provide free\nmedical treatment to such victims. It is noted that there may\nperhaps be some reluctance on the part of some private\nhospitals to provide free medical treatment and, therefore,\nthe officers concerned in the State Governments should take\nup the matter with the private hospitals so that they are also\nrequired to provide free medical treatment to the victims of\nacid attack.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">    14. The decisions taken in the meeting read as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">    The private hospitals will also be brought on board for\ncompliance and the States/UTs will use necessary means in\nthis regard.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">    No hospital/clinic should refuse treatment citing lack of\nspecialised facilities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">    First aid must be administered to the victim and after\nstabilisation, the victim/patient could be shifted to a\nspecialised facility for further treatment, wherever required.\n    Action may be taken against hospital/clinic for refusal to\ntreat victims of acid attacks and other crimes in\ncontravention of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 357-C</a> of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">    17. We, therefore, issue a direction that the State\nGovernments/Union Territories should seriously discuss and\ntake up the matter with all the private hospitals in their\nrespective State/Union Territory to the effect that the private\nhospitals should not refuse treatment to victims of acid\nattack and that full treatment should be provided to such\nvictims     including     medicines,    food,   bedding     and\nreconstructive surgeries.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                           41</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">   18. We also issue a direction that the hospital, where the\nvictim of an acid attack is first treated, should give a\ncertificate that the individual is a victim of an acid attack.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">This certificate may be utilised by the victim for treatment\nand reconstructive surgeries or any other scheme that the\nvictim may be entitled to with the State Government or the\nUnion Territory, as the case may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">   19. In the event of any specific complaint against any\nprivate hospital or government hospital, the acid attack\nvictim will, of course, be at liberty to take further action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">   20. With regard to the banning of sale of acid across the\ncounter, we direct the Secretary in the Ministry of Home\nAffairs and Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family\nWelfare to take up the matter with the State\nGovernments/Union Territories to ensure that an\nappropriate notification to this effect is issued within a\nperiod of three months from today. It appears that some\nStates/Union Territories have already issued such a\nnotification, but, in our opinion, all States and Union\nTerritories must issue such a notification at the earliest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">   21. The final issue is with regard to the setting up of a\nCriminal Injuries Compensation Board. In the meeting held\non 14-3-2015, the unanimous view was that since the\nDistrict Legal Services Authority is already constituted in\nevery district and is involved in providing appropriate\nassistance relating to acid attack victims, perhaps it may not\nbe necessary to set up a separate Criminal Injuries\nCompensation Board. In other words, a multiplicity of\nauthorities need not be created.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">   22. In our opinion, this view is quite reasonable.\nTherefore, in case of any compensation claim made by any\nacid attack victim, the matter will be taken up by the District\nLegal Services Authority, which will include the District\nJudge and such other co-opted persons who the District\nJudge feels will be of assistance, particularly the District\nMagistrate, the Superintendent of Police and the Civil\nSurgeon or the Chief Medical Officer of that district or their\nnominee. This body will function as the Criminal Injuries\nCompensation Board for all purposes.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">   12. The abovementioned direction given by this Court in\nLaxmi case3 is a general mandate to the States and Union\nTerritories and is the minimum amount which the State\nshall make available to each victim of acid attack. The State\nand Union Territory concerned can give even more amount of\ncompensation than Rs 3,00,000 as directed by this Court. It\nis pertinent to mention here that the mandate given by this\nCourt in Laxmi case3 nowhere restricts the Court from\ngiving more compensation to the victim of acid attack,\nespecially when the victim has suffered serious injuries on\nher body which is required to be taken into consideration by\nthis Court. In peculiar facts, this Court can grant even more\ncompensation to the victim than Rs 3,00,000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">   13. We have come across many instances of acid attacks\nacross the country. These attacks have been rampant for the\nsimple reason that there has been no proper implementation\nof the regulations or control for the supply and distribution\nof acid. There have been many cases where the victims of\nacid attack are made to sit at home owing to their difficulty\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                            42</span>\n\n\n\n\nto work. These instances unveil that the State has failed to\ncheck the distribution of acid falling into the wrong hands\neven after giving many directions by this Court in this\nregard. Henceforth, stringent action be taken against those\nerring persons supplying acid without proper authorisation\nand also the authorities concerned be made responsible for\nfailure to keep a check on the distribution of the acid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">    14. When we consider the instant case of the victims, the\nvery sight of the victim is traumatising for us. If we could be\ntraumatised by the mere sight of injuries caused to the\nvictim by the inhumane acid attack on her, what would the\nsituation of the victim be, perhaps, we cannot judge.\nNonetheless we cannot be oblivious of the fact of her trauma.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">    15. From perusal of the record of the case, it is found that\nthe elder sister suffered 28% burns on her body and 90% on\nher face, owing to the alleged brutal attack on her. Due to\nthe acid attack, the victim had undergone several surgeries,\nand has to undergo many more corrective and curative\nsurgeries for her treatment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">16. Admittedly, three skin grafting surgeries were conducted\nby PMCH but they were all improperly conducted as testified\nat Safdarjung Hospital. The victim, was brought to Delhi by\nthe petitioner and in Delhi some skin grafting surgeries were\nagain conducted at Safdarjung Hospital for neck, lips, eyes,\nnose, arm, forehead and ear. Further skin grafting surgeries\nwere also conducted at Fortis Hospital for neck, lips, nose,\neye and arm. In the opinion of the victim&#x27;s doctor also, she\nwould be required to undergo multiple corrective and\ncurative operations and medical support for the rest of her\nlife. The victim would be required to have corrective and\ncurative surgeries for neck, lips, eyes, nose, arm, forehead,\nears, breasts and elbow. Apart from the above medical\nconditions/treatment, which she is required to undergo,\nthere are many other consequences, which an acid attack\nbrings out in the life of the victim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">    17. Considering the plight of the victim we can sum up\nthat:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">    (i) The likeliness of the victim getting a job which involves\nphysical exertion of energy is very low.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">    (ii) The social stigma and the pain that she has to go\nthrough for not being accepted by the society cannot be\nneglected. Furthermore, the general reaction of loathing\nwhich she would have to encounter and the humiliation that\nshe would have to face throughout her life cannot be\ncompensated in terms of money.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">    (iii) As a result of the physical injury, the victim will not\nbe able to lead a normal life and cannot dream of marriage\nprospects.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">    (iv) Since her skin is fragile due to the acid attack she\nwould have to take care of it for the rest of her life. Therefore,\nthe aftercare and rehabilitation cost that has to be incurred\nwill have huge financial implications on her and her family.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">    18. On perusal of various contentions and evidence, we\nfind it imperative to mention that even after this Court\nhaving passed an order dated 6-2-2013 directing the Union\nof India and the States to implement compensation payable\nto acid attack victims by creation of a separate fund, only 17\nStates have been notified of the Victim Compensation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                           43</span>\n\n\n\n\nSchemes (VCS). Out of which 7 States and 4 Union\nTerritories have not initiated VCS. Even in those States\nwhere the Scheme has been implemented, a meagre\ncompensation ranging between Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakhs is\nprovided for medical care. And many States have not\nprovided any compensation for rehabilitation at all. In the\npresent case, the Government of Bihar has fixed a pitiable\namount of Rs 25,000 for the victims of acid attack.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">    19. The guidelines issued by orders in Laxmi case1,2,3\nare proper, except with respect to the compensation amount.\nWe just need to ensure that these guidelines are\nimplemented properly. Keeping in view the impact of acid\nattack on the victim&#x27;s social, economical and personal life,\nwe need to enhance the amount of compensation. We cannot\nbe oblivious of the fact that the victim of acid attack requires\npermanent treatment for the damaged skin. The mere\namount of Rs 3 lakhs will not be of any help to such a\nvictim. We are conscious of the fact that enhancement of the\ncompensation amount will be an additional burden on the\nState. But prevention of such a crime is the responsibility of\nthe State and the liability to pay the enhanced compensation\nwill be of the State. The enhancement of the compensation\nwill act in two ways:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">    (i) It will help the victim in rehabilitation;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">    (ii) It will also make the State to implement the guidelines\nproperly as the State will try to comply with it in its true\nspirit so that the crime of acid attack can be prevented in\nfuture.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1402035\" id=\"span_83\">20. Having regard to the problems faced by the victims,\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1402035/\" id=\"a_156\">Laxmi v. Union of India1</a> by an order dated 18-\n7-2013, enhanced the compensation, stating that, &quot;at least\nRs 3 lakhs must be paid to the victims of acid attacks by the\nGovernment concerned&quot;. Therefore, a minimum of Rs 3 lakhs\nis to be awarded by the Government to each victim of the\nacid attack. In the present case, a minimum amount of Rs 6\nlakhs has to be awarded to the sisters.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">    21. In peculiar facts of the case, we are of the view that\nvictim Chanchal deserves to be awarded a compensation\nmore than what has been prescribed by this Court in Laxmi\ncase1. Though in this case we are not issuing any guidelines\ndifferent from the guidelines issued in Laxmi case1, we\nshould not forget that the younger sister was also injured by\nthe acid attack. Although her degree of sufferance is not as\nthat of the elder one, but she also requires treatment and\nrehabilitation. It is to be noted that this Court in Laxmi\ncase3 does not put a bar on the Government to award\ncompensation limited to Rs 3 lakhs. The State has the\ndiscretion to provide more compensation to the victim in the\ncase of acid attack as per Laxmi case3 guidelines. It is also\nto be noticed that this Court has not put any condition in\nLaxmi case3 as to the degree of injuries which a victim has\nsuffered due to acid attack. In the instant case, the victim&#x27;s\nfather has already spent more than Rs 5 lakhs for the\ntreatment of the victim. In consideration of the severity of the\nvictim&#x27;s injury, expenditure with regard to grafting and\nreconstruction surgery, physical and mental pain, etc., we\nare of the opinion that the victim (Chanchal) should be\ncompensated to a tune of at least Rs 10 lakhs. Suffice it to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                   44</span>\n\n\n\n\n        say that the compensation must not only be awarded in\n        terms of the physical injury, we have also to take note of the\n        victim&#x27;s inability to lead a full life and to enjoy those\n        amenities which is being robbed of her as a result of the acid\n        attack. Therefore, this Court deems it proper to award a\n        compensation of Rs 10 lakhs and accordingly, we direct the\n        Government concerned to compensate the victim Chanchal\n        to the tune of Rs 10 lakhs, and in light of the judgment given\n        in Laxmi case3 we direct the State Government of Bihar\n        concerned to compensate the main victim&#x27;s sister, Sonam to\n        a tune of Rs 3 lakhs. Of the total amount of Rs 13 lakhs, a\n        sum of Rs 5 lakhs shall be paid to the victim and her family\n        within a period of one month and the remaining sum of Rs 8\n        lakhs shall be paid to the victims within a period of three\n        months from the date of this order. Furthermore, the State\n        shall upon itself take full responsibility for the treatment and\n        rehabilitation of the victims of acid attack as per the\n        guidelines provided in Laxmi case3, vide order dated 10-4-\n        2015.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1123786\" id=\"span_85\">54.

Their lordships have held as\nunder:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">            22. The case at hand is an example of uncivilised and\n        heartless crime committed by Respondent 2. It is completely\n        unacceptable that concept of leniency can be conceived of in\n        such a crime. A crime of this nature does not deserve any\n        kind of clemency. It is individually as well as collectively\n        intolerable. Respondent 2 might have felt that his ego had\n        been hurt by such a denial to the proposal or he might have\n        suffered a sense of hollowness to his exaggerated sense of\n        honour or might have been guided by the idea that revenge\n        is the sweetest thing that one can be wedded to when there\n        is no response to the unrequited love but, whatever may be\n        the situation, the criminal act, by no stretch of imagination,\n        deserves any leniency or mercy. Respondent 2 might have\n        suffered emotional distress by the denial, yet the said feeling\n        could not to be converted into vengeance to have the licence\n        to act in a manner like he has done.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">            23. In view of what we have stated, the approach of the\n        High Court shocks us and we have no hesitation in saying\n        so. When there is medical evidence that there was an acid\n        attack on the young girl and the circumstances having\n        brought home by cogent evidence and the conviction is given\n        the stamp of approval, there was no justification to reduce\n        the sentence to the period already undergone. We are at a\n        loss to understand whether the learned Judge has been\n        guided by some unknown notion of mercy or remaining\n        oblivious of the precedents relating to sentence or for that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                           47</span>\n\n\n\n\nmatter, not careful about the expectation of the collective\nfrom the court, for the society at large eagerly waits for\njustice to be done in accordance with law, has reduced the\nsentence. When a substantive sentence of thirty days is\nimposed, in the crime of present nature, that is, acid attack\non a young girl, the sense of justice, if we allow ourselves to\nsay so, is not only ostracised, but also is unceremoniously\nsent to &quot;Vânaprastha&quot;. It is wholly impermissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">    24. In view of our analysis, we are compelled to set aside\nthe sentence imposed by the High Court and restore that of\nthe trial court. In addition to the aforesaid, we are disposed\nto address on victim compensation. We are of the considered\nopinion that the appellant is entitled to compensation that is\nawardable to a victim under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_160\">CrPC</a>. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61901185\" id=\"span_90\">In <a href=\"/doc/61901185/\" id=\"a_161\">Ankush Shivaji\nGaikwad v.

While the State of Bihar has provided for\ncompensation of Rs 25,000 in such Scheme, the State of\nRajasthan has provided for Rs 2 lakhs of compensation. In\nour view, the compensation provided in the Scheme by most\nof the States/Union Territories is inadequate. It cannot be\noverlooked that acid attack victims need to undergo a series\nof plastic surgeries and other corrective treatments. Having\nregard to this problem, the learned Solicitor General\nsuggested to us that the compensation by the States/Union\nTerritories for acid attack victims must be enhanced to at\nleast Rs 3 lakhs as the aftercare and rehabilitation cost. The\nsuggestion of the learned Solicitor General is very fair.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">    26.

The inhibition against its deprivation extends to\n        all those limbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed.
