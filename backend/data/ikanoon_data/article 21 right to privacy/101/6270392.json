No.89 of 2009 (Crl.M.P) on the file of Judge, Family\nCourt-cum-III Additional District Judge, Warangal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">The petitioner is the husband, the second respondent is the wife and the third\nrespondent is the daughter of the second respondent.  Whereas the petitioner\nherein is the respondent, the respondents 2 and 3 herein are the petitioners in\nthe M.C. No.8 of 2009 (M.C).  For the sake of convenience, I refer the parties\nas arrayed in the M.C. before the Court below.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">The petitioners filed the M.C. to award certain amounts towards their\nmaintenance against the respondent on the ground that he being the husband of\nthe first of them and father of the second of them, neglected and deserted them\nwithout lawful cause while they got no means to maintain themselves.  It is the\nclaim of the respondent in the M.C. that the first petitioner is guilty of\nadultery and the second petitioner was not born to him whereas she was born to\nthe first petitioner by virtue of her adultery with a different male person by\nreason of which he got no responsibility to provide any maintenance to the\nsecond petitioner.  In that context he filed the Crl.M.P under <a href=\"/doc/1709250/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 12</a> of the\nFamily Courts Act, 1984 read with <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 45</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\nbefore the Court below seeking to send the second petitioner for DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) test for the purpose of determining as to whether he happened to\nbe her natural father for the purpose of awarding necessary maintenance to her\nas pleaded in the M.C against him on which the Court below passed the following\norder.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Perused the petition and counter.  As per Section 45 of Evidence Act, 112 of\nEvidence Act, 120 of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_5\">Evidence Act</a>, this Court cannot compel the party to go for\nDNA test.  Accordingly the petition is dismissed&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1378226\" id=\"span_1\">Learned counsel for the respondent would contend that by virtue of Order\nXXXIX Rules 1 and 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">CPC</a>, for the purpose of dredging the actual paternity of the\nsecond petitioner, necessary orders are to be passed by the Court for subjecting\nher to necessary DNA test.  He further contends that if the second petitioner\nrefuses to submit herself for medical examination, an adverse inference can be\ndrawn against her within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act.  It is\nalso contended by him that if an order is passed giving directions to carry out\ncertain tests, non-implementation of the order will have the tendency of making\nthe law and the Court, a laughing stock.  According to him, under those\nprinciples, necessary force can also be applied against the person for the\nimplementation of the order for having effective adjudication of the matter.  He\nhas drawn the attention of this Court to a decision of Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1378226/\" id=\"a_8\">Rohit\nShekhar v Narayan Dutt Tiwari1</a>, in which it is observed that the first\nrespondent therein against whom such an order was passed should obey the order \nand if he continues to defy the order, necessary police assistance and\nreasonable force for the compliance thereof should be taken or applied.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_2\">Learned\ncounsel also has relied upon, in this context, the decision of the Apex Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_9\">Sharda v Dharmpal2</a>, in which it is observed under similar circumstances that an\norder of subjecting the second respondent therein for DNA test can be passed to\nachieve necessary object and if the order is not obeyed an adverse inference can\nbe drawn.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">On the other hand, learned counsel for the petitioners would contend that\ncompelling the second petitioner to undergo DNA test against her consent is\nagainst the principle of testimonial compulsion as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a>\nof the Constitution of India, which therefore cannot be permitted.\nTherefore it is to be seen as to whether the order passed by the Court below in\nrejecting the plea of the respondent to send the petitioner for DNA test in the\ncircumstances of the case is reasonable and tenable or not, and whether\nnecessary steps are to be taken for doing so to have the evidence of real\npaternity of the second respondent besides the question of paying maintenance to\nher against the respondent even using force and against her consent.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_11\">Sharda</a> case a question was considered as to whether an application filed\nseeking for sending the wife concerned (appellant) therein for medical\nexamination, with regards to her unsoundness of mind said to be incurable, in\nthe context of granting divorce to her husband under <a href=\"/doc/1882893/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 12(1)</a>((b) and\n13(1)(iii) of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_13\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a> could be entertained.  It was\ncontended on behalf of the appellant therein also that the enquiry court got no\njurisdiction to issue such directions as it would be violative of right to\npersonal liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  In\nthat context, the Apex Court has held as follows.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">...     The matter may be considered from another angle. In all such matrimonial\ncases where divorce is sought, say on the ground of impotency,\nschizophrenia...etc. normally without there being medical examination, it would\nbe difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made by his\nspouse against the other spouses seeking divorce on such a ground, is correct or\nnot. In order to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would always\ninsist on medical examination. If respondent avoids such medical examination on\nthe ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or for a matter right to\npersonal liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India,\nthen it may in most of such cases become impossible to arrive at a conclusion.\nIt may render the very grounds on which divorce is permissible nugatory.\nTherefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution of India and with the extensive interpretation of the\nphrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be\ntreated as absolute right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on this\nright have to be imposed and particularly where two competing interests clash.\nIn mattes of aforesaid nature where the legislature has conferred a right upon\nhis spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it would be the right of that spouse\nwhich comes in conflict with the so-called right to privacy of the respondent.\nThus the Court has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing the\ninterests involved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">...  If for arriving at the satisfaction of the Court and to protect the right\nof a party to the lis who may otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting\nhis own interest, the Court passes an appropriate order, the question of such\naction being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India would not\narise. The Court having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India must\nalso see to it that the right of a person to defend himself must be adequately\nprotected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">... However, the Court should exercise such a power if the applicant has a\nstrong prima facie case and there is sufficient material before the Court. If\ndespite the order of the court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to\nmedical examination, the court will be entitled to draw an adverse inference\nagainst him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">        Thereby this decision categorically contemplates that the right guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> cannot be treated as absolute right.  There must be some\nlimitations to be imposed on that right particularly where two competing\ninterests clash.  With regards to the question of divorce where the Legislature\nhas conferred a right upon one of the spouses to seek on such grounds, it would\nbe the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the so called right to\nthe privacy of the other spouse by reason of which the Court concerned has to\nreconcile those competing interests by balancing the interests involved.\nTherefore for arriving at the satisfaction of the Court and to protect the right\nof a party to the lis who may be otherwise be capable of protecting his interest\nif the Court passes an appropriate order the question of such an action being\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> would not arise at all. Further if despite the order of\nthe Court the spouse against whom such an order is passed to undergo necessary  \ntests refuses to submit himself or herself for medical examination, the Court\nwill be entitled to draw an adverse inference against him.  In that context, the\nquestion of forcing the spouse to undergo necessary test was not under\nconsideration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">        The Supreme Court and High Courts have rendered in various decisions\nconsidering the concept of testimonial compulsion that sending a person for DNA\nor other medical test is within the powers of the Courts to do so as noted\nbelow.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120342440\" id=\"span_4\">The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/120342440/\" id=\"a_22\">H.M.

It is\nfurther observed that keeping in view the prolonged factum of litigation\nresulting in the passing of a decree in favour of a litigant, a rational\napproach is necessitated and the policy of law is to give a fair and liberal,\nand not a technical construction, enabling the decree-holder to reap the fruits\nof his decree.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_7\">The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_25\">Selvi v State of Karnataka6</a>, while sitting over judgment of\na single Judge, has upheld the authority of Civil Court to order a medical\nexamination in exercise of the inherent powers vested in it by <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 151</a> of\nthe CPC, though held that the same reasoning cannot be applied in the criminal\ncontext (Para 175). Rather (in Para 203) it is held that compelled extraction of\nblood samples in the course of a medical examination does not amount to &quot;conduct\nthat shocks the conscience&quot; and that &quot;use of force as may be reasonably\nnecessary is mandated by law and hence it meets the threshold of procedure\nestablished by law&quot;. The learned Single Judge has In paras 74, 78, 79 and 80 of\nthe impugned judgment has held that the right of privacy is subject to such\naction as may be lawfully taken for the protection of rights of others; that the\nlevel of privacy depends on the context; that Human Rights law justifies\ncarrying out of compulsory and mandatory medical examination which may be bodily \ninvasive and that the right to privacy is not an absolute right and can be\nreasonably curtailed. The learned Single Judge having held so, we are unable to\nfathom as to how the same factors could be an impediment to the enforceability\nand implementability of the order. What is not an impediment to the making of\nthe order, cannot become an impediment to the enforceability of the order and\nwould tantamount to saying that the court order is violative of the rights of\nthe litigant.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255258\" id=\"span_8\">The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/255258/\" id=\"a_27\">State of Haryana v State of Punjab7</a>, has held that the\nresiduary powers under <a href=\"/doc/379241/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 51(e)</a> Cr.PC allow a Court to pass orders for\nenforcing a decree in a manner which would give effect to it.

The object is to compel a man to perform the\nmoral obligation which he owes to society in respect of his wife, children and\nparents so that they are not left beggared and destituted on the scrap-heap of\nsociety and thereby driven to a life of vagrancy, immortality and crime for\ntheir subsistence.  The jurisdiction of the Magistrate is preventive and not\nremedial and certainly not punitive.  The scope is limited and orders passed by\nthe Court as <a href=\"/doc/1840939/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 127(2)</a> Cr.PC expressly provides, are subject to any final\nadjudication by a civil court regarding status and civil rights.  Having a\nsocial purpose, <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 125</a> Cr.PC and sister clauses in their interpretation\nmust receive a compassionate expanse of the sense that the words permit.  In\nthis generous jurisdiction, a broader perception and appreciation of facts and\ntheir bearing must govern the verdict not chopping little logic or tinkering\nwith burden of proof.  The objection of the section is to prevent destitution on\npublic grounds and vagrancy.  <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 125</a> Cr.PC is only a speedy remedy against\nstarvation of a deserted wife or child or indigent parents.  It is a summary\nprocedure which does not cover entirely the same grounds as the civil liability\nof a husband or father or son under his personal law to maintain his wife or\nchild or parents.  Thereby it is clear that the proceedings are purely civil in\nnature for which the relevant provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_53\">Cr.PC</a> are made applicable.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the criminal petition is allowed.\nMiscellaneous petitions pending if any shall stand closed.\n__________________________________      \n(G.
