He has commended us to paragraphs 21 and 22 of <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_9\">the\n\nsaid judgment</a> which we think appropriate to reproduce:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         “21. Gender identity is one of the most-fundamental\n         aspects of life which refers to a person’s intrinsic\n         sense of being male, female or transgender or\n         transsexual person. A person’s sex is usually\n         assigned at birth, but a relatively small group of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\fWP(Crl.)No.76/2016                        3</span>\n\n         persons may born with bodies which incorporate both\n         or   certain  aspects   of   both   male  and   female\n         physiology. At times, genital anatomy problems may\n         arise in certain persons, their innate perception of\n         themselves, is not in conformity with the sex\n         assigned to them at birth and may include pre and\n         post-operative transsexual persons and also persons\n         who do not choose to undergo or do not have access to\n         operation and also include persons who cannot undergo\n         successful operation. Countries, all over the world,\n         including India, are grappled with the question of\n         attribution of gender to persons who believe that\n         they belong to the opposite sex. Few persons\n         undertake surgical and other procedures to alter\n         their bodies and physical appearance to acquire\n         gender characteristics of the sex which conform to\n         their perception of gender, leading to legal and\n         social complications since official record of their\n         gender at birth is found to be at variance with the\n         assumed gender identity. Gender identity refers to\n         each person’s deeply felt internal and individual\n         experience of gender, which may or may not correspond\n         with the sex assigned at birth, including the\n         personal sense of the body which may involve a freely\n         chosen,   modification   of   bodily   appearance   or\n         functions by medical, surgical or other means and\n         other expressions of gender, including dress, speech\n         and mannerisms. Gender identity, therefore, refers to\n         an individual’s self-identification as a man, woman,\n         transgender or other identified category.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         22. Sexual orientation refers to an individual’s\n         enduring   physical,      romantic    and/or    emotional\n         attraction to another person. Sexual orientation\n         includes transgender and gender-variant people with\n         heavy sexual orientation and their sexual orientation\n         may or may not change during or after gender\n         transmission,   which    also    includes  homo-sexuals,\n         bysexuals,    heterosexuals,     asexual   etc.    Gender\n         identity   and    sexual     orientation,    as   already\n         indicated, are different concepts. Each person’s\n         self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity\n         is integral to their personality and is one of the\n         most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and\n         freedom and no one shall be forced to undergo medical\n         procedures, including SRS, sterilization or hormonal\n         therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of\n         their gender identity.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89477319\" id=\"span_12\">Mr.Datar has also drawn inspiration from the Nine-Judge\n\nBench decision in Justice K.S.Puttaswamy (Retd.) and <a href=\"/doc/89477319/\" id=\"a_10\">another vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\fWP(Crl.)No.76/2016                       4</span>\n\nUnoin of India and others</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1, wherein the majority\n\ndealing with Suresh Kumar Kaushal&#x27;s case has expressed the view\n\nthus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        “144. Neither of the above reasons can be regarded as a\n        valid constitutional basis for disregarding a claim based\n        on privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. That “a\n        miniscule   fraction   of   the   country’s   pop  ulation\n        constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders” (as\n        observed in the judgment of this Court) is not a\n        sustainable basis to deny the right to privacy. The\n        purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of\n        guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their\n        exercise   from   the  disdain   of   majorities,  whether\n        legislative or popular. The guarantee of constitutional\n        rights does not depend upon their exercise being\n        favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion. The test of\n        popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to\n        disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of\n        constitutional protection. Discrete and insular minorities\n        face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason\n        that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord\n        with the ‘mainstream’. Yet in a democratic Constitution\n        founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as\n        those conferred on other citizens to protect their\n        freedoms and liberties. Sexual orientation is an essential\n        attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual\n        on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to\n        the dignity and self-worth of the individual. Equality\n        demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in\n        society must be protected on an even platform. The right\n        to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at\n        the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles\n        14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_13\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        145.    The view in Koushal that the High Court had\n        erroneously relied upon international precedents “in its\n        anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons”\n        is similarly, in our view, unsustainable. The rights of\n        the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population\n        cannot be construed to be “so-called rights”. The\n        expression “so-called” seems to suggest the exercise of a\n        liberty in the garb of a right which is illusory. This is\n        an inappropriate construction of the privacy based claims\n        of the LGBT population. Their rights are not “so-called”\n        but are real rights founded on sound constitutional\n        doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in\n        privacy and dignity. They constitute the essence of\n        liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an essential\n        component of identity. Equal protection demands protection\n        of    the   identity    of   every    individual   without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\fWP(Crl.)No.76/2016                              5</span>\n\n      discrimination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      146 The    decision    in    Koushal    presents    a    de\n      minimisrationale when it asserts that there have been only\n      two hundred prosecutions for violating <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 377</a>. The de\n      minimishypothesis is misplaced because the invasion of a\n      fundamental right is not rendered tolerable when a few, as\n      opposed to a large number of persons, are subjected to\n      hostile treatment. The reason why such acts of hostile\n      discrimination   are  constitutionally   impermissible   is\n      because of the chilling effect which they have on the\n      exercise of the fundamental right in the first place. For\n      instance, pre-publication   restraints such as censorship\n      are vulnerable because they discourage people from\n      exercising their right to free speech because of the fear\n      of a restraint coming into operation. The chilling effect\n      on the exercise of the right poses a grave danger to the\n      unhindered fulfilment of one’s sexual orientation, as an\n      element of privacy and dignity. The chilling effect is due\n      to the danger of a human being subjected to social\n      opprobrium or disapproval, as reflected in the punishment\n      of crime. Hence the Koushal rationale that prosecution of\n      a few is not an index of violation is flawed and cannot be\n      accepted. Consequently, we disagree with the manner in\n      which Koushal has dealt with the privacy –dignity based\n      claims of LGBT persons on this aspect.”\n\n     Be    it   noted,    the   said   decision      did   not   deal    with    the\n\nconstitutional       validity   of   <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_16\">Section   377</a>   IPC   as    the    matter   was\n\npending before the larger Bench.               The matter which was pending\n\nbefore the larger Bench is a Curative Petition which stands on a\n\ndifferent footing. In this regard, Mr.Datar has also referred to\n\nparagraph 647 of the judgment of the concurring opinion. It is as\n\nfollows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_15\">“647. There are two aspects of the opinion of Dr. D.Y.\n          Chandrachud,J., one of which is common to the opinion of\n          Rohinton F. Nariman,J., needing specific mention. While\n          considering    the     evolution    of    Constitutional\n          jurisprudence on the right of privacy he has referred to\n          the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_17\">Suresh Kumar Koushal Vs. Naz Foundation</a>.\n          In the challenge laid to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal\n          Code before the Delhi High Court, one of the grounds of\n          challenge was that the said provision amounted to an\n          infringement of the right to dignity and privacy. The\n          Delhi High Court, inter alia, observed that the right to\n          live with dignity and the right of privacy both are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\fWP(Crl.)No.76/2016                       6</span>\n\n        recognized    as  dimensions   of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article   21</a>   of   the\n        Constitution of India. The view of the High Court,\n        however did not find favour with the Supreme Court and\n        it was observed that only a miniscule fraction of the\n        country’s    population   constitutes   lesbians,    gays,\n        bisexuals or transgenders and thus, there cannot be any\n        basis for declaring the Section ultra virus of\n        provisions    of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles   14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_21\">,  15</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">21</a>   of   the\n        Constitution. The matter did not rest at this, as the\n        issue of privacy and dignity discussed by the High Court\n        was also observed upon. The sexual orientation even\n        within the four walls of the house thus became an aspect\n        of debate. I am in agreement with the view of Dr. D.Y.\n        Chandrachud, J., who in paragraphs 123 &amp; 124 of his\n        judgment, states that the right of privacy cannot be\n        denied, even if there is a miniscule fraction of the\n        population which is affected. The majoritarian concept\n        does not apply to Constitutional rights and the Courts\n        are often called up on to take what may be categorized\n        as a non-majorit arian view, in the check and balance of\n        power envisaged under the Constitution of India. Ones\n        sexual orientation is undoubtedly an attribute of\n        privacy.</span> The observations made in Mosley vs. News Group\n        Papers Ltd., in a broader concept may be usefully\n        referred to:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">              “130...

Or was it necessary because the\n                information, in the words of the Strasbourg\n                court in Von Hannover at (60) and (76), would\n                make a contribution to “a debate of general\n                interest”? That is, of course, a very high\n                test, it is yet to be determined how far that\n                doctrine will be taken in the courts of this\n                jurisdiction in relation to photography in\n                public places. If taken literally, it would\n                mean a very significant change in what is\n                permitted. It would have a profound effect on\n                the tabloid and celebrity culture to which we\n                have become accustomed in recent years.”\n\n\n       The submission advanced by Mr.Datar is that privacy of the\n\nindividual having been put on such a pedestal and, in the                          <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_24\">National\n\nLegal    Service     Authority</a>&#x27;s      case(supra)           (popularly     known    as     the\n\ntransgender&#x27;s        case),     sexual      orientation         has    been   emphasised,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 377</a> IPC cannot be construed as a reasonable restriction as\n\nthat has the potentiality to destroy the individual autonomy and\n\nsexual orientation. It is an accepted principle of interpretation\n\nof   statutes    that      a   provision         does   not   become    unconstitutional\n\nbecause    there     can   be    abuse      of    the   same.      Similarly       though   a\n\nprovision of the statute book is not invoked on many occasions, it\n\ndoes not fall into the sphere of Doctrine of Desuetude.</span>                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_19\"><a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_26\">Suresh\n\nKumar Kaushal</a>&#x27;s case has been guided by that.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">              Certain other aspects need to be noted.                     <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\nuses    the   phraseology       “carnal      intercourse        against    the     order    of\n\nnature”.      The determination of order of nature is not a constant\n\nphenomenon.      Social morality also changes from age to age.                      The law\n\ncopes with life and accordingly change takes place. The morality\n\nthat public perceives, the Constitution may not conceive of. The\n\nindividual      autonomy       and   also    individual         orientation      cannot     be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\fWP(Crl.)No.76/2016                                 8</span>\n\natrophied unless the restriction is regarded as reasonable to yield\n\nto the morality of the Constitution.                What is natural to one may\n\nnot be natural to the other but the said natural orientation and\n\nchoice cannot be allowed to cross the boundaries of law and as the\n\nconfines   of    law    cannot     tamper   or     curtail   the   inherent    right\n\nembedded in an individual under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.                    A\n\nsection of people or individuals who exercise their choice should\n\nnever remain in a state of fear.                 When we say so, we may not be\n\nunderstood to have stated that there should not be fear of law\n\nbecause fear of law builds civilised society. But that law must\n\nhave the acceptability of the Constitutional parameters.                  That is\n\nthe litmus test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_21\">It is necessary to note, in the course of hearing on a\n\nquery being made and Mr.Datar very fairly stated that he does not\n\nintend to challenge that part of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 377</a> which relates to\n\ncarnal intercourse with animals and that apart, he confines to\n\nconsenting acts between two adults.               As far as the first aspect is\n\nconcerned, that is absolutely beyond debate.                 As far as the second\n\naspect is concerned, that needs to be debated.                The consent between\n\ntwo   adults    has    to   be   the   primary    pre-condition.    Otherwise    the\n\nchildren would become prey, and protection of the children in all\n\nspheres has to be guarded and protected.               Taking all the apsects in\n\na cumulative manner, we are of the view, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_30\">Suresh\n\nKumar Kaushal</a>&#x27;s case (supra) requires re-consideration.
