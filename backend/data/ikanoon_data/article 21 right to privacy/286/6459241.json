This order will dispose of CWP Nos.5248 and 5254\n\nof 2010 as both the petitions involve identical issue of validity\n\nof detention of goods by the custom authorities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">2.         In CWP No.5248 of 2010, case of the petitioner is\n\nthat it imported material in question i.e. Processed Distillate\n\nOil in January-February 2010 and filed Bill of Entry under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1982368/\" id=\"a_1\">section 46</a> of the Customs Act, 1962 (for short, &#x27;the Act&#x27;). The\n\npetitioner sought clearance of the goods for home consumption\n\non payment of import duty. The officers of the department\n\nphysically verified the goods and took samples for the purpose\n\nof making assessment of duty under <a href=\"/doc/354004/\" id=\"a_2\">section 17</a> of the Act.\n\nThere was also correspondence between the petitioner and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> CWP No.5254 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                    2</span>\n\n\ndepartment.     Thereafter,   the   goods   were   seized   vide\n\nPanchnamas Annexures P.6 to P.8, P.10 and P.11 between\n\n12.3.2010 to 19.3.2010.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">3.         The petitioner sought release of goods pointing out\n\nthat examination of goods had already taken place and there\n\nwas no justification for seizure of the goods. It was also\n\npointed out that detention of goods was resulting in demurrage\n\ncharges. Even Deputy Commission, Customs wrote to the\n\nAdditional Director, DRI vide letter dated 18.3.2010,\n\nAnnexure P.11 that samples having already been taken, the\n\nparty was suffering heavy demurrage on account of            non\n\nclearance of consignment and, therefore, the goods may be\n\nreleased, unless required for examination or re-examination. It\n\nwas also mentioned that bill of entry had already been assessed\n\nprovisionally by the proper officer. Still, the goods were not\n\nreleased. Accordingly, this petition was filed in this Court on\n\n22.3.2010 stating that the goods were being illegally detained.\n\nReliance was also placed on instructions Annexure P.12 dated\n\n22.8.2006 to the effect that first examination of goods should\n\ntake place in 48 hours and assessment should be done within\n\n24 hours thereafter. If it was necessary to detain the goods, the\n\nimporter must be intimated so that he may shift the goods to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> CWP No.5254 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                       3</span>\n\n\nbonded warehouse under <a href=\"/doc/12990/\" id=\"a_3\">section 49</a> of the Act. Goods may be\n\nprovisionally released and decision to release goods should be\n\ntaken within five days      after the presentation of bill of entry.\n\nExceptions were of prohibited goods or fraudulent practices.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4.         Facts in CWP No.5254 of 2010 are identical.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.         In the reply filed on behalf of the Directorate of\n\nRevenue Intelligence, stand taken is that the goods had been\n\ndetained by the DRI on 23.2.2010 and the importer was\n\ninformed that the goods could be kept in bonded warehouse\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/12990/\" id=\"a_4\">section 49</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6.         We have heard learned counsel for the parties and\n\nperused the record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">7.         Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the\n\ngoods are being detained for the last about three months and it\n\nwas only on April 7, 2010 that counsel for the respondents\n\nmade a statement that the goods could be shifted to the\n\ngodown of the petitioner under the seal of the respondents.\n\nMere shifting of goods to the godown of the petitioner was no\n\nrelief as the goods could not be dealt with as the petitioner may\n\nlike to. The petitioner was, thus, suffering loss. Action of the\n\nrespondents was without any valid justification. The said\n\naction amounted to seizure without following the statutory\n\nsafeguards. It was submitted that though, power of seizure may\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> CWP No.5254 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                       4</span>\n\n\nbe exercised for advancing the object of law, the same could\n\nnot be allowed to be misused without there being any prima-\n\nfacie case and without following the prescribed procedure. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1014484\" id=\"span_4\">The\n\nundervaluation could be taken care of by assessment or\n\nprovisional assessment and unless the goods are prohibited\n\ngoods, the power of seizure could not be exercised so as to\n\ndeprive the importer of use of goods for a long time. It is not\n\nthe case of the respondents that the goods are prohibited goods.\n\nAs per letter dated 17.4.2010, a copy of which was produced at\n\nthe time of hearing, only allegation of the DRI was that dispute\n\nwas about classification of goods. Reliance has been placed on\n\njudgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1014484/\" id=\"a_5\">Mapsa Tapes Private Limited vs.\n\nUnion of India</a>, 2006(201) ELT 7, wherein it was observed:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                  &quot;14.It is well-settled that power of search and\n                  seizure has to be conceded in the larger interest\n                  of the society and to check evasion of tax..

Statutory regulation in this behalf is\n                       necessary and reasonable restriction cannot\n                       per se be considered to be unconstitutional.\n                       The damage, if any, caused by such\n                       temporary interference if found to be in\n                       excess of legal authority is a matter for\n                       redress in other proceedings.

As\n\nheld in Mapsa Tapes, exercise of power of seizure requires\n\nrecording of reasons before exercise of such power. Only\n\nquestion is whether detention could be justified pending\n\nclearance under <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_25\">Chapter VII of the Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/657135/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 47</a> of the Act\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> CWP No.5254 of 2010 (O&amp;M)                                    9</span>\n\n\nprovides for clearance of goods on payment of duty, unless\n\ngoods are prohibited goods.

It is also not their\n\ncase that duty assessed under <a href=\"/doc/354004/\" id=\"a_27\">section 17</a> or 18 has not been\n\npaid. In such a situation, non clearance of goods may be\n\njustified for minimum period required for assessment. In no\n\ncase, non clearance of goods for months can be justified. Non\n\nclearance seriously affects rights of lawful importer and fair\n\nprocedure being constitutional mandate, no authority can plead\n\nunlimited power of non clearance for its own incompetence as\n\na justification beyond reasonable period. Learned counsel for\n\nthe respondents submitted that the petitioners could get the\n\ngoods released on furnishing requisite bond under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_28\">section\n\n110A</a> of the Act.
