At the outset, an option was given to the parties\n\n     whether the main writ petition would be taken\n\n     up for hearing or the prayer for interim orders\n\n     was to be heard. Most of the respondents chose\n\n     to use affidavits and insisted that the latter\n\n     option be resorted to. Hence, for the sake of fair\n\n     trial, the matter is being heard on the question\n\n     of   interim    orders,      although     the    lengthy\n\n     arguments advanced over several days and the\n\n     numerous       judgments      cited     necessitates   a\n\n     lengthy discourse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.   The writ petition has been filed by a lady who is\n\n     the wife of a politician. The petitioner is an OCI\n\n     (Overseas Citizenship of India) card-holder and\n\n     not an Indian citizen. It is alleged by the\n\n     petitioner that the media in general and the\n\n     respondents       in       particular     have     been\n\n     assassinating her character and maligning her\n\n     family   by    regularly     publishing     information\n\n     regarding an investigation being carried out by\n\n     the central investigating agencies, including the\n\n     Enforcement Directorate (for short, &quot;the ED&quot;)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  3</span>\n\n\n\n\n     which     is    one    of       the     respondents        herein\n\n     regarding financial and other scams of some\n\n     magnitude.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.   The present challenge is primarily on three\n\n     grounds:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.   First, the petitionerâ€Ÿs right to privacy, which is\n\n     a component of her fundamental right to live\n\n     with dignity, is being assailed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.   Secondly,       fair   trial      is    being       affected.    A\n\n     subsidiary ground of the same is that there is\n\n     an element of criminal contempt of court, since\n\n     the investigation will lead to a criminal trial\n\n     which is being attempted to interfered with.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">6.   Thirdly, the media trial which is going on is\n\n     moulding         public          opinion           by      serving\n\n     sensationalism         in   the        garb   of    true    news,\n\n     thereby        providing        false     information           and\n\n     opinions to the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_3\">7.

The range of his\n\n     assertions, criticisms or comments is as wide\n\n     as and no wider than of any other subject and\n\n     no privilege attaches to his position as a\n\n     journalist.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"561739\" id=\"span_6\">9.

The public platform, it\n\n    was observed, is not a place for such debate or\n\n    proof of what otherwise is the exclusive domain\n\n    and function of courts of law.            Such debate or\n\n    discussions touching upon matters which are\n\n    in the domain of courts would amount to direct\n\n    interference in the administration of criminal\n\n    justice, the Supreme Court observed.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                            12</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18. Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for\n\n    the Union of India/respondent no.1 submits\n\n    that there are grievance redressal mechanisms\n\n    and    bodies      incorporated      for   redressing\n\n    grievances    regarding     broadcasting     and   the\n\n    operation of the media and hands over a list of\n\n    grievance       redressal          mechanism/bodies\n\n    incorporated vide the amended Rules of 2021\n\n    on such score. It is highlighted that there are\n\n    several levels of grievance redressal mechanism\n\n    regarding broadcast. Self-regulation by media,\n\n    it is submitted, is sufficient alternative remedy\n\n    in such context.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">19.

It is submitted that the FIR lodged against the\n\n    petitionerâ€Ÿs husband are under various Sections\n\n    of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">Indian Penal Code</a>.          They stand on an\n\n    independent     footing     and,     as    such,   the\n\n    petitioner cannot in the garb of this writ\n\n    petition, seek any order regarding protection of\n\n    her husband, who is the accused in such cases.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">21. Learned DSG also relies on the notification\n\n    dated March 4, 2021 issued by the Ministry of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     13</span>\n\n\n\n\n    Home      Affairs        of    the   Government          of        India\n\n    regarding Oversees Citizens of India (OCI) card\n\n    holders.     It     is        pointed   out    that       in        the\n\n    explanation thereto, the OCI card holder is\n\n    stipulated to be a foreign national holding\n\n    passport of a foreign country and not a citizen\n\n    of India. Thus, it is argued that the petitioner\n\n    does not have the locus standi to seek a\n\n    curtailment of the freedom of press under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India, which is\n\n    available only to citizens of India. It is argued\n\n    that such curtailment can only be under the\n\n    provisions of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">22. Learned DSG also contends that this Court\n\n    does not have determination and refers to a\n\n    notification dated September 30, 2022 which\n\n    provides, inter alia, that matters relating to CBI\n\n    and Central Agencies in writ petitions under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India are\n\n    already    included            within   the    comprehensive\n\n    reading    of     subject        category     â€žPoliceâ€Ÿ        in    the\n\n    Appellate Side Rules, therefore, there is no need\n\n    to   mention         CBI         and    Central          Agencies\n\n    separately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">23. Learned     senior            counsel   appearing         for       the\n\n    respondent nos. 10 to 12 contends that nothing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                            14</span>\n\n\n\n\n    has been produced to show that any derogatory\n\n    remarks were carried by the said respondents\n\n    in any news item against the petitioner.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for\n\n    the respondent no.4-ED, apart from adopting\n\n    the submissions of his counter-part appearing\n\n    for the UOI vehemently denies that the ED\n\n    officials   leak     any    information   relating\n\n    investigation.     It is stressed that the ED only\n\n    releases formal Press statements, most of which\n\n    are also available on the website of the ED.\n\n    The written instruction delineating the exact\n\n    extent of dissemination of such information by\n\n    the Ed is also handed over and kept on record.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">25.

The court\n\n    can only insulate the witnesses up to an extent\n\n    and control the release of leads, information\n\n    and gossip to the Press by police officers,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                            15</span>\n\n\n\n\n    witnesses and the counsel for both sides, if\n\n    such information is inaccurate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">26.

Learned senior counsel also cites the judgment\n\n    delivered in Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&#x27;s\n\n    case reported at AIR 1920 Bom 175 by a Full\n\n    Bench of the Bombay High Court on March 12,\n\n    1920. Where the Full Bench observed that\n\n    speaking generally, it is not permissible to\n\n    publish comments on or extracts from any\n\n    pending proceedings in the Court, unless the\n\n    leave of the Court is first obtained.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">28. Discussing Rex v. Parke , the court observed\n\n    that the reason why the publication of articles\n\n    like those with which the court was dealing is\n\n    treated as a contempt of Court is because of\n\n    their tendency and sometimes object to deprive\n\n    the Court of the power of doing that which is\n\n    the    end   for   which    it   exists,   namely,   to\n\n    administer justice duly, impartially, and with\n\n    reference solely to the facts judicially brought\n\n    before it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">29. The court observed that a contempt of court of\n\n    a     more   serious   nature     is   committed     in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                              16</span>\n\n\n\n\n    commenting in the particular manner of the\n\n    letter produced therein which amounted the\n\n    scandalising a District Judge. In the opinion of\n\n    the     court,    contempt        is    committed     if   the\n\n    comments tend to interfere with a fair trial and\n\n    to prejudice public justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">30. It is argued that such high test has not been\n\n    satisfied in the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">31. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent\n\n    no.21 places reliance on a judgment of a\n\n    Division Bench of the Delhi High Court for the\n\n    purpose      of    pointing       out    that   the   actual\n\n    addresses of Google India were given therein. It\n\n    is argued that the respondent no.21 has been\n\n    incorrectly arrayed, since YouTube and Google\n\n    India    are      separate    entities.         The   parent\n\n    company for both is Google LLC, which is\n\n    situated outside India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">32. The     respondents,         in    general,     adopt      the\n\n    arguments of each other and pray for the\n\n    dismissal of the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">33. The objections as to maintainability are taken\n\n    up first. The Union of India and the ED have\n\n    raised a question as to whether this Bench has\n\n    determination to take up the matter, since\n\n    there are allegations against central agencies.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                             17</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">34. Such contention is misplaced. As per the roster\n\n    determined by the Honâ€Ÿble the Chief Justice,\n\n    who is the master of the roster, writ petitions\n\n    pertaining to police inaction are assigned to\n\n    another    Bench.   A    sub-category     of    matters\n\n    relating to â€žPoliceâ€Ÿ, as per the circulations\n\n    relating   to   determination,   is    writ    petitions\n\n    against the â€žcentral agenciesâ€Ÿ. However, such\n\n    matters must essentially pertain to inaction or\n\n    overaction of the police or central agencies in\n\n    exercise of their functions and authority. If any\n\n    and every matter containing allegations against\n\n    instrumentalities of the Union Government or\n\n    â€žcentral agenciesâ€Ÿ is classified under â€žpolice\n\n    inactionâ€Ÿ category, the Bench taking up such\n\n    matters would be the only Bench taking up all\n\n    writ petitions against the Union of India or its\n\n    instrumentalities and agencies, which would be\n\n    an absurd proposition and an antithesis of the\n\n    distribution of business among writ courts\n\n    under all the other classifications.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">35. Police inaction is a sub-category under the\n\n    Residuary Jurisdiction under Group IX of the\n\n    writ matter classifications. This Bench has\n\n    determination     regarding   all     residuary    writ\n\n    matters apart from those pertaining to â€žPoliceâ€Ÿ.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                           18</span>\n\n\n\n\n    The present matter does not pertain directly to\n\n    the   investigation   or   action/inaction    of     the\n\n    central agencies but only to alleged press\n\n    releases and media bytes given by the ED as\n\n    well as information allegedly leaked by the ED\n\n    officials to the public, thereby violating the\n\n    fundamental rights of the petitioner, which is\n\n    by no stretch of imagination a â€žpolice inactionâ€Ÿ\n\n    matter. Thus, the matter is taken up by this\n\n    court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">36. The other objection regarding maintainability is\n\n    that the petitioner, being a foreign national\n\n    (Thai citizen) and OCI card holder, is not\n\n    entitled to seek curtailment of the right of the\n\n    respondents,    which      are   Indian   citizens    or\n\n    organizations run by Indian citizens, to freedom\n\n    of speech and expression under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19</a> of\n\n    the   Constitution    of     India.   However,       the\n\n    judgments cited on such count relate to the\n\n    rights guaranteed under various clauses of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19</a> itself. It has been observed by the\n\n    Supreme Court in the said reports that the\n\n    right to freedom of speech and expression\n\n    overrides the other freedoms given under Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">    19. However, here the petitioner is asserting\n\n    her right to privacy, which is an integral\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                             19</span>\n\n\n\n\n    component of her right to live with dignity as\n\n    enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\n    India and her right to equality before the law as\n\n    guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14.</a> Thus, the question is\n\n    essentially of the interplay between different\n\n    Articles in Part III of the Constitution and not\n\n    Article 19 inter se.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">37. It is to be noted in this context that whereas\n\n    the language of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19</a> denotes that the said\n\n    rights are given only to citizens of India, the\n\n    rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">14</a> are\n\n    not restricted to citizens but are applicable to\n\n    anybody    and      everybody.   Several       judgments\n\n    cited by the petitioner hold as much. Thus,\n\n    there cannot be any doubt that even if the\n\n    petitioner is not an Indian â€žcitizenâ€Ÿ but only an\n\n    OCI card holder, she is equally entitled to seek\n\n    protection of her fundamental rights sought in\n\n    the present writ petition as any full-fledged\n\n    citizen of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">38. Another aspect is required to be kept in mind.\n\n    The fundamental rights embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Articles 21</a>\n\n    and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">14</a> are not conferred by the Constitution as\n\n    such, but are basic and implicit human rights\n\n    guaranteed in any civilized society worth the\n\n    name.   The    Constitution      of   India,    like   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                 20</span>\n\n\n\n\n    Constitutions and Charters of Rights of several\n\n    other nations and international communities,\n\n    merely recognizes such implicit human rights.\n\n    Thus, the said rights have a universal air and\n\n    cannot be restricted by any Legislature or\n\n    Judiciary only to the citizens of a country.\n\n    Hence, the objection as to maintainability on\n\n    such score is turned down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">39. As    to    other   statutes,       there    is   no   statute\n\n    governing all aspects of the media as such.\n\n    Although there are certain self-regulatory Acts\n\n    and Regulations in place here and there which\n\n    provide forums for grievances and seek to\n\n    control activities of the media, there is no\n\n    comprehensive statute which stipulates the\n\n    yardstick of such control, particularly when the\n\n    larger issue of violation of fundamental rights\n\n    by    the    media     is    alleged.       Moreover,    such\n\n    statutes operate in pockets such as cable\n\n    television,     etc.    but      are        not   universally\n\n    applicable to the internet and all other media.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">40. Hence, the writ petition is maintainable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">41. The    respondents          claim    their    rights    under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. It is argued that\n\n    the said rights cannot be curtailed even by\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Such a blanket\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                              21</span>\n\n\n\n\n    norm, taken to its logical conclusion, would\n\n    mean that freedom of speech and expression\n\n    overrides the right to life. Dead men do not\n\n    speak.     Thus,   the   freedom    of   speech    and\n\n    expression cannot under normal circumstances\n\n    curb the right to live of another.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">42. The issue, however, comes under the scanner\n\n    since by social and judicial evolution certain\n\n    additional rights have been read into the right\n\n    to life and personal liberty as its essential and\n\n    implicit components. Right to privacy is one\n\n    such right. The said evolution in itself is\n\n    absolutely justified; the question arises as to\n\n    how far the right to privacy would override the\n\n    right to freedom of speech and expression. The\n\n    mirroring component of the latter right is the\n\n    right of the citizens of India to get accurate and\n\n    relevant    information,      without    which    there\n\n    cannot be an assurance of a dignified life and\n\n    personal liberty. An informed view of society is\n\n    essential for an individual to protect her or his\n\n    life and its ancillaries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">43. The fast-paced, competitive modern day world\n\n    leaves little scope of introspection. There is no\n\n    opportunity to stop by woods in evenings,\n\n    snowy or otherwise. Since Nature abhors a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                              22</span>\n\n\n\n\n   vacuum, such void in our lives is sought to be\n\n   filled     by     resorting      to        titillating        gossip,\n\n   â€žrevelationsâ€Ÿ and sensationalism, be it from the\n\n   media gossip columns or otherwise.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">44. However, if mainstream journalism converts\n\n   itself to yellow journalism, the dissemination of\n\n   objective news is directly hampered. â€žNewsâ€Ÿ,\n\n   presented as news, has to be objective, shorn of\n\n   opinionated barbs and jibes. The media has\n\n   two-fold        responsibility        -      to    disseminate\n\n   accurate information to the public at large and\n\n   to stay afloat by weighing commercial viability.\n\n   The latter cannot be entirely shunned, since\n\n   commerce provides the funds for sustaining\n\n   independent journalism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">45. The     petitionerâ€Ÿs   case,     considered             in     such\n\n   backdrop, has several facets. The first is the\n\n   petitionerâ€Ÿs right to privacy. The media has to\n\n   be cautious to maintain bounds since its huge\n\n   impact       may      make       or        break     individual\n\n   reputations as well. Every person, in Indian\n\n   criminal        jurisprudence,        is    innocent          unless\n\n   proved guilty. Although an investigation is not\n\n   â€žtrialâ€Ÿ in the strict sense of the term, it is the\n\n   genesis of a trial.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                          23</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">46. â€žMedia trialâ€Ÿ begins much before the actual trial\n\n    in a competent court of law. In the present\n\n    case, upon specific query of court as to whether\n\n    the petitioner is an accused in any of the cases,\n\n    learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for\n\n    the ED submitted that the petitioner, at this\n\n    stage, is a suspect and is being interrogated.\n\n    The ED disowns any unauthorised leakage of\n\n    information regarding the investigation by any\n\n    of its officers. It is contended that the said\n\n    investigating agency sticks to the press releases\n\n    and media bytes formally disseminated by the\n\n    ED to the media and on its website. In fact, the\n\n    written instruction of ED is filed in court, the\n\n    relevant portion of which it reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">    &quot;To focus on the positive work done by the\n    organization and to build confidence with the\n    public, with due care information are put on the\n    website of the ED only after actions are\n    completed. Further, only those facts are shared\n    with due caution which may not impede and\n    jeopardize    the   interest of    the   ongoing\n    investigation/action.    No    opinionated    or\n    judgmental statements are made by the ED\n    generally against any person.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_51\">47. During arguments, learned Deputy Solicitor\n\n    General submits on instruction that the term\n\n    &quot;generally&quot;, qualifying the sentence that no\n\n    opinionated or judgmental statements are made\n\n    by the ED, be deleted, as the same was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              24</span>\n\n\n\n\n   inadvertently incorporated. Since the ED binds\n\n   itself to such submissions, the same has the\n\n   force of an undertaking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">48. Such undertaking by the ED is accepted. It\n\n   takes ample care of the aspect of interference\n\n   with the administration of justice and fair trial,\n\n   insofar as the said agency is concerned. The\n\n   aspect   which      remains,     however,   is     the\n\n   perspective    of   the    suspect/accused/witness.\n\n   Reiterating for the sake of coherence, a person\n\n   in Indian criminal jurisprudence is innocent\n\n   unless proved guilty. Hence, if the investigating\n\n   agency, before filing a charge-sheet, divulges\n\n   the   name     of   the    person   interrogated    or\n\n   searched prior to conducting such interrogation\n\n   or search, the media may have a field day, but\n\n   the personâ€Ÿs personal goodwill, credibility and\n\n   respect in society goes for a toss. Either before\n\n   or after the search or interrogation, if the\n\n   investigating agency discloses to the public or\n\n   the media the circumstances, reasons and/or\n\n   the details of the interrogation or the search,\n\n   the same definitely interdicts a fair trial and\n\n   instigates his/her guilt to be assumed in the\n\n   public mind.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                             25</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">49. Moreover, the investigating agencies in general\n\n    and the ED in particular should not involve or\n\n    be accompanied by media persons during their\n\n    raids/interrogations/search         and       seizure\n\n    procedure, since such act on the part of the\n\n    investigating agency compromises fair trial as\n\n    well as privacy of the concerned individual,\n\n    raising   presumptions       of   guilt/involvement\n\n    before being established in due process of law\n\n    before the competent court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">50. Just as courts are supposed to speak through\n\n    their judgments and not go about expressing\n\n    their opinions in public matters which are sub\n\n    judice or which may potentially be the subject-\n\n    matter of adjudication, investigating agencies\n\n    speak through their charge sheets. The said\n\n    agencies are not a part of the media nor courts\n\n    of law. Their function is only to investigate. It is\n\n    not for the investigating agencies to wear their\n\n    success stories on their sleeves. Keeping in\n\n    mind the huge responsibilities of the central\n\n    investigating        agencies,    who      are     an\n\n    indispensable and very important arm of the\n\n    justice   delivery     system,    they    should   be\n\n    extremely careful in what information they\n\n    disseminate, since such information may ruin a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                             26</span>\n\n\n\n\n    suspect or even accused who after investigation\n\n    may not even be named in the charge sheet or\n\n    be ultimately acquitted after trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">51. Thus, the notion of the ED itself of whether the\n\n    disclosure would impede and jeopardize the\n\n    interest   of   the   ongoing    investigation/action\n\n    cannot be the only consideration of its media\n\n    releases. Fair trial is an important component\n\n    of equal access to justice guaranteed under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and\n\n    ought to be zealously guarded by all wings of\n\n    the Executive and Judiciary associated with an\n\n    investigation and trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">52. The job of the ED is not primarily to focus on\n\n    the positive work done by the organization and\n\n    to build confidence with the public, although\n\n    confidence-building with the public may be\n\n    necessary to the extent required to ensure\n\n    smooth          investigation.     However,      the\n\n    investigating agencies must not flaunt their\n\n    results during investigation but must maintain\n\n    a low-key profile to justify the immense powers\n\n    vested in them. The investigating agencies are\n\n    in a category apart from other agencies and\n\n    have to adhere to much higher standards than\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                              27</span>\n\n\n\n\n    the others.

Not only do the media not have any extra\n\n    freedom of speech and expression, I would go\n\n    one step further and say that in view of the\n\n    immense impact of media on the society at\n\n    large, they are bound by additional and higher\n\n    standards of accuracy than an ordinary citizen.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">56. Cardinal       pre-requisites      of      responsible\n\n    journalism are accuracy in presenting facts and\n\n    objectivity. When a news item is presented as a\n\n    news item, in whatever medium - audio, visual\n\n    or print - the same has to be utterly truthful\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                              28</span>\n\n\n\n\n    and be able to be corroborated by concrete\n\n    materials and sources. The exact source may or\n\n    may not be disclosed in the news item, but the\n\n    Editor/Board of Editors/ Management of the\n\n    particular    media    entity     must    be    able   to\n\n    corroborate it, if so required by any court of law\n\n    or    investigating      agency    or     other     body\n\n    authorised in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">57. Secondly, newspapers and other forms of media\n\n    may, apart from strictly news items, also carry\n\n    opinions     and   investigative   articles    or   even\n\n    â€žjuicyâ€Ÿ pieces of literature, but the name of the\n\n    author is to be clearly disclosed, so that the\n\n    author cannot avoid responsibility for his or her\n\n    own opinions. It is expected that a responsible\n\n    media would do its homework and ascertain the\n\n    facts before publishing them and it is not for\n\n    courts of law to advise them in their own field.\n\n    However, in order to enable the public to\n\n    discriminate between the grain and the chaff,\n\n    the media must clearly allocate separate spaces\n\n    / time slots / sections for actual factual news\n\n    and        opinionated        articles,        critiques,\n\n    advertisements and other type of literature and\n\n    photo/video features and clearly place them\n\n    under different heads/slots.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  29</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">58. Thirdly, during investigation and before filing of\n\n    charge sheet, no section of the media should\n\n    publish photographs of any person linking him\n\n    or her to the investigation in any manner. Even\n\n    if photographs of persons who are involved in\n\n    an investigation are published in a different\n\n    context altogether, there shall not be any\n\n    reference in the caption, article or news item\n\n    associated          with    such     photograph        to      the\n\n    investigation, during the continuance of such\n\n    investigation. Nothing above shall preclude the\n\n    media    from        accurately      reporting       the     press\n\n    briefings      or     media   bytes        released    by      the\n\n    investigating agencies. That apart, the media\n\n    may     also        carry   independent        and         verified\n\n    information           regarding          the   investigation,\n\n    including       the         names        of    the     persons\n\n    interrogated/searched,              if    relevant     in      the\n\n    context. However, no live video/audio/print\n\n    footage of the search and seizure process or\n\n    raid or interrogation will be published. Such\n\n    publication violates all norms of fair trial,\n\n    privacy and is utter sensationalism. The media,\n\n    taking advantage of their special privileges of\n\n    access to information, cannot resort to such\n\n    sensationalism, thereby conducting media trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                30</span>\n\n\n\n\n    and castigating a person before he/she is held\n\n    guilty by a competent court of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">59. It has to be kept in mind that there are specific\n\n    spheres of specialization of each branch of\n\n    society.     The       investigating      agencies     are\n\n    specialized       in   investigating      and   revealing\n\n    valuable information for bringing culprits to\n\n    justice. The courts are specially trained and\n\n    experienced to adjudicate. Similarly, the media\n\n    is specially trained to disclose and disseminate\n\n    facts having vital bearing on social life of the\n\n    polity. â€žInvestigativeâ€Ÿ journalism is definitely\n\n    welcome      to    expose       the   wrong-doings     and\n\n    injustices in society and is an essential facet of\n\n    a free press exercising the freedom of speech\n\n    and        expression.      However,         investigative\n\n    journalism        cannot        be    a   substitute   for\n\n    investigation by a specialized agency authorized\n\n    in law or trial conducted by a court of law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">60. There are various aspects of the justice delivery\n\n    system which may not be understood properly\n\n    by laymen. Just as a doctor or a lawyer or a\n\n    delivery person or a professional security guard\n\n    watching court proceedings are all specialists\n\n    in their respective spheres of work, the various\n\n    aspects of which may not be understood or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                              31</span>\n\n\n\n\nperformed       by    a     judge       or    an    investigator,\n\nsimilarly an investigation process or a court\n\nproceeding      has        different         components            and\n\nnuances which are not properly comprehended\n\nby others. For example, during live-streaming,\n\nwhich      is        an      important             technological\n\nadvancement           in         transparency          of      court\n\nprocedure, certain comments are made and\n\nview exchanged between the judge and the\n\nlawyers and litigants which are merely a part of\n\nthe process of adjudication. Thesis, antithesis\n\nand     synthesis          are     an        ongoing        part    of\n\nadjudication. Passionate arguments and heated\n\nexchanges ultimately congeal into a judgment\n\nof court. It is only the final outcome which\n\nmatters    and       is    binding,      and       none      of    the\n\ncomponents leading to it. Reportage in media\n\nand social platforms often mould public opinion\n\nand taint untrained minds with the impression\n\nthat those exchanges in-between are final and\n\nis the ultimate verdict on the issue. Often,\n\npassionate arguments made by professionals in\n\ncourt are not so passionate as they seem and\n\nanti-views expressed by the judge are a mode of\n\ntesting the exactly opposite view of the judge on\n\nthe corner-stone of debate.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 32</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">61. Similarly,    during        investigation,       many        false\n\n    leads and barking up the wrong trees precede\n\n    the culmination of a proper investigation. If the\n\n    media were to grill each of the leads and trees\n\n    before any guilt is attributed to them in a fair\n\n    trial, the trial will reach its culmination some\n\n    day and the guilty would be brought to justice,\n\n    but many an innocent will be crushed in public\n\n    censure and unwarranted public focus in the\n\n    process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">62. Insofar as the petitioner is concerned, she is\n\n    admittedly a suspect and is being interrogated.\n\n    However,      before       being        held   guilty    by     a\n\n    competent     court        of    law,     no   guilt    can    be\n\n    attributed     to     her        either    directly     or     by\n\n    insinuation      by    the        media.       Conjuring       up\n\n    conjecture should be left to the public mind,\n\n    which cannot be restrained, nor does the court\n\n    have any intention to. But insofar as the media\n\n    and the investigating agencies are concerned,\n\n    they should be extremely careful not only to\n\n    provide correct and accurate information to the\n\n    public,    but      also        protect    the    dignity       of\n\n    individuals, irrespective of their affiliations,\n\n    gender, class, creed and opinions, as well as to\n\n    ensure that the administration of justice, of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                               33</span>\n\n\n\n\n    which    investigation         and     trial        are     both\n\n    important facets, is not interfered with or\n\n    hampered in any manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">63.

However, the focal point of the judgments was\n\n    the concept of family vis-Ã -vis the protagonists\n\n    therein. The publications allegedly made in\n\n    respect of the petitionerâ€Ÿs husband and family\n\n    are not in the capacity of the said persons as\n\n    family members of the petitioners. The husband\n\n    of the petitioner is a well-known political figure.\n\n    Other    members         of    her    family        are      also\n\n    prominent functionaries in the State Executive.\n\n    The publications against them are in their\n\n    individual     capacities       and/or         as     political\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                            34</span>\n\n\n\n\n    propaganda.

Thus the\n\n    protective umbrella sought by the petitioner\n\n    cannot be extended to her family, since the\n\n    media publications against the said family\n\n    members are in their own capacities, which can\n\n    always     be   assailed     by     them      in   their\n\n    independent capacities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">66.
