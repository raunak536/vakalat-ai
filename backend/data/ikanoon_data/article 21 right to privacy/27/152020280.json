The Plaintiff asserts to be the Category-I of Class-II legal heir of SSR\nand absolute legal heir under <a href=\"/doc/1207692/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 16</a> of Hindu Succession Act, 1956,\nentitled to bring the present suit for protecting the reputation, privacy and\nrights of his deceased son. SSR was a renowned actor from the\nentertainment industry, who worked in several blockbuster movies and\ntelevision series, bagged multiple awards, and had attained the status of a\npublic figure and celebrity. He passed away under suspicious circumstances\non 14th June, 2020. The Plaintiff lodged an FIR on account of his unnatural\ndeath. The matter is being investigated by the CBI, and there is no\nconclusive report submitted as yet. As SSR commanded a huge\nfan-following, people of the country were deeply moved by his unfortunate\nand untimely demise, and it attracted widespread news coverage on\nelectronic, social, and print media. The Plaintiff believes that the Defendants\nare trying to exploit this media frenzy and public curiosity surrounding\nSSR&#x27;s life and the circumstances surrounding his death, for their commercial\ngain.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">3.

Despite that, without approaching the family, Defendants No. 1 to 4\nare making a movie which is a self-proclaimed &quot;tribute to Sushant Singh\nRajput&quot;, titled &#x27;Nyay: The Justice&#x27; slated to be released on 11th June, 2021\n[produced by Defendant No. 1 (Sarla A Saraogi) and Defendant No. 2\n(Rahul Sharma), directed by Defendant No. 3 (Dilip Gulati), and outlined by\nDefendant No. 4 (Ashok Saraogi)].

Defendant No. 9 is a John Doe / Ashok Kumar\nimpleadment of unknown person(s), against whom a relief of the same\nnature is sought, by way of a pre-emptive measure. In this background,\nPlaintiff has filed the present suit seeking enforcement of John Doe orders\nagainst known Defendants No. 1 to 8, and other unknown Defendants, on\nthe ground that their actions are violative of the right to publicity, the right\nto privacy and the right to free and fair trial.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">CONTENTIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.     During the course of argument, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior\nCounsel for the Plaintiff, made the following submissions:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">4.1.   VIOLATION OF CELEBRITY RIGHTS / THE RIGHT TO PUBLICITY\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)    Celebrity rights have been acknowledged for the benefit of those who\n       have worked hard to be known as distinguished personalities. It gives\n       them the right to publicity, which allows them to control the\n       commercial use of their identity and entitles them to the money that\n       arises from their fame. Such celebrity rights are assignable and\n       licensable for commercial benefits. They also offer posthumous\n       protection to the legal heirs of the celebrities, and cannot be used by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                Page 4 of 42</span>\n           third parties for commercial advantage without the consent of their\n          legal heir. In the present case, the public perception of the Plaintiff&#x27;s\n          son is of tremendous value. After their death, the public at large\n          cannot be permitted to make windfall gain through commercially\n          exploiting the persona of the deceased.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">(ii)      There is no strict proof required for identifiability of a &#x27;celebrity&#x27;. It\n          should be enough if there is a resemblance of name, likeness, or\n          reputation of a celebrity. In this regard, reliance is placed upon Titan\n          Industries Ltd. v. M/s. Ramkumar Jewellers,1 and Mr. Shivaji Rao\n          Gaikwad v. M/s. Varsha Productions.2 It is an undisputed position\n          that the Plaintiff&#x27;s son was a celebrity. It is also admitted by the\n          Defendants that the Plaintiff is the only legal heir. Further, the\n          documents placed on record show that Defendants are looking to\n          make a movie which is inspired by the life of Plaintiff&#x27;s son.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58859365\" id=\"span_5\">(iii)     The law in this regard is well-settled and courts have, in the past,\n          granted injunctive relief prior to release of a movie on this ground, in\n          the cases of Shivaji Rao (supra) and in <a href=\"/doc/58859365/\" id=\"a_4\">Kirtibhai Raval &amp; Ors v.\n          Raghuram Jaisukhram Chandrani</a>. 3 In the latter case, the Gujarat\n          High Court upheld that the right to publicity of a celebrity is\n          transferred to their direct descendant after their death.</span> It was also\n          pointed out that this right has been upheld in the United States of\n          America in Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social Change, Inc. v.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">    2012 SCC OnLine Del 2382.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">    2015 SCC OnLine Mad 158.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">    Appeal from Order No. 262 of 2007, dated 20 th January, 2010 by the Gujarat High Court.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                                       Page 5 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">         American Heritage Products, Inc, 4 Martin Luther King v.

He is making a movie titled &#x27;Shashank&#x27;, which is a\n          common Indian name and bears no resemblance to &#x27;Sushant&#x27;. The\n          movie is based on the struggle of first-generation actors / &#x27;outsiders&#x27;\n          in the Hindi film industry. The Plaintiff&#x27;s son is not the only actor to\n          struggle as an &#x27;outsider&#x27;, and moreover, there are four male\n          protagonists in the movie. Thus, the Plaintiff&#x27;s argument that, the film\n          is based on the life of his son, has no legs to stand on.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(iii)     On the issue of right to fair trail, he submitted that Defendant No. 7&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">25</span>\n     AIR 1999 SC 357.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                     Page 17 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">           movie does not cover the on-going investigation into the demise of the\n          Plaintiff&#x27;s son, and thus the Plaintiff&#x27;s rights, if any, would not be\n          infringed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">REJOINDER ARGUMENTS BY PLAINTIFF\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">9.        In rejoinder thereto, Mr. Vikas Singh urged that under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_35\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a>, the right to make a movie for commercial gain is separate from\njournalistic freedom to report an event. He submitted that the FIR was filed\nby the Plaintiff, who is the complainant therein, and thus his right to fair trial\nis subsisting and on-going. The Plaintiff also enjoys the right to privacy, as\nthe press&#x27;s portrayal of the Plaintiff in a villainous manner is untrue. The\ncommercial gain of filmmakers has to bow down to the Plaintiff&#x27;s right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21.</a> Defendant No. 4 has made brazen statements to the media\nand also admits representing an accused in the investigation; hence the\naudience can be misled into believing that the film is fact-based. Right to\ncelebrity is distinguishable from right to privacy. The right to remain\ninformed about public figures such as politicians or officials holding public\noffice could be traced to Right to Information, which in turn finds its origin\nin freedom of free speech under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India. The\nactual information reported in the news about public figures arises from the\nmoral duty of journalists to keep the public informed, and cannot be equated\nwith the commercial exploitation one sets out to cause by copying the\nlikeness of a person. That the likeness and brand value of a celebrity must\nonly be used with the consent of the celebrity is a settled principle of law,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">26</span>\n     AIR 2012 AP 78.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                  Page 18 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\"> however, the Defendants have sought to create confusion without any legal\nbasis.

Before proceeding with the analysis of the arguments put forth by the\nparties, let us first briefly examine the works which are sought to be\ninjuncted. The movie titled &#x27;Nyay: The Justice&#x27; [hereinafter referred to as\n&#x27;the said film&#x27;] produced by Defendant No. 1 &amp; 2 and directed by\nDefendant No. 3, has not been released for public viewing as yet. These\nDefendants have argued that the said film is inspired by true events\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">27</span>\n     (1995) 15 PTC 46.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                Page 19 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_74\"> surrounding the lives of film or TV celebrities including the Plaintiff&#x27;s son\nwho purportedly passed away due to unnatural causes, details whereof are\nwidely available in the public domain, and that the said film is a fictional\nrendition with creative dramatization of such true events. The said film\nmerely draws inspiration from information already available in the public\ndomain, such as news reports and articles, which form a part of the public\nrecord. These Defendants have argued that the said film is neither a biopic\nof the Plaintiff&#x27;s son, nor will portray the name, image, caricature,\nphotographs etc., of either SSR or the Plaintiff himself or his family. They\nhave also inserted a disclaimer in to the movie to that effect. Defendant No.\n7, who is making other films such as &#x27;Shashank&#x27;, similarly claims that their\nfilm is a work of fiction, portraying the struggle of young actors in\nBollywood, and is inspired by real events.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">11.       The contents of the films are being speculated by the Plaintiff on the\nbasis of publicity materials, such as the teasers available on the internet and\nstatements made in the media by persons who are associated with it. Despite\nthe fact that the films are yet to be released for public viewing, the Plaintiff\nseeks restraint orders against their exhibition, not just against named\npersons, but also attempts to invokes John Doe jurisdiction of the court\nagainst unknown persons. Keeping in mind this factual scenario, we now\nproceed to examine whether the Plaintiff satisfies the requirement of law for\nthe injunction, as prayed for. It is to be remembered that the law on\npre-publication injunctions is quite well-settled. Courts grant pre-publication\ninjunctions only in exceptional circumstances. This reluctance is rooted in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">28</span>\n     (2015) 4 LW 443.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 20 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\"> the importance attached to the right of free speech. Blanket injunctions or\ngag orders should be avoided, unless extremely imperative.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">12.   First and foremost, it is apposite to understand the framework of the\nsuit and the rights sought to be enforced. The present application seeks a\nlimited prayer restraining the use of SSR&#x27;s name, caricature, lifestyle or\nlikeness in their forthcoming projects/films. Relief is sought regarding, inter\nalia, (i) &quot;passing off&quot;; (ii) &quot;infiltration of personality rights by such\nunauthorized use&quot;; (iii) &quot;misrepresentation and causing deception in minds\nof public leading to passing off&quot;; (iv) &quot;violation of right to fair trial of\nPlaintiff under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> of Indian Constitution&quot; and other ancillary reliefs.\nBesides, in the body of the application as well as the plaint, Plaintiff has also\nreferred to the film being &quot;defamatory in nature and in violation of the\nprivacy rights&quot;, however, no relief has been sought for defamation. Now, let\nus delve into the multitude of rights which have been pressed by the Plaintiff\nto seek such restraint orders.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n\nCELEBRITY / P ERSONALITY RIGHTS\n\n\nA.    What are &#x27;celebrity&#x27; or &#x27;publicity&#x27; rights?\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">13.   The suit is centred around the celebrity rights of SSR, and the plaint\nand interim application refer to the terms &#x27;publicity right&#x27;, &#x27;celebrity right&#x27;\nand &#x27;personality right&#x27; interchangeably. There is no express statutory\nrecognition of publicity, personality or celebrity rights in India, although\nthere are limited provisions, whereunder, some of these rights can be\nclaimed as intellectual property rights, such as under the <a href=\"/doc/1017213/\" id=\"a_43\">Trade Marks Act</a>,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 21 of 42</span>\n 1999, but that is not the case canvassed here. Nevertheless, on the basis of\nrights asserted, the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_44\">Copyright Act, 1957</a>, becomes relevant, but again, it does\nnot define the term &#x27;celebrity&#x27; and the most relevant definition found\nthereunder, is of the terms &#x27;author&#x27; [<a href=\"/doc/197427767/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2(d)</a>] and &#x27;performer&#x27; [<a href=\"/doc/159649082/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n2(qq)</a>] and their associated rights, who may not necessarily be celebrities.\nWhile the term &#x27;Performer&#x27; includes an actor within its ambit, the rights\nascribed to an actor, under this Act, are neither relevant nor asserted in\nthe instant case. In the absence of a statutory definition of a &#x27;celebrity&#x27;,\nwe turn to refer to its common parlance meaning. The Coll ins Online\nDictionary defines a &#x27;celebrity&#x27; as &quot;someone who is famous, especially\nin areas of entertainment such as films, music, writing, or sport. &quot; SSR&#x27;s\nstatus as a celebrity is not in dispute, as the Defendants accep t the same.\nThe Court is thus, not concerned with the aspect of who/what constitutes\nas a &#x27;celebrity&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">14.   One could say that the law on the subject of celebrity rights is still in\nits nascent stage, and it has been developing predominately through judicial\nprecedents which have given recognition and protection of such rights, as\nand when the Courts have been approached in diverse situations. The\ncommon law, as discussed hereinafter at length, recognizes the\ncommercial value ascribed to the fame or popularity of a celebrity, due to\nwhich various rights are attained and enjoyed by them. Indeed, many such\nprecedents have been cited by both the parties, some of which we have\nexamined hereinbelow:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57212191\" id=\"span_71\">(i)   In <a href=\"/doc/57212191/\" id=\"a_47\">Titan Industries Ltd.</a> (supra), the Plaintiff, who owned the brand\n      &#x27;Tanishq&#x27;, filed a suit against the Defendant for putting up hoardings,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 22 of 42</span>\n           depicting Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Ms. Jaya Bachchan endorsing\n          Defendant&#x27;s jewellery, which were exact copies of the Plaintiff&#x27;s\n          hoardings put all over the country. The Plaintiff also had an exclusive\n          license agreement with the actors for endorsement of its jewelry and\n          owned the copyright in all the work produced pursuant to the said\n          agreement. This court, while discussing publicity right of a celebrity\n          noted:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                   &quot;A celebrity is defined as a famous or a well-known person.

The right to\n                   control commercial use of human identity is the right to publicity.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"358048\" id=\"span_73\">(ii)      In the case of <a href=\"/doc/358048/\" id=\"a_48\">ICC Development (International) Ltd. v.

In the said case, the court\n          while going into the concept of publicity rights, held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                   &quot;14.

Any effort to take\n              away the right of publicity from the individuals, to the organiser\n              {non-human entity} of the event would be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_49\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">21</a> of\n              the Constitution of India. No persona can be monopolised. The right of\n              Publicity vests in an individual and he alone is entitled to profit from it.\n              For example if any entity, was to use Kapil Dev or Sachin Tendulkar&#x27;s\n              name/persona/indicia in connection with the &#x27;World Cup&#x27; without their\n              authorisation, they would have a valid and enforceable cause of action.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">(iii)   In DM Entertainment (supra), Mr. Daler Mehndi had assigned all his\n        rights, title, and interest in his personality, inherent in his rights of\n        publicity, along with the registered trade mark &#x27;DALER MEHNDI&#x27; as\n        well as goodwill vested therein, in favour of the Plaintiff company,\n        which then brought an action against the Defendants who were\n        involved in the sale of dolls in the image and likeness of Mr. Daler\n        Mehndi. In this context, injunction was granted, and this Court\n        observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              &quot;14. The right of publicity can, in a jurisprudential sense, be located\n              with the individual&#x27;s right and autonomy to permit or not permit the\n              commercial exploitation of his likeness or some attributes of his\n              personality. However, a word of caution has to be expressed here. In a\n              free and democratic society, where every individual&#x27;s right to free speech\n              is assured, the over emphasis on a famous person&#x27;s publicity rights can\n              tend to chill the exercise of such invaluable democratic right. Thus, for\n              instance, caricature, lampooning, parodies and the like, which may tend to\n              highlight some aspects of the individual&#x27;s personality traits, may not\n              constitute infringement of such individual&#x27;s right to publicity. If it were\n              held otherwise, an entire genre of expression would be unavailable to the\n              general public. Such caricature, lampooning or parody may be expressed\n              in a variety of ways, i.e. cartoons in newspapers, mime, theatre, even\n              films, songs, etc. Such forms of expression cannot be held to amount to\n              commercial exploitation, per se; if the individual is of the view that the\n              form of expression defames or disparages him, the remedy of damages for\n              libel, or slander, as the case may be, would then, is available to him.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                        Page 24 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\"> (iv)   In Shivaji Rao Gaikwad (supra), the Madras High Court was dealing\n       with a suit filed by the actor Mr. Shivaji Rao Gaikwad (who goes by\n       the screen-name Rajinikanth) against the release of a film titled &#x27;Main\n       Hoon Rajinikanth&#x27; on the ground that his name in the title would\n       cause gross damage to his goodwill, infringe his personality rights,\n       and cause deception in the minds of public, leading to passing off.\n       The Court granted the injunction in favour of the Plaintiff against the\n       release of the film, and made the following observations:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"358048\" id=\"span_77\">&quot;21. (...) From a reading of the above said judgments [<a href=\"/doc/358048/\" id=\"a_51\">ICC Development</a>\n             (supra) and Titan (supra)], I am of the opinion that the personality right\n             vests on those persons, who have attained the status of celebrity. In fact,\n             in the present case, it has been categorically admitted by the defendant\n             himself in the counter affidavit that the Plaintiff is a well acclaimed actor\n             with high reputation and he is a doyen of the film industry in India.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">             Therefore, the defendant now cannot say that the name &#x27;Rajinikanth&#x27; is a\n             common name and as such it does not refer to the Plaintiff alone. A\n             celebrity must be identifiable from defendant&#x27;s unauthorized use.\n             Infringement of right of publicity requires no proof of falsity, confusion, or\n             deception, especially when the celebrity is identifiable.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_78\">(v)    On this aspect, we must also note that in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_52\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra),\n       wherein the right to privacy was declared to be a fundamental right on\n       the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court\n       has reflected upon personality rights also, and observed that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">             &quot;58. Every individual should have a right to be able to exercise control\n             over his/her own life and image as portrayed to the world and to control\n             commercial use of his/her identity. This also means that an individual may\n             be permitted to prevent others from using his image, name and other\n             aspects of his/her personal life and identity for commercial purposes\n             without his/her consent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">15.    The above-noted cases, and many others on the subject, clearly\nrecognize the concept of celebrity rights. It can, therefore, be fairly said that\n&#x27;celebrity rights&#x27; is essentially a compendium of the other rights accrued by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 25 of 42</span>\n a person upon attaining the status of a &#x27;celebrity&#x27;, comprising of a bundle of\nrights which include certain intellectual properties rights, publicity,\npersonality and privacy rights.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">16.   Plaintiff emphasises on the brand value of a celebrity and contends\nthat it is a settled principle of law that the likeness and brand value of a\ncelebrity must only be used with the consent of the celebrity. It is also\nargued that that the judgements relied upon it, and also those cited by the\nDefendants such as DM Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. (supra), categorically\nrecognize that an unauthorized usage of a persona must be injuncted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"358048\" id=\"span_80\">17.   Undoubtedly, there are several such cases which recognize this\ncommon law right of celebrities to control the commercial use their image\nand personality, and in situations where a third party, without consent, has\ngiven an impression that a merchandise, product or service has been\nendorsed or associated with the celebrity, the courts have granted injunctions\nas well. However, as can be seen from DM Entertainment (supra), <a href=\"/doc/358048/\" id=\"a_54\">ICC</a>\n(supra), and Titan (supra), these rights rest in the concept that a celebrity,\nwho earns a living on the basis of the monetization of their recognition by\nthe public, must be entitled to the tangible, economic benefit arising from\nthe utilization and assignment of their image or likeness, be it through\nadvertisements, merchandise, etc.\n\n\nB.    Can &#x27;celebrity rights&#x27; be enforced posthumously?</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">18.   In the instant case, the celebrity is unfortunately no longer between\nus, which gives rise to a legal quandary in relation to his posthumous rights.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 26 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58859365\" id=\"span_82\">Plaintiff claims that such rights are inheritable by the legal heirs of a\ncelebrity. He has relied upon the judgment of the Gujarat High Court\n<a href=\"/doc/58859365/\" id=\"a_55\">Kirtibhai Raval</a> (supra) to contend that celebrity rights can be transferred to\na direct descendant. The case law has thus been examined by this Court at\nlength. Therein, the Plaintiff, claiming to be direct descendant of late Shri\nJalaram Bapa of Virpur, set up a case based on the right to privacy and right\nof publicity. He sought injunction against publishing any film or artistic\nwork on the life of late Jalaram Bapa, without his consent. Defendants\nclaimed that they had based their film on a pre-published book on the\ndeceased&#x27;s life. While the court upheld the injunction granted by the trial\ncourt, on the consideration that irreparable harm will be caused by violation\nof right to publicity or privacy which cannot be compensated monetarily, but\nit also took the view that the contentions raised by the parties required\ndetailed consideration upon leading appropriate evidence. The Court thus\ndid not delve into rival contentions, noting that the right of privacy and\npublicity urged therein was a triable issue. It felt that the questions of\nwhether the documentary evidence on record as relied upon by the\ndefendants can be considered &#x27;public record&#x27;, and whether any authentic\nrecord was available on the life or incidents as mentioned in the book, would\nbe required to be considered in detail upon leading evidence at the\nappropriate stage. Thus, in the eyes of this Court, this judgment does not say\nmuch on posthumous rights of a celebrity, and does not advance the\nproposition canvassed by the Plaintiff.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">19.   Next, the Plaintiff has relied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court\nof Georgia, USA, in Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social Change,\n(1982) (supra) to argue that celebrity rights are assignable and licensable for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 27 of 42</span>\n commercial benefit and survive beyond the life of a celebrity. Therein, the\nCourt of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit, certified to the Supreme Court of\nGeorgia the questions of whether the &#x27;right to publicity&#x27; as recognized in\nGeorgia was distinct from the &#x27;right of privacy&#x27;, and if so, whether such\nright survived the death of its owner. The Supreme Court instructed that the\nright to publicity was distinct from the right to privacy, and further opined\nthat it is an inheritable and devisable right, concluding that &quot;while private\ncitizens have the right of privacy, public figures have a similar right of\npublicity, and that the measure of damages to a public figure for violation of\nhis or her right of publicity is the value of the appropriation to the user&quot;. In\nthe opinion of this Court, this judgment cannot assist the cause of the\nPlaintiff as it is based on State-specific law and not federal law of USA.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_84\">Moreover it would not be entirely relevant in view of the legal position in\nIndia, especially in view of the observations in the landmark judgment of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_56\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra), which we will come to shortly.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\">20.   At this juncture it is noted that, curiously, the Plaintiff has sought to\ndistinguish &#x27;celebrity rights&#x27; from the &#x27;right to privacy&#x27;. Celebrity rights, as\nnoted earlier, are a bundle of rights, including publicity, personality, and\nprivacy and in some cases, intellectual properties rights, and in the opinion\nof this Court, any assertion of such rights (except those claimed through\nIntellectual Property Rights for which special statutory protection is\nprovided), cannot be appreciated, divorced of the concept of right to privacy.\nIn the absence of statutory acknowledgement of such rights, the\nfountainhead of such rights would be the right to privacy emanating from\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                Page 28 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_86\">21.        There can also be no doubt that a limited class of celebrity rights\nwhich are protected as intellectual property rights under applicable laws, and\nare assignable and licensable under such statutes, could survive the death of\nthe celebrity. However, the Plaintiff claims that the deceased celebrity has a\nposthumous publicity right. Since it is inextricably interlinked to and birthed\nfrom the right of privacy, the Court prima facie finds merit in the\nsubmission of the Defendants that the posthumous privacy right is not\npermissible. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_58\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra, at para</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">557), has also held that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">           &quot;557. Right to privacy of any individual is essentially a natural right, which\n           inheres in every human being by birth. Such right remains with the human being\n           till he/she breathes last. It is indeed inseparable and inalienable from human\n           being. In other words, it is born with the human being and extinguishes with\n           human being.&quot;                                                (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57212191\" id=\"span_87\">22.        Apart from above-noted view expressed by the Supreme Court, there\nare other authoritative decisions holding that the right of privacy would not\nsurvive after death. It would be worthwhile to take note of the Madras High\nCourt&#x27;s view in the case of <a href=\"/doc/57212191/\" id=\"a_59\">Managing Director, Makka Tholai Thodarpu\nLtd.</a> (supra, at paras 17 &amp; 18) wherein it has been held that right of privacy\nof the late forest brigand Veerappan, did not subsist after this death.</span> Then,\nagain in the recent judgment of Deepa Jayakumar (supra), the Madras High\nCourt framed a specific question regarding posthumous enforceability of\nprivacy right, and after considering the law on the subject, held that the right\nof privacy of an individual cannot be inherited after his death by his legal\nheirs and that personality right, reputation or privacy enjoyed by a person\nduring his lifetime, come to an end after his lifetime.30\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">30</span>\n     See: Paras 13, 30, 33, 34, 35, and 37.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                          Page 29 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57212191\" id=\"span_90\">23.   Moreover, even if one were to assume that the Plaintiff has inherited\nthe persona of SSR and has the right of publicity as a posthumous right, it\nwould be essential to understand what this right is. In <a href=\"/doc/57212191/\" id=\"a_60\">Titan Industries Ltd.</a>\n(supra), this Court while defining the building blocks of the right of\npublicity held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      &quot;The basic elements comprising the liability for infringement of the right of\n      publicity:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      Validity: The Plaintiff owns an enforceable right in the identity or persona of a\n      human being.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      Identifiability: The Celebrity must be identifiable from defendant&#x27;s unauthorized\n      use.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">24.   In the present context, the enforceable right being claimed is in the\npersona of SSR, on the basis of the events that occurred in his life. The\nPlaintiff specifically contends that &quot;no picture/show or any other related\ndocument of Sushant Singh Rajput could be created without the consent of\nPlaintiff&quot;. To put it differently, the Plaintiff claims to have inherited the\nexclusive right over the life story of SSR as an intangible or commercial\nproperty. In another sense, the Plaintiff claims a copyright over the life of\nSSR. However, under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_61\">Copyright Act, 1957</a>, facts which are historical,\nbiographical, or news of the day cannot be copyrighted as they are a part of\nthe public domain, available to every person, and involve no &#x27;originality&#x27;\nand &#x27;creation&#x27; which lies at the heart of a copyright protection. The\nnecessary corollary, therefore, is that anyone is entitled to make movies on\nevents which have actually occurred.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_91\">25.   The Defendants have, in fact, pitched their case much higher and have\nargued that personality rights are recognized through the right to privacy and\npublicity, which are considered to be the mirror rights of each other. Right to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                      Page 30 of 42</span>\n publicity / celebrity deals with the commercial utilization of the celebrity&#x27;s\nname, photograph, voice, image, signature, etc. whereas the right to privacy\nis a personal right basically saying, &quot;let me be&quot;. They have argued that in\nIndia, the &#x27;right to publicity&#x27; is derived from the &#x27;right to privacy&#x27; and the\ntwo are not completely independent of each other, as the former cannot exist\nwithout the latter. It has then been argued that, in the context of the\nreasoning in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_62\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra), as noted above, if the right to privacy\nextinguishes with the human being, the only necessary corollary is that right\nto publicity would also extinguish and would not survive after the death of\nthe person.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">26.    Having said that, in the opinion of this Court, whether commercial\ncelebrity rights, such as personality or publicity rights, would survive or\nextinguish after the death of the celebrity, requires a deeper probe. In the\nabsence of codified laws protecting such rights, the common law which\ngoverns such rights has to be analysed. Moreover, additional questions\nemerge, such as whether personality/publicity right is a property, being part\nof the estate/assets of the deceased, as a concept detached from the theory of\ndignity, or can it only be harmonised with the right of privacy, from where it\noriginated. Such enquiries would first require evidence to be led by the\nPlaintiff to prove that the persona of SSR is still surviving as a commercial\nproperty, which is alleged to be exploited by the Defendants for profit. The\nfoundational facts have to be established and proved and mere status of a\ncelebrity is not enough. Even in a passing off action - a remedy available\nunder common law - the Plaintiff is required to satisfy the Classical Trinity\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                              Page 31 of 42</span>\n test.31 Therefore, this debate should be kept for another day and would not\ndetain this Court in deciding the present application, keeping in view the\nspecific nature of the case put forth by the Plaintiff, the rights asserted, and\nthe reliefs sought at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">27.      At this juncture the Court may also deal with the Plaintiff&#x27;s claim of\npassing off. A passing off action is initiated to safeguard the Plaintiff&#x27;s\ngoodwill from another who is designedly trying to mislead the public that\nhis goods or services are that of the Plaintiff. In view of the facts noted\nabove, and specific disclaimer of the Defendants, the Court prima facie does\nnot find any element to hold that the film would lead the public to believe\nthat it is a true story or a biopic that has been authorised or endorsed by the\nPlaintiff. Pertinently, once the disclaimer is included at the beginning of the\ncinematograph film, any apprehension that the Plaintiff has about passing\noff that the film is a biopic of SSR, will be put to rest. A more detailed\nenquiry into the same, as stated earlier, should be kept for another day when\nappropriate evidence to this effect can be appreciated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">28.      Furthermore, in the case at hand, the name, caricature, lifestyle,\nand/or likeness of SSR is not being exploited by applying to any\nmerchandise as t-shirts, toys, posters, mugs, etc. so as to evoke his persona.\nThe Defendants are not making any misrepresentation or claiming a false\nendorsement for their respective films. They represent their work to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">31</span>\n   Reckitt and Colman Products Limited, [1990] 1 All ER 873. The Classical Trinity test postulates that in\norder to prove passing off, the plaintiff must prove: (1) goodwill or reputation attached to his goods or\nservice; (2) existence of misrepresentation by defendant to the public which is likely to lead the public to\nbelieve that the goods and services offered by defendant are that of the plaintiff; and (3) existence of loss or\nthe likelihood of damage to plaintiff&#x27;s goodwill.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                                          Page 32 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\"> fictional, i.e., neither a biopic nor based on true events. For such reasons as\ndetailed in the foregoing discussion, the Plaintiff is unable to convince the\nCourt on the point of infringement of celebrity rights.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"129499404\" id=\"span_96\">29.    The Court does not find merit in the contention of the Plaintiff\nseeking restraint on the strength of his right to fair trial. Plaintiff asserts that\nsince he is the complainant in the FIR, he is entitled to a fair trial relating to\nthe unnatural death of his son. He has relied upon the order of High Court of\nBombay in the PIL in <a href=\"/doc/129499404/\" id=\"a_63\">Nilesh Navalakha</a> (supra), to contend that it is the\nduty of all media houses to protect the right to fair trial, and in case of\ncompeting interest between right to fair trial and right to free speech, the\nformer should be given importance.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">30.    The directions issued by the High Court of Bombay are already in\nforce. Here, the right to fair trial is being claimed by the Petitioner, being the\ninformant/complainant, but no foundation is set up to demonstrate as to how\nthe films would impair the fairness in investigation or trial. In fact, the\naccused persons who are named in the FIR or are being investigated have\nnot come forward claiming prejudice. While it needs no emphasis that the\nright to fair trial is a valuable right, however, it must be remembered that the\ninvestigative agencies and judicial system do not rely on cinematographic\nfilms for the purpose of investigation or judicial pronouncements. They have\nto proceed to decide the issues before them by drawing their own inferences\nand conclusions based on the materials placed before them, in accordance\nwith the law. The films in question are not documentaries, but work of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                    Page 33 of 42</span>\n fiction. The Court does not find any reasonable ground to believe that the\ndanger apprehended by the Plaintiff is real or imminent. The two-pronged\ntest of necessity and proportionality, as recognised and applied by the court\nin the case of Dr. Shashi Tharoor (supra), has not been satisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">31.       On this issue, the views of the Supreme Court in Adarsh Cooperative\nHousing Society Limited (supra), are also relevant and must be taken note\nof. In the said case, the Court inter alia held that, &quot;the doctrine of sub judice\nmay not be elevated to such an extent that some kind of reference or allusion\nto a member of society would warrant the negation of the right to freedom of\nspeech and expression which is extremely cherished right enshrined under\nthe Constitution.&quot; <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158628950\" id=\"span_98\">In <a href=\"/doc/158628950/\" id=\"a_64\">Nachiketa Walhekar v. Central Board of\nFilm Certification &amp; Anr.</a>, 32 the Supreme Court held that a film, drama,\nnovel or a book is a creation of art, and that an artist has his own freedom to\nexpress himself in a manner which is not prohibited in law. The Court also\nheld that prohibitions should not, by implication, crucify the rights of\nexpressive minds.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">32.       Thus, a newspaper report pertaining to Defendant No. 4 cannot be the\nsole basis to conclude interference in the administration of justice or\ninvestigation. The cause of action for asserting right of fair trial herein\nseems to be based on unreasonable apprehension and vague possibilities.\nKeeping in view the parameters applied in such cases, the Defendants&#x27; right\nto present their fictional stories, in the opinion of this Court, cannot be\ncurbed purely on an unsubstantiated hypothesis, and no gag order can be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">32</span>\n     2018 (1) SCALE 382.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 34 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\"> issued.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">PLAINTIFF&#x27;S CAUSE OF ACTION FOR DEFAMATION\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"930035\" id=\"span_101\">33.   Although, Mr. Vikas Singh has not pressed the allegations of\ndefamation, and rightly so, as the movie has neither been released, nor seen\nby the Plaintiff as yet, but it must be noted that, in the suit, the Plaintiff has\nalso briefly alluded to the content of the film being defamatory, by\ncontending that having SSR associated with the Defendants&#x27; forthcoming\nfeature film of immoral and promiscuous nature, the Plaintiff and his son\nwould be subject to defamation and slander, and gross damage would be\ncaused to his vast reputation/goodwill amongst the public across the world\nand the Hindi film industry, which has been built over the hard work of\nseveral years by the SSR. The Court finds this plea to be misconceived and\nthe allegation to be entirely speculative, based on assumptions and\npresumptions. Without knowing the contents of the said film and only by\nrelying on some news articles, the Plaintiff cannot argue that the depiction in\nthe films is intended to be tarnished by the Defendants. The Court finds no\nprima facie case in favour of the Plaintiff&#x27;s tort action for defamation and is\nimpelled to reject the prayer for injunction, in light of the law <a href=\"/doc/158628950/\" id=\"a_65\">laid down in</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/930035/\" id=\"a_66\">Melepurath</a> (supra, at paras 6-8), that the civil wrong or the tort action\nbased on defamation is in personam and would not survive the death of the\ncomplainant.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">34.   The Plaintiff also claims injury to his personal image, and damage to\nhis reputation as well. The reasons discussed above would apply equally to\nthe Plaintiff&#x27;s personal tort action, for which, without viewing the content of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                  Page 35 of 42</span>\n the films and on the mere basis of the material placed on record, there is no\ncompelling reason to grant an injunction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">PLAINTIFF&#x27;S RIGHT   TO   PRIVACY   VERSUS   D EFENDANTS&#x27; RIGHT    TO   FREEDOM\nOF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">35.   This brings us to the intersection where competing rights of the\nparties takes us to the much debatable issue which recurrently arises\nwhenever a Plaintiff&#x27;s rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a> are pitted against a\ndefendant&#x27;s rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. In\nsuch cases, the courts have to strike a balance and align the rights and\ninterests of the parties. Mr. Vikas Singh has fleetingly argued that the right\nof free speech, in matters of news reporting, does not enjoy the same\nprotection when it comes to matters of commercial exploitation. The\nargument is misconceived, and one cannot read this classification of core\nand non-core rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India. The\nprotection and guarantee provided by the Constitution would apply with\nequal rigour, even if the publication leads to commercial gain.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">36.   On this issue, firstly, as discussed above, we must not lose sight that\nthe Defendants claim of the film being a fictional rendition of true events\nsurrounding the lives of film/TV personalities, including Plaintiff&#x27;s son, who\nhas reportedly passed away due to unnatural causes. They have firmly stated\nthat nowhere has the Plaintiff or his family or SSR&#x27;s name, image, persona,\nlikeness etc. been used by them. The only resemblance to SSR, as\nDefendants have asserted, would be an imaginary dramatization of some of\nthe events occurred in his life. The artistic freedom to create fictional works\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 36 of 42</span>\n cannot be controlled, limited, or confined within set boundaries. An artist&#x27;s\ninspiration can come from any source, and the court cannot filter real-life\nevents. This Court finds merit in the submission of the Defendants that\ndetails of the demise of SSR received widespread and protracted news\ncoverage in all media, which are available in the public domain, and form a\npart of the public record. The Court also finds merit in the contention of\nDefendant No. 3 that if information of events which have occurred is already\nin the public domain, one cannot plead any violation of right to privacy if a\nmovie is inspired from such events. Admittedly, there are several news\nreports, articles, write-ups, features, videos, etc. on this topic which are\nwidely available in public domain. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_104\">This fact is admitted by the Plaintiff in\nthe suit. The Defendants are also quick to point out that the Plaintiff has not\nraised any objections against author/publishers of such information, and\ntherefore now cannot plead violation of privacy, particularly when such\nmovie does not use any photos, images, caricature or name of the Plaintiff&#x27;s\nson. If the events that form the subject matter of the film are in the public\nsphere, in terms of there being prior reporting of the matter in controversy,\nthe Court does not find any justification to restrain publication of work that\nis claimed to be fictional and only draws inspiration from such events. On\nthis issue, it also pertinent to note the following extract from <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_70\">R. Rajagopal v.\nState of Tamil Nadu</a> (supra):</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      &quot;28. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above\n      discussion:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the\n      citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a\n      right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation,\n      motherhood, child bearing and education among other matters. None can publish\n      anything concerning the above matters without his consent - whether truthful or\n      otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating\n      the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                           Page 37 of 42</span>\n       damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts\n      himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning\n      the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon\n      public records including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\n      becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it\n      becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others. We\n      are, however, of the opinion that in the interest of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(2)]</a> an\n      exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a\n      sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\n      to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      (3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above - indeed, this is not an\n      exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious,\n      right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not\n      available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\n      official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts and\n      statements which are not true, unless the official establishes that the publication\n      was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n      would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that\n      he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n      prove that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved\n      to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant would\n      have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious that in\n      matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the\n      same protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs\n      no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for\n      contempt of court and the Parliament and Legislatures protected as their\n      privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_73\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_74\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India,\n      represent exceptions to this rule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      (4) So far as the government, local authority and other organs and institutions\n      exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot maintain a suit for\n      damages for defaming them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_75\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or any\n      similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the press or\n      media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">      (6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to impose\n      a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot;                      (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"793946\" id=\"span_106\">37.   The Plaintiff has argued that the news articles covering the death of\nthe Plaintiff are not verified and cannot be construed as &#x27;public record&#x27; in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                         Page 38 of 42</span>\n terms of <a href=\"/doc/121771355/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 2(e)</a> of the Public Records Act and <a href=\"/doc/1227984/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 74</a> of the\nEvidence Act and further relies upon <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_78\">Phoolan Devi</a> (supra), to argue that the\nusage of newspaper articles and reports is not to be construed as &#x27;public\nrecord&#x27;. However, this argument cannot discern the fact that the events\nrelating to the life and demise of SSR are in public domain.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_108\">Even in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_79\">R. Rajagopal</a> (supra), it was held that the Petitioners in the said case had\nright to publish what they alleged to be a life-story/autobiography, insofar as\nit appears from the public records, even without the consent or authorisation\nof said person. Further it was held that if they go beyond that and publish his\nlife story, that may be evading the right of privacy, they will be liable for\nconsequences in accordance with law. Here, the fictional rendition for\ndramatic presentation based on certain events falls within the scope of\nartistic freedom of expression and speech.</span> Similarly, in the case of Ram\nGopal Verma (supra), the Madras High Court set aside an injunctive order\nagainst a movie made by the Appellant therein, on the ground that violation\nof right of privacy cannot be pleaded by the Respondent when events which\noccurred in her life are already in the public domain and covered widely by\nthe news. The court held that as long as the Respondent&#x27;s name was not used\nand a disclaimer was published along with the movie, the appellants cannot\nbe disallowed from making a movie based on such events.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">38.   Accordingly, since the Defendants&#x27; films are neither portrayed as a\nbiopic, nor a factual narration of what transpired in the life of the SSR, and\nare depicted to be complete fictional and inspired from certain events which\nhave occurred in the past and have been widely discussed and are available\nin public domain, the Court finds no to reason to grant a restraining order.\nMoreover, Defendants No. 1-3 have inserted the following disclaimer to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                               Page 39 of 42</span>\n their film:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       &quot;Disclaimer: all characters, names, locations, buildings, properties, assigned are\n       all fictitious, if there is any resemblance to any location, person, property, etc. it\n       is purely coincidental and not intentional. Any mention of a community, language\n       or region in this film is not intended to inflict contempt at any point. The film must\n       therefore be viewed as purely a non-commenting source of harmless\n       entertainment not designed to hurt or disdain any individual or a community.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">39.    Lastly, breach of privacy is not being asserted on the ground of\ndefamation. It is founded primarily on the commercial exploitation of the\npersonality of the celebrity, which, as elaborated hereinafter, can be\nadequately remedied by award of damages/compensation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">40.    Before moving on to the other issues, we must note that the right to\nprivacy has also been invoked not just of the deceased but also in respect of\nthe right of the family of SSR. The submissions on this aspect are unspecific\nand vague. No definite instance has been presented by the Plaintiff to show\nhow this right is infringed and therefore, the plea is devoid of merit.\nNevertheless, the views noted above, expressed with respect to SSR&#x27;s\nprivacy, which is alleged to be infringed, would be equally applicable to the\nPlaintiff&#x27;s personal cause of action emanating from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India, as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">PRINCIPLES RELATING TO GRANT OF INJUNCTION\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">41.    In view of the above, this Court opines that the Plaintiff has failed to\nestablish a prima facie case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">42.    The Court finds merit in the contention of the Defendants that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                          Page 40 of 42</span>\n Plaintiff&#x27;s action is belated. SSR passed away on 14th June, 2020. News on\nhis death was widely circulated in the media. Production of the said film was\npublicly announced in August 2020. Admittedly, in September, 2020,\nPlaintiff&#x27;s counsel made a public statement that, &quot;no film, serial etc. shall be\nallowed on Plaintiff&#x27;s son without Plaintiff&#x27;s consent&quot;. Defendant No. 1-3\nhave filed numerous documents to show that the said film was being\npublicized and promoted since August, 2020. Therefore, Plaintiff ought to\nhave been aware that these Defendants were in the process of producing the\nsaid film as early as September, 2020. Plaintiff has filed the present suit\nclose to the release of the said film, after substantial time, money and effort\nhave been expended by Defendant No. 1-3 on production and promotion.\nFor this reason, the balance of convenience lies entirely in favour of the\nDefendants.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">43.   On the aspect of irreparable loss, we may note that the suit is not\npremised as a tortious action for defamation. It is founded on the basis of\nbreach of celebrity/publicity rights inhering to the Plaintiff. It is thus opined\nthat if an interim order is granted, it would be difficult to compensate the\nDefendants in the event Plaintiff ultimately does not succeed in the suit.\nWhereas, the Plaintiff can always re-apply at a later juncture for injunction,\nif there is a change in circumstances after the release of the said film, and\nhas an adequate remedy of being compensated by award of damages, if the\nPlaintiff proves in trial that the celebrity/publicity rights were inheritable\nand inured to him exclusively. To ensure that, the Defendants are directed to\nrender complete and true accounts of the revenue earned from the films by\nway of sale/licensing of all rights relating to the films.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">CS(COMM) 187/2021                                                 Page 41 of 42</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\"> 44.   In view of the above, the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the\nthree-pronged test for grant of pre-emptory injunction to restrain exhibition\nof the films.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">45.
