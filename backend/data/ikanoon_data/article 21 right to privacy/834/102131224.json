Therefore, the petitioners have not\n\nbeen able to make out a prima facie so as to persuade this Court\n\nto pass any interim injunction order in regard to the movie in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">10.   Secondly, this Court has seen as to whether there is balance\n\nof convenience in favour of the petitioners in the present case; the\n\nnews related to the movie in question was started long time back,\n\nwhile the present petition was preferred just few days prior to\n\nrelease of the movie in question, more particularly, even when the\n\ntrailer of the movie was aired on 08.05.2023. The movie in\n\nquestion has already been released over the OTT Platform on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                       (Downloaded on 26/05/2023 at 11:40:50 PM)</span>\n [2023/RJJD/016907]                 (10 of 11)                    [CW-6922/2023]\n\n\n23.05.2023 in the morning. Therefore, at this juncture, if any\n\ninterim order, as prayed by the petitioners herein, is passed\n\nagainst the movie in question, the same would result into\n\nunwarranted and huge financial loss to the respondent-producer of\n\nthe film. Thus, in the given factual matrix, on that count also, this\n\nCourt does not find any case to be made out for passing any\n\ninterim order as prayed by the petitioners herein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">11.   Thirdly, this Court has seen as to whether any case of\n\nirreparable loss was made out by the petitioners in the present\n\ncase; the petitioners can seek compensation against damages and\n\ndefamation, if there is any violation of the reputation and dignity\n\nof the petitioners, on the part of the respondents; however, this\n\nCourt does not find that in the given factual matrix, any\n\nirreparable loss is being caused to the petitioners herein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">12.   This Court further observes that as per the trailer of the\n\nmovie in question, there is nothing directly found related to the\n\npetitioner no.2, which could persuade this Court to grant the relief\n\nprayed for in the stay application filed by the petitioners; however,\n\nin the opinion of this Court, all the issues involved in the present\n\ncase, can be decided by this Court only at the time of final hearing\n\nof the writ petition, after having proper assistance from the Union\n\nof India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">13.   Thus, in light of the aforesaid observations and looking into\n\nthe factual matrix of the present case, this Court does not find it a\n\nfit case so as to grant any relief to the petitioners in the present\n\nstay application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                     (Downloaded on 26/05/2023 at 11:40:50 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">                                    [2023/RJJD/016907]                 (11 of 11)                    [CW-6922/2023]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                                   14.   Consequently, the present stay application is dismissed.\n\n                                   However, the dismissal of the stay application shall not preclude\n\n                                   either of the parties to raise their legal issues, which they wish to,\n\n                                   at the time of final disposal of the writ petition, on merits.
