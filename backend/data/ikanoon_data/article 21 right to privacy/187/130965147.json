In this\ncontext, it is imperative to draw the distinction between a statutory\nbody/government entity vis-à-vis a corporate established under the <a href=\"/doc/172276913/\" id=\"a_13\">Companies\nAct, 2013</a> and a banking company licensed to carry out banking activities under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_14\">BR Act</a>. Merely because the corporate has got a statutory approval to carry on\na particular line of business does not ipso facto make it a statutory body or a\ngovernment body/Public Authority under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">RTI Act</a>. Equally it is\nimportant to appreciate that solely because a private banking company has an\noversight by RBI does not indicate that it is a Public Authority within the meaning\nof the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_16\">RTI Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_3\">A careful reading of the judgment pronounced by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India\nin the matter of <a href=\"/doc/37517217/\" id=\"a_17\">Thalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited &amp; Ors. Vs. State of\nKerala &amp; Ors.</a> [(2013) 16 SCC 82] (&quot;Thalappalam Judgment&quot;) would reveal the\njudicial rationale behind this distinction. In this context, this Hon&#x27;ble Commission\nmay be pleased to consider the Thalappalam Judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt, which clearly recognizes the distinction between a statutory/government\nbody vis-à-vis a corporate body incorporated under a statute.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">f) In the Thalappalam Judgment, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that the right to\ninformation and right to privacy are not absolute rights, both the rights, one of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         4</span>\n which falls under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the other under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\nof India, can obviously be regulated, restricted and curtailed in the larger public\ninterest. It was further held that the public authority also is not legally obliged to\ngive or provide information even if it is held, or under its control, if that\ninformation falls under clause (j) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while substantiating its stand with a number of\nprecedents also held that if the information sought for is personal and has no\nrelationship with any public activity or interest or it will not sub-serve larger public\ninterest, the public authority or the officer concerned is not legally obliged to\nprovide those information. Also the Court stressed that the authority finds that\ninformation sought for can be made available in the larger public interest, then\nthe officer should record his reasons in writing before providing the information,\nbecause the person from whom information is sought for, has also a right to\nprivacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\nRelevant portion of the Thalappalam Judgment is reproduced below for your ready\nreference: &quot;The right to information and right to privacy are, therefore, not\nabsolute rights, both the rights, one of which falls under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the\nother under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, can obviously be regulated,\nrestricted and curtailed in the larger public interest. Absolute or uncontrolled\nindividual rights do not and cannot exist in any modern State. Citizens&#x27; right to get\ninformation is statutorily recognised by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_24\">RTI Act</a>, but at the same time\nlimitations are also provided in the Act itself, which is discernible from the\nPreamble and other provisions of the Act. First of all, the scope and ambit of the\nexpression &quot;public authority&quot; has been restricted by a statutory definition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 2(h)</a> limiting it to the categories mentioned therein which exhaust itself,\nunless the context otherwise requires. Citizens, as already indicated by us, have a\nright to get information, but can have access only to the information &quot;held&quot; and\nunder the &quot;control of public authorities&quot;, with limitations. If the information is not\nstatutorily accessible by a public authority, as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act,\nevidently, those information will not be under the &quot;control of the public authority&quot;.\nResultantly, it will not be possible for the citizens to secure access to those\ninformation which are not under the control of the public authority. The citizens, in\nthat event, can always claim a right to privacy, the right of a citizen to access\ninformation should be respected, so also a citizen&#x27;s right to privacy. 62. The public\nauthority also is not legally obliged to give or provide information even if it is held,\nor under its control, if that information falls under clause (j) of subsection (1) of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8</a>. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_5\"><a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is of considerable importance so far as this case is\nconcerned, hence given below, for ready reference: &quot;8. Exemption from disclosure\nof information.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           5</span>\n no obligation to give any citizen-- (a)-(i) *** (j) information which relates to\npersonal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public\nactivity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of\nthe individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\nInformation Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that\nthe larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that\nthe information which cannot be denied to Parliament or a State Legislature shall\nnot be denied to any person.&quot; We would like to humbly submit that the FAA&#x27;s\ndecision to disclose the Information to the RTI Applicant, might be in direct\nviolation of the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India. g) We request you to\nnote that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_29\">Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal N\nMistry (&quot;Jayantilal Judgment</a>&quot;) on the one hand directed RBI to disclose inspection\nreports with the RTI applicants, while on the other, exempted certain information\nthat meets the threshold <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_30\">laid down in</a> paragraph 76 of the Jayantilal Judgment,\nfrom such disclosure. h) We would like to further respectfully submit that while\ndisclosing information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_31\">RTI Act</a>, regard should have been accorded to the\nconfidential nature of the information, irrespective of whether the bank is a\nprivate commercial banks or public sector bank. However, it is pertinent to\nmention that the situation in case of a private commercial bank is more serious.\nUnlike PSU banks, which are generally recapitalised and substantially financed by\nGovernment of India, private sector banks rely majorly on foreign investors for\ncapital and is dependent on them to a great extent. It is the money from foreign\nsources that is crucial in developing the country and its infrastructure, apart from\ngenerating employment. As such, the peculiar position of the private sector bank\ncannot and ought not to be ignored and any leak in the confidential information\npertaining to the Bank, is fatal, not only for the Bank, but may also result in far\nreaching negative consequences on the economy as a whole. i) The FAA failed to\nappreciate that the Bank, like any other bank, is bound by a confidentiality\narrangement with its customers /constituents. However, the same is partially\npierced and revealed to RBI, considering the regulatory supervisory authority\nconferred on RBI by the RBI Act and BR Act. This cannot be further extrapolated by\nthe RTI Applicant under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_32\">RTI Act</a>, as the consequences\n/ramifications of misuse of the Information are extremely wide and incalculable j)\nIn this regard, FAA should have been mindful that in a banking company, there are\nmultiple stakeholders viz., depositors, borrowers, employees, shareholders,\nbondholders, lenders to the Bank (domestic, foreign (FDI, FII)) etc. All of them may\nnot appreciate the nuances of the information contained in the Risk Assessment\nReports, for financial position as on 31 March 2018 and in the responses\n(compliances) received from the Bank. Hence, the Information sought by the RTI\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          6</span>\n Applicant under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_33\">RTI Act</a>, if misused or abused, would have far reaching\nconsequences not only to the Bank and may even cause a systemic impact on the\neconomy. k) We also respectfully submit that there is no public interest being\nserved by deciding to share the Information sought by the RTI Applicant. On the\ncontrary, it is causing serious harm and injury to the interest of the Bank. The\nfinancial stability of the country is paramount and depends on the strength of its\nfinancial sector. Any wrong reporting by the media basis the Information sought\nby the RTI Applicant, if shared and misused by him, can have devastating\nconsequences and can irreparably damage the reputation of the Bank. It is a\nstatutory protection given to banking companies, that no one will act in a manner\ncalculated to undermine the confidence of the depositors in the banking company\n(Section 36 AD of the BR Act). It is extremely unclear as to how the RTI Applicant is\ngoing to use the Information sought from RBI.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_8\">The Respondent, during the hearing, submitted that the information sought by\nthe RTI applicant in his RTI application should be disclosed as per <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_34\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>\ncase.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">Decision:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_9\">In the facts of the instant case, it is pertinent to note that a decision of a\ncoordinate bench of the Commission in the matter of various third-party banks vs.\nRBI vide File No. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 + Ors. dated 05.05.2022 covers a\ndetailed discussion inter alia on the same nature of information sought for from\nthe RBI and the reliance placed by RBI on the <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_35\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case. Suffice to say\nthat the issues raised in the instant case are encapsulated in that same discussion\nof the coordinate bench in the following manner:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_10\">&quot;39. A comprehensive view has to be taken on the objection filed by the\ninstitutions. These objectives has to be deliberated and adjudicated in the light of\n<a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_36\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case and other judicial pronouncements relevant in such\nmatter, some of which have been referred by the Commission in the above parts\nas well. The Commission while examining various objections realize that the Writ\nPetitions filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India is seeking directions of\nthe Supreme Court for non-disclosure of certain aspects of these audit/inspection\nreport and any such guidance in these Writ Petitions will have direct bearing and\nprovide further clarity to the CPIO/FAA in adjudicating various aspects of\ndisclosure/non-disclosure of reports or the information/data which are part of\nthese reports under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_37\">RTI Act</a>.</span> The Commission takes note that\nall the cases/second appeals filed herein are based on interpretations of RBI Vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                         7</span>\n Jayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judicial pronouncements requesting for\nfull disclosure vis-à-vis with exemptions under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act for non-\ndisclosure of full or parts of these reports.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_12\">40. In view of the above observations, the Commission is of the view that\nthe reports generated in the hands of regulatory public authority in discharge of\nits statutory obligations are information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, as the\nregulator and the regulated entities are not governed by fiduciary relationship.\nThe orders of the Commission to their effect has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_40\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case and the position is unchanged even\ntoday. Various objections filed by banks/financial institutions, to be examined,\nanalyzed and adjudicated upon, are related to various data and information\nsubmitted to the Reserve Bank of India by these financial institutions explaining\ntheir operations, commercial decisions, clients data etc. under statutory\nobligations can be disclosed as such. There are apparently two set of such\ninformation which have been shared by the institutions with the regulator under\nstatutory obligation. First is the information/data of clients relating to their\nbusiness/commercial operations, financial transactions, business and commercial\nstrategy which is shared by clients with financial institutions in full trust and\nconfidence and is held by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from disclosure\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_41\">RTI Act</a> in their hands. Second set is the information relating to business\nstrategy, decisions, transactions, other operational data etc. of financial\ninstitutions have been bearing on their competitive position which also enjoys the\nexemption from disclosure in their hands, if it is a public authority or otherwise,\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_42\">RTI Act</a>. Some of such data, on case to case basis be sensitive enough for\nprotection of national interest. The Commission is of the view that the protection\nof disclosure of information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of\nfinancial institutions does not evaporate once such data/information is shared, in\ngood faith and trust, with the regulator under statutory obligation.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_13\">Various\nobservations of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_44\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case also does not\nindicate so and decision of the regulator to consider redacting such\ndata/information while disclosing the reports is aligned with this and other judicial\npronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_14\">41. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of\nthe CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and later\nin the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be required to\nadjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of the Commission\nafresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take view on various\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                         8</span>\n objections filed by the Banks and Financial Institutions and submissions made by\napplicant to reach the decision in favour or against redaction of various parts of\nthe report on case to case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_45\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other relevant judgments, some of\nwhich have been referred in this order as well. Hence, with these observations the\norders passed by the CPIO and FAA in these matters are set aside and the cases\nare being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication afresh.

It is amply clear that Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged are admitted in Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court wherein guidance and\ndirection has been sought on non-disclosure of certain type of information which\nare essentially the part of the Annual Inspection Report/RAR, etc. These petitions\nalso seek protection of interim communication between regulator and the\nregulated entity in the process of finalization of these reports or otherwise. It is\nobvious that decision in these Writ Petitions will provide clarity and guidance to\nthe Public Authority on redaction/non-disclosure of a set of information inspite of\nbeing part of these reports which are open to disclosure. At this stage, any\ndecision by the Public Authority will amount to pre-judging the issues pending\nadmitted Writ Petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Various banks,\nfinancial institutions, respondent public authority and the RTI applicant have\nalready impleaded party and are presenting their arguments before the Apex\nCourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">       43. Hence, any decision of redaction or disclosure of information, without\nwaiting for decision in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged may cause irrevocable damage against right of privacy and protection of\ncommercial interest. Hence, the respondent public authority if expedient may\nwait for the outcome in Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and others\ntagged or seek clarification from the Hon&#x27;ble Court and accordingly decide these\nRTI applications by following process as enumerated in the earlier paras by the\nCommission in the interest of principles of natural justice. While disclosing the\ninformation they should be cautious in taking a considerate view balancing right\nto privacy, protection of national and commercial interest on one hand vis-à-vis\nlarger public interest.
