It is contended that the aforesaid Act is an outdated\n\nlegislation and is a complete anachronism with modern\n\nday life and thinking. It is a discriminatory law that\n\ncriminalises the transgender community unfairly without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               5</span>\n\n\n\n\nany legal basis. Vires of the Act has been questioned on\n\nthe ground that it targets the transgender community and\n\ntreats them as a distinct class with no reasonable basis\n\nfor such classification, besides permitting discrimination\n\nagainst persons on the basis of their sexual orientation\n\nand gender, thus violating <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_5\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_6\">15(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_3\">6.1. It is further contended that the Act imposes\n\narbitrary restriction on the freedom of speech and\n\nexpression of the transgender community and also\n\nbreaches their fundamental right to privacy. Thus, the\n\nsaid legislation is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_7\">Articles 19(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It is also contended that the said legislation\n\nis against the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_9\">National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) v. Union\n\nof India1</a> which has declared eunuchs etc., as third gender\n\nand also directing the Central and State Governments to\n\ntreat them as socially and educationally backward classes\n\nof citizens.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_4\">Petitioners have also relied upon the decision\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n    (2014) 5 SCC 438\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                            6</span>\n\n\n\n\nof the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_10\">K.S.Puttaswamy v.

Respondent No.2 i.e., State of Telangana represented\n\nby   the    Principal    Secretary          to    Home    Department,\n\nGovernment of Telangana has filed affidavit.\n\n\n9.1. Adverting to the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_14\">NALSA</a> (supra), it is stated that following <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_15\">the said decision</a>,\n\nParliament     has      enacted       the        <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_16\">Transgender     Persons\n\n(Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a>. Referring to various\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_17\">Transgender Persons (Protection of\n\nRights) Act, 2019</a>, it is stated that the said Act is the first\n\nstatutory    enactment     meant        for       amelioration   of   the\n\nconditions of the transgenders. The said Act answers all\n\nthe contentions raised by the petitioners.\n\n\n9.2. Insofar challenge to the <a href=\"/doc/134117190/\" id=\"a_18\">Telangana Eunuchs Act,\n\n1329</a> Fasli is concerned, it is the contention of respondent\n\nNo.2 that the Central Act i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_19\">Transgender Persons\n\n(Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a> covers only welfare\n\nmeasures to transgenders. There is no provision for\n\nspecific offences committed usually by transgenders i.e.,\n\nkidnapping or emasculating boys or committing unnatural\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                8</span>\n\n\n\n\noffences or any other offences abetting the commission of\n\nsuch offences. The impugned legislation governs and\n\naddresses the same. Petitioners claim for protection in\n\nrespect of offences committed by transgenders under the\n\nguise of discrimination is not justified. The issue of\n\ndiscrimination has been taken care of by the Central Act.\n\n\n9.3. It   is   stated   that   both   Parliament   and   State\n\nLegislatures can legislate on the same subject. Referring to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/66135850/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 4</a> of the Telangana Eunuchs Act, 1329 Fasli, it is\n\ncontended that fundamental right is not absolute. It is\n\nsubject to reasonable restriction in the collective interest\n\nof the society. It is asserted that the said Act is enacted in\n\nthe interest of public order and to identify transgenders\n\nindulging in such acts. There is no discrimination shown\n\nagainst the transgenders in the Act. In the circumstances,\n\nrespondent No.2 seeks dismissal of the public interest\n\nlitigation.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                      9</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">10.

It is stated that during the covid-19 induced lock\n\ndown, the transgender community faced extreme hardship\n\nparticularly with regard to ration, social security and\n\naccess to medication. G.O.Ms.No.17 dated 05.11.2014\n\nwas issued by the Panchayat Raj and Rural Development\n\n(RD.I) Department of the Government of Telangana\n\nintroducing a new scheme called Aasara Pension Scheme\n\nto provide substantial financial benefits to the most\n\nvulnerable sections of society to ensure a secured life with\n\ndignity for all poor persons. The scheme would be\n\navailable   to    people     having     HIV/AIDS,    widows,\n\nincapacitated weavers and toddy toppers who have lost\n\ntheir means of livelihood with growing age. The categories\n\nof pensioners entitled to Aasara Pension Scheme are as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">     (1)    old age;          (2)     widow;\n\n     (3)    disabled;         (4)     weavers;\n\n     (5)    toddy toppers;    (6)     persons with HIV/AIDS\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                  16</span>\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">15.3.

On 27.04.2020, this Court had passed the following\n\norder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">              This writ petition has highlighted the plight of\n      transgender population during the Covid-19 lockdown.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              Mr. B.S.

Thereafter,     Mr.        B.S.Prasad,             learned      Advocate\n\nGeneral submitted two reports before the Court, the first\n\nreport dated 26.05.2020 and the second report dated\n\n04.06.2020. On consideration of the two reports, this\n\nCourt passed the following order on 29.06.2020:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           A bare perusal of the report dated 26.05.2020,\n     clearly reveals that it is a highly vague report. For, in\n     para 5, the respondents claim that &quot;they are making\n     efforts to establish two Shelter Homes exclusively for\n     transgenders&quot;. But the details of where these shelter\n     homes are being constructed, and the capacity of these\n     shelter homes, are not given in the report.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           Similarly, although this Court had asked the\n     exact figures with regard to the population of the\n     transgender community in the major cities of the State,\n     in para 11, a bald statement has been made that &quot;the\n     Government has identified 2,175 transgenders in the\n     State of Telangana&quot;. Whether this number includes the\n     transgenders in the major cities of Telangana, or merely\n     in the GHMC area is unclear.\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_6\">           Similarly,     in     para    14,   it   is    claimed     that\n     &quot;medicines     are   also    made     available       as   per   the\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     requirement of the transgender community&quot;. It is\n     unclear as to when the medicines were made available?\n     By whom they were made available? And to whom they\n     were made available? Therefore, the essential data is\n     conspicuously missing.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               18</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      Lastly, it is also stated that &quot;dry ration supplies\nare arranged for 610 persons through local donors, and\nNGOs by reaching out to them&quot;. Despite the fact that\nthe Government claims that it is distributing 5 kg rice,\n1 kg tur dal, 200 grams chilli powder, 1 lr sunflower\noil, 250 grams tamarind, 250 grams salt, 1 kg onions,\n200 grams turmeric powder, one dettol soap, and one\nreusable   cloth    mask,    it    is   unclear   whether    the\nmembers of the transgender community are permitted\nto buy their foodgrains from the Public Distribution\nSystem, or not?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\nmany of the transgender community do not have\navailability of ration cards, because in the form to be\nfilled up for seeking ration card, the third gender is not\nindicated. In the absence of having valid ration cards,\nthe transgender community is denied access to the\nPublic Distribution System. She further submits that\ndue to the spike in COVID-19 cases in the State,\ndespite the fact that a member of the transgender\ncommunity     may    be     contracting     COVID-19,       their\nmedical care requires special attention. For, according\nto the learned counsel, it is this community which is\nunfortunately neglected, and is ostracized by large\nnumber of people. Until and unless special wards are\ndesignated for housing the transgender community in\nthe hospitals, there is a grave possibility that the\nmedical    needs,    and    medical       attention   of    such\ntransgender persons may be neglected by medical staff,\nand even by doctors. Therefore, she prays that a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                 19</span>\n\n\n\n\n     direction should be issued to the Government to\n     instruct the medical staff, firstly, to have separate ward\n     for the members of the transgender community, and to\n     instruct them to take special care of such persons.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">           This Court directs the learned Advocate General\n     to immediately bring the two points raised by the\n     learned counsel for the petitioner to the notice of the\n     Government. He is also directed to inform this Court on\n     06.07.2020 as to whether any action has been taken by\n     the Government on these points, or not?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_51\">\n16.2. When the matter was taken up next on 07.07.2020,\n\nMs. Kothari, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners\n\nsubmitted before the Court that the State had taken a\n\nposition that it was not able to distribute foodgrains to the\n\nmembers of the transgender community who do not have\n\nration cards in their names. However, she pointed out that\n\nunder the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana, Hon&#x27;ble\n\nPrime Minister had announced that foodgrains would be\n\ndistributed even to those who are not holders of ration\n\ncards.   The    aforesaid     scheme      was     extended        upto\n\nNovember, 2020. She pointed out that according to the\n\nCentral Government, State of Telangana had lifted till then\n\nonly one per cent of the foodgrains being distributed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                               20</span>\n\n\n\n\nunder the Central Scheme. Therefore, it was submitted\n\nthat the transgender community members who do not\n\nhave ration cards in their names should be given the\n\nbenefit of the Central Scheme. On such submission, this\n\nCourt directed learned Advocate General to instruct the\n\nCommissioner of Civil Supplies Department for extending\n\nthe benefit of the Central Scheme not only to the members\n\nof the transgender community but also to others who may\n\nnot be holding ration cards in their names. Learned\n\nAdvocate General sought for time to file a report with\n\nregard to the distribution of food grains to those members\n\nof the transgender community who were not holders of\n\nration cards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_25\">16.3. On the next date of hearing i.e., 14.07.2020, learned\n\nAdvocate General submitted a report of the Commissioner\n\nof   Civil   Supplies   and   ex   officio   Secretary   to   the\n\nGovernment of Telangana dated 10.07.2020. As per the\n\nreport, 10 kgs of rice were being provided to each\n\ntransgender person free of cost from July to November,\n\n2020 under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Yojana. However,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                           21</span>\n\n\n\n\nthis Court recorded that it was not clear whether 10 kgs of\n\nrice would be for the entire period from July to November,\n\n2020 or for each month. That apart, this Court noticed\n\nthat as per the instructions issued by the Commissioner,\n\na member of transgender community was subjected either\n\nto medical examination by a doctor or to a physical\n\nexamination by the Revenue Tahsildar. Referring to the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_23\">NALSA</a> (supra), this\n\nCourt observed that subjecting a transgender person to\n\nphysical examination was not only demeaning but also\n\namounted to violation of the right to privacy. It was\n\nthereafter that this Court passed the following order on\n\n14.07.2020:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           The learned counsel for the petitioner submits\n     that most of the transgenders do have either the\n     Aadhaar   card     or        other    Government     identification\n     documents with them. These documents would clearly\n     reveal that they are transgenders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">           Therefore,        it    should      be   sufficient   if   the\n     Government were to direct the Fair Price Shop owners\n     to distribute 10 kgs of rice per month to the\n     transgenders, who presents either the Aadhaar Card,\n     or any other Governmental identification document.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                    22</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            The   learned    counsel       further   submits   that,\n     according to the instructions, a transgender is required\n     to go to a Fair Price Shop having ePOS devices, but is\n     not permitted to pick up 10 kgs of rice from manually\n     operated Fair Price Shops. According to her, the\n     inability of transgender to pick up the quantity of rice\n     from manually operated fair price shop will create\n     difficulties for the transgender community.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">            Once these factors have been pointed out to the\n     learned Advocate General, he seeks time for getting\n     further instructions from the Government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">            This Court directs the respondents to clarify\n     whether 10 kgs of rice would be available on a monthly\n     basis or for the complete period of July to November.\n     2020. Secondly, the Government should consider if the\n     transgender can receive the said quantity of rice on the\n     basis of the Aadhaar card, or any other Government\n     identification    document.        Thirdly,   the   Government\n     should   also     consider    if     transgender    community\n     members can pick up the above mentioned quantities\n     of rice from any of the Fair Price Shops rather than\n     restricting it only to the shop having ePOS devices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">            The learned Advocate General seeks time to\n     address this Court on the above mentioned directions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">16.4. In the hearing held on 20.08.2020, this Court\n\nnoticed   that        as    per     report         dated    05.07.2020,\n\nCommissioner to the Government of Telangana, Vaidya\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                             23</span>\n\n\n\n\nVidhana Parishad had issued an order on 02.07.2020\n\ndirecting Superintendents of all hospitals providing covid-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">19 protection not to neglect transgender patients. Another\n\nreport dated 22.07.2020 was submitted by the learned\n\nAdvocate General which communicated that members of\n\nthe transgender community would be given 10 kg rice per\n\nmonth free of cost till November, 2020. Thus, this Court\n\nnoted that concerns expressed in the public interest\n\nlitigation were taken care of. Nonetheless learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the petitioners made a submission before the\n\nCourt to keep the PIL pending so that the Court can\n\nmonitor as to whether orders issued by the Government\n\nwere being implemented in letter and spirit. Observing\n\nthat the concern of the petitioners is a genuine one, this\n\nCourt decided to keep the PIL pending.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">16.5. In the proceedings held on 04.03.2021, learned\n\nSenior Counsel for the petitioners had submitted that the\n\nPIL would be confined to the question regarding permitting\n\ntransgender persons to apply for and to receive social\n\nsecurity pension under the Aasara Scheme and for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                  24</span>\n\n\n\n\ndirecting       the   respondents       to   extend    Arogyasree\n\nGovernment Medical Insurance to them.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">16.6. In the hearing held on 02.02.2022, Mr. Santosh\n\nKumar, learned counsel appearing for the State submitted\n\nbefore    the     Court   that   the    State    was   vaccinating\n\ntransgender persons irrespective of whether one possessed\n\nAadhaar card or not. In the light of the above, this Court\n\ndirected the State Government to provide a centre in each\n\ndistrict of the State of Telangana in the District Hospital\n\nfor vaccination of people belonging to the transgender\n\ncommunity. This Court clarified that while carrying out\n\nvaccination, the said officials would not insist on proof of\n\nAadhaar card as large number of members of transgender\n\ncommunity do not possess Aadhaar card. As a matter of\n\nfact,    learned      Government       Pleader   had   given   an\n\nundertaking that State would not have any objection in\n\nvaccinating people from the transgender community even\n\nwithout Aadhaar card. This Court directed the State to\n\npublicize the details of the centres in the media so that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                       25</span>\n\n\n\n\npeople   from        the   transgender           community            could    get\n\nthemselves vaccinated.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">16.7. In the proceedings held on 20.09.2022, this Court\n\nhad passed the following order:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">              This    Public     Interest   Litigation       (PIL)    raises\n     important       questions     relating      to    the   transgender\n     community in the State of Telangana.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">              Though order dated 02.02.2022 was confined to\n     vaccination      of   the    members        of    the   transgender\n     community, we are of the view that the prayer made in\n     the Public Interest Litigation transcends such limited\n     issue.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">              On the next date, learned Government Pleader\n     shall submit the particulars of the Board recently\n     constituted      by   the     State    of    Telangana      for    the\n     transgender community and also of extension of the\n     benefit conferred by G.O.Ms.No.17 dated 05.11.2014 to\n     members of the transgender community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">16.8. This Court observed that though initial thrust of the\n\nPIL was confined to vaccination of the members of the\n\ntransgender      community,            issue          raised     in     the    PIL\n\ntranscends such limited issue.

In the hearing held on 19.10.2022, a detailed order\n\nwas passed by this Court. First part of the order dated\n\n19.10.2022 dealt with constitution of the State Welfare\n\nBoard (briefly, &#x27;the Board&#x27;) for transgender persons in the\n\nState of Telangana.

Member Secretary of Telangana State Legal Services\n\nAuthority had submitted a consolidated report dated\n\n10.07.2020 after compiling the reports received from\n\nDistrict Legal Services Authorities. In his report, Member\n\nSecretary has stated that the common problem of\n\ntransgender persons in the State of Telangana is that their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                             32</span>\n\n\n\n\nfamily members have necked them out from their houses\n\nor because of societal pressure or humiliation, thereby\n\nthey themselves have left the family. As a result, most\n\ntransgenders have become shelterless. Compounding the\n\nproblem is the disinclination of landlords to rent out\n\npremises to transgenders. In the circumstances, there is a\n\ndire necessity to have shelter homes for transgenders\n\nexclusively. However, the Government has no special\n\nschemes or programmes in this regard. Representations\n\nsubmitted by persons belonging to the transgender\n\ncommunity for allotting them single bedroom or double\n\nbedroom houses have also not been considered.\n\n\n18.1. Member   Secretary   has   pointed   out   that   most\n\ntransgenders have no fixed source of income. Most\n\nemployers are reluctant to provide any employment to\n\ntransgenders irrespective of whether it is a private sector\n\nor the public sector. Government is also not providing any\n\nfinancial assistance to enable the transgenders to have\n\ntheir own start ups. In this regard, the role played by the\n\nbanks has also been found to be wanting. In such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                  33</span>\n\n\n\n\ncircumstances, some transgenders have resorted to either\n\nbegging or by acting as sex workers to earn some money\n\nper day. However, there are some NGOs in the State who\n\nhave   reached    out     to    the   transgender   community.\n\nTransgenders complain that they have no ration cards or\n\nvoter identification cards in their names. One of the\n\ncommon grievances of the transgenders is regarding grant\n\nof   ration   cards,    voter   identification   cards   etc.   by\n\nrecognizing them as transgenders. Though some of them\n\nare graduates and postgraduates, they are unable to get\n\nemployment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">\n18.2. Substantial number of transgenders are engaged as\n\nsex workers as a result some of them have been infected\n\nwith HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases. Access to\n\nhealth is a big issue for them. Many hospitals refuse to\n\ngive admission to transgenders because the data format\n\ndoes not provide for a special column for transgenders.\n\n\n18.3. Even in public toilets, transgenders are not allowed\n\nentry either into toilets meant for men or into toilets\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                        34</span>\n\n\n\n\nmeant for women. Therefore, they require separate toilets\n\nearmarked for transgenders. They have stated that they\n\nhave been humiliated and facing insults on a daily basis.\n\nAs per the report, the number of transgenders could be\n\nidentified at 12,233.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">19.

As per G.O.Ms.No.21 dated 19.08.2022, the function\n\nof the State Welfare Board for transgender persons is to\n\nadvise the State Government on the formulation of\n\npolicies, programmes, legislation and projects with respect\n\nto transgender persons; to monitor and evaluate the\n\nimpact of policies and programmes designed for achieving\n\nequality and full participation of transgender persons; to\n\nreview and coordinate the activities of all the departments\n\nof the Government and other Governmental and non-\n\nGovernmental        organizations   which   are   dealing   with\n\nmatters relating to transgender persons etc. It further\n\nprovided that tenure of the State Welfare Board would be\n\nfor a period of two years but it would meet at least once in\n\nsix months to advise the State Government on effective\n\nimplementation of the Transgender Persons (Protection of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                 37</span>\n\n\n\n\nRights) Act, 2019 and to perform such other functions in\n\nrelation to transgenders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">20.

The action plan also provides\n\nfor skill development training and economic rehabilitation\n\nscheme. There is also a provision to set up a help desk for\n\ntransgender persons in the Directorate of Welfare of\n\nDisabled and Senior Citizens. It has been proposed to\n\nhave   a corpus      fund    and      for     this,   an    amount     of\n\nRs.53,05,360-00 has been earmarked. However, it is seen\n\nthat to be eligible for undertaking such skill development\n\ntraining or economic rehabilitation, certain eligibility\n\ncriteria have been fixed, such as, having an identity card\n\nissued by the concerned District Collector or a certificate\n\nissued by a competent authority; age proof certificate (age\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                38</span>\n\n\n\n\nbetween 21 to 55 years); Aadhaar card; educational\n\nqualification etc. In fact, for availing the benefit of\n\neconomic rehabilitation scheme, a transgender person is\n\nalso required to furnish recent income certificate issued by\n\nthe Tahsildar concerned who has less than Rs.2 lakhs for\n\nurban and Rs.1.5 lakh for rural areas.

Ventilating such grievances, National Legal Services\n\nAuthority moved the Supreme Court contending that non-\n\nrecognition of the identity of persons belonging to the\n\ntransgender community violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Hijras and eunuchs falling within the\n\ntransgender community claimed legal status as a third\n\ngender with all legal and constitutional protection. In <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_39\">the\n\nsaid judgment</a>, Supreme Court observed that transgender\n\nis generally described as an umbrella term for persons\n\nwhose gender identity/gender expression or behaviour do\n\nnot conform to their biological sex. Transgender may also\n\ntake in persons who do not identify with their sex\n\nassigned at birth, which include hijras/eunuchs. Hijras\n\nare not men by virtue of anatomical appearance and\n\npsychologically, they are also not women; though they are\n\nlike women they have no female reproductive organ and\n\nno menstruation. Since hijras do not have reproductive\n\ncapacities as either men or women, they are neither men\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                43</span>\n\n\n\n\nnor women and claim to be third gender. Among hijras,\n\nthere are emasculated men, non-emasculated men and\n\ninter-sexed persons i.e. hermaphrodites. Transgender also\n\nincludes      persons   who     intend   to   undergo    Sex\n\nReassignment Surgery (SRS) or have undergone Sex\n\nReassignment Surgery to align their biological sex with\n\ntheir gender identity in order to become male or female.\n\nThey    are     generally   called   transsexual     persons.\n\nResultantly, the term &#x27;transgender&#x27; in contemporary usage\n\nhas become an umbrella term that is used to describe a\n\nwide range of identities and experiences including but not\n\nlimited to pre-operative, post-operative and non-operative\n\ntranssexual people who strongly identify with the gender\n\nopposite to their biological sex: male and female.\n\n\n23.1. After tracing the history of transgenders in the world\n\nand    in   India,   Supreme    Court    acknowledged    that\n\ntransgender people, as a whole, face multiple forms of\n\noppression in this country. Discrimination is writ large\n\nand pronounced, especially in the field of healthcare,\n\nemployment, education, not to speak of social exclusion.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                44</span>\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court referred to the report submitted by United\n\nNations Development Programme - India, 2010 which\n\nhighlighted the extreme necessity of taking emergent steps\n\nto improve the sexual and mental health of transgenders\n\nand also to address the issue of social exclusion. It was\n\nnoted that social exclusion and discrimination on the\n\nground of gender stating that one does not conform to the\n\nbinary gender i.e. male or female, strongly prevail in India.\n\nSupreme Court observed that many of them experience\n\nviolence and discrimination because of their sexual\n\norientation or gender identity.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">\n23.2. Supreme Court agreed with the petitioners that\n\ndespite   constitutional     guarantee       of   equality,   hijras/\n\ntransgender      persons     have      been       facing      extreme\n\ndiscrimination    in   all   spheres    of    the    society.   Non-\n\nrecognition of the identity of hijras/transgender persons\n\ndenies them equal protection of law, thereby leaving them\n\nextremely vulnerable to harassment, violence and sexual\n\nassault in public spaces, at home and in jail. Non-\n\nrecognition of identity of hijras/transgender persons\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                     45</span>\n\n\n\n\nresults in them facing extreme discrimination in all\n\nspheres    of     the    society,   especially   in   the   field   of\n\nemployment, education, healthcare etc. They face huge\n\ndiscrimination in access to public spaces like restaurants,\n\ncinemas, shops, malls etc. Further, access to public toilets\n\nis also a serious problem which they face quite often.\n\nSince     there    are     no   separate    toilet    facilities    for\n\nhijras/transgender persons they have to use male toilets\n\nwhere they are prone to sexual assault or harassment.\n\nSupreme Court concluded that discrimination on the\n\nground of sexual orientation or gender identity impairs\n\nequality before law and equal protection of law and\n\nviolates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n\n23.3. Adverting to <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_41\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_42\">16</a> of the Constitution,\n\nSupreme Court observed that both the articles prohibit\n\ndiscrimination against any citizen on certain enumerated\n\ngrounds including on the ground of sex. In fact, both the\n\narticles prohibit all forms of gender bias and gender based\n\ndiscrimination. After a careful analysis, Supreme Court\n\nopined that the expression &#x27;sex&#x27; used in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_43\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_44\">16</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                              46</span>\n\n\n\n\nis not just limited to biological sex of male or female but\n\nintended to include people who consider themselves to be\n\nneither male nor female. Supreme Court noted that\n\ntransgenders have been systematically denied the rights\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 15(2)</a> i.e. not to be subjected to any\n\ndisability, liability, restriction or condition in regard to\n\naccess to public places. Transgenders have also not been\n\nafforded special provisions envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 15(4)</a>\n\nfor the advancement of the socially and educationally\n\nbackward classes. State is bound to take some affirmative\n\naction for their advancement so that injustice done to\n\nthem for centuries could be remedied. Supreme Court has\n\nheld that transgenders have also been denied rights under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1011960/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 16(2)</a> and discriminated against in respect of\n\nemployment under the State on the ground of sex. They\n\nare entitled to reservation in the matter of appointment as\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution. State is\n\nbound to take affirmative action to give them due\n\nrepresentation in public services.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                              47</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n\n\n\n\n23.4. Thus, Supreme Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_49\">Articles 15(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_50\">(4)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 16(4)</a> read with the Directive Principles of State\n\nPolicy and various international instruments to which\n\nIndia is a party, call for social equality which transgenders\n\ncould realise, only if facilities and opportunities are\n\nextended to them so that they can also live with dignity\n\nand equal status with other genders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">\n23.5. Elaborating further, Supreme Court observed that\n\nright to dignity which is a facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21</a> forms an\n\nessential part of our constitutional culture. Recognition of\n\none&#x27;s gender identity lies at the heart of the fundamental\n\nright to dignity. Gender constitutes the core of one&#x27;s sense\n\nof being as well as an integral part of a person&#x27;s identity.\n\nLegal recognition of gender identity is, therefore, part of\n\nthe right to dignity guaranteed under the Constitution.\n\nDetermination of gender to which a person belongs is to\n\nbe decided by the person concerned. Thus, gender identity\n\nis integral to the dignity of an individual and is at the core\n\nof personal autonomy which is traceable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21.</a>\n\nThus, hijras and eunuchs have to be considered as third\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                              48</span>\n\n\n\n\ngender over and above the binary genders under our\n\nConstitution and the laws. It was, therefore, concluded\n\nthat discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or\n\ngender identity includes any discrimination, exclusion,\n\nrestriction or preference which has the effect of nullifying\n\nor transposing equality by the law or the equal protection\n\nof laws guaranteed under our Constitution.\n\n\n23.6. In his concurring judgment, Dr A.K.Sikri, J posed\n\nthe question as to whether transgenders who are neither\n\nmales nor females have a right to be identified or\n\ncategorised as third gender? He observed that indubitably,\n\nthe issue of choice of gender identity has all the trappings\n\nof human rights. The issue is not limited to the exercise of\n\nchoice of gender/sex. Many rights which flow from this\n\nchoice also come into play, inasmuch as not giving them\n\nthe status of a third gender results in depriving the\n\ncommunity of transgenders of many of their valuable\n\nrights and privileges which other persons enjoy as citizens\n\nof this country. There is also deprivation of social and\n\ncultural participation which results into eclipsing their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                              49</span>\n\n\n\n\naccess to education and health services. Justice Sikri has\n\nmentioned that though in the past transgenders in India\n\nwere treated with great respect, that is not the scenario\n\nany longer. Attrition of their status was triggered with the\n\npassing of the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_54\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> which deemed\n\nthe entire community of hijra persons as innately\n\ncriminals and adapted to the systematic commission of\n\nnon-bailable offences. There could not have been more\n\nhardship caused to this community with the passing of\n\nthe aforesaid brutal legislation during the British regime\n\nwith the vicious and savage mindset. To add insult to\n\nirreparable injury caused, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 377</a> IPC was misused\n\nand abused as there was a tendency in the British period\n\nto arrest and prosecute transgender persons under\n\nSection 377 merely on suspicion. Though there may have\n\nbeen marginal improvement in the social and economic\n\ncondition of transgenders in India, it is still far from\n\nsatisfactory. The transgender community continues to face\n\ndifferent   kinds   of   economic   blockade   and    social\n\ndegradation. They still face multiple forms of oppression in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                  50</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe    country.      Discrimination       qua   them   is    clearly\n\ndiscernible    in     various    fields    including   healthcare,\n\nemployment, education, social cohesion etc.\n\n\n23.7. Justice Sikri asserted that transgenders are also\n\ncitizens of this country. They have equal right to achieve\n\ntheir potential as human beings. For this purpose, not\n\nonly   are    they    entitled   to   proper    education,   social\n\nassimilation, access to public and other places and\n\nemployment opportunities as well. Therefore, it was\n\nopined that by recognising transgenders as third gender,\n\nthey would be able to enjoy their human rights to which\n\nthey are largely deprived of for want of this recognition.\n\nThereafter, the learned Judge recorded some of the\n\ncommon and reported problems of people belonging to the\n\ntransgender community, such as, harassment at home,\n\nharassment by the police, rape, discrimination, abuse in\n\npublic places, lack of educational facilities, lack of medical\n\nfacilities, homelessness, unemployment, depression etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                     51</span>\n\n\n\n\n23.8. In the circumstances, Supreme Court declared and\n\ndirected as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">            135.1.

Thus, besides declaring transgenders as third gender\n\nfor the purpose of safeguarding their rights, Centre and\n\nState Governments have been directed to grant legal\n\nrecognition of the gender identity of the transgenders such\n\nas male, female or third gender.

When the petitioner challenged her termination\n\nfrom service, stand taken by the police department was\n\nthat since the petitioner did not disclose that she was a\n\ntransgender, she was terminated from service as she was\n\nnot eligible for appointment as a woman police constable.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_81\">Learned      Single   Judge      framed     two     questions   for\n\nconsideration:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">             (1) Whether petitioner was a female and eligible\n      for appointment as a woman police constable?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">             (2) Whether termination of the petitioner from\n      service on the ground that she was a transgender\n      was sustainable?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_69\">25.1. It was in that context, learned Single Judge delved\n\ninto the concept of sex and gender as appearing in\n\ndifferent statutes. Learned Single Judge observed that the\n\nterm &#x27;sex&#x27; operates within the classic binary biological\n\nmodel in which human beings are divided into either male\n\nor female. Transsexuals do not fit in with the said\n\nclassification in the domestic Indian laws as they do not fit\n\nin within the binary classification of sex. They feel\n\ncompletely     neglected    by    the     society   and    by   the\n\ngovernment. Learned Single Judge observed that in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                              55</span>\n\n\n\n\nIndian scenario, an individual for all practical purposes is\n\nidentified either as a male or as a female. Therefore, it was\n\nwrong on the part of the State authority to discard the\n\ndescription of gender by the petitioner on the basis of\n\nmedical report. Learned Single Judge also referred to the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_63\">NALSA</a> (supra) and\n\nthereafter concluded that since Indian laws did not\n\nrecognise third gender and was confined to the binary\n\nclassification of male and female, in such a case an\n\nindividual who is born as a female but declared as a\n\ntranssexual by the medical community cannot be kept out\n\nof the binary classification. Such medically declared\n\ntranssexuals are to be treated by the legal community only\n\nby the sexual identity given to them at birth and\n\nrecognised by the society. If such medically declared\n\ntranssexuals are kept outside the purview of the female\n\nsexual identity, then the State would not be in a position\n\nto   provide   employment    and   other   opportunities    to\n\ntransgenders by treating them as females or as males. In\n\nsuch   circumstances,    Madras    High    Court   held   that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                     56</span>\n\n\n\n\npetitioner was a female in the legal parlance and thus\n\neligible for appointment as a woman police constable.\n\nConsequently, the impugned order of termination from\n\nservice        was     found   to   be   unsustainable   and   was\n\naccordingly set aside.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">\n25.2.

It has been observed that if\n\nprivacy is to be construed as a protected constitutional\n\nvalue, it would redefine in significant ways our concepts of\n\nliberty and the entitlements that flow out of its protection.\n\n\n30.1.

The right &quot;to\n\nbe let alone&quot; represents a manifestation of &quot;an inviolate\n\npersonality&quot;, a core of freedom and liberty from which the\n\nhuman being had to be free from intrusion. The right &quot;to\n\nbe let alone&quot; is not so much an incident of property (in\n\nview of advancing technology) as a reflection of the\n\ninviolable nature of the human personality.\n\n\n30.2. On the above basis, Supreme Court proceeded in its\n\nanalysis that privacy is a concomitant of the right of the\n\nindividual to exercise control over his or her personality. It\n\nfinds an origin in the notion that there are certain rights\n\nwhich are natural to or inherent in a human being.\n\nNatural          rights   are   inalienable   because   they   are\n\ninseparable from the human personality. The human\n\nelement in life is impossible to conceive without the\n\nexistence of natural rights. Natural rights are not\n\nbestowed by the State. They inhere in human beings\n\nbecause they are human.

Supreme Court, thereafter, made a comprehensive\n\nanalysis of all relevant judicial precedents indicating\n\nevolution of the right to privacy in our constitutional\n\njurisprudence. The analysis indicates the manner in\n\nwhich the debate on the existence of a constitutional right\n\nto   privacy   has   progressed.   The   content   of   the\n\nconstitutional right to privacy and its limitations have\n\nproceeded on a case to case basis, each precedent seeking\n\nto build upon and follow the previous formulations.\n\nThereafter, Supreme Court observed that these decisions\n\nhad to weave a jurisprudence of privacy as new challenges\n\nemerged from a variety of sources: wiretapping, narco-\n\nanalysis, gender based identity, medical information,\n\ninformational autonomy and other manifestations of\n\nprivacy. The right to privacy has been traced in the\n\ndecisions which have been rendered over the last several\n\ndecades to the guarantee of life and personal liberty in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 21</a> and the freedoms set out in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19.</a> In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                   64</span>\n\n\n\n\naddition, India&#x27;s commitment to a world order founded on\n\nrespect for human rights has been noticed along with the\n\nspecific articles of the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil\n\nand Personal Rights (ICCPR) which embodied the right to\n\nprivacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">\n30.4. Thereafter,       Supreme    Court   observed   that   our\n\nconstitutional      jurisprudence      has    recognised     the\n\ninseparable relationship between protection of life and\n\nliberty with dignity which as a constitutional value finds\n\nadequate expression in the Preamble. The Preamble\n\ncontains the constitutional precepts to facilitate a humane\n\nand compassionate society. The individual is the focal\n\npoint of the Constitution because it is in the realisation of\n\nindividual rights that the collective wellbeing of the\n\ncommunity is determined. Human dignity is an integral\n\npart of the Constitution. Reflections of dignity are found in\n\nthe guarantee against arbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 14</a>), the\n\nfreedoms (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 19</a>) and in the right to life and personal\n\nliberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21</a>).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                              65</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175579179\" id=\"span_101\">30.5.

Union of India11</a> which observed that human dignity is a\n\nconstitutional value and a constitutional goal. Thereafter,\n\nSupreme Court observed that life is precious in itself. But\n\nlife is worth living because of the freedoms which enable\n\neach individual to live a life as it should be lived. The best\n\ndecisions on how life should be lived are entrusted to the\n\nindividual. The duty of the State is to safeguard the ability\n\nto take decisions i.e., the autonomy of the individual, and\n\nnot to dictate those decisions. To live is to live with\n\ndignity. Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental\n\nrights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for\n\neach individual the dignity of existence. Privacy with its\n\nattendant values assures dignity to the individual and it is\n\nonly when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of\n\ntrue substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity\n\nand is a core value which the protection of life and liberty\n\nis intended to achieve.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">11</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">     (2016) 7 SCC 761\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                              66</span>\n\n\n\n\n30.6. It is in that context, Supreme Court repelled the\n\nsubmission that to recognise the right to privacy would\n\nrequire a constitutional amendment and cannot be a\n\nmatter of judicial interpretation. Supreme Court asserted\n\nthat right to privacy is an element of human dignity.\n\nSanctity of privacy lies in its functional relationship with\n\ndignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can lead a life\n\nof dignity by securing the inner recesses of the human\n\npersonality from unwanted intrusion. Privacy recognises\n\nthe autonomy of the individual and the right of every\n\nperson to make essential choices which affect the course\n\nof life. In doing so, privacy recognises that living a life of\n\ndignity is essential for a human being to fulfil the liberties\n\nand   freedoms    which    are    the   cornerstone   of   the\n\nConstitution. To recognise the value of privacy as a\n\nconstitutional entitlement is not to fashion a new\n\nfundamental right by a process of amendment.\n\n\n30.7. Supreme Court however noted that in the evolution\n\nof the doctrine of right to privacy and dignity in India\n\nwhich placed the dignity of the individual and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                       67</span>\n\n\n\n\nfreedoms and liberties at the forefront, there had been a\n\nfew discordant notes. One of them being ADM, Jabalpur v.\n\nShivakant Shukla12 was particularly discussed whereafter,\n\nthe majority view that the remedy for enforcement of the\n\nright to life or liberty would stand suspended when an\n\norder is issued by the President under <a href=\"/doc/1760044/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 359(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution was found to be seriously flawed and\n\nexpressly overruled. The dissenting judgment rendered by\n\nJustice H.R.Khanna that the suspension of the right to\n\nmove any court for the enforcement of the right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> upon a proclamation of emergency would not\n\naffect the enforcement of the basic right to life and liberty\n\nhas been expressly approved. Life and personal liberty are\n\ninalienable             to   human   existence.   These   rights   are\n\nprimordial rights. They constitute rights under natural\n\nlaw. The human element in the life of an individual is\n\nintegrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is\n\nassociated with liberty and freedom.

The right to privacy and the\n\nprotection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">13</span>\n     (2014) 1 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">14</span>\n     (2018) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                              69</span>\n\n\n\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_93\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_94\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">21</a>\n\nof the Constitution. Supreme Court also elaborated that\n\nsexual orientation is an essential component of identity.\n\nEqual protection demands protection of the identity of\n\nevery individual without discrimination.\n\n\n30.9. While repelling the submission that privacy is a\n\nprivilege for the few, Supreme Court has held that every\n\nindividual in society irrespective of social class or\n\neconomic status is entitled to the intimacy and autonomy\n\nwhich privacy protects. Pursuit of happiness is founded\n\nupon autonomy and dignity. Both are essential attributes\n\nof privacy which makes no distinction between the birth\n\nmarks of individuals.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">\n30.10. Thereafter, Supreme Court posed the question as\n\nto what does privacy postulate? Answering this question,\n\nSupreme Court held that privacy postulates reservation of\n\na private space for the individual, described as the right to\n\nbe let alone. The concept is founded on the autonomy of\n\nthe individual. The ability of an individual to make choices\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                  70</span>\n\n\n\n\nlies at the core of the human personality. The notion of\n\nprivacy enables the individual to assert and control the\n\nhuman element which is inseparable from the personality\n\nof the individual. The inviolable nature of the human\n\npersonality is manifested in the ability to make decisions\n\non matters intimate to human life. Since the observations\n\nof the Supreme Court are extremely relevant for our\n\npresent discourse, it is important to extract and restate\n\nthe same. Supreme Court held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">      R. Essential Nature of Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">           297. What,    then,   does   privacy   postulate?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">      Privacy postulates the reservation of a private space\n      for the individual, described as the right to be let\n      alone. The concept is founded on the autonomy of\n      the individual. The ability of an individual to make\n      choices lies at the core of the human personality. The\n      notion of privacy enables the individual to assert and\n      control the human element which is inseparable from\n      the personality of the individual.

The body and the mind are\n      inseparable elements of the human personality. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                   71</span>\n\n\n\n\nintegrity of the body and the sanctity of the mind can\nexist   on    the      foundation        that     each     individual\npossesses an inalienable ability and right to preserve\na private space in which the human personality can\ndevelop. Without the ability to make choices, the\ninviolability of the personality would be in doubt.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_8\">Recognising        a    zone      of     privacy      is    but     an\nacknowledgment          that     each      individual       must     be\nentitled     to   chart     and        pursue     the      course    of\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">development of personality. Hence privacy is a\npostulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts and\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an\nindividual are entitled to a zone of privacy where one\nis free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy,\nan individual is not judged by others. Privacy enables\neach individual to take crucial decisions which find\nexpression in the human personality. It enables\nindividuals       to   preserve        their    beliefs,    thoughts,\nexpressions,       ideas,      ideologies,       preferences        and\nchoices against societal demands of homogeneity.\nPrivacy is an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of\nthe right of the individual to be different and to stand\nagainst the tide of conformity in creating a zone of\nsolitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\nsearching glare of publicity in matters which are\npersonal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the\nperson and not to the place where it is associated.\nPrivacy constitutes the foundation of all liberty\nbecause it is in privacy that the individual can decide\nhow liberty is best exercised. Individual dignity and\nprivacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven out\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                    72</span>\n\n\n\n\nof a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural\nculture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">   298. Privacy of the individual is an essential\naspect of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and\ninstrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human\ndignity    is   an      entitlement      or   a     constitutionally\nprotected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet,\ndignity and freedom are inseparably intertwined,\neach being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The\nability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy\nenables the realisation of the full value of life and\nliberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which\nprivacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised\nin privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual to retain\nthe autonomy of the body and mind. The autonomy\nof the individual is the ability to make decisions on\nvital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been\ncouched as an independent fundamental right. But\nthat   does       not    detract    from      the    constitutional\nprotection afforded to it, once the true nature of\nprivacy and its relationship with those fundamental\nrights which are expressly protected is understood.\nPrivacy    lies    across     the       spectrum      of   protected\nfreedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee\nagainst arbitrary State action. It prevents the State\nfrom      discriminating       between         individuals.     The\ndestruction by the State of a sanctified personal\nspace whether of the body or of the mind is violative\nof the guarantee against arbitrary State action.\nPrivacy of the body entitles an individual to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                            73</span>\n\n\n\n\nintegrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The\nintersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and\nprivacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought,\nthe freedom to believe in what is right, and the\nfreedom     of   self-determination.     When      these\nguarantees intersect with gender, they create a\nprivate space which protects all those elements\nwhich are crucial to gender identity. The family,\nmarriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all\nintegral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the\nprivacy of the individual recognises an inviolable\nright to determine how freedom shall be exercised.\nAn individual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a\nrealm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul\nin a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the\noutcome of a process of thought. A musician\ncontemplates upon notes which musically lead to\nsilence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the\nability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or\ninteract with others. These are crucial aspects of\npersonhood. The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 19</a> can be\nfulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide\nupon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have\na choice of preferences on various facets of life\nincluding what and how one will eat, the way one will\ndress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other\nmatters on which autonomy and self-determination\nrequire a choice to be made within the privacy of the\nmind. The constitutional right to the freedom of\nreligion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                             74</span>\n\n\n\n\nability to choose a faith and the freedom to express\nor not express those choices to the world. These are\nsome illustrations of the manner in which privacy\nfacilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of\nliberty. The Constitution does not contain a separate\narticle telling us that privacy has been declared to be\na fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the\nprovisions of Part III with an alpha-suffixed right to\nprivacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting.\nDignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside\nwithin the inalienable values of life, liberty and\nfreedom which the Constitution has recognised.\nPrivacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of\nthe individual. It is a constitutional value which\nstraddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights\nand protects for the individual a zone of choice and\nself-determination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">   299. Privacy represents the core of the human\npersonality   and     recognises      the   ability   of   each\nindividual to make choices and to take decisions\ngoverning matters intimate and personal. Yet, it is\nnecessary to acknowledge that individuals live in\ncommunities    and      work     in    communities.        Their\npersonalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their\nsocial environment. The individual is not a hermit.\nThe lives of individuals are as much a social\nphenomenon. In their interactions              with others,\nindividuals are constantly engaged in behavioural\npatterns and in relationships impacting on the rest of\nsociety. Equally, the life of the individual is being\nconsistently shaped by cultural and social values\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                             75</span>\n\n\n\n\nimbibed from living in the community. This state of\nflux   which   represents   a    constant   evolution   of\nindividual personhood in the relationship with the\nrest of society provides the rationale for reserving to\nthe individual a zone of repose. The lives which\nindividuals lead as members of society engender a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. The notion of a\nreasonable expectation of privacy has elements both\nof a subjective and objective nature. Privacy at a\nsubjective level is a reflection of those areas where an\nindividual desires to be left alone. On an objective\nplane, privacy is defined by those constitutional\nvalues which shape the content of the protected zone\nwhere the individual ought to be left alone. The\nnotion that there must exist a reasonable expectation\nof privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the\nindividual has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the\nother, the exercise of individual choices is subject to\nthe rights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance,\nan individual who possesses a plot of land may\ndecide to build upon it subject to zoning regulations.\nIf the building bye-laws define the area upon which\nconstruction can be raised or the height of the\nboundary wall around the property, the right to\nprivacy of the individual is conditioned by regulations\ndesigned to protect the interests of the community in\nplanned spaces. Hence while the individual is\nentitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not\nonly on the subjective expectation of the individual\nbut on an objective principle which defines a\nreasonable expectation.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                  76</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">\n\n\n\n\n30.11. Thus, Supreme Court has explained that privacy of\n\nthe individual is an essential aspect of dignity. The family,\n\nmarriage, procreation and sexual orientation are integral\n\nto the dignity of the individual. Dignity cannot exist\n\nwithout privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values\n\nof life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has\n\nrecognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the\n\nsanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value\n\nwhich straddles across the spectrum of fundamental\n\nrights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and\n\nself-determination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">\n30.12. Thus, Supreme Court concluded that privacy is a\n\nconstitutionally protected right which emerges primarily\n\nfrom the guarantee of life and personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution. Privacy is the constitutional core of\n\nhuman      dignity.    Privacy   includes    at    its   core   the\n\npreservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of family\n\nlife,   marriage,     procreation,    the   home     and    sexual\n\norientation. It also connotes a right to be left alone. It\n\nsafeguards individual autonomy and recognises the ability\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                               77</span>\n\n\n\n\nof the individual to control vital aspects of his/her life.\n\nHowever, Supreme Court recognised that privacy is not an\n\nabsolute right in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 21</a> but invasion of\n\nprivacy must be justified on the basis of law which\n\nstipulates a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable.\n\nPrivacy has both positive and negative content. The\n\nnegative content restrains the State from committing an\n\nintrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\n\npositive content imposes an obligation on the State to take\n\nall necessary measures to protect the privacy of the\n\nindividual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">31.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_122\">In <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_101\">Navtej Singh Johar</a> (supra), Constitution Bench of\n\nthe Supreme Court was considering the constitutional\n\ndimension of the contention that right to sexuality, right\n\nto sexual autonomy and right to choice of a sexual partner\n\nare part of the right to life guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution; the further contention was to declare\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 377</a> IPC as unconstitutional.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100472805\" id=\"span_123\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_124\">It may be mentioned\n\nthat two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_104\">Suresh\n\nKumar   Koushal</a>   (supra)   had    overturned   the   decision\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                         78</span>\n\n\n\n\nrendered by the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/100472805/\" id=\"a_105\">Naz Foundation V.\n\nGovernment (NCT of Delhi</a>)15.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_126\">The correctness of <a href=\"/doc/100472805/\" id=\"a_106\">the said\n\ndecision</a> was also an issue in <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_107\">Navtej Singh Johar</a> (supra).\n\n\n31.1.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_127\">Chief Justice Deepak Misra in the leading judgment\n\nadverted to the Delhi High Court decision in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_108\">Naz\n\nFoundation</a> (supra).

This\ndignity is special to the man/woman who has a right\nto enjoy his/her life as per the constitutional norms\nand should not be allowed to wither and perish like a\nmushroom. It is a directional shift from conceptual\nmacrocosm to cognizable microcosm. When such\nculture grows, there is an affirmative move towards a\nmore     inclusive     and      egalitarian     society.    Non-\nacceptance of the same would tantamount to denial\nof human rights to people and one cannot be\noblivious of the saying of Nelson Mandela -- &quot;to deny\npeople their human rights is to challenge their very\nhumanity&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                               83</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_140\">31.4.

In   his     concurring          judgment,    Justice       Dr.\n\nD.Y.Chandrachud (as His Lordship then was) observed\n\nthat sexuality is a natural and precious aspect of life, an\n\nessential and fundamental part of humanity. Sexual rights\n\nare entitlements related to sexuality and emanate from the\n\nrights to freedom, equality, privacy, autonomy and dignity\n\nof all people. Individuals belonging to sexual and gender\n\nminorities experience discrimination, stigmatisation and\n\nin some cases denial of care on account of their sexual\n\norientation and gender identity. Under our constitutional\n\nscheme, no minority group must suffer deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right because they do not adhere to the\n\nmajoritarian     way   of    life.     LGBT     people    including\n\ntransgender      persons    are      excluded   from     access    to\n\nhealthcare due to the societal stigma attached to sexual\n\nidentity. Being particularly vulnerable to contraction of\n\nHIV, this deprivation can only be described as cruel and\n\ndebilitating. The indignity suffered by the sexual minority\n\ncannot, by any means, stand the test of constitutional\n\nvalidity. Thereafter, it has been summed up as follows:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                89</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">   606. Constitutional morality will impact upon any\nlaw which deprives the LGBT individuals of their\nentitlement to a full and equal citizenship. After the\nConstitution came into force, no law can be divorced\nfrom constitutional morality. Society cannot dictate\nthe expression of sexuality            between consenting\nadults.   That   is    a   private    affair.    Constitutional\nmorality will supersede any culture or tradition.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">   607.

Thus, it has been held that constitutional morality\n\nwill impact upon any law which deprives the LGBT\n\nindividuals of their entitlement to a full and equal\n\ncitizenship.

As per Section 14, the appropriate Government\n\nshall formulate welfare schemes and programmes to\n\nfacilitate and support livelihood for transgender persons\n\nincluding their vocational training and self-employment.\n\n\n32.13.

Rule 2(i) defines &quot;medical intervention&quot; to include\n\nany gender affirming medical intervention undertaken by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                              101</span>\n\n\n\n\nan individual to facilitate the transition to their self-\n\nidentified gender, including but not limited to counselling,\n\nhormonal therapy, and surgical intervention, if any.\n\n\n33.2. Rules 3 to 7 deal with application for issue of\n\ncertificate of identity and the procedure for issuance of\n\nsuch certificate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_139\">\n33.3. In case of rejection of application for issuing a\n\ncertificate of identity, the District Magistrate under Rule 8\n\nis required to inform the applicant the reason or reasons\n\nfor such rejection within thirty days. However, the District\n\nMagistrate has the power to review the decision of\n\nrejection based on the reply submitted by the applicant on\n\nthe reason for rejection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">\n33.4.

Rule 10 is crucial. It deals with welfare measures,\n\neducation, social security and health of transgender\n\npersons   by    appropriate       Government.            Sub-rule   (1)\n\nmandates the appropriate Government to constitute a\n\nwelfare board for the transgender persons for the purpose\n\nof protecting their rights and interests and facilitating\n\naccess to schemes and welfare measures framed by the\n\nGovernment.      Sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 provides that the\n\nappropriate     Government         shall   review        all   existing\n\neducational, social security, health schemes, welfare\n\nmeasures,      vocational       training   and     self-employment\n\nschemes to include transgender persons to protect their\n\nrights and interests and to facilitate their access to such\n\nschemes     and       welfare     measures        framed       by   the\n\nGovernment.      As    per      sub-rule   (3),    the    appropriate\n\nGovernment shall formulate educational, social security,\n\nhealth schemes and welfare schemes and programmes in\n\na manner which is transgender sensitive, non-stigmatising\n\nand non-discriminatory to transgender persons. Sub-rule\n\n(4) says that the appropriate Government shall take\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                 103</span>\n\n\n\n\nadequate     steps    to    prohibit    discrimination        in   any\n\nGovernment or private organisation, or private and public\n\neducational institution under their purview and ensure\n\nequitable    access    to   social     and   public    spaces.     The\n\nappropriate Government under sub-rule (5) is under a\n\nmandate      to    create   institutional     and     infrastructure\n\nfacilities, including but not limited to rehabilitation centre,\n\nseparate wards in hospitals and washrooms in the\n\nestablishment within two years from the date of coming\n\ninto force of the rules to protect the rights of transgender\n\npersons.     That apart, the appropriate Government is\n\nrequired to carry out an awareness campaign to educate,\n\ncommunicate and train transgender persons to avail\n\nthemselves of the benefits of welfare schemes etc., besides\n\nproviding for sensitisation of various establishments\n\nincluding sensitisation of teachers and faculty members in\n\neducational institutions to foster respect for equality and\n\ngender diversity as well as sensitization of healthcare\n\nprofessionals etc. Very importantly, as per sub-rule (8) of\n\nRule   10,   all    educational      institutions     shall   have   a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                     104</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommittee which shall be accessible for transgender\n\npersons in case of any harassment or discrimination.\n\nUnder   sub-rule       (9)    of     Rule     10,    the    appropriate\n\nGovernment shall create institutional and infrastructure\n\nfacilities including but not limited to temporary shelters,\n\nshort-stay homes and accommodation, choice of male,\n\nfemale or separate wards in hospitals and washrooms in\n\nthe establishment within two years of coming into force of\n\nthese rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">\n32.6.

Such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                               105</span>\n\n\n\n\na policy shall include preventive administrative and police\n\nmeasures to protect vulnerable transgender communities.\n\nThe appropriate Government shall be responsible for\n\nsupervision of timely prosecution of individuals charged\n\nunder Section 18 of the Transgender Persons Act or under\n\nany other law for similar offences committed against\n\ntransgender persons. Besides that, under Rule 11(5),\n\nevery State Government shall set up a Transgender\n\nProtection Cell under the charge of the District Magistrate\n\nin each District and under the Director General of Police\n\nin the State to monitor cases of offences against\n\ntransgender persons and to ensure timely registration,\n\ninvestigation and prosecution of such offences.\n\n\n33.7. Under   Rule   12(1),    every   establishment   shall\n\nimplement all measures for providing a safe working\n\nenvironment and to ensure that no transgender person is\n\ndiscriminated in any matter relating to employment etc.\n\n\n33.8. Rule 13 requires the appropriate Government to\n\nensure that every establishment designates a complaint\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                              106</span>\n\n\n\n\nofficer in accordance with Section 11 to enquire into\n\ncomplaints received.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">34.   Annexure II to the Transgender Persons Rules\n\ncontains a list of welfare measures to be considered. It\n\nincludes access to health, access to education including\n\nproviding scholarship for transgender students; access to\n\nhousing including providing affordable housing, shelters\n\nand community centres for at risk transgender youths\n\nproviding nutritious food and counselling etc, welfare\n\nmeasures and economic support.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">35.   After enactment of the Transgender Persons Act and\n\nthe Transgender Persons Rules, Government of Telangana\n\nin the Department for Women, Children, Disabled and\n\nSenior Citizens issued G.O.Ms.No.21 dated 19.08.2022.\n\nVide the said G.O.Ms.No.21 proposal submitted by the\n\nDirector, Welfare of Disabled and Senior Citizens for\n\nconstitution of State Welfare Board for transgender\n\npersons   for   protecting   the   rights   and   interests   of\n\ntransgender persons in terms of Rule 10(1) of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                             107</span>\n\n\n\n\nTransgender Persons Rules was accepted. Whereafter, the\n\nState Welfare Board has been constituted which we have\n\nnoted in our order dated 19.10.2022. While the said\n\nG.O.Ms.No.21 has laid down the functions of the Board,\n\nthe tenure of the Board has been made for two years with\n\nthe caveat that it would meet once in six months to advise\n\nthe State Government on effective implementation of the\n\nTransgender Protection Act and to perform such other\n\nfunctions in relation to transgender persons. We have also\n\nnoted the action plan prepared by the Government of\n\nTelangana for implementation of various welfare activities\n\nfor transgenders for the year 2022-23.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">36.   While we appreciate constitution of the State Welfare\n\nBoard and drawing up of action plan, what is required is\n\nthat the State Welfare Board should take pro-active steps\n\nfor betterment of the transgender population and to\n\nensure implementation not only of the action plan but also\n\nthe provisions of the Transgender Persons Act and the\n\nTransgender Persons Rules. We also feel that having\n\nregard to the mandate of the Legal Services Authority Act,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                             108</span>\n\n\n\n\n1987, the State should also involve the legal services\n\nauthorities while implementing various provisions of the\n\nTransgender Persons Act and the Transgender Persons\n\nRules as well as the action plan. Involvement of legal\n\nservices authorities to implement the aforesaid provisions\n\nwould go a long way in providing access to justice for the\n\ntransgender persons. There are many transgender persons\n\nin the society and to expect all of them to approach the\n\ndistrict magistrate or the revenue divisional officer for a\n\ncertificate of identity would be wholly unrealistic. In\n\nsituation such as this, legal services authorities certainly\n\nhave a role to play. Instead of asking the transgender\n\npersons to approach the authorities for certificate of\n\nidentity or for various other welfare measures, proactive\n\nsteps should be taken to reach out to the members of the\n\ntransgender community considering their vulnerability.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_171\">37.   We further notice that notwithstanding the direction\n\nof the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_164\">NALSA</a> (supra) for providing\n\naffirmative action to persons belonging to the transgender\n\ncommunity as socially and educationally backward class\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">                             109</span>\n\n\n\n\nno such steps have been taken either by the Central\n\nGovernment or by the State Government even though\n\nmore than nine years have elapsed since delivery of the\n\naforesaid judgment.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">38.   We are therefore of the view that till proper\n\nlegislation is brought in place, the State Government as\n\nwell as the Central Government may issue administrative\n\ninstructions providing for reservation to persons belonging\n\nto the transgender community in public employment as\n\nwell as in educational institutions. This would go a long\n\nway in bringing the transgender community into the\n\nmainstream fold.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">39.   We may mention that Government of Telangana in\n\nthe Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Department\n\nhad issued G.O.Ms.No.17 dated 05.11.2014 whereby\n\nGovernment of Telangana as a part of its social safety\n\nneed strategy introduced the Aasara Pension Scheme with\n\na view to ensure secured life with dignity for poor persons.\n\nThe object of the scheme is to protect the most vulnerable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                              110</span>\n\n\n\n\nsections of society in particular &quot;the old and the disabled&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">people having HIV/AIDS, widows, incapacitated weavers\n\nand toddy tappers who have lost their means of livelihood\n\nwith growing age and in order to support their day-to-day\n\nminimum needs to lead a life with dignity and social\n\nsecurity. Government noted that in the past social\n\nsecurity pensions provided were meagre and barely\n\nsufficient to cover the basic minimum requirements of the\n\nneedy. With a view to combat the ever increasing cost of\n\nliving and inflation, the Government introduced the\n\nscheme called &quot;Aasara Pensions&quot; to provide financial\n\nbenefit to all the above categories particularly those who\n\nare most needy. The scheme was made effective from\n\n01.10.2014 and initially the following categories were\n\nmade eligible for Aasara Pension Scheme:\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_9\">        (1) old age;         (2)   widow;\n\n        (3) disabled;        (4)   weavers;\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">        (5) toddy toppers;   (6)   persons with HIV/AIDS\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                  111</span>\n\n\n\n\n39.1. The scheme provides for grant of monthly pension of\n\nRs.1,000/- per month except for the disabled in which\n\ncase it was made Rs.1,500/-.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">40.     In the affidavit filed by the Secretary to the\n\nGovernment of Telangana, Panchayat Raj and Rural\n\nDevelopment Department on 14.10.2022, it is stated that\n\nafter    formation    of   Telangana     State,    Government   of\n\nTelangana had launched Aasara Pension Scheme vide\n\nG.O.Ms.No.17         dated    05.11.2014       wherein   detailed\n\nguidelines have been framed for implementation of the\n\nsaid scheme in the State of Telangana. Society for\n\nElimination of Rural Poverty is the nodal agency for\n\nimplementation of the scheme. As per the affidavit, the\n\nfollowing categories are covered under Aasara Pension\n\nScheme:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">        1. Old Age Pensions\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">        2. Widow Pensions\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">        3.

In the said affidavit, it has been submitted that\n\ntransgender persons are eligible for sanction of pension\n\nunder the Aasara Pension Scheme provided they fall\n\nwithin any of the eligible categories mentioned above.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">41.    We are afraid the State has not appreciated the\n\njudgments of the Supreme Court and different High\n\nCourts as well as proceedings of this Court in the correct\n\nperspective. If widows, disabled persons, beedi workers,\n\nsingle woman, HIV persons etc., are entitled to the benefit\n\nunder the Aasara Pension Scheme as a class, we fail to\n\nunderstand as to why and how transgender persons can\n\nbe excluded from such benefits as a class. As we have\n\ndiscussed above, transgender community is one of the\n\nmost    deprived,     neglected    and   discriminated   against\n\ncommunities in the State and in the country. They have\n\nbeen held to be belonging to socially and economically\n\nbackward class. They fulfil eligibility requirement under\n\nthe Aasara Pension Scheme. We are, therefore, of the view\n\nthat   benefit   of   G.O.Ms.No.17       dated   05.11.2014   as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                               113</span>\n\n\n\n\namended from time to time should be made available to\n\nthe members belonging to the transgender community.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_177\">42.

It may be mentioned that the colonial British\n\nGovernment had enacted the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_175\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> for\n\nregistration of criminal tribes and eunuchs. The preamble\n\nto the said Act states that it was expedient to provide for\n\nregistration, surveillance and control of certain criminal\n\ntribes and eunuchs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">\n43.1. Thus, from the preamble itself, it is seen that the\n\nsaid Act had grouped together certain tribes declared as\n\ncriminal tribes and eunuchs under a single classification.\n\nTherefore, the Act proceeded on the assumption that\n\neunuchs as a class were criminal. As per <a href=\"/doc/102139448/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 2</a>, if the\n\nlocal government had reason to believe that any tribe,\n\ngang or class of persons was addicted to the systematic\n\ncommission of non-bailable offences, it would report the\n\ncase to the Governor General in Council requesting his\n\npermission to declare such tribe, gang or class to be a\n\ncriminal tribe.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                             117</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">\n\n\n\n\n43.2. <a href=\"/doc/96641361/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 3</a> mandated furnishing of reasons in the\n\nreport as to why such tribe, gang or class was considered\n\nto be addicted to the systematic commission of non-\n\nbailable offences etc. While rest of the provisions provide\n\nfor the procedure to deal with such tribe, gang or class\n\ndeclared as criminal tribes, it is Part II of the said Act\n\nwhich has relevance to the present discourse.\n\n\n43.3. Part II comprising of Sections 24 to 31 deal with\n\neunuchs. Section 24 provided for maintenance of a\n\nregister containing the names and residences of all\n\neunuchs residing in any town or place who were\n\nreasonably suspected of kidnapping or castrating children\n\nor committing offences under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 377</a> IPC or abetting\n\nthe commission of any of the said offences. A register of\n\nproperty of such registered eunuchs were also required to\n\nbe maintained. The term &#x27;eunuch&#x27; was defined for the\n\npurpose of the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_179\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> to include all\n\npersons of the male sex who admitted themselves or on\n\nmedical inspection clearly appeared to be impotent.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                              118</span>\n\n\n\n\n43.4. Section 25 provides for lodging of complaint by a\n\nperson on his name being entered in the register of\n\neunuchs. The officer entertaining such a complaint could\n\nenter such person&#x27;s name or erase it or retain it, as he\n\ndeemed fit. However, every order for eraser of such\n\nperson&#x27;s name     should state     the   grounds   for such\n\nerasement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">\n43.5. Section 26 penalised any registered eunuch who\n\nappeared dressed or ornamented like a woman in a public\n\nstreet or place, or in any other place with the intention of\n\nbeing seen from a public street or place or who danced or\n\nplayed music or took part in any public exhibition in a\n\npublic street or place or for hire in a private house. Such a\n\neunuch could be arrested without warrant and punished\n\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which\n\ncould extend to two years or with fine or with both.\n\n\n43.6. Section 27 imposed penalty on a registered eunuch\n\nwho had in his charge or kept in his house or under his\n\ncontrol any boy who had not completed the age of sixteen\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                             119</span>\n\n\n\n\nyears. The penalty prescribed was imprisonment for a\n\nterm which could extend to two years or with fine or with\n\nboth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_162\">\n43.7. Section 28 mandated the jurisdictional magistrate to\n\nreturn such boy to the parents or guardian, if they could\n\nbe discovered. However, if they could not be discovered,\n\nthe magistrate was required to make such arrangements\n\nas he thought necessary for the maintenance and\n\neducation of such boy, in which event the whole or any\n\npart of the fine inflicted under Section 27 would be\n\nemployed in defraying the cost of such arrangements.\n\n\n43.8. As per Section 29, no registered eunuch was capable\n\nof or being or acting as guardian to any minor; or of\n\nmaking a gift; or of making a will, or of adopting a son.\n\nPower to require information as to register a eunuch&#x27;s\n\nproperty   was   provided   in    Section   30.   Any   officer\n\nauthorised by the local government in this behalf could\n\ndirect any eunuch so required to furnish information as to\n\nthe property whether movable property or immovable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                  120</span>\n\n\n\n\nproperty which he possessed or entitled or which was held\n\nby him. If any eunuch intentionally omitted to furnish\n\nsuch information or furnished information which he had\n\nreason to believe to be false was deemed to have\n\ncommitted an offence under <a href=\"/doc/641385/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 176</a> IPC or under 177\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_181\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">44.

After    India   became    independent,   a   high   level\n\ncommittee was constituted to examine the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_184\">Criminal Tribes\n\nAct, 1871</a>, as amended from time to time. Following its\n\nrecommendations, the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_185\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> was\n\nrepealed in 1952. It was one of the most draconian laws\n\nenacted by the colonial Government.

We have already noticed above that eunuchs\n\nwere categorised with such tribes declared as criminal\n\ntribes. Such an enactment was not only arbitrary but had\n\nstigmatised entire communities including the eunuchs as\n\ncriminals. Once a tribe was declared as a criminal tribe or\n\nin case of eunuch, they were presumed to be criminal and\n\npolice had the power of surveillance over them, to arrest\n\nthem and to monitor their day-to-day lives.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_186\">46.
