When these matters were taken up for hearing by us on\n\n30.09.2024 and 01.10.2024, we heard the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nand respondents in all the three writ petitions. We felt that in the light of the\n\ndevelopments in our free speech jurisprudence in the years since 2017, and\n\nin view of the transparency in court proceedings ushered in through\n\ntechnological innovations such as video-conferencing and live streaming of\n\ncourt proceedings, the sole issue that now remains to be considered in these\n\nproceedings can be framed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                  &quot;What is the scope, extent and content of the right to freedom of\n                  speech and expression guaranteed to the press/media under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_8\">Article\n                  19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India, in the context of reporting facts\n W.P.(C).Nos.21108/14,\n24499 &amp; 25718/16                              :: 13 ::\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                                                           2024:KER:82715\n\n\n                  relating to criminal investigations and cases pending adjudication\n                  before various adjudicatory forums in our country ?&quot;\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">By framing the issue as above, we hope to find answers to the following\n\nquestions viz.

A\n                 perception is created for or against the accused in the mind of the laymen.\n                 So much so, that when a judge passes a verdict which may be totally\n                 against the layman&#x27;s perception, it causes him to distrust the integrity of\n                 the very legal system. The time tested system of arriving at the conclusion\n                 of guilt on the basis of legal evidence need not always be a concept which\n                 is familiar to a person untrained in law.

When the court is\n                 full of interested members of the public...it is bound to have the effect that\n                 everybody is more careful about what they do, everyone tries just that\n                 little bit harder and there is a disciplinary effect on the court which would\n                 be totally lacking if there were no critical members of the public or press\n                 present. When one has an order for trial in camera, all the public and\n                 press are evicted at one fell swoop and the entire supervision by the public\n                 is gone&#x27;\n\n\nIn the same vein, our Supreme Court in Swapnil Tripathi v. Supreme\n\nCourt of India - [(2018) 10 SCC 639], in the context of live streaming of\n\njudicial proceedings, observed that first-hand access to court hearings\n\nenables the public and litigants to witness the dialogue between the judges\n\nand the advocates and to form an informed opinion about the judicial\n\nprocess. However, it went on to note that;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                 &#x27;[T]he impact of open courts in our country is diminished by the fact that a\n                 large segment of the society rarely has an opportunity to attend court\n                 proceedings. This is due to constraints like poverty, illiteracy, distance,\n                 cost and lack of awareness about court proceedings. Litigants depend on\n                 information provided by lawyers about what transpired during the course\n                 of hearings. Others, who may not be personally involved in a litigation,\n                 depend on the information provided about judicial decisions in newspapers\n                 and the electronic media. When the description of cases is accurate and\n                 comprehensive, it serves the cause of open justice.

The dissemination of\n\ninformation through various media, including print and electronic media or\n\naudio-visual form, is to ensure that the citizens are enlightened about their\n\nrights and duties, the manner in which they should conduct themselves in a\n\ndemocracy and for enabling a debate on the policies and actions of the\n\ngovernments and ultimately for the development of the society in an\n\negalitarian way. The necessity for the media to provide true and accurate\n\ninformation, along with the necessary context to fully comprehend the same,\n\ncannot be understated.

In other words, whenever a person alleges\n\nthat his/her right under a statute or under common law is infringed on\n\naccount of a media publication, the approach of our courts has been to\n\nprotect the fundamental right of the media under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> to the\n\nextent possible, on the principle that a lesser right of an individual must give\n\nway to the fundamental right of the media that caters to a larger public\n\ninterest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                 12.    A different yardstick is however adopted in cases where a\n\nperson alleges infringement of his/her constitutional right - fundamental or\n\notherwise - on account of the exercise by another person of their\n\nconstitutional right. Whenever the court is confronted with a case involving\n\nconflict of fundamental or other constitutional rights, it has applied the\n\nprinciple of &#x27;balancing of rights&#x27; to resolve the situation. Such balancing of\n\ncompeting fundamental rights has been effected by using either (i) the\n\ncollective interest or public interest standard, (ii) the single proportionality\n\nstandard or (iii) the double proportionality standard. An application of the\n\nsaid standards has helped the court determine which of the competing rights\n\nshould prevail in a given factual situation. As a matter of fact, before the\n\nproportionality standard was adopted, the balancing was done by according\n\nprominence to one of the conflicting fundamental rights over the other based\n\non public interest.

In the first, the court while identifying the fundamental rights\n\nin conflict, circumscribed one of the fundamental rights in question in such a\n\nway that there was no real conflict between the rights. This was usually done\n\nby weighing the relative constitutional values of the rights based on public\n\ninterest. For instance, in Noise Pollution (V) In re v. Union of India and\n\nanother - [(2005) 5 SCC 733], the court held that the right to freedom of\n\nspeech and expression does not include the freedom to engage in aural\n\naggression, and therefore the court circumscribed the freedom of speech\n\nand expression by excluding from its ambit noise pollution. Similarly, in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/80997184/\" id=\"a_55\">Subramaniam Swamy v.

In the second modality of the public interest approach, the\n\ncourt would undertake a comparison of the values which the rights espouse\n\nand give more weightage to the right that was in furtherance of a higher\n\ndegree of public or collective interest.

Answering the said questions, the court held in answer to\n\nissue (i) that the grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 19(2)</a> are exhaustive of the\n\nrestrictions that can be placed on the right to free speech, and that the State\n\ncannot add to the restrictions so enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It was also held that reasonable restrictions on the grounds\n\nexpressly stated in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 19(2)</a> must be imposed only through a law having\n\nstatutory force and not a mere executive or departmental instruction. The\n\ncourt went on to state that the restraint upon the executive not to have a\n\nback door intrusion applies equally to courts and that courts should not\n\nimpose additional restrictions by using tools of interpretation. However, it\n\nwas clarified that whenever two or more fundamental rights appeared either\n\nto be on collision course or to be seeking preference over one another, the\n\ncourts had dealt with the same by applying well established legal tools that\n\nbalanced the conflicting rights. Issue (ii) was answered by considering the\n\ndevelopment of law in other countries and India and holding that a\n\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_84\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_85\">21</a> can be enforced even against\n\npersons other than the State or its instrumentalities.

Significantly, it was also clarified\n\nthat a law imposing any restriction in terms of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 19(2)</a> can only be\n\nmade by the State and not by the Court since the role envisaged in the\n\nconstitutional scheme for the court was to be a gatekeeper to strictly check\n\nthe entry of restrictions into the temple of fundamental rights and to protect\n\nfundamental rights limited by lawful restrictions, and not to protect\n\nrestrictions and make the rights residual privileges.

Freedom of speech and expression lay at the foundation of all\n\ndemocratic institutions. The press and media have the same rights--no more\n\nor no less than any individual--to write, publish, circulate, and broadcast\n\ninformation. The media derives this right from the right to freedom of speech\n\nand expression in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. Free and\n\nindependent media enables citizens to be informed and to hold the powerful\n\nto account. In a democratic society like ours, where accurate information is a\n\nprerequisite to intelligent decision-making by the public, the news media\n\nserve a vital role. The role of the media is that of a watchdog to disseminate\n\ntruth to the knowledge of the public. In Re : Harijai Singh and Another 1,\n\nthe Supreme Court observed that the freedom of the press is regarded as\n\n&quot;the mother of all liberties in a democratic society&quot;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">           5. As adjudication is not a private activity, the open court is the norm\n\nfor legal proceedings. Indian law recognises open court justice. The concept\n\nof open justice permits fair and accurate reports of court proceedings to be\n\npublished. Reporting of the court proceedings increases transparency and\n\nfaith of the public in the judiciary. This is also in harmony with the citizen&#x27;s\n\nright to know. The right to know is a basic right which the citizen of a free\n\ncountry aspires to.        The public has a right to know what is happening in\n\ncourts and events relating to the investigation of the crime. The right of the\n\npublic to access true and correct facts is required to be recognized. This\n\n1 (AIR 1997 SC 73)\n W.P.(C).Nos.21108/14,\n24499 &amp; 25718/16                          :: 38 ::\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">                                                                      2024:KER:82715\n\n\nensures overall fairness in the functioning of the justice delivery system. The\n\nmedia can bring into the courtroom those of the public who could not attend\n\nand, through intelligent reporting, educate the reading public in judicial\n\naffairs. The right to public access also emanates from <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 327</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C., which reaffirms the principle of &quot;open trial&quot; and the public&#x27;s access\n\nto such open trials. It is one of the salutary principles of the administration of\n\njustice that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.\n\nAn &quot;open trial&quot; reaffirms the said principle.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">           6.      Although the right of freedom of speech and expression as\n\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution is the hallmark of a\n\ndemocracy, thereby protecting the right of the free press and the free media,\n\nlike every fundamental right, the freedom of the press and media cannot be\n\nunlimited or unfettered. This is even if it is accepted that the necessity of\n\nfree media for the proper functioning of a democratic polity cannot be\n\nundermined. Considering that unfettered freedom of speech and expression\n\nwould be equivalent to providing unrestricted permission, the Supreme\n\nCourt in Re : Harijai Singh (supra) has voiced that press freedom is neither\n\ntotal nor infinite and if it were left entirely unrestricted, even somewhat, it\n\nwould cause calamity and turmoil. While the right of the media to keep the\n\npublic          informed   about   criminal   trials   and   investigations   must   be\n\nsafeguarded, equally important is the right to dignity, reputation, and\n\nprivacy of the victim and the accused must be zealously guarded, and a fair\n\ntrial, which includes fair investigation, must be ensured.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\"> W.P.(C).Nos.21108/14,\n24499 &amp; 25718/16                         :: 39 ::\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                                                                  2024:KER:82715\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">           7.

The criminal justice\n                administration system in India places human rights and dignity for\n                human life at a much higher pedestal. In our jurisprudence an\n                accused is presumed to be innocent till proved guilty. The alleged\n                accused is entitled to fairness and true investigation and fair trial\n                and the prosecution is expected to play balanced role in the trial of a\n                crime. The investigation should be judicious, fair, transparent and\n                expeditious to ensure compliance with the basic rule of law. These\n                are the fundamental canons of our criminal jurisprudence and they\n                are quite in conformity with the constitutional mandate contained in\n                <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_140\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_141\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">           10.          The media is seen and observed to have habitually overlooked\n\nthis legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty by indulging in media\n\ntrials or parallel investigations, thereby negatively impacting the accused in\n\nthe case. We are now in the era where trial by media and press coverage\n\nfuels public opinion, which begins even before the suspects are charged.\n\nNowadays, we witness TV channels initiate intense discussions during prime\n\ntime on ongoing criminal investigations and pending criminal trials of public\n\ninterests. It is a kind of a parallel criminal trial of the suspects in the news\n\nstudios. Some of such channels resort to &quot;investigative journalism,&quot; as they\n\ncall it. What we generally see in these kinds of media trials is that the media\n\nitself does a parallel investigation, characterizes the accused as a person\n\nwho had indeed committed the crime, builds a public opinion against him,\n\nreincarnates itself into a &#x27;kangaroo court&#x27;, and &#x27;convict&#x27; the accused by\n\npublic opinion even before the trial at the court takes off. It completely\n\noverlooks the vital gap between an accused and a convict keeping at stake\n\nthe golden principles of &#x27;presumption of innocence until proven guilty&#x27; and\n\n&#x27;guilt beyond reasonable doubt&#x27;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_48\">In <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_142\">Manu Sharma</a> (supra), it was held by\n\nthe Supreme Court that &quot;presumption of innocence of an accused is a legal\n W.P.(C).Nos.21108/14,\n24499 &amp; 25718/16                             :: 42 ::</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">                                                                      2024:KER:82715\n\n\npresumption and should not be destroyed at the very threshold through the\n\nprocess of media trial and that too when the investigation is pending.

The public has a vested interest in\n\nunderstanding the workings of the criminal justice system, including access\n\nto information about ongoing criminal cases, as this transparency is crucial\n\nfor maintaining public confidence in the judicial system and allows citizens\n\nto be informed about matters affecting their safety and welfare. The media\n\nserves as a conduit for information, exercising its right to free speech and\n\nexpression; however, this right must be exercised responsibly, avoiding\n\nsensationalism               or   misinformation            that   could     prejudice       ongoing\n\ninvestigations or legal proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">                 4.

The media&#x27;s role in reporting on a case can\n\ninfluence public perception, which may impact the trial&#x27;s fairness. Moreover,\n\nthe accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty,\n\nand media coverage that portrays the accused negatively before conviction\n\ncan undermine this legal principle, potentially swaying public opinion\n\nagainst them, which may affect the justice dispensation. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 21</a> also\n\nencompasses the right to reputation and privacy; thus, the media must\n\nnavigate these rights carefully, ensuring that reporting does not unjustly\n\nharm the reputation of the accused or violate the privacy of victims and\n\ntheir families. Above all, the ultimate goal is the due administration of\n\njustice, which entails a balanced approach where the rights of all parties--\n\nvictims, accused, and the public--are respected. Courts can impose\n\nrestrictions on media coverage in certain cases to avert justice being\n\nsubverted. While the media plays a vital role in informing the public about\n\ncriminal cases, it must do so within the bounds of legal and ethical\n\nstandards that protect the rights of all involved and uphold the integrity of\n\nthe judicial process and be conscious of the fact that rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 21</a>\n\nwould prevail over those under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 19</a> in the matter of reporting about\n\nongoing investigations or pending proceedings in Courts.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">                 5.

It is\n\ninsufficient to defend such reporting either relying on any fundamental right\n\nor justify by arguing that it is based on preliminary findings or mere\n\nsuspicions of the investigative agency. Such trial by media&quot; not only shapes\n\nperceptions of guilt or innocence but also leads to distrust in judicial\n\noutcomes, especially when verdicts differ from prevailing public beliefs.

Such media portrayals foster\n\nperceptions, whether favourable or detrimental, towards the accused, often\n\nleading the layperson to form judgments that starkly contrast with judicial\n\nconclusions. Consequently, when a Judge renders a verdict that deviates\n\nfrom widely held beliefs shaped by media narratives, it breeds distrust in the\n\nintegrity of the legal system itself. The principled approach of adjudicating\n\nguilt based on legal evidence may be foreign to those unversed in the law,\n\nwho instead gravitate towards the sensationalized versions propagated by\n\nthe media. This erosion of confidence in the justice delivery system is\n\nfurther exacerbated when the Judge, rather than the judgment, becomes the\n\ntarget of media scrutiny.

The media and judiciary are two vital pillars of democracy and\n\nnatural allies, one complements the other towards the goal of a successful\n\ndemocracy.

The precedents discussed thus reveal that in the process of trying\n\nto reconcile the competing claims of rights in the context of duties/freedoms\n\nguaranteed to others, the courts have taken note of the Hohfeldian scheme\n\nof jural relations29, which stipulates that conferring a right on one must\n\nentail the vesting of a corresponding duty in another. 30 The various vivid\n\nforms in which &#x27;rights&#x27; may appear viz., as a &#x27;claim&#x27; or a &#x27;right properly so-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">called&#x27;, &#x27;liberty&#x27; or a &#x27;privilege&#x27;, &#x27;power&#x27; and &#x27;immunity&#x27; and the different\n\nhues that the concept of &#x27;duty&#x27; may partake, like for instance, &#x27;no right&#x27;,\n\n&#x27;liability&#x27; and &#x27;disability&#x27; etc, are pivotal and cannot be ignored when it\n\ncomes to the question of examining the nature of the rights and while inter\n\nse attempting to balance the same. The Hohfeldian classification of rights,\n\nand duties into jural correlatives, jural contradictories, and jural opposites\n\nhelps in understanding the status of the legal relations and in fixing and\n\nconfining them to their appropriate desirable spaces as envisaged by the\n\nConstitution. Looked at from this point of view, justice administration\n\nbecomes an exercise in mutual accommodation of these various rights and\n\nduties in their different forms and variations with the ultimate purpose of\n\neither determining, defining or confining these rights or duties on the\n\ntouchstone of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">           6.

From the said viewpoint, the term\n\n&#x27;constitutional right&#x27; could be used broadly to mean a collection of such legal\n\npositions or as a &#x27;bundle of relations&#x27;. Thus, constitutional rights could either\n\nmean a claim, liberty, power, immunity, as well as a bundle of relations\n\narising from the Constitution. The phrase &quot;right to freedom of speech&quot; could\n\nthus encompass many positions arising from different articles and policies\n\nadopted in the Constitution. It would thus be influenced by the fundamental\n\nduties part, the directive principles as well as those avowed objectives and\n\nprinciples that are now termed as the constitutional mores which latently\n\npervade the Constitution like for instance, the doctrine of separation of\n\npowers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">           7. In the Hohfeldian analysis, rights are not like objects that people\n\ncan possess or carry with them nor are they metaphysical entities floating in\n\nspace between individuals and the government. Instead, rights are positions\n\nwithin legal relations or bundles of such relations. And these positions only\n\nhave meaning by reference to the broader relationships which they are\n\ncapable of creating. They are like different vantage points upon a single\n\nrelationship and obtain its significance from the perspective from which it is\n\nviewed upon. As pithily explained by Llewellyn, &#x27;A has a right that B shall do\n\nsomething... [b]ut the right has B on the other end. The right is indeed the\n\nduty, a duty seen from the other end.&#x27; Looked at from this point of view all\n\njurisprudence addresses the method of determining the rights and duties of\n\nthe people. The relationships between these rights and duties in their varied\n\nforms, become central to constitutional law&#x27;s structure and meaning.

Employing the said analysis it could be seen that the right to\n\nfreedom of speech and expression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> as vested in the\n\ncitizens and in the media has to be understood with specific reference to the\n\nnature and character of legal interest so vested. What is guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> being a &#x27;right&#x27; to &#x27;freedom&#x27;, the import of both the &#x27;right&#x27; and\n\nthe &#x27;freedom&#x27;, in the Hohlfeldian sense ought to be taken specific note of. A\n\nright vested in one will have a jural co-relative (equivalent) by way of a duty\n\non the other which mandates that the right in the former, is respected by the\n\nlatter. If on the other hand what is so vested is not a right but a &#x27;privilege&#x27;,\n\n&#x27;freedom&#x27; or &#x27;liberty&#x27;, then the jural co-relative would be a &#x27;no right&#x27; on the\n\nother to interfere with the said privilege/freedom/ liberty. Thus looked at\n\nfrom the Hohfeldian prism, the right to freedom vested in the citizen and the\n\nmedia under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> will have to be viewed as impacting each\n\nslightly differently.
