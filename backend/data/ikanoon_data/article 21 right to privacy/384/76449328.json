INTRODUCTION &amp; OVERVIEW</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1.    These cases seem to me to represent an issue of significant\nimmediacy in our times. On the one hand, the seemingly limitless\nreach and expansion of modes of communication over the internet,\nespecially through social media. On the other, digital technology --\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">the very one that powers the internet -- now also allows, in a manner\nand to an extent never known before, the manipulation of information\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">-- text, graphic, videographic -- to generate almost indetectable false\ninformation; information often revealed after the event to be &#x27;fake&#x27;.\nThis is far beyond mere forgery; it is something else altogether: an\nentire chunk of information is manipulated to produce something\nwholly false. The voice of a famous politician is replicated with words\nhe never spoke. The face of an actor is superimposed on a body and\nnobody can tell. This is not parody. This is not a prank. But because\nthese fakes -- most especially the &#x27;deep fakes&#x27; where entire videos\nare conjured up -- have such verisimilitude and because they, too, are\ncapable of instant global propagation via the internet, their influence\nis profound. The boundaries between truth and falsehood are blurred.\nAnd with that, comes the blurring of the dividing line between the\nconstitutional guarantee of the freedom of speech and expression and\nstate-imposed limits on it. After all, who is to decide what is fake or\nfalse and what is authentic?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_5\">2.    The several Petitioners and the Applicant, different voices\nfrom different quarters, are united in their complaint about the\nCentral Government&#x27;s 2023 amendment to a particular Rule under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_11\">Information Technology Act</a>. This amendment, they all say, has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                               Page 7 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_12\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\njust one purpose: to muzzle criticism and questioning of the Central\nGovernment as it goes about its &#x27;business&#x27;, to stifle dissent from what\nthe Central Government puts out in regard to affairs of the state.\nThrough this amendment, the Central Government has anointed\nitself as the sole arbiter of what is or what is not &#x27;fake, false or\nmisleading&#x27;. It, and it alone, will decide this, including the entirely\nambiguous term &#x27;misleading&#x27;; and when it does, dare any\n&#x27;intermediary&#x27; allow such information to continue to be hosted on a\nsocial media platform, that intermediary immediately risks losing\nstatutory protection. The entire amendment is overbroad, vague and\nwithout controlling guidelines. It does not even provide for an\nopportunity for the propounder of any information to defend its\ncorrectness, and the government becomes a judge in its own cause\n(hence another dimension of violation of principles of natural\njustice).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3.     The impugned Rule is ultra vires the governing parent Act,\ngoes the submission. It purports to do that which the Act itself\ncannot. No rule by executive action, made under any rule-making\npower, can either go beyond the statute or do what the statute cannot.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">4.     Therefore, the amendment in question is, the Petitioners say,\nviolative of constitutional freedoms; specifically, those guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India, the right to free\nspeech. At least one Petitioner has an argument positioned under\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>, saying that the amendment infringes his right to\ncarry on a legitimate profession.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                Page 8 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_8\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_15\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">5.     For different reasons, the Petitioners claim, the amendment is\narbitrary and ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 14.</a> To say that the amendment is\n&#x27;limited&#x27; to &#x27;the business of the government&#x27; is, the Petitioners say,\nnothing but smoke and mirrors. Nobody knows where the &#x27;business\nof government&#x27; begins or where it ends. In any case, when it comes\nto the mainstream press and media, as a submission from Mr Seervai\nand Mr Farasat would have it, &#x27;the government&#x27;s business is our\nbusiness&#x27;. No government can tell the press to &#x27;mind its own\nbusiness&#x27;, for the function of the press is precisely the opposite: at\nevery stage to mind the government as it goes about whatever it\nbelieves it is its business.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.     At least one fully government controlled entity, the Press\nInformation Bureau, already has a significant social media presence.\nIt is already active on it. Therefore, there is no need for any other &#x27;fact\ncheck unit&#x27; to be created. The sinister and insidious facet to the\nimpugned amendment is that this new agency has far more than a\nloud bark: it has fangs and claws, for its unilateral view of what is or is\nnot the &#x27;truth&#x27; is accompanied by a requirement of removal of what it\nhas so determined (to be fake, false or misleading); and an\nintermediary can refuse it only on pain of losing statutory protector\nor &#x27;safe harbour&#x27;. Taken together, this has what they describe as &#x27;a\nchilling effect&#x27; on the right to free speech and freedom of the press.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">7.     There is also a submission that no such amendment could be\neffected by executive action or delegated legislation. Even a statutory\namendment by Parliament was impermissible for that would violate\nnot just <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> but also <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 Page 9 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_10\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_19\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">8.    Not so, says Mr Mehta, learned Solicitor-General for the\nUnion of India. He points to the widely reported perils of allowing\nfake news and information to proliferate on social media. Doing\nnothing is not an option. Indeed, it is the very intermediaries who\nasked for Central Government intervention. What the Central\nGovernment has done, he maintains, is walk a tightrope, treading\nvery carefully within the boundaries of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(2)</a>, the permissible\nlimitations on <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> Far from being in the slightest manner\n&#x27;arbitrary&#x27;, the amendment strikes an appropriate balance. It is,\ntherefore, neither vulnerable on the principle of Wednesbury\nunreasonableness, nor does it violate the doctrine of proportionality.\nWorse, the 2023 amendment is nothing but a minor adjustment to a\nprevious amendment to which no one raised the slightest objection.\nThere is, Mr Mehta maintains, a much wider public and social\ninterest that must be served. There is far too much fakery abounding;\nsomeone has to be charged with the responsibility of detecting and\nidentifying it. That task is not one to be lightly undertaken: fakery\ncannot be met with or set against fakery. It is a responsibility of the\nhighest order. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_11\">The government is possibly if not in loco parentis at least\nparens patriae, an authority regarded and accepted as the legal\nprotector of citizens otherwise unable to protect themselves. This is\nnot condescension, Mr Mehta is quick to clarify; it is by no means an\nassertion that the citizens of this country are irresponsible or weak or\nany such thing. It is simply that the power of internet dissemination,\nsocial media and technology have blurred the boundaries between\ntruth and falsehood in a manner never before known to mankind.\nWhat the amendment seeks to do, therefore, is to establish an agency\nas objective as possible, in whom trust can be reposed because it is\nbacked by legal authority, to detect -- not &#x27;decide&#x27;, not &#x27;arbiter&#x27;, but\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                Page 10 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_22\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ndetect -- that which is fake, false and misleading. The amendment\nfurther circumscribes even this authority by limiting it only to the\n&#x27;business of government&#x27;; not the statements or public assertions of\nindividuals, whether politicians or bureaucrats, but only the business\nof government. He maintains that what constitutes &#x27;the business of\ngovernment&#x27; is well-defined and well-known to all. At no time has the\ngovernment proposed to arrogate to itself the sole power to detect\neverything that is or may be &#x27;fake, false or misleading&#x27;. Lastly, even if\nsome information about the business of government is found to be\n&#x27;fake, false or misleading&#x27; by the fact-check unit, the intermediary is\nonly required to take reasonable efforts not to host it. Even if it does\nnot, there is no immediate consequence. It only loses immediate and\ninstant immunity, akin to losing an indemnity. It may then have to face\na lawsuit; but in that lawsuit, all its defences are open to it, including\ninviting a judicial pronouncement that would have the effect of\nrestoring that immunity, of returning the intermediary to safe\nharbour. In any case, he concludes, this is a question of interpretation\nof a statute. This court would be well within its remit to limit the\nambit of any clause or word if that would save the amendment, for the\nfirst effort of any writ court vested with the power to decide on the\nvalidity of a statute must be, it is well settled, to find a way to uphold\nit. Striking it down is the exception, not the rule.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_13\">9.    I have attempted the preceding summary of the contesting\nposition in the broadest terms to more accurately focus on the issues\nbefore us.

They all have internet-based versions or editions and these\nmay take different forms. But the publications, and individual\nreporters or journalists who work for them, all have social media\naccounts.

Some of the arguments by the Petitioners drew heavily on\nAmerican jurisprudence in relation to the right to free speech. I do\nnot believe it is necessary, or even prudent, to examine those\ndimensions in any detail. Our jurisprudence in India regarding Part\nIII and especially the remit of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 14</a> is now firmly\nestablished. My summary of the rival submissions attempted to show\nwhat these cases are about. But it is equally important to understand\nwhat these cases are not about. We are not tasked with expanding or\nenlarging (nor shrinking or limiting) the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_38\">Articles 19</a> or 14 per\nse. We are asked to assess whether the impugned rule can be fairly\nsaid to be correctly positioned within the existing jurisprudence. Is it\nwithin the guardrails or does it fall outside them?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_21\">19.   For instance, Mr Seervai in particular took us through\nAmerican law to suggest that the right to free speech includes a\nknown falsehood.

But I need not venture into that territory. The reason seems to\nme plain. It is best explained by the rival first amendments to the two\nConstitutions, the American and the Indian. The First Amendment\nto the US Constitution did not limit the right to free speech. It went\nthe other way. It constrained the power of Congress to curtail that\nright.1\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">21.       Our First Amendment did the opposite (and there is a\nhistorical and jurisprudential context possibly best left for discussion\nelsewhere): it expanded the state&#x27;s powers to curtail fundamental\nrights. <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(2)</a> was substantially amended. Originally, it said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          (2)    Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the\n          operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or\n          prevent the State from making any law relating to, libel,\n          slander, defamation, contempt of court or any matter which\n          offends against decency or morality or which undermines the\n          security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The First Amendment substituted <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 19(2)</a> to read:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">          (2)    Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the\n          operation of any existing law, or prevent the State from\n\n\n1      &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of\nthe press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the\nGovernment for a redress of grievances.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                   Page 16 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_24\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_42\">January 2024\n              Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                           oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n       making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable\n       restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said\n       sub clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of\n       India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign\n       States, public order, decency or morality or in relation to\n       contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">                                      (The italics show the new introductions)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">22.

THE IMPUGNED AMENDMENT &amp;\n      STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n\n\nI     Social Media: Users and Intermediaries\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_30\">27.   &quot;Social media&quot; is what lawyers like to call a &#x27;term of art&#x27;, which\nis to say it has no definition in statute, and its everyday meaning is\naccepted. It refers to various internet-based services such as\nFacebook, X (the social media service formerly known as Twitter),\nYouTube and many others. These are digital platforms. At least in\ntheory, they provide no content themselves, unlike the websites of,\nsay, news organizations or broadcasters, which have their in-house\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                               Page 19 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_64\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nbespoke content hosted on their websites. Social media services also\nhave their websites, but the content here is (at least supposedly)\nentirely user-driven. Individual users accept the terms of service, sign\nup, create online social media accounts, and then with their chosen\nonline names (which may have no relation at all to their true\nidentities), &#x27;share&#x27; content. Where users get their content is\nuncontrolled and often unknown. Some of it may be self-developed\n(for instance, if Kamra has a video made of one of his performances),\nbut this is not a requirement. Users control access to their content.\nAn entirely open access user account allows everyone to access all\ncontent of that user. A user may choose to restrict his or her content\nto the extent the social media allows it. Nobody blocks all user access;\nthat would be pointless, rather like talking to oneself.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">28.   The entity that owns, operates and manages the social media\nservice is, in our law, the &#x27;intermediary&#x27;. It hosts the service. The\nservice lets users share content. The intermediary does not upload or\nshare content. Intermediaries have in-house rules of conduct.\nTransgressions can result in suspension or even cancellation of the\nuser account.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_32\">29.   But because the content is uploaded to, accessible on and from\nand therefore resides on the social media service provider&#x27;s computer\nnetworks    and    systems,     the    intermediary      assumes     limited\nresponsibility for this content; typically, a &#x27;best efforts&#x27; provision not\nto permit content that violates its terms of service or law (include\nintellectual property infringement).

Because social media is so easily accessible -- on any internet-\nenabled device -- it has a reach beyond any form of communication\npreviously known to humankind.

The sheer power this represents can be frightening, and few\nare more alarmed by it than those whose power over individuals is\nthreatened by its inherent subversiveness.

Not one of them is an intermediary. No intermediary is\nbefore us. None protests. These users are, therefore, they say under\nthe constant threat, as regards the undefined &#x27;business of the Central\nGovernment&#x27;, that their user-content will be unilaterally identified by\nsome government-controlled &#x27;fact-check unit&#x27; as &#x27;fake or false or\nmisleading&#x27;. The intermediary&#x27;s &#x27;due diligence&#x27; obligation is not to\nhost, publish, store, etc. It covers every possible thing that can be\ndone to and with digital content. Therefore, the moment this fact\ncheck unit or, as we got used to calling it in Court, the FCU on its\nown decides that something some user has put out is fake or false or\nmisleading, the intermediary is bound to take it down. This operates\nentirely outside the control of <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 69A</a>, the takedown provision.\nFor, if the intermediary does not do this, Rule 7 operates eo instante:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_79\">the intermediary loses safe harbour and is liable to prosecution.

This is squarely the &#x27;chilling effect&#x27;, and a\nfrontal assault on the &#x27;marketplace of ideas&#x27;. It is not just Rule\n3(1)(b)(v) that is to be read in isolation; it is Rule 3(1)(b)(v) read with\nthe consequences in Rule 7.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">50.   Mr Mehta disagrees. The controlling portion of Rule 3(1)(b)\nonly speaks of &#x27;reasonable efforts&#x27;. There is no compulsion. It is the\nnot making of a reasonable effort at all that attracts Rule 7. As to the\n2023 amendment, he asks how is that no user complained of a\nfundamental right of free speech being violated when substantially\nthe same provision existed in 2022 with the words &quot;patently false or\nuntrue or misleading&quot;, and how it comes to pass that the objection\narises for the first time only when a dedicated provision is sought to\nbe made for &quot;the business of the Central Government&quot;. Surely it cannot\nbe suggested that fake, false or misleading information is legitimate\nfor the business of the Central Government but not for other matters.\nAll that the government is doing is identifying a specific authority, the\nFCU (which may or may not be the PIB) to identify only that\ninformation that pertains to the business of the government and\nwhich is also fake, false or misleading. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_81\">Nobody knows the business of\nthe government better than the government which does that business\nto begin with; and fakery, falsehood and misleading information about\nthe business of the government abound without limit. The business\nof the government is not merely the concern of a stand up comedian\nor this or that newspaper. The government encourages debate and\ndissent and it has no problem at all with parody. But the business of\nthe government is the concern of every single citizen and, arguably,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                Page 44 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_119\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ngiven the reach of the medium, everyone everywhere. Why should\nthe government not be allowed to set the record straight if something\nis found by an independent agency to be fake, false or misleading? he\nasks. In what legal or moral universe should this be permitted?\nBesides, he submits, there is now the provision for a grievance\nredressal mechanism; even an appeal is provided under Rule 3(3A).\nFurther, Rule 7 only operates when an intermediary &#x27;fails to observe\nthese Rules&#x27;, i.e., it makes no effort at all.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">51.    If only matters were that simple, that straightforward, the\nPetitioners say. They maintain that these answers to their case are all\nover simplistic, even facile. After all, the government already has a\npublic information agency, the PIB, one of considerable heft and\nstanding even on social media. It puts out its corrective or\nclarificatory content periodically on diverse social media -- and\nindeed users themselves cite the PIB. What is at play here, the\nPetitioners say, is something else entirely. It begins with the entirely\nuntenable assumption that in every single matter or regarding every\nsingle thing -- including the business of the government -- there is\nan absolute truth; and everything else is fake, false or misleading. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_83\">In\nthe 2022 amendment, there was scope for debate whether a particular\nchunk of digital data or user content was patently false and untrue or\nmisleading. The 2023 amendment takes away all room for debate. In\nregard to the business of the government -- and nobody really knows\nwhat that is or tomorrow could be -- the government has unilaterally\narrogated to itself the power to decide an absolutism: absolute truth\nor absolute falsehood, with no scope before the FCU for defending user\ncontent. Mr Seervai said it could not get worse as an egregious\ninstance of a blatant violation of every concept of natural justice: a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                Page 45 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_120\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nuser need not even be given a chance to defend himself or herself.</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">&quot;Rome has spoken; and the cause is lost.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">II    A Closer Look at the Impugned Amendment &amp; Its Interpretation\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">52.

For the\ndisjunctive &quot;or&quot;, to my mind, makes all the difference. It introduces\nanother independent clause unrelated to whether or not content is\nknowingly and intentionally communicated. Further, the &quot;knowing\nand intentional&quot; communication can never be by an intermediary --\nbecause it is a communication, i.e., user-content. An intermediary is\nonly a host. The 2023 amendment&#x27;s prohibition is independent of any\nuser knowledge or intent.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">60.   This is why the 2023 amendment actually creates another class\nof content (and a class of user, the Central Government), viz.,\ninformation which (i) relates to the &#x27;business of the Central\nGovernment&#x27;; (ii) is &#x27;found&#x27; to be fake, false or misleading by (iii) a\nnotified FCU. It is also this class separation that is directly the matter\nof at least one facet of the <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 14</a> challenge before us.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_93\">61.   Any other interpretation would result simultaneously in an\nabsurdity and a redundancy. On absurdity, the contrary view\npropounded by the Union, that knowledge and intention restrict the\nimpugned Rule, would mean that the FCU identifies some content\nrelating to the business of the Central Government that is fake, false\nor misleading, but it continues to be &#x27;hosted, published, displayed,\ntransmitted, etc&#x27; because this &#x27;hosting, publishing, display,\ntransmission, etc&#x27; is not a knowing or intentional communication by\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                               Page 50 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_126\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nthe user. In turn, that would mean that no intermediary would ever be\nrequired not to host, publish, display etc this FCU-identified Central\nGovernment business-related content that is identified as fake, false\nor misleading for every user would simply claim that there was\nneither knowledge nor intent -- and no one could ever say otherwise,\nat least not without the greatest difficulty.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">62.   If &#x27;knowingly and intentionally communicates&#x27; qualifies or\nrestrict the 2023 amendment, then the clause would read like this:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">      (b)      the intermediary ... shall make reasonable efforts by\n      itself, and to cause the users of its computer resource to not host\n      any information that,--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      (v)     ... deceives or misleads the addressee about the origin of\n      the message or knowingly and intentionally communicates\n      any misinformation or information which (i) is patently\n      false and untrue or misleading in nature OR, (ii) in respect of\n      any business of the Central Government, is identified as\n      fake or false or misleading by such fact check unit of the\n      Central Government as the Ministry may, by notification\n      published in the Official Gazette, specify;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_95\">63.   If the clause is to be read like this, then the second portion (the\n2023 amendment, the portion following (ii) in red above) is wholly\nunnecessary because it is entirely subsumed in (i). The first part deals\nwith all information. It is classless. The second portion is a subset of\nthe first. Everything that applies to the first would then apply to the\nsecond -- specifically, knowledge and intention. But this would\ncontrary to the Union&#x27;s own arguments that: (i) the Court should\nread in (as a matter of &#x27;reading down&#x27;) a &#x27;disclaimer&#x27; by the\nintermediary -- for no such &#x27;disclaimer&#x27; would ever be necessary if\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                Page 51 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_127\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nknowledge and intent were essential ingredients (there would simply\nbe nothing to disclaim); and (ii) that the FCU is not the &#x27;final arbiter&#x27;\nof truth, and while there is loss of safe harbour and exposure to\nprosecution, it is a court that will decide truth or falsity, a submission\nmade on affidavit. That interpretation would render the 2023\namendment wholly otiose, redundant, and unnecessary.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">64.

Correctly read, in my view, the 2023 amendment operates\nindependently of any user knowledge or user intention.

The loss of safe harbour and the liability to prosecution under\nRule 7 evidently triggers differently depending on whether or not the\ncontent is about &quot;the business of the Central Government&quot;. If it is not\nabout the business of the Central Government, there is no loss of safe\nharbour or liability to prosecution unless knowledge and intent is\nestablished. This is not a requirement for the second class of content, viz.,\nthat which relates to the &quot;business of the Central Government.&quot; There,\nno    question     of   &#x27;knowledge&#x27;       (&quot;knowingly&quot;)        or    &#x27;intent&#x27;\n(&quot;intentionally&quot;) arises.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_99\">68.    The justification or reason for this is plain. For non-Central\nGovernment-business-related content there is no FCU. There is no\narbiter of what is &quot;patently false or untrue or misleading&quot;. The\nrequirement is that it is the user who must be aware that the content\nis &quot;patently false or untrue or misleading&quot; and must, with that\nawareness, &quot;knowingly and intentionally&quot; publish it.

This is markedly different from the other class, content said to\nrelate to &#x27;the business of the Central Government&#x27;. For this content,\nthere is an arbiter: the FCU. It is the FCU that decides what is fake,\nfalse or misleading.

Thus, in the first category, the focus is on the user&#x27;s awareness\nof falsity, untruth or misleading nature.

If it does not, Rule 7 operates immediately and\ntakes away safe harbour and exposes the intermediary to prosecution.\nThere is little point in saying that it is the court that will ultimately\ndetermine it.

The correct question is this: if the FCU identifies some chunk\nof data about the business of the Central Government as fake, false or\nmisleading, can the intermediary &#x27;interpret&#x27; that content and come to\nthe opposite conclusion?

The disjunctive &#x27;or&#x27; puts FCU-\nidentified content (that which pertains to the business of the Central\nGovernment and is FCU-certified as fake, false or misleading) in a\nseparate category or class. Loss of safe harbour is immediate if this\ncontent is not removed. This is what Mr Seervai calls the illusion of\nchoice.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">74.

Fifthly, the clause is capable of being read\ndown if it must be saved, and &#x27;knowingly&#x27; and &#x27;intentionally&#x27; can as\nwell apply to that content relating to the business of the Central\nGovernment which the FCU identifies as fake, false or misleading.\nSixthly, nobody has ever attempted to shrink any fundamental right,\nnor to expand the permissible restrictions on the exercise of those\nfundamental rights.

The emphasis in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 19(2)</a>, Mr Seervai says, and I think\ncorrectly, is on the State. This is not to be confused or conflated with\nthe dispensation of the day. The State survives periodic changes in\ngovernment. The State does not face the electorate; governments do.\nThroughout the second Affidavit in Reply, he says, and especially in\nparagraphs 79 to 81, there is precisely such a muddling of these two\ndistinct concepts. Further, what is guaranteed is a right under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_161\">Article\n19(1);</a> and in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, it is the right to freedom of speech and\nexpression, not some &#x27;right to the truth&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_123\">79.

The speed, anonymity and reach of\nthe internet generally and social media especially drives content with\nreal-world implications and the potentiality to do serious harm: sexual\noffences against children and woman, torture, animal abuse, hate\nspeech, minority targeting, aggravating social, ethnic and religious\nprejudices, inciting mob violence against identified communities and\ngroups, even genocide. Kamra&#x27;s lawyers have cited many examples.\nIt makes for sickening reading. But, they say, this case is not about\nthose egregious harms that surely must be addressed. It is about one\nparticular class, affairs or matters that relate to the business of the\nCentral Government.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">80.    Safe harbour, it is argued, is an important adjunct to free\nspeech in the context of the power to cause harm via the internet. It lies\nat the heart of the exercise of freedom of speech and expression on\nthe internet. It protects not just intermediaries but, through them,\ntheir users -- precisely those in whom the fundamental right is\nvested. Intermediaries themselves have no direct interest in any\nparticular user-content. Axiomatically, they cannot. It follows that if\ncontent publications carries a commercial risk (including a possible\nloss of safe harbour), it is inevitable that the risk-avoidance will\nprevail. 10\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">81.    Consequently, Mr Seervai argues, confronting intermediaries\nwith the loss of statutory safe harbour is a form of directing or\nmandating censorship (or self-interested censorship) of identified\n\n\n10    Dickinson, Gregory M; The Internet Immunity Escape Hatch; BYU Law\nReview, Vol. 47(5), <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 6 (2022) (p. 1437).</a> Relied on by the Petitioners.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                 Page 66 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_178\">                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_126\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_165\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nonline content relating to the business of the Central Government.\nAn intermediary will do anything to retain safe harbour. It will bend\nthe knee to a government directive regarding content. Its business\ndepends on safe harbour and immunity from prosecution for hosted\ncontent. Between safe harbour and user&#x27;s rights regarding content,\nthe intermediary faces a Hobson&#x27;s choice; and no intermediary is\nquixotic enough to take up cudgels for free speech. Compromising\none particular chunk of content is a small price to pay; better the user\ncontent is thrown under the bus than having the bus run over the\nentire business. The safe-harbour provision is therefore not just\nintermediary-level insulation from liability. It is an explicit\nrecognition of a free speech right. What safe harbour does is to\nremove the potentiality of indirect censorship.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">82.   I agree.

The Supreme Court said that <a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 79</a> is an exemption\nprovision -- that is to say, an exemption from responsibility and\nliability for user-content. Leaving aside the blocking order statutory\nmechanism under <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 69A</a> of the IT Act, the Supreme Court\nread down <a href=\"/doc/183491832/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 79(3)(b)</a> to mean that an intermediary would lose\nsafe harbour only if it did not remove or disable access to identified\nmaterial despite receiving actual knowledge of a court order (under\n<a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 69A</a>) directing such a removal or disabling.

This is also what the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit held in Zeran v America Online: 12\n      [11] ... The specter of tort liability in an area of such\n      prolific speech would have an obvious chilling effect. It\n      would be impossible for service providers to screen each\n      of their millions of postings for possible problems. Faced\n      with potential liability for each message republished by\n      their services, interactive computer service providers\n      might choose to severely restrict the number and type of\n      messages posted. Congress considered the weight of the\n      speech interests implicated and chose to immunize\n      service providers to avoid any such restrictive effect.\n      [25] If computer service providers were subject to\n      distributor liability, they would face potential liability\n      each time they receive notice of a potentially defamatory\n      statement from any party, concerning any message. Each\n      notification would require a careful yet rapid investigation of\n      the circumstances surrounding the posted information, a\n      legal judgement concerning the information&#x27;s defamatory\n      character, and an on-the-spot editorial decision whether to\n      risk liability by allowing the continued publication of that\n      information. Although this might be feasible for the\n      traditional print publisher, the sheer number of postings on\n      interactive computer services would create an impossible\n      burden in the Internet context.

Thus, like strict liability, liability upon notice\n      has a chilling effect on the freedom of Internet speech.\n      [26] Similarly, notice-based liability would deter service\n      providers from regulating the dissemination of offensive\n      material over their own services. Any efforts by a service\n      provider to investigate and screen material posted on its\n      service would only lead to notice of potentially\n      defamatory material more frequently and thereby create\n      a stronger basis for liability.

The test of\nproportionality was applied in Anuradha Bhasin: proportionality must\nensure a rational nexus between the objects and the means adopted to\nachieve them. Is a legislative measure is disproportionate in its\ninterference with the fundamental right? Again, a court will see\nwhether a less intrusive measure could have been adopted consistent\nwith the object of the law and whether the impact of the\nencroachment on a fundamental right is disproportionate to the\nbenefit claimed. The proportionality standard is a demand on both\nprocedural and substantive law. Five principles emerged from this\ndiscussion, and they were accepted in Anuradha Bhasin: 30\n      1324.1.

In view of the aforesaid discussion, we may\n        summarise the requirements of the doctrine of\n        proportionality which must be followed by the authorities\n        before passing any order intending on restricting\n        fundamental rights of individuals. In the first stage itself, the\n        possible goal of such a measure intended at imposing\n        restrictions must be determined. It ought to be noted that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                 Page 73 of 148</span>\n                               31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_203\">January 2024\n              Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                           oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n       such goal must be legitimate. However, before settling on\n       the aforesaid measure, the authorities must assess the\n       existence of any alternative mechanism in furtherance of\n       the aforesaid goal. The appropriateness of such a measure\n       depends on its implication upon the fundamental rights and\n       the necessity of such measure. It is undeniable from the\n       aforesaid holding that only the least restrictive measure\n       can be resorted to by the State, taking into consideration\n       the facts and circumstances. Lastly, since the order has\n       serious implications on the fundamental rights of the\n       affected parties, the same should be supported by\n       sufficient material and should be amenable to judicial\n       review.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">                                                               (Emphasis added)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">90.    Mr Seervai maintains that the impugned Rule wholly fails the\nproportionality test, one that goes back to Chintaman Rao in 1950.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">91.    Mr Seervai cited more law, particularly the dissent of Justice\nOliver Wendell Holmes Jr (in which he was joined by Justice\nBrandeis) in Abrams et al v United States, 31 but a further discussion in\nthat direction is unnecessary. 32 I have already said that we are not\n\n\n31      250 US 616 (1919).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">32      For which reason, I do not think it appropriate to consider the submission\non whether a knowing falsehood is protected, which Mr Seervai advocates based\non United States v Alvarez, 567 US 709 (2012). The Stolen Valor Act criminalized\n&#x27;false statements&#x27; about having a military medal. A 6:3 majority of the US\nSupreme Court held the law to be unconstitutional and violative of the right to\nfree speech protected under the First Amendment. There does not appear to be\na common rationale: four of the justices concluded that a falsehood, even a\nknowingly made one, is not in itself sufficient to exclude First Amendment\nprotection. Two other justices held that false speech was entitled to some\nprotection, but the statute was invalid because it could have achieved its objective\n(preventing a falsehood) in a less restrictive manner. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_160\">The latter proposition is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                  Page 74 of 148</span>\n                                31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_204\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ntasked with discovering new frontiers of the right to freedom of\nspeech and expression. We are only to see if the impugned Rule can\nfairly be said to lie within the narrowly -- and strictly -- defined\nlimits of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 19(2)</a>, the &#x27;reasonable restrictions&#x27; on the exercise of\nthat fundamental right. For this, the decisions of our Supreme Court,\ndiscussed earlier, are surely sufficient. I need not, therefore, consider\nat any great length authority from other jurisdictions. In particular,\nand as I have also already noticed, the First Amendment to the US\nConstitution is in critical ways different from the amendment to\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 19(2)</a> of our Constitution.</span> For this reason, a more elaborate\ndiscussion of New York Times v Sullivan,33 on which Mr Seervai also\nrelies, is not really necessary though it is undoubtedly a landmark.\nNYT v Sullivan was in the context of libel and defamation. I need only\nnote my agreement with the general principle that any rule that\ncompels a critic or a commentator (in our case a social media\nintermediary&#x27;s user) to guarantee the truth of all factual assertions,\nand to do so on pain of -- Sullivan said libel -- having that assertion\ntotally suppressed does lead to a form of self-interest censorship by\nthe intermediary in question.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_162\">92.

The question is how far the principles emerging from\n      the United States and English decisions are relevant under\n      our constitutional system. So far as the freedom of press is\n      concerned, it flows from the freedom of speech and\n      expression guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> But the said right\n      is subject to reasonable restrictions placed thereon by an\n      existing law or a law made after the commencement of the\n      Constitution in the interests of or in relation to the several\n      matters set out therein. Decency and defamation are two of\n      the grounds mentioned in clause (2). Law of torts providing\n      for damages for invasion of the right to privacy and\n      defamation and <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_212\">Sections 499</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_213\">500</a> IPC are the existing laws\n      saved under clause (2). But what is called for today -- in\n      the present times -- is a proper balancing of the freedom\n      of press and said laws consistent with the democratic way\n      of life ordained by the Constitution. Over the last few\n      decades, press and electronic media have emerged as\n      major factors in our nation&#x27;s life. They are still\n      expanding -- and in the process becoming more\n      inquisitive. Our system of Government demands -- as do\n      the systems of Government of the United States of\n      America and United Kingdom -- constant vigilance over\n      exercise of governmental power by the press and the\n      media among others. It is essential for a good\n      Government. At the same time, we must remember that\n      our society may not share the degree of public awareness\n      obtaining in United Kingdom or United States.

We may now consider whether the State or its\nofficials have the authority in law to impose a prior\nrestraint upon publication of material defamatory of the\nState or of the officials, as the case may be? We think not.\nNo law empowering them to do so is brought to our\nnotice. As observed in New York Times v. United States\n[(1971) 403 US 713 : 29 L Ed 2d 822 (1971)], popularly known\nas the Pentagon papers case, &quot;any system of prior\nrestraints of (freedom of) expression comes to this Court\nbearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional\nvalidity&quot; and that in such cases, the Government &quot;carries\na heavy burden of showing justification for the\nimposition of such a restraint&quot;. We must accordingly hold\nthat no such prior restraint or prohibition of publication\ncan be imposed by the respondents upon the proposed\npublication of the alleged autobiography of &quot;Auto Shankar&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">by the petitioners. This cannot be done either by the State\nor by its officials. In other words, neither the\nGovernment nor the officials who apprehend that they\nmay be defamed, have the right to impose a prior\nrestraint upon the publication of the alleged\nautobiography of Auto Shankar. The remedy of public\nofficials/public figures, if any, will arise only after the\npublication and will be governed by the principles\nindicated herein.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">                                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_169\">(Emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                         Page 77 of 148</span>\n                       31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_215\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_171\">93.

This approach from our own jurisprudence sits uneasily with\nMr Mehta&#x27;s frequent assertions that the government welcomes\ndebate, dissent, satire; and yet maintains that the impugned Rule is\nnecessary. Firstly, it is not about this or that government at all. It is\nabout what the State -- perennial as the grass -- can or cannot do.\nWhat a particular government or dispensation wants, and what the\nState can permissibly do may be very different things. Secondly, on my\ninterpretation of the Rule in question -- that is to say the requirement\nthat an intermediary must block or take down any content relating to\nthe business of the Central Government that the FCU has (on its\nown) determined to be fake, false or misleading, or, in default\nimmediately lose safe harbour -- for precisely this targeted content\nthere remains no scope for any debate, dissent or satire before the\nmaterial is excised from the public domain.

These two phrases are far too easily bandied about. I narrow\ntheir implications for these cases. The chilling effect speaks to\ncensorship, but not direct censorship. It connotes a concatenation of\nfactors that tend inevitably and ineluctably to self-censorship; and\nthis self-censorship may itself be direct (by the author) or indirect (by\nanother who has control over the author&#x27;s content). Knowing that\nsome content will be proscribed, and, if put out, will entail significant\nadverse consequences, the author refrains -- and we have self-\ncensorship. In parallel, where the author is dependent on some other\nagency on whom is cast the burden of content-control, the knowledge\nthat the other agency will certainly (or even almost certainly) act to\nforbid that content prevents the author from exercising the right to\nfree speech.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_238\">99.

The use of\nthe marketplace is not to be confused with commercialization. The\nmarketplace here is a forum for exchange -- where ideas, expressed\nin a certain way -- are traded, exchanged, debated, commented on.\nThe marketplace of ideas is a term of art that means space and\nopportunity for discussion, dissent and debate. Automatically, this\nhas several implications. It means there is no universal or accepted\n&#x27;version&#x27;. Perceptions matter. Opinions count. Dissent, disagreement\nand debate are of the essence; without them, there is simply no &#x27;right\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                              Page 84 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_231\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nto freedom of speech and expression&#x27;.

He points out\n      that the law as interpreted by the Supreme\n      Court &quot;teaches you how you should see the\n      film and a legal theory of spectatorship... it\n      creates a world of reception theory, which\n      plays an important pedagogic role, which is not\n      just about prohibiting a particular view, but\n      also about cultivating a particular view.&quot;\n      Recognising the need to acknowledge the\n      rights of both the &quot;citizen viewer&quot; and the\n      &quot;speaking subject&quot; he says: &quot;the task of\n      censorship is to teach the viewer to become a\n      citizen through particular spectatorial\n      practices, and the imagined gaze of the citizen-\n      viewer determines the specific content of\n      censorship laws.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">28.

The documentary film\nwhich was censored -- &quot;Jenin, Jenin&quot; -- presented the\nPalestinian narrative of the battle in the Jenin refugee camp\nin April 2002 during the &quot;Operation Defensive Wall&quot;. The\nfilm maker at the outset declared that he had made no\nattempt to present the Israeli position. The censor Board\nbanned the film since it was &quot;distorted&quot; and was &quot;offensive\nto public&#x27;s feelings&quot;. The Israel Supreme Court reversed the\nBoard. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_198\">Justice Procaccia speaking for the Court observed\n&quot;the messages of the film Jenin, Jenin, as described\nabove, are indeed offensive to wide sections of the public\nin Israel&quot; and still the film could not be banned because\n&quot;although the injury is deep and real, it does not reach\nthe high threshold required to rescind freedom of speech\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                        Page 88 of 148</span>\n                       31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_240\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n      .... the offense is not radically shocking to the point of\n      posing a concrete threat to the public order, in a way that\n      might justify restricting freedom of expression and\n      creativity.&quot; Commenting on this decision, legal scholar\n      Daphne Barak-Erez points out that the Court should perhaps\n      acknowledge the offense to feelings caused by such films but\n      still refuse to uphold the censor Board&#x27;s decision &quot;because\n      of the enormous danger of turning the state into the\n      custodian of truth.&quot; (Barak-Erez, Daphne (2007) &quot;The\n      Law of Historical Films: In the Aftermath of &quot;Jenin, Jenin&quot;,\n      Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal, Vol. 16,\n      495-522.

I will return to the question of &#x27;truth&#x27; momentarily. What the\ndiscussion so far tells us is the importance of divergence, in\nperception, perspective and expression. This relates both to the\nmarketplace of ideas, an essential component of the right to free\nspeech and expression (for without such a marketplace the right is a\nnothingness), and the pernicious &#x27;chilling effect&#x27;. To put this in a firm\nperspective, we need to turn to the 5-judge Supreme Court decision\nin <a href=\"/doc/132336158/\" id=\"a_241\">Kaushal Kishor v State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors.</a> 42 The learned\nAttorney-General for India submitted that--</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_248\">      as a matter of constitutional principle, any addition,\n      alteration or change in the norms or criteria for\n      imposition of restrictions on any fundamental right has\n      to come up through a legislative process.

The Supreme Court held by majority that the first question\nbefore it was in two parts. The first was whether the <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 19(2)</a>\nreasonable restrictions on the right to free speech under could be said\nto be exhaustive. The second, possibly following from the first, was\nwhether additional restrictions on the right to free speech can be\nimposed on grounds not found in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_247\">Article 19(2)</a>, by invoking other\nfundamental rights. We are not concerned here with the second part.\nThe Supreme Court said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">      33.

This is why this Court repeatedly\n      held that any restriction which does not fall within the four\n      corners of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_249\">Article 19(2)</a> will be unconstitutional. ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_203\">34.

The\n      Court made it clear that the reasonable restrictions sought to\n      be imposed must be through &quot;a law&quot; having statutory force\n      and not a mere Executive or Departmental instruction.

An argument can be made that this Court\n      can make exceptions under the peculiar\n      circumstances of this case, wherein the State\n      has acknowledged that it has not acted with the\n      requisite speed and vigour in the case of large\n      volumes of suspected unaccounted for monies\n      of certain individuals. There is an inherent\n      danger      in    making         exceptions      to\n      fundamental principles and rights on the\n      fly. Those exceptions, bit by bit, would then\n      eviscerate the content of the main right\n      itself. Undesirable lapses in upholding of\n      fundamental rights by the legislature, or the\n      executive, can be rectified by assertion of\n      constitutional principles by this Court.\n      However, a decision by this Court that an\n      exception could be carved out remains\n      permanently as a part of judicial canon, and\n      becomes a part of the constitutional\n      interpretation itself. It can be used in the future\n      in a manner and form that may far exceed what\n      this Court intended or what the constitutional\n      text and values can bear. We are not proposing\n      that Constitutions cannot be interpreted in a\n      manner that allows the nation-State to tackle\n      the problems it faces. The principle is that\n      exceptions cannot be carved out willy-nilly,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                         Page 91 of 148</span>\n                       31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_253\">January 2024\n      Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                   oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n       and without forethought as to the damage they\n       may cause.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">       86. One of the chief dangers of making\n       exceptions to principles that have become a\n       part of constitutional law, through aeons of\n       human experience, is that the logic, and ease\n       of seeing exceptions, would become\n       entrenched as a part of the constitutional\n       order. Such logic would then lead to seeking\n       exceptions, from protective walls of all\n       fundamental rights, on grounds of\n       expediency and claims that there are no\n       solutions to problems that the society is\n       confronting without the evisceration of\n       fundamental rights. That same logic could\n       then be used by the State in demanding\n       exceptions to a slew of other fundamental\n       rights, leading to violation of human rights\n       of citizens on a massive scale.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_209\">35.

Information that may be grossly offensive or which\n       causes annoyance or inconvenience are undefined terms\n       which take into the net a very large amount of protected\n       and innocent speech. A person may discuss or even\n       advocate by means of writing disseminated over the\n       internet information that may be a view or point of view\n       pertaining to governmental, literary, scientific or other\n       matters which may be unpalatable to certain sections of\n       society. It is obvious that an expression of a view on any\n       matter may cause annoyance, inconvenience or may be\n       grossly offensive to some. A few examples will suffice.

On this perennial dilemma, it is worth considering the\nfollowing extracts from John D Caputo of Syracuse University and\nVillanova University. In his incisive work Truth: The Search for\nWisdom in the Postmodern Age, 51 he writes:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">      Contemporary life, which is marked by modern\n      transportation systems in which we can travel almost\n      anywhere, and modern information systems, through\n      which almost anything can travel to us, is much more\n      pluralistic than life in the past.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">      This has resulted in ideas about open-ended rainbow\n      cultures rather than monochromic pure ones. But it has\n      also created trouble. On the one hand it has created social\n      strife, arising from an influx of peoples into the wealthier\n      nations in search of a better life, as well as the\n      exploitation of the poorer countries by the wealthier ones\n      on the global market. Kant, to his credit, saw some of this\n      coming, and addressed it under the name of\n      &#x27;cosmopolitanism&#x27;, treating visitors as citizens of the\n\n\n\n50    (1988) 1 SCC 668.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">51    Penguin Books, 2013.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">                              Page 99 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_281\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_231\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_279\">January 2024\n      Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                   oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ncosmos, of the world, which is an excellent point, especially\ncoming from someone who didn&#x27;t get around much. On the\nother hand, contemporary life has created problems for\nphilosophers, as all this pluralism threatens a veritable\nvertigo when it comes to truth, and that vertigo is called\npostmodernism.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_282\">So if you ask postmodernists, &#x27;What is truth?&#x27; they are\nlikely to squint and say, &#x27;It depends.&#x27; Postmodernists\ntend to be a bit incredulous that there is just one thing\ncalled truth which is always and everywhere the same,\nand are more inclined to think there are a lot of different\ntruths, depending on who and where you are; they are\ninclined to play it loose. Herein lies the problem. Playing\nit too loose with truth is called relativism -- a point that\nwe will want to keep in mind throughout. Relativism\nmeans there is no Truth, just a lot of competing truths,\ndepending on your language, culture, gender, religion,\nneeds, tastes, etc., and one is as good as another. Who can\nsay what is true? Who has the authority to pronounce on\nthat? So the critics of postmodernism fear the worst:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">relativism, scepticism, nihilism, flat out anarchy. And,\ntruth to tell, a lot of postmodern philosophers have\ncreated this impression because they have spent their\ntime trying to take the air out of Truth. In the late\nnineteenth century, Nietzsche (one of postmodernism&#x27;s\npatron saints) said Truth was an ensemble of fictions and\nmetaphors that we had forgotten are fictions and metaphors.\nMore recently, the highly influential philosopher\nRichard Rorty (1931-2007) said truth was merely a\ncompliment we pay ourselves when things are going well\nwith our beliefs. He was an American, and a pragmatist. But\nmaybe you already guessed that. Classical philosophers,\nespecially Germans, love to capitalize Truth (of course the\nGermans capitalize all their nouns), while postmodernists\ngenerally avoid the upper case.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                        Page 100 of 148</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_233\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_280\">January 2024\n      Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                   oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nSo the problem we have on our hands -- and it&#x27;s a good\none to read about on a long journey -- is what &#x27;universal&#x27;\nmeans in a postmodern world, and what &#x27;truth&#x27; means\nwhere our first thought is that everyone&#x27;s truth is\nentitled to its own fifteen minutes in the sun.\nRelativism is the main threat to truth that is posed by the\npostmodernists, just as absolutism is the main threat\nposed by modernism. In what follows I hope to dodge\nboth these bullets, each of which I regard as dead ends, I\nwill argue that absolutism is a kind of intellectual\nblackmail, while relativism, which is widely mistaken to\nbe the postmodern theory of truth, is in fact a failure to\ncome up with a theory. Relativism renders us unable to\nsay that anything is wrong, but absolutism confuses us\nwith God. Unbridled relativism means that anything at\nall could be taken to be true, and then we&#x27;re left standing\nat the station, holding the bag of &#x27;anything goes&#x27;. This\nisn&#x27;t chaosmic, it&#x27;s just chaos. If anything goes, how will you\never be able to say anything is false? Why not just say things\nare different?</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">How about &#x27;2 + 2 = 5&#x27;? How would you be able to object to\nlying and cheating? How about people who swindle the\nelderly out of their life savings? The list goes on. So, fond as\nwe are of travelling hither and yon, Anything Goes is one of\nthose places we don&#x27;t want to go.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">This even entails renouncing the title of my book, Truth,\nand breaking the bad news to readers that there is no such\nthing. Instead there are truths -- many of them, in the\nplural and lower case. There is no such thing as Reason\n(as it was understood by the Enlightenment at least), but\nthere are good reasons and bad ones. I want to defend all\nof this -- and this is the challenge -- while not ending us all\nup in the Relativist ditch of &#x27;anything goes&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                        Page 101 of 148</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_235\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_281\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n      Lessing offers us some sage advice in terms of reducing our\n      expectations and trimming our sails to the winds of space and\n      time.

This is something of\n      which we have been made acutely aware by modern\n      transportation and information systems, by virtue of which\n      we are constantly being barraged by a multiplicity of\n      perspectives. Whatever truth means for us -- in our\n      postmodern situation -- is a function of hermeneutics, of\n      learning to adjudicate; of dealing with difference\n      judiciously.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">      Hermeneutics is based on the idea that there are truths\n      big and small, some crucially important, others not so\n      much, truths of different kinds, levels and purposes, all\n      depending on our hermeneutic situation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">                                                         (Emphasis added)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_283\">118.

The major news\norganizations like the Financial Times, the New York Times, the\nEconomist and other periodicals like the New Yorker and a slew of\nothers are reputed to have very stringent fact checking standards.\nSubmitted material must first pass through these filters before it hits\nprint -- and, in the case of online editions, even the online versions\nof the same content.

Every single counter point on\ngovernment business can conceivably fall within the word\n&#x27;misleading&#x27;. What is left to the user, therefore, he submits, is nothing\nbut an illusion of choice; in reality, there is no choice at all; all must,\nat least in regard to &#x27;the business of the Central Government&#x27;,\nconform to the diktat of the FCU.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_306\">127.

That&#x27;s why the First Amendment is so\nnecessary. At various times and in various places during our\nnation&#x27;s history, Jeffersonian Republicans, Hamiltonian\nFederalists, Catholics, Jews, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, atheists,\nlabor organizers, anarchists, pacifists, socialists,\ncommunists, civil rights activists, white supremacists,\nwomen&#x27;s liberation advocates, LGBT rights proponents,\nand fundamentalist Christians have all been victims of the\nintolerance of substantial parts of American society, and\noften of government censorship as well. And while social\nmedia has undoubtedly enabled new modes of\ncancellation, its ready availability to all has\nsimultaneously provided a megaphone to unpopular\nspeakers, making it more difficult to cancel them\neffectively.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_313\">With so much cancellation from all sides, free speech is\nundoubtedly imperilled on college campuses. The academic\nenterprise demands a commitment to open debate and free\ninquiry. In the words of a 1974 Yale faculty committee\nreport, written by the historian C. Vann Woodward in\nresponse to students shouting down speakers fifty years ago,\n&quot;The history of intellectual growth and discovery clearly\ndemonstrates the need for unfettered freedom, the right\nto think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and\nchallenge the unchallengeable.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_314\">And the problem is hardly unique to universities; a\nbroader culture in which people often get their news and\nopinion from outlets that express only one point of view\nmeans many have lost the habit of engaging seriously\nwith ideas they find disturbing, wrong, or offensive. We\nask a lot of students when we tell them to rise above all that.\nBut as the 1974 Yale committee noted, that is precisely what\nintellectual growth requires.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">                        Page 113 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_315\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_259\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_295\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\n        The prevalent notion that hearing something one finds\n        offensive inflicts harm that should be avoided, and\n        concomitant demands for &quot;trigger warnings&quot; and &quot;safe\n        spaces,&quot; make open conversation challenging. In response,\n        it&#x27;s not sufficient to invoke the playground rhyme &quot;Sticks\n        and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt\n        me.&quot; We have all at some point been hurt by someone&#x27;s\n        words. Speech is undeniably powerful, and it can be used\n        for good or bad ends. But just as playing soccer\n        inescapably poses the risk of injury, so the free exchange\n        of ideas will inevitably leave some feeling bruised.

I have already discussed the relevant portions of Shreya Singhal\non overbreadth and vagueness. I will not repeat these. I find nothing\nin Shreya Singhal that overbreadth or vagueness as a ground to hold a\nstatute ultra vires is limited to penal provisions. If anything, it is quite\nthe opposite. I cannot possibly revisit or rethink the Supreme Court\ndicta in Shreya Singhal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_333\">140. I am puzzled how it can be denied that this Rule has no &#x27;penal&#x27;\nconsequences. It does. There does not have to be a rule prescribing\nan offence or a punishment. Rule 7 makes it clear that not only is there\nloss of safe harbour but there is an immediate liability to prosecution\nas well, and a loss of prosecution immunity if an intermediary does\nnot cease to host the FCU-identified content.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_334\">141. The first point remains. Is there vagueness? Can it be cured by\nan appropriate &#x27;reading down&#x27; (not a rewriting)? What would Mr\nMehta have us do? How would he have us read the Rule in question?\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">                                 Page 117 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_335\">                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_270\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_306\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_336\">142. To begin with, Mr Mehta contends that the Rule is limited to\nthat which is fake or false, and this can never be subjective. I have\nbeen at some pains to question the accuracy of even this assertion, so\nbroadly stated. But the submission wholly elides the expression\n&#x27;misleading&#x27; and asks that it be ignored entirely. That I cannot do. I\ndo not say that it will colour the other two terms, but it has to be read\nin context. When confronted with this, to argue causality -- that\nsome information is &#x27;misleading&#x27; because it is &#x27;fake or false&#x27; --\nproceeds on a false premise of the three words being amorphous and\ninterchangeable or having some sort of undefined interplay. But that\nin itself is vagueness and overbreadth. The three words are\ndisjunctive (the comma and the use of the disjunctive &#x27;or&#x27;). One\nexpression cannot glissade over the others. That is not reading down.\nIt is reading out. I cannot do that.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_337\">143. Second, Mr Mehta says that &#x27;information&#x27; in the impugned\nRule should be confined to &#x27;facts&#x27;. But &#x27;information&#x27; is defined in the\n<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_307\">IT Act</a>. &#x27;Fact&#x27; takes its definition from the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_308\">Evidence Act</a>, as we have\nseen. What is now suggested is that we should read in to fake, false or\nmisleading as an exclusion (or somehow read out), any opinion, view,\ncommentary, satire, or criticism. The Rule does not even remotely\nsuggest this. It simply flattens everything that is in its path by\nreferencing any information that the FCU has identified as &#x27;fake, false\nor misleading&#x27; in relation to the &#x27;business of the Central\nGovernment&#x27;. Now the definition of &#x27;information&#x27; in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_309\">IT Act</a> itself\nis expansive and inclusive. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_271\">It has the widest possible import. I do not\nsee how a court can, in the face of that interpretation, narrow the\ndefinition by judicial interpretation. That would be most injudicious.\nThe written submissions by Mr Mehta do not really clarify the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                               Page 118 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_310\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nposition. For instance, it is suggested -- and I do not know by what\nmechanism a statement in written submission or even on affidavit can\noperate to alter a statute -- that &#x27;false information&#x27; is that which\n&#x27;purports&#x27; to be true but &#x27;cannot be supported as true under any\nreasonable interpretation&#x27;. Supported by whom? Why? What is or is\nnot a reasonable interpretation is surely not a singularity.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_338\">144. I was surprised to hear from Mr Mehta a suggestion that there\ncould be a disclaimer by intermediaries, i.e., that when confronted\nwith a FCU identification of some business of the Central\nGovernment being fake, false or misleading, a mere disclaimer would\nsuffice without actual removal of content. But nothing in my analysis\nof the Rule supports this. The emphasis is on the words &quot;not to host&quot;.\nContinuing to host with a disclaimer attached is not contemplated at\nall.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_339\">145. Further, emphasizing the words &#x27;reasonable efforts&#x27; is to no\navail. The reason is the virality of the medium. No intermediary can\nguarantee that every single occurrence, repetition or incident of\ncontent is removed. By its very nature, content is proliferated and\nrepeated, endlessly: what we call &#x27;forwards&#x27;. This is not a situation of\na single chunk of content being in a static or solitary place from which\nit can be removed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_273\">It spreads in every direction -- hence, &#x27;reasonable\nefforts&#x27; (as opposed to doing nothing at all). Moreover, digital content\nis frequently cached and can remain in some digital store for years on\nend. No one can ensure absolute removal; hence, again, a\n&#x27;reasonable&#x27; or &#x27;best efforts&#x27; provision. But this is not the same thing\nas saying that the intermediary has the choice of not removing the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                              Page 119 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_311\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ncontent identified by the FCU as fake, false or misleading. If it does\nnot, it has not made &#x27;reasonable efforts&#x27; and the consequences follow.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_340\">146. Here Mr Mehta in his further written submissions invites us to\nventure into the realm of the &#x27;known unknowns&#x27;, or, as he puts it, the\n&#x27;elephant test&#x27; -- impossible to describe, but you know it when you\nsee it. 60 The first authority cited, from the UK, Aerotel Ltd v Telco\nHoldings Ltd, 61 actually rejected this submission. But Mr Mehta&#x27;s\ncanvas is this trifecta: (i) it is not necessary to define with precision the\nwords fake, false or misleading because (ii) they cannot be precisely\ndefined; yet (iii) one knows them when one comes upon them.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_341\">147. But in the same written submissions, the Union of India would\nhave it that the terms are capable of &#x27;mathematical precision&#x27;, and it\nprovides ten pages of definitions; presumably inviting us to fall back\non ordinary lexical meanings. 62 But what not one of these definitions\ndeny, as they cannot, is that though a determination may be possible,\nit is inherently subjective.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_342\">148. We have already seen what the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_312\">Evidence Act</a> says.

And even if it does, these\nstandards -- all rooted in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_314\">Evidence Act</a> -- can yield inconsistent\nand contradictory results. What troubles me is this. If the FCU is to\ngo about its business in this fashion, then it is really arrogating to itself\nthe power of some court, civil or criminal. For the final determination\nof these matters on these standards and precepts is the work of courts.\nIf one strips away these accretions, what remains is the conferment\nof unguided and uncanalised authority on the FCU to decide what it\nlikes about anything it choose relating to the business of the Central\nGovernment.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_345\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"687159\" id=\"span_277\">149. Vagueness and overbreadth may overlap, but they are\nconceptually distinct. Vagueness is unacceptable fuzziness and lack\nof clarity. Overbreadth is a statute that tries too much.

But in that very decision,\nthe Supreme Court held that the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_337\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> cannot be restricted except as permitted by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_338\">Article 19(2).</a> The\nCAB decision was in the context of a perceived need to regulate not\nfree speech but the issue of licenses to broadcaster. It did not deal\nwith content. The impugned Rule is concerned only with content.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_357\">157. I agree, though, on this: that the potential implications of fake\nnews is indeed wide. But that is surely an argument against the\ngovernment on the question of overbreadth, because it necessarily\nand axiomatically makes suspect and subject to identification with no\nreference to cause, effect or <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 19(2)</a>&#x27;s constraints, every single\ndigital data chunk that relates to the business of the Central\nGovernment. Before anything else is suggested, the primary\nrequirement remains: a demonstration that the impugned Rule falls\nwithin, and only within, the straitjacket of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 19(2).</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_358\">158.

There is much of\nvalue in his thoughtful and well-researched note, drawing on\njurisprudence from various jurisdictions. Our Constitution does not\ndistinguish between &quot;high-value&quot; and &quot;low-value&quot; speech. The\nState cannot make this distinction. All forms of expression are\npresumptively protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_343\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> The only restrictions\nare in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_344\">Article 19(2).</a> We have already seen this.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_361\">160. He is also correct in saying that the State cannot coercively\nclassify speech as true or false and compel the non-publication of the\nlatter. That is nothing but censorship. The Constitutional guarantee\nof free speech is a guarantee on principle; a recognition of, as Justice\nAP Shah said in Anand Patwardhan, a natural right. What is the\nunderlying rationale? It would appear to have overlapping\ndimensions. First, through debate, disagreement, dissent, discourse\nand dialogue, it is a mechanism to truth-determination. Second, it is a\nmatter of individual agency and autonomy buried in the promise of\n&#x27;freedom&#x27;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_288\">Third, it is tied root and branch to the concept of a\ndemocratic republic: self-governance under the rule of law, and this\nties to the first. The noisiness of all three is not to be abjured. It is\ndevoutly to be welcomed. The opposite, viz., that the State alone will\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                              Page 125 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_345\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ndetermine in advance and for all and on what topic it chooses that\nwhich can or cannot be said is the complete anti-thesis of the\n&#x27;freedom&#x27;. It knocks it off its pedestal.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_362\">161. There is, as I have noted, something of a divide between what\nis said and how it is said. &quot;Information&quot; and &quot;content&quot; cover the\nwhat. The how is a question of the manner of expression. Separating\nthe two is not a matter of wheat-from-chaff. Indeed, few courts\nanywhere have achieved unanimity about this.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_363\">162. To put it differently: in our constitutional scheme, free speech\nis always to be under-regulated, and the restrictions on it -- attempts\nat control and abridgement -- must be over-regulated, not the other\nway around. This is not a finding that there is a fundamental right to\nfalsehood or fake news or deepfakes. Quite the contrary. That is not\neven the question before us. The only issue is whether the State has,\nin our Constitutional set up, an overriding authority to arrive at an\nabsolutist determination of both content and expression as &#x27;the truth&#x27;\nand to compel a particular form of content and expression? I would\nhave the greatest difficulty in accepting a proposition of this width.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_364\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_290\">163. I am also not be misunderstood to suggest, let alone hold, that\nany fundamental right is absolute. That is contrary to law. What\ncomes to us from established learning and the weight of authority is\nthat the restrictions on the right must conform to what the\nConstitution itself demands. We need not look at judge-made\njurisprudence in the American context because, as I have noted, our\nConstitution took a different path. Our Constitution does not (as US\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">                               Page 126 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_346\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nlaw might be said to do) distinguish between types of free speech. It\nsimply enumerates in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_347\">Article 19(2)</a>, the specific parameters within\nwhich that right can be curtailed -- and every attempt at statutory\ncurtailment must be demonstrated to fall within, and strictly and only\nwithin, the confines of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_348\">Article 19(2).</a> More importantly, <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_349\">Article 19(2)</a>\ncannot be expanded by legislation or judicial pronouncement. As Mr\nDatar points out, that would need a full-fledged Constitutional\namendment. India is not alone in this interpretation, as Mr Bhatia\npoints out with instances from South African jurisprudence. Thus,\neven a restriction on fake, false or misleading cannot lie outside\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_350\">Article 19(2).</a> It must remain within, and it must satisfy the tests of\nbeing the least restrictive and of meeting the demands of the doctrine\nof proportionality.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_365\">164. Where might a piece of &#x27;fake news&#x27; calling for an insurrection\nor an incitement to communal or other violence fall? Conceivably,\nthis could well be within the <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_351\">Article 19(2)</a> limits of &#x27;public disorder&#x27;.\nBut that demands guidelines, and it demands a shrinking or\nconstriction of what can be held to be fake, false or misleading and\nwhy. The impugned Rule takes up falsity per se, and restricts content\non that ground divorced from, and untraceable to, any specific part of\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_352\">Article 19(2).</a> That would be impermissible.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_366\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_292\">165. Mr Bhatia&#x27;s written submissions have an extensive analysis of\ncomparative jurisdictions, but those may not be necessary for my\npurposes. The general principles are correct; most of all that while\nsome things may be absolutely true (that 2+2 = 4), the question before\nus is whether the State can arrogate to itself the power to determine\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">                              Page 127 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_353\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nwhat, outside the starkly obvious, may be true or false. History has no\nshortage of examples; the most immediate one may be Galileo. Also,\nfrom the evidence act, an opinion is a fact. But it is an opinion. It may\nbe neither true nor false (for instance, that such and such a writer\ndeserves the Nobel Prize).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_367\">166. My discussion could end here. But there are other submissions\nto consider, and I now turn to those.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_368\">IX    <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_354\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_355\">Article 19(6)</a>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_369\">167. Supplementing Mr Seervai&#x27;s argument, but with a focus of\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_356\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_357\">Article 19(6)</a>, Mr Farasat opens with one incisive\npoint. The test, he submits, and I think with considerable\njustification, is to see if this Rule could be applied to print media as it\nstands.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_370\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_294\">168. Mr Farasat is quick to point out that the stereotyped &#x27;vision&#x27; of\na social media &#x27;user&#x27; being only an individual with internet access on\nsome device is far from true. The Editors&#x27; Guild, which he\nrepresents, is in charge of content in both print and digital media.\nThere are several commercial bodies that have -- and traditionally\nonly had -- print editions. These publications now have social media\naccounts in the name of their publications, apart from individual\ncontent contributors having their own accounts. In law, this is most\nvisible with, for instance, the online social media accounts of LiveLaw\nand BarAndBench (neither with a print edition). But other\npublications like the Times of India, the Hindu, the Hindustan\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">                               Page 128 of 148</span>\n                              31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_358\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nTimes, the Indian Express and so forth all have daily broadsheets in\nprint and, in addition, have social media accounts.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_371\">169. The conundrum, he points out, is this: content is not fake, false\nor misleading only because of the medium. The medium does not\ndetermine the message. Yet the impugned Rule applies only to online\ncontent. If there is an underlying or accompanying print version, it is\nnot subjected to the same level of scrutiny.

Social media has become the primary news medium for the last\nhalf-decade or so. There is some material to show a precipitous\ndecline in hard-copy newspaper readership in India. That in turn\nmeans a stagnation or decline in advertising revenue. Social media is\nthus the primary driver for news dissemination. The impugned Rule\ntargets social media content even for news outlets that have a print\nmedia (and about which nothing is or can be proposed). There is,\nthus, a direct infringement of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_362\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> The impugned Rule\n&#x27;pushes out of the news cycle&#x27; the digital version of any reportage\nwith which the Central Government disagrees.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_378\">173.

At least on this aspect of the matter, I am unable to see any\nappropriate answer to Mr Farasat&#x27;s formulation. Any particular\n&#x27;information&#x27; does not become fake, false or misleading only because it\nis digital. Examples can be endlessly multiplied. India&#x27;s economic\ngrowth, poverty levels, education, health, drinking water, even\ninternet freedom are all fertile grounds for opposing views and\ncriticism. If this critical material is in print, it cannot be censored --\nat least not by this Rule. But the very same material only because it is\nalso in digital form is liable to be suppressed as fake, false or\nmisleading. What would happen to reports on figures and statistics\non fatalities and vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic? The\ngovernment had one set of figures. Others reported differently in\nprint. And they did so online as well. Would the online content be\n&#x27;fake, false or misleading&#x27; but the identical content in hard copy not?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_381\">175.

But Entry 97 in List I\nhas a residuary provision, which makes it expansive; and <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_380\">Article 73</a>\nextends the executive power of the Union even to matters on which\nParliament has not legislated, though competent to do so. Whether\nthis adds to overbreadth and vagueness is not the question. The point\nonly is that it is virtually impossible -- and more akin to the elephant\nargument -- to define what the business of the Central Government\nactually covers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_394\">182. A look at the &#x27;exemplars&#x27; in the Union of India&#x27;s compilation\nshows precisely this: the PIB has put out corrections and\nidentifications on a vast range of subjects: police, defence, health and\nmedicine, social media account information, elections, statements\nattributed to the then Chief Justice of India and so forth. This tells\nme two things: first, the business of the Central Government is not as\nwell-defined or limited as Mr Mehta would have it; and second, that\nthe existing -- that is to say, the least restrictive -- measure of having\nthe PIB put out corrections, clarifications and identifications even in\nrelation to whatever may be the business of the Central Government\nis sufficient.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_395\">183. Thus, information and content relating to the business of the\nCentral Government is a separate class. For this, and this alone, the\nCentral Government&#x27;s own FCU will determine what is fake, false or\nmisleading. And then the consequences follow.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                               Page 134 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_396\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_311\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_381\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_397\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"66395994\" id=\"span_312\">184. The Government does not ipso facto constitute a class of its\nown sufficient to justify preferential treatment.

How might one go about testing this? The universe of all social\nmedia content is a subset of all internet content (just as there some of\nus who use the internet but have no social media accounts, there is\ninternet material that is not on social media). Within this subset is a\nfurther subset of information relating to the business of the Central\nGovernment. But anything, i.e., any content on the internet in the\nlargest class may be fake, false or misleading -- and may have the\nsame ills and perils as every other piece of information. Similarly, any\ncontent on social media, not just government content, may be fake,\nfalse or misleading. Why is Central Government business-related\ncontent a class apart (and why not, while we are about it, State\nGovernment content, or content relating to every instrumentality of\nthe State?) In other words, there is no justification why the business\nof the Central Government stands or should stand on a special footing\ndistinct from other information. Or, as Mr Seervai somewhat\nwaspishly put it, what is so great or so special about the Central\nGovernment? To say only that there is a significant likelihood of\nspeculation, misconception and one-sided information is no answer.\nThat is equally true of anything or anyone. The suggestion, too, that\n\n\n69    (1964) 6 SCR 903 : AIR 1964 SC 1633.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                              Page 135 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_399\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_314\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_383\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\nthe Central Government most especially is in a particularly\nvulnerable position and cannot defend itself is hardly tenable.

Self-evidently, the impugned Rule cannot operate outside its\ncontrolling statute. No Rule can. <a href=\"/doc/1769769/\" id=\"a_392\">Section 87</a> of the IT Act allows the\nCentral Government to make rules by notification to carry out the\nprovisions of the Act.

The impugned Rule is not made under <a href=\"/doc/1554652/\" id=\"a_399\">Section 87(2)(z)</a> of the\nIT Act. They could not have been. Therefore, the impugned Rule\nfalls under <a href=\"/doc/1554652/\" id=\"a_400\">Section 87(2)(zg)</a>. That in turn means it must be read with\n<a href=\"/doc/103684089/\" id=\"a_401\">Section 79(2)</a> (the safe harbour provision in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_402\">IT Act</a>). <a href=\"/doc/1554652/\" id=\"a_403\">Section\n87(2)(zg)</a> directly references <a href=\"/doc/103684089/\" id=\"a_404\">Section 79(2)</a>; i.e., safe harbour.

Further, what the impugned Rule does is to create substantive\nlaw beyond the parent statute.

The\nsubstantive law created is this: the intermediary, on receiving a\ncommuniqué from the FCU or the Central Government, and without\nany of the protections of <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 69A</a> (which have oversight in the\nform of a mechanism for the most serious issues, inter alia by\nrequiring reasons and by following prescribed procedures and\nsafeguards), must, at the risk of losing safe harbour, excise the content\nso identified.

What troubles me about the impugned 2023 amendment, and\nfor which I find no plausible defence is this: the 2023 amendment is\nnot just too close to, but actually takes the form of, censorship of user\ncontent. There is no material difference between this and the\nnewsprint cases of the 1990s. I should not be misunderstood: this is\nnot a comment on this or that dispensation or the present\n\n\n73    (2007) 2 SCC 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_425\">74    (1955) 1 SCR 707.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">                               Page 141 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_426\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_330\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_416\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ngovernment. I am only considering the effect of the impugned\namendment. What it does is to shift the responsibility for content\naccuracy from the creator or originator of the content to the service\nprovider or intermediary, an entity that axiomatically has no control\nover the content at all. But an intermediary is the one that has safe\nharbour and, as a business entity, is regulated by the government in\nmyriad ways. The impugned amendment makes the government&#x27;s\nchosen FCU the sole authority to decide what piece of user-content\nrelating to the undefined and unknowable &#x27;business of the\ngovernment&#x27; is or is not fake, false or misleading. The lack of\ndefinition of these words: business of the government; fake; false; and\nmisleading makes the amendment both vague and overbroad.\nAnything might be the business of government. Anything could be\nsaid to be &#x27;fake&#x27;. &#x27;Misleading&#x27; is entirely subjective. And as to &#x27;truth&#x27;\nand &#x27;falsity&#x27;, throughout recorded human history there are few, if any,\nabsolute truths. Perceptions, perspectives, possibilities, probabilities</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_427\">-- all will to a greater or lesser extent colour what one chooses to\nbelieve or hold or chooses not to believe or hold. The assumption that\nthere are absolute truths to even the business of government, even if\nwe knew what that included and what it did not, is unsubstantiated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_428\">203. How the FCU will go about its business is also unknown. We\nare simply asked to trust it. This is not a question of trust, and\nespecially not of distrust in any particular dispensation. It is simply a\nmatter of setting the impugned Rule against the settled law and seeing\nwhether it passes established Constitutional tests.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">                              Page 142 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_429\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_332\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_417\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_430\">204. By shifting responsibility for user content to the vulnerable\nsegment, viz., the intermediary, the amendment of 2023 effectively\nallows the government, through its FCU, to be the final arbiter not\njust of what is or is fake, false or misleading; but, more importantly,\nof the right to place an opposing point of view. We have already seen\nexamples, and they are not entirely hypothetical. The government\nroutinely rebuts criticism. If, in addition, this is now dubbed fake,\nfalse or misleading (and there are no guidelines to suggest why it\ncannot), then criticism and debate are stifled. There is little achieved\nin saying that the guidelines will come later. There is no assurance of\nthat either; and they should have been in place by now if there was\nsuch an intent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_431\">205. Again, I should not be misunderstood to suggest that the\nproblem of digital fakes is not serious. It is; but it is serious because it\nis a deliberate distortion, and it needs to be exposed and\ndemonstrated to be so by an open dialectic of debate and discourse.\nThis is, to be sure, noisy, raucous, and a messy business. But that is\nthe nature of a democratic republic with ensured freedoms: the\ncacophony of dissent and disagreement is the symphony of a\ndemocracy at work. The view of the FCU or the PIB that a particular\npiece of information relating to the business of the government is fake\nor false or misleading should not be allowed to be taken inviolate;\nmost certainly, its publication cannot be subject to penalty and loss of\nimmunity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_333\">                               Page 143 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_432\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_334\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_418\">January 2024\n             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                          oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_433\">206.

Of equal concern is the attempt in the impugned amendment\nto impermissibly expand the remit of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_419\">Article 19(2).</a> This, as I have\nnoted, is directly contrary to the government&#x27;s own stand before the\nSupreme Court in Kaushal Kishore, where it argued that <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_420\">Article 19(2)</a>\nis exhaustive. I fail to see how the amendment is within the scope of\nShreya Singhal either. To the contrary: it fails every test set out in that\ndecision, especially for overbreadth and vagueness. The impugned\namendment is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_421\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_422\">Article 19(2)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_423\">Article\n19(1)(g)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_424\">Article 19(6)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_425\">Article 14</a>, violates the principles of natural\njustice and is also ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_426\">Section 79</a> of the IT Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_435\">208. As a general and perhaps even inflexible rule, I would suggest\nthat every attempt to whittle down a fundamental right must be\nresisted root and branch. The slightest possibility of a fundamental\nright abridgment cannot be allowed to stand.

The submission on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_433\">Article 14</a> and the invalid classification is,\nin my view, correctly placed. As I have noted, information relating to\nthe business of the Central Government is a subset fully included in\nthe 2022 amendment. 76 There is no particular reason why\ninformation relating to the business of the Central Government\nshould receive &#x27;high value&#x27; speech recognition, more deserving of\nprotection with a dedicated cell to identify that which is fake, false or\nmisleading, as opposed to precisely such information about any\nindividual or news agency. There is material, indicated above, about\nwhat is called the epistemic apocalypse. We have seen that other than\npoint to instance of &#x27;fakery&#x27;, there is no material at all of any particular\n&#x27;public interest&#x27; or &#x27;national interest&#x27; peril -- and these are not even\nwithin the permissible parameters of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_434\">Article 19(2).</a> Consequently, it\nfollows that separating out the business of the Central Government\nfor preferential treatment is class legislation, not a rational or\npermissible classification. I will accept that it is not open to\nintermediaries to disclaim all responsibility: no Petitioner has\nsuggested that. Wholesale abandonment of all responsibility is\nirresponsible. 77 But that only reinforces the point that all information\ndeserves equal treatment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_438\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"89846076\" id=\"span_338\">210.

Further, the lack of contemporaneous guidelines raise the\nother question, never fully answered. As I have noted, the entire\nargument of the Union has more or less proceeded on the basis that\nall users are individuals. But, as we have seen immediately, that is\nentirely incorrect. Users are also entities such as news outlets and\njournals. Not only do they have their own fact-checking systems, but\nthey and their individual writers publish in print and online. The\ndecisive test must surely be that if the material in print cannot be\nsubjected to FCU checking and compelled deletion, there is no\nreason why, merely because the exact same material also appears\nonline it is susceptible to unilateral determination of fakeness, falsity\nor being misleading.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_441\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_341\">212. I have not been able to accept the submission, perhaps\nimplicitly suggested, that there has been no violation -- in the form\nof censorship or unilateral takedown as yet -- and therefore there is\nno call for interference; or that the assault is on &#x27;mere possibility of\nabuse&#x27;. It is not my reading of the law that petitions can only lie\ninfringement by infringement. The entire discussion in Shreya\nSinghal on &#x27;the chilling effect&#x27; militates against an acceptance of any\nsuch submission, for the finding of the Supreme Court is clearly\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">                              Page 146 of 148</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_437\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf\n\n\n\n\ndirected towards the anticipated future impact of a rule.

More importantly, this argument is founded on the entirely\nincorrect theory that the government is somehow parens patriae; it is\nduty bound to ensure that citizens receive only &#x27;correct information&#x27;\n(or what the government considers correct information); that the\nreasonable reader is infantile and cannot decide for herself or himself;\nand so on to the end of the chapter. This is again circular, for it is\nposited on the assumption that government-related information is\nsomehow special and deserving of extra protection. This sits at odds\nwith the fact that the biggest megaphone and the loudest voice is that\nof the government: if there is one entity that does not need such\nprotection, it is the government. It already has an &#x27;authentic&#x27; voice;\npossibly, the most authentic voice. And it has so far been unafraid to\nuse it.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_443\">214. Finally, I believe it is unthinkable that any one entity -- be it\nthe government or anyone else -- can unilaterally &#x27;identified&#x27;,\n(meaning picked out and decided) to be fake, false or misleading. That\nsurely cannot be the sole preserve of the government. The argument\nthat the government is &#x27;best placed&#x27; to know the &#x27;truth&#x27; about its\naffairs is equally true of every citizen and every entity. Paradoxically,\ncomplaints of a grievous nature (pornography, child abuse,\nintellectual property violations) can only be taken down only after\nfollowing a grievance redressal procedure; yet anything relating to the\nbusiness of the Central Government can be &#x27;identified&#x27; as fake, false\nor misleading by the FCU -- and cannot be hosted.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                              Page 147 of 148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_444\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_344\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_438\">January 2024\n            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected Matters</a> -- per GS Patel J\n                                         oswpl-9792-2023++J-F-GSPatelJ.pdf</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_445\">215.

I regret that I have been unable to persuade Justice Gokhale to\nmy perspective, nor I to share hers. We have, with due respect to each\nother&#x27;s views, agreed to disagree. To my mind, not only does that\nredound to the credit of our system since it permits and even\nencourages independence and dissent, but it is possibly the most\ncomplete answer to the very issue at hand, reinforcing thoroughly my\nview: that in our country, and under our Constitution, an alternative\nview should not ever be allowed to go unsaid, unheard or unread.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_448\">218.
