The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit\n\nthat Crime No.282/2004 pertains to S.C.No.35/2007 on the file of the\n\nAdditional   District   and   Sessions       Judge,   Fast   Track   Court   No.I,\n\nChengalpattu, wherein there were 16 accused and the petitioner was\n\ncharged for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 120(B)</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">149</a> r/w. 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> and after full-fledged trial, all the accused were\n\nacquitted honourably on 08.12.2008 and no appeal has been preferred\n\neither by the State or revision by the witnesses and therefore, it cannot\n\nbe taken into consideration. Insofar as the second case in Crime\n\nNo.286/2012 is concerned, it is the submission of the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner that the matter has been settled as early as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                          4</span>\n\nduring May 2012 and therefore, it cannot be termed as a material to\n\nopen History/Rowdy Sheet against the petitioner and in this regard, he\n\nhas submitted a detailed representation to the Director General of\n\nPolice,   Collector   of   Kancheepuram       District,   Inspector    of   Police,\n\nGuduvancherry Police Station to remove his name from the History\n\nSheet, but he has not been favoured with any response and hence,\n\nconstrained to file this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has drawn the\n\nattention of this Court to the Police Standing Order 749 and would\n\nsubmit that satisfaction has to be derived by the concerned authority\n\nwith a person against whom History Sheet is to be opened that he is\n\naddicted to crime and in the case on hand, there are absolutely no\n\nmaterial available and therefore, in all fairness, the respondents 4 to 6\n\nought to     have     removed   the   name     of   the   petitioner   from    the\n\nHistory/Rowdy Sheet and hence, prays for appropriate orders. The\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the petitioner has also drawn the\n\nattention of this Court to the order dated 29.11.2012 made in\n\nW.P.No.30320/2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">      5.

This Court carefully considered the rival submissions and also\n\nperused the materials available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">     7. In two sessions cases in S.C.Nos.35 and 36/2007 on the file of\n\nthe Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.I,\n\nChengalpattu, the petitioner was arrayed as Accused No.13 and was\n\ncharged for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 120(B)</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">149</a> r/w. 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a> and both the cases ended in acquittal for the reason\n\nthat the prosecution has failed to prove the charges levelled against the\n\naccused and the orders of acquittal came to be passed on 08.12.2008\n\nand no further challenge was made to the said orders of acquittal. Four\n\nyears thereafter, the petitioner was said to have been involved in Crime\n\nNo.286/2012 for the alleged commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1198799/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections\n\n294(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_25\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_26\">506(ii)</a> IPC, registered by the fifth respondent\n\nand according to the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the\n\nmatter has been compromised and the said fact is not seriously\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                         6</span>\n\ndisputed also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115135\" id=\"span_5\">8.   This   Court,   in     the   order   dated   29.11.2012   made    in\n\nW.P.No.30320 of 2012, has considered a similar issue and by placing\n\nreliance upon the earlier decision of this Court dated 22.06.2010 made\n\nin W.P.No.1199/2006, has ordered removal of the petitioner therein\n\nfrom the History Sheet.         A Division Bench of this Court in the decision\n\nin Selvaraj and Others v. The Inspector of Police, Kaliakavilai\n\nPolice Station, Kaliakavilai, Kanyakumari District and others\n\n[2010 Writ L.R. 335] has considered the scope of Police Standing\n\nOrders 746, 748, 749(1) &amp; (3), 751 and 758 and also considered the\n\njudgment rendered by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/115135/\" id=\"a_27\">Vani v. Superintendent of Police</a>\n\n[2008 (3) MLJ 1525] and held that the History Sheets were opened\n\non 09.04.2006 and as per the Police Standing Orders, it should come to\n\nan end with December 2007 and in the absence of any information as to\n\nthe continuance of the same, has found that the keeping of the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s name in the History Sheet is unsustainable and therefore,\n\ndisposed of the writ petition accordingly.        It is relevant to extract the\n\nobservations of this Court in the above cited judgment [2008 (3) MLJ\n\n1525]:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            “In all these Writ Petitions, the petitioners have\n      raised questions of far-reaching importance, namely, the\n      rights of citizens of India to lead a free life subject to social\n      control imposed by valid law. The question raised in all\n      these writ petitions at the instance of the alleged\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                              7</span>\n\ndisreputable characters cannot be allowed to deflect the\nperspective of this Court. If the police do what they did to\nthese petitioners, they can also do the same to the honest\nand law abiding citizens.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       2. The common thread in all these three Writ\nPetitioners are that the actions taken by the respective\nStation House Officers in opening History Sheets in the\nname of the petitioners mechanically counter signed by the\nrespective Superior Police Officers is justified.\n.........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">10.6. For those entries, without any basis, the Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police had been counter signed year\nafter year. In all those entries, it is noted that she was\nunmarried and she was having bad conduct. But she was\nfound working in an Automobile company at Madurai and\nshe was living with her family, who are doing milk\nbusiness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">10.7. Even after her acquittal by the Criminal Court as\nearly as on 30.09.2007, the Inspector of Police continued\nto retain her name in the History Sheets. Shockingly, even\non 30.9.2007, a note was put up to continue her name\nunder the surveillance list for one more year.\n10.8. A perusal of the original file clearly shows that there\nwas no basis for opening a History Sheet in the name of\nthe petitioner and for making such entries there was no\nfactual basis.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">.........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">13...... In one case, the petitioner in W.P.No.5378 of 2005\nwas acquitted. In the second case, the petitioner was on\nbail and he was also an elected Panchayat President. The\nnotings in the files relating to the second and the third\npetitioners, noting were made periodically by the\nrespondents stating heir conduct was not blameworthy. In\nthe case of the first petitioner Ms.Vani, an endorsement\nstating that she is a unmarried woman, living with her\nparents and working in an Automobile Company, at\nMadurai but she was having bad character. There was not\neven an iota of material to support such remark found in\nthe file. Either it shows the subjective opinion of the\nstation House Officer or that it shows their clear animus\ntowards the petitioners.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     ..........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     16. In the above factual matrix, it is necessary to refer the\n     PSO 746 of Tamil Nadu Police Standing Orders providing\n     power for opening history sheets and it reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     “PSO 746, Part-IV – History Sheets.\n     (I) Part V (Form No.111) shall contain the History Sheets\n     of the persons resident permanently or temporarily in their\n     Station limits who are known or believed to be addicted to\n     or to aid and abet the commission of crime, whether\n     convicted or not or who are believed to be habitual\n     receivers.”\n     .........\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">     20. Therefore, in the light of the facts narrated and the\n     legal precedents, it must be held that the actions of the\n     respondents in all the three Writ Petitions are\n     condemnable. Opening of the history sheets in the name of\n     three petitioners are arbitrary, unreasonable and whimsical\n     and it would amount to denial of right of citizens provided\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the constitution of India to have the\n     right of privacy. Though opportunities were given to the\n     respondents, they have not shown any credible materials\n     to justify their action before this Court. The superior officer\n     though had considerable responsibility to oversee such\n     records have acted in a mechanical fashion to put their\n     initials periodically without any verification. “\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">     9. The above cited decisions are squarely applicable to the facts of\n\nthis case for the reason that in two murder cases, the petitioner was\n\nhonourably acquitted even in the year 2008 and in yet another case\n\ninvolved in the commission of minor offences, which said to have taken\n\nplace in the year 2012, the matter has been compromised and it is also\n\nnot made clear whether the name of the petitioner in the Rowdy/History\n\nsheet has been extended subsequently.       In the light of the materials\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                      9</span>\n\nplaced before this Court, it cannot be said that the petitioner is addicted\n\nto crime as on today.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">      10. In the result, this Writ Petition is allowed and the respondents\n\n3 to 6 are directed to delete the name of the petitioner from History\n\nSheet No.02/2012 forthwith.       No costs.   Consequently, the connected\n\nmiscellaneous petition is closed.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n\n                                                               24.07.2014\n\nIndex       : Yes / No\nInternet    : Yes / No\njvm\n\nTo\n\n1.The Home Secretary,\n  Government of Tamil Nadu,\n  Secretariat,\n  Fort St.George,\n  Chennai-600 009.\n\n2.The Director General of Police,\n  Tamil Nadu Police Head Quarters,\n  Kamarajar Salai,\n  Chennai-600 005.\n\n3.The Superintendent of Police,\n  Kancheepuram District,\n  Kancheepuram.\n\n4.The Deputy Superintendent of Police,\n  Chengalpet Sub-Division,\n  Kancheepuram District.\n\n5.The Inspector of Police,\n  Guduvancherry Circle,\n  Kancheepuram District.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                 10</span>\n\n                                      M.SATHYANARAYANAN.
