Life is made up of good times\n                                 and bad, and the bad times can bring with it terrible illnesses\n                                 and extreme hardships. The partners in a marriage must weather\n                                 these storms and embrace the sunshine with equanimity. Any\n                                 person may have bad health, this is not their fault and most\n                                 times, it is not within their control, as in the present case, the\n                                 respondent was unwell and was taking treatment for the same.\n                                 The illness had its fair share of problems......&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                    33. Marriage is not made of only happy memories and good times, and two\n                          people in a marriage have to face challenges and weather the storm\n                          together. It is not easy to live with a partner who has mental health\n                          issues, and such ailments come with their own challenges for the person\n                          facing the problem, and even more so for the spouse. There needs to be\n                          an understanding of the problems in a marriage, and communication\n                          between the partners- especially when one of the two partners in a\n                          marriage is facing challenges of their own. Treatment of any mental\n                          ailment requires acceptance of the same, not only by the family members\n                          but, most importantly, by the person suffering therefrom. The same has\n                          been enunciated by the Department of Health, Australia Government\n                          where it has been observed that, &quot;....Acceptance is acknowledged to be\n                          an important step in developing effective illness management strategies\n                          and working effectively with mental health services and complying with\n                          medications and treatments (Van Meijel et al 2002a, Van Meijel et al\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                           MAT.

Thus, the Family Court fell in error in rejecting the appellant‟s\n                          application. The approach of the Family Court - that the appellant had to\n                          fend for himself, and he could not seek a direction from the Court for\n                          medical examination of the respondent was erroneous.

The appellant had shown the respondent to\n                          several specialists, and the medications prescribed show that they were\n                          relevant for treatment of Schizophrenia. The appellant also produced the\n                          medical doctors/ specialists and exhibited their prescriptions. The parties\n                          lived together for hardly any period, as the respondent was taken away\n                          by her father after about nine weeks of marriage from the matrimonial\n                          home. The evidence with regard to the respondent‟s medical condition -\n                          which related to her mental health, could possibly not have been\n                          garnered by the appellant without co-operation of the respondent. Only\n                          upon medical examination of the respondent, it could be established,\n                          with definiteness whether, or not, she is suffering from Schizophrenia,\n                          even though, there were pointers in that direction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                    42.

The\n                          appellant could not have been left to gather evidence of the respondent‟s\n                          mental condition on his own.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">                    44.

Why else, such a spouse-who claims to be not\n                          suffering from any mental ailment who has preferred a petition to seek\n                          restitution of conjugal rights, and expresses her desire to live with the\n                          appellant husband, not undergo such medical examination?</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">                    46. The only course that commends itself, in the facts of the case, is to call\n                          the opinion of an expert Medical Board. While the burden of proof is on\n                          the party alleging a claim, the conduct and cooperation of the other party\n                          is something to be taken a note of. The outright refusal by learned\n                          counsel of the Respondent to subject the Respondent to such medical\n                          examination, leaves the situation at a stalemate and prevents us from\n                          arriving at the definite truth. The Respondent has scuttled the effort of\n                          the court to arrive at a definite finding of truth. The only way of\n                          conclusively determining the mental health of the Respondent is by\n                          subjecting the Respondent to an examination by an expert Medical\n                          Board. The appellant has significantly discharged the onus by leading\n                          cogent evidence, and raise a preponderance of probability, that the\n                          Respondent is suffering from Schizophrenia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                    47. For the abovesaid reasons, we draw an adverse inference against the\n                          Respondent that she is suffering from Schizophrenia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">                    48. <a href=\"/doc/368948/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 12</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act deals with voidable marriages.

The fact that the parties could not live together beyond nine weeks itself\n                          shows that the mental disorder suffered by the respondent is of a kind,\n                          and to such an extent as to be unfit for marriage and the procreation of\n                          children. It is not the case of the respondent that either of the conditions\n                          enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/970099/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 12(2)(a)(i)</a>, or (ii) exists in the present case, which\n                          would have debarred the appellant from seeking annulment of marriage\n                          on the ground contained in <a href=\"/doc/1766252/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 12(1)(b)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act.\n                          That is not the defence set up by her, or established by her. The failure\n                          on the part of the respondent to disclose her mental disorder before her\n                          marriage with the appellant - as alleged by him, constituted a fraud\n                          perpetrated upon the appellant. Apart from stating that the parties had\n                          met a few times before the marriage, the respondent has not specifically\n                          averred, or established, that the appellant was made aware of the mental\n                          disorder suffered by the respondent, which was passed-off by her as mere\n                          &quot;headaches&quot;. Headaches-by themselves are not a disease. They are only\n                          symptoms of a disease. The Respondent does not state what caused her\n                          such serious and frequent headaches, which debilitated her from\n                          completing her studies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">                    50.
