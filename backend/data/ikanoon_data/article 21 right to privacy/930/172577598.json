The right of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy or abort the\n                          foetus has been the subject matter of debate across the world. This right gives\n                          a woman the ultimate choice as to whether to give birth to the child which she\n                          has conceived. India is amongst the countries that recognises this choice of\n                          the woman, in its law, and has even expanded this right in recent times with\n                          amendments permitting termination at an advanced stage, under various\n                          circumstances. While recognising the choice of the woman - the ultimate\n                          giver of life in this world, beyond the Omnipresent, such cases highlight the\n                          severe dilemma that women undergo while taking a decision to terminate her\n                          pregnancy. Courts are no exception - in that Judges have to grapple with\n                          issues that are not merely factual and legal but also involve ethical and moral\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 16607/2022                                                  Page 1 of 33</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Signing Date:06.12.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">15:17:50</span>\n                                                                                       2022/DHC/005344\n\n\n\n\n                          factors.

In India, judicial precedents have supported the rights of women to\n                          abort/medically terminate the pregnancy, depending upon the gestational\n                          period, the medical condition of the foetus, the physical and mental health of\n                          the woman, and other such factors.

It is important to recognise that\n                                      reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as\n                                      well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial\n                                      consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy,\n                                      dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This\n                                      means that there should be no restriction whatsoever on\n                                      the exercise of reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s\n                                      right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n                                      alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n                                      methods. Furthermore, women are also free to choose\n                                      birth-control methods such as undergoing sterilisation\n                                      procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\n                                      reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to\n                                      carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n                                      subsequently raise children. However, in the case of\n                                      pregnant women there is also a &#x27;compelling state\n                                      interest&#x27; in protecting the life of the prospective child.\n                                      Therefore, the termination of a pregnancy is only\n                                      permitted when the conditions specified in the\n                                      applicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the\n                                      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_31\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as\n                                      reasonable restrictions that have been placed on the\n                                      exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">                          30.

It is contended that the first\n                                      petitioner&#x27;s case falls within <a href=\"/doc/1294807/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act and\n                                      warrants urgent intervention by this Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">                                      8. Learned Government Pleader pointed out that the\n                                      Medical Board has not givenany conclusive opinion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">                                      9. From Exhibits P1 to P3 and the report of the Medical\n                                      Board, it is evident that the first petitioner will be at risk if\n                                      the pregnancy is continued and the baby born to her may\n                                      be abnormal. In such circumstances, the first petitioner\n                                      cannot be compelled to continue the pregnancy. The\n                                      freedom of a pregnant woman to take an informed\n                                      decision regarding her pregnancy cannot be curtailed by\n                                      rigid adherence to the letter of law. The plight of the\n                                      hapless woman compels me to exercise the discretionary\n                                      jurisdiction in her favour.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                          44.    In conclusion, the Court holds that the ultimate decision in such cases\n                          ought to recognize the choice of the mother, as also, the possibility of a\n                          dignified life for the unborn child. Keeping in mind these two factors, the\n                          Court comes to the conclusion that the mother&#x27;s choice is being made in a\n                          completely bona fide manner. There is considerable doubt and risk involved\n                          in the unborn child&#x27;s chances of leading a dignified and self-sustaining life,\n                          based upon the medical evidence and reports.
