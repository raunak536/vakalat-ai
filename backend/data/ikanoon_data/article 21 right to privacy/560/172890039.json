FACTUAL MATRIX OF THE CASE:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\"> 2.     The brief facts of the case are as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">(i)     FIR No. RC 2172024A0017 was registered on 07.12.2024 by the CBI\n\n        under Section 61(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections\n\n        7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_4\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1324019/\" id=\"a_5\">9</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/990066/\" id=\"a_6\">10</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. It alleges that\n\n        Shri Chanchal Mukherjee (Group General Manager, Bridge &amp; Roof Co.\n\n        Ltd., a CPSU) demanded ₹10,00,000 from Santosh Moharana (Director,\n\n        M/s Penta A Studio Pvt. Ltd.) as a bribe for clearing project bills and\n\n        facilitating further contract work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">(ii)    The CBI laid a trap on 07.12.2024. It is claimed that the bribe amount\n\n        was received by Mukherjee and subsequently transferred to\n\n        Debadutta Mohapatra. The cash was recovered from Mohapatra&#x27;s\n\n        vehicle near Hotel Mayfair, Bhubaneswar in the presence of\n\n        independent witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">(iii)   The CBI alleges that a call was made from the phone of the accused\n\n        Mukherjee to Debadutta Mohapatra at around 7:50 PM on the same\n\n        day, suspected to have been made by Petitioner No. 1 (a senior IAS\n\n        officer), instructing Mohapatra to receive the money.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">(iv)    Prior to the trap, Petitioner No. 1 had met with Mukherjee regarding a\n\n        ₹50 crore project under the SC/ST Department. Investigation also\n\n        revealed that Mahima Sethi (Petitioner No. 3), daughter of Petitioner\n\n        No. 1, had previously received expensive items (a MacBook and a\n\n        luxury watch) from Debadutta Mohapatra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">(v)     On 18.02.2025, CBI officers conducted searches at the official residence\n\n        of Petitioner No. 1 in Bhubaneswar and at Petitioner No. 3&#x27;s hostel\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                         Page 2 of 17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                  Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                 Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                 Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                 Reason: Authentication</span>\n                                                                 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                 Date: 20-Jun-2025 17:52:07</span>\n\n\n\n\n       room in IIM Lucknow under judicial warrants. Devices such as mobile\n\n       phones, laptops, and external drives were seized. It is alleged that two\n\n       lockers, not initially disclosed, were found to have been accessed\n\n       shortly before CBI could intervene and were discovered empty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">(vi)   CBI claims that Petitioner No. 1 and his spouse were non-cooperative\n\n       during the search. The agency asserts that passcodes for digital devices\n\n       were refused, and some devices were submitted in damaged\n\n       condition. Video/audio recordings were made and submitted under\n\n       Section 105 of BNSS, 2023.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">(vii) The petitioners allege that they were subjected to harassment,\n\n       unlawful seizure of personal items, denial of procedural safeguards\n\n       (like presence of lady officers), and overall conduct violative of their\n\n       privacy and dignity. They deny any involvement in the alleged crime\n\n       and assert that the work allocations were done through formal MoUs\n\n       with the CPSU, not individual discretion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">II.

COURT&#x27;S REASONING AND ANALYSIS:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">5.    Heard Learned Counsel for parties and perused the documents placed\n\n      before this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">6.    The first issue that calls for attention is the extent to which a High\n\n      Court may intervene in an ongoing criminal investigation, particularly\n\n      in cases alleging corruption in public office. This is not a question that\n\n      invites novelty. The law on this point is firmly settled. Yet, in the face\n\n      of growing attempts to blur institutional boundaries, certain\n\n      constitutional fundamentals deserve restatement. Investigation is the\n\n      province of the executive, whether police or CBI. Adjudication belongs\n\n      to the judiciary. These spheres are not fluid zones of convenience but\n\n      carefully           delineated   domains   grounded      in   the    constitutional\n\n      architecture. The Court&#x27;s role is not to supervise probes in real time. It\n\n      begins only once the process crystallises into a charge-sheet. Any\n\n      attempt to judicially intrude into the investigative stage risks not only\n\n      distorting this balance but also weakening the integrity of the criminal\n\n      justice system itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1926500\" id=\"span_31\">7.

The observations of the Judicial Committee and\nthe observations of this Court in the various decisions which\nI have earlier quoted, make this position abundantly clear.\nThe prepositions enunciated by the Judicial Committee and\nthis Court in the various decisions which I have earlier\nnoted, are based on sound principles of justice. Once an\noffence is disclosed, an investigation into the offence must\nnecessarily follow in the interests of justice. If, however, no\noffence is disclosed, an investigation cannot be permitted, as\nany investigation, in the absence of any offence being\ndisclosed, will result in unnecessary harrassment to a party,\nwhose liberty and property may be put to jeopardy for\nnothing. The liberty and property of any individual are\nsacred and sacrosanct and the Court zealously guards them\nand protects them. An investigation is carried on for the\npurpose of gathering necessary materials for establishing\nand proving an offence which is disclosed. When an offence\nis disclosed, a proper investigation in the interest of justice\nbecomes necessary to collect materials for establishing the\noffence, and for bringing the offender to book. In the absence\nof a proper investigation in a case where an offence is\ndisclosed, the offender may succeed in escaping from the\nconsequences and the offender may go unpunished to the\ndeteriment of the cause of justice and the society at large.\nJustice requires that a person who commits an offence has to\nbe brought to book and must be punished for the same. If the\nCourt interferes with the proper investigation in a case\nwhere an offence has been disclosed, the offence will go\nunpunished to the serious deteriment of the welfare of the\nsociety and the cause of the justice suffers. It is on the basis\nof this principle that the Court normally does not interfere\nwith the investigation of a case where an offence has been\ndisclosed. The decision on which Mr. Chatterjee has relied\nare based on this sound principle, and in all these cases, an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                           Page 7 of 17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                         Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                        Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                                        Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                        Reason: Authentication</span>\n                                                                        Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                                        Date: 20-Jun-2025 17:52:07</span>\n\n\n\n\n                    offence had been disclosed.

This principle squarely applies here. The present petition, examined in\n\n     light of the above doctrine, appears to be a textbook case where\n\n     interference would be premature and inappropriate. The CBI&#x27;s inquiry\n\n     is at nascent stage; evidence is still being gathered and assessed. No\n\n     charge-sheet or final report is before this Court. Interdicting the\n\n     investigation now would not only impede the fact-finding process but\n\n     also set a dangerous precedent enabling suspects to stall inquiries\n\n     against them by rushing to this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"603130\" id=\"span_45\">9.

These words apply with full force to the case at hand; there is no\n\n      showing that the CBI&#x27;s investigation is transgressing any legal\n\n      provision; hence this Court must not micromanage or prematurely\n\n      halt it. Investigative agencies must be allowed the operational freedom\n\n      to pursue leads and uncover facts, especially in matters involving\n\n      serious economic offences and corruption.

Another feature that stands out is the petitioners&#x27; conscious choice to\n\n      ignore the remedies already available to them under the criminal law.\n\n      The criminal procedure is not without answers, it offers clear, time-\n\n      tested forums for any individual to challenge illegal searches, seek\n\n      return of property, or apply for anticipatory bail. These are not\n\n      ornamental safeguards. They exist for everyone, regardless of rank.\n\n      What is troubling is the unmistakable impression that the petitioner\n\n      believes his administrative standing entitles him to bypass the\n\n      ordinary route.

However, it is important to clarify that the presence of\n\n      alternate remedies does not altogether oust the jurisdiction of\n\n      constitutional courts. The writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> remains\n\n      open, but its invocation must be justified within the narrow\n\n      framework recognized by law. The Supreme Court in the case of The\n\n      Assistant Commissioner of State Tax and Others v. M/s Commercial\n\n      Steel Limited 3held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             &quot;The existence of an alternate remedy is not an absolute bar\n             to the maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226</a> of\n             the Constitution.

When individuals occupying high public office invoke it\n\n      prematurely to stall an ongoing corruption probe, the integrity of legal\n\n      institutions stands compromised. The petitioners have neither shown\n\n      that the FIR fails to disclose an offence, nor pointed to any legal\n\n      infirmity such as absence of sanction or procedural nullity that would\n\n      render the investigation void ab initio.

In the present case, the intrusion into petitioners&#x27; privacy, search of\n\n      premises, seizure of personal digital data, inquiry into personal\n\n      finances, is grounded in law. Warrants were issued by a judicial officer\n\n      on the CBI&#x27;s showing of probable cause, which is a constitutionally\n\n      sanctioned process. <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 165</a> Cr.P.C. permits search and seizure\n\n      upon reasonable suspicion of material evidence.

In this regard, the Supreme Court, in the case of K.S. Puttaswamy v.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">      Union of India4 the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                &quot;Apart from national security, the State may have\n                justifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data. In a\n                social welfare State, the Government embarks upon\n                programmes which provide benefits to impoverished and\n                marginalised sections of society. There is a vital State\n                interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are not\n                dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do\n                not qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\n                development is coupled with a legitimate concern that the\n                utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for\n                extraneous purposes. Data mining with the object of\n                ensuring that resources are properly deployed to legitimate\n                beneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to insist on the\n                collection of authentic data. But, the data which the State\n                has collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of the\n                State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for\n                extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate\n                concerns of the State are duly safeguarded while, at the same\n                time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention and\n                investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are\n                among the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms are\n                a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social welfare\n                State. Information technology--legitimately deployed is a\n                powerful enabler in the spread of innovation and\n                knowledge.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">19.   In balancing interests, the scale at this stage tilts in favor of the public\n\n      interest in an unimpeded corruption investigation, as long as the\n\n      investigation is under the supervision of law - which it is. The Court\n\n\n\n      4 2019 (1) SCC 1\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                                                       Page 13 of 17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                                 Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                                Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                Reason: Authentication</span>\n                                                                Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                                Date: 20-Jun-2025 17:52:07</span>\n\n\n\n\n      also notes that there are in-built safeguards: misuse of any personal\n\n      information or conducting roving inquiries unrelated to the case can\n\n      be checked by the trial court; evidence law will ensure only relevant\n\n      material is produced and considered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">20.   It is worthwhile to mention that this Court&#x27;s refusal to intervene at\n\n      this stage does not amount to adjudging the petitioners guilty, nor\n\n      does it foreclose their defense. The petitioners will have full\n\n      opportunity, if charges are formally brought, to contest the evidence,\n\n      cross-examine witnesses, and avail due process at trial. Presumption\n\n      of innocence remains with the petitioners until proven guilty, but\n\n      presumption of innocence is not a presumption against investigation.\n\n      Law enforcement is permitted to investigate on reasonable suspicion.\n\n      Stopping an investigation in its tracks would require a finding that\n\n      even if the facts alleged are true, no offence is made out, a condition\n\n      plainly not satisfied in a bribery scenario with documented recovery of\n\n      money. Thus, the demand to quash the FIR or stop the probe is wholly\n\n      unjustified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">21.   Finally, the Court must speak to the larger truth behind the writ.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">      Corruption at high levels is not a matter of isolated misconduct. It\n\n      speaks to a breach of the social contract, where those entrusted with\n\n      public power allegedly turn it into private currency. In such cases, the\n\n      judiciary&#x27;s responsibility is not limited to resolving procedural\n\n      questions. It extends to preserving the legitimacy of the investigative\n\n      process itself. Petitioner No. 1 is not just any litigant. He is a senior\n\n      bureaucrat, someone who has operated within the architecture of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                                  Page 14 of 17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                  Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                 Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                 Signed by: BHABAGRAHI JHANKAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                                 Reason: Authentication</span>\n                                                                 Location: ORISSA HIGH COURT, CUTTACK\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                 Date: 20-Jun-2025 17:52:07</span>\n\n\n\n\n      power for decades. When such an individual is named in a serious\n\n      corruption probe, the Court cannot pretend that ordinary safeguards\n\n      suddenly become excessive or optional. What is sought here is not\n\n      relief, but insulation, an attempt to short-circuit due process under the\n\n      pretext of constitutional grievance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">22.   To entertain this writ at such a preliminary stage would be to set a\n\n      dangerous precedent that those with access, stature, or proximity to\n\n      government can invoke <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 226</a> as a fire escape from legitimate\n\n      inquiry. That is not the function of this jurisdiction. It is not the\n\n      judiciary&#x27;s role to guard the reputations of the powerful from lawful\n\n      suspicion. Courts must, of course, remain vigilant against investigative\n\n      abuse. But vigilance cannot become veto. An investigation, once\n\n      triggered by credible material, must be allowed to breathe. The rule of\n\n      law loses its steam when it is invoked selectively; shielding those in\n\n      office from the very processes they once oversaw. Justice demands\n\n      neither haste nor hesitation, only that it be allowed to do its work,\n\n      uninterrupted and unafraid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\"> V.

Before parting, this Court deems it necessary to address the conduct of\n\n      Petitioner No.1. As a senior IAS officer, Petitioner No.1 is expected to\n\n      set a high example in upholding the law.

The extraordinary writ power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> cannot be permitted\n\n      to be used as a shield by individuals (howsoever high-placed) to fend\n\n      off legitimate inquiries. The petitioners are reprimanded for this ill-\n\n      advised litigation. They ought to have first pursued remedies like\n\n      cooperating with the investigation or approaching the appropriate\n\n      court if any specific illegality arose, rather than prematurely\n\n      approaching the High Court.
