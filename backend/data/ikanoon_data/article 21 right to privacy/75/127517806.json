Khanwilkar, J.)\n\n\nIntroduction and Preliminaries:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                   It is better to be unique than the best. Because,\n                    being the best makes you the number one, but\n                          being unique makes you the only one.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2)     ‘Unique makes you the only one’ is the central message of\n\n       Aadhaar, which is on the altar facing constitutional challenge in\n\n       these petitions. ‘Aadhaar’ which means, in English, ‘foundation’\n\n       or ‘base’, has become the most talked about expression in recent\n\n       years, not only in India but in many other countries and\n\n       international bodies. A word from Hindi dictionary has assumed\n\n       secondary significance. Today, mention of the word ‘Aadhaar’\n\n       would not lead a listener to the dictionary meaning of this word.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">       Instead, every person on the very mentioning of this word\n\n       ‘Aadhaar’ would associate it with the card that is issued to a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 3 of 567</span>\n\f       person from where he/she can be identified. It is described as an\n\n       ‘Unique Identity’ and the authority which enrols a person and at\n\n       whose behest the Aadhaar Card is issued is known as Unique\n\n       Identification Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as ‘UIDAI’\n\n       or ‘Authority’).       It is described as unique for various reasons.\n\n       UIDAI claims that not only it is a foolproof method of identifying a\n\n       person, it is also an instrument whereby a person can enter into\n\n       any transaction without needing any other document in support.\n\n       It has become a symbol of digital economy and has enabled\n\n       multiple avenues for a common man. Aadhaar scheme, which\n\n       was conceptualised in the year 2006 and launched in the year\n\n       2009 with the creation of UIDAI, has secured the enrolment of\n\n       almost 1.1 billion people in this country. Its use is spreading like\n\n       wildfire, which is the result of robust and aggressive campaigning\n\n       done by the Government, governmental agencies and other such\n\n       bodies. In this way it has virtually become a household symbol.\n\n       The Government boasts of multiple benefits of Aadhaar.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3)     At the same time, the very scheme of Aadhaar and the\n\n       architecture built thereupon has received scathing criticism from a\n\n       section of the society. According to them, Aadhaar is a serious\n\n       invasion into the right to privacy of persons and it has the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 4 of 567</span>\n\f       tendency to lead to a surveillance state where each individual can\n\n       be kept under surveillance by creating his/her life profile and\n\n       movement as well on his/her use of Aadhaar. There has been no\n\n       other subject matter in recent past which has evoked the kind of\n\n       intensive and heated debate wherein both sides, for and against,\n\n       argue so passionately in support of their respective conviction.\n\n       The petitioners in these petitions belong to the latter category\n\n       who apprehend the totalitarian state if Aadhaar project is allowed\n\n       to continue. They are demanding scrapping and demolition of the\n\n       entire Aadhaar structure which, according to them, is anathema\n\n       to the democratic principles and rule of law, which is the bedrock\n\n       of the Indian Constitution. The petitioners have challenged the\n\n       Aadhaar project which took off by way of administrative action in\n\n       the year 2009. Even after Aadhaar got a shield of statutory cover,\n\n       challenge persists as the very enactment known as <a href=\"/doc/103925960/\" id=\"a_1\">Aadhaar\n\n       (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and\n\n       Services) Act, 2016</a> (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Aadhaar Act’)\n\n       is challenged as constitutionally impermissible. The wide range\n\n       of issues involved in this case is evident from the fact that it took\n\n       almost four months for the parties to finish their arguments in\n\n       these cases, and the Court witnessed highly skilled, suave,\n\n       brilliant and intellectual advocacy, with the traces of passions as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 5 of 567</span>\n\f       well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4)     The issue has generated heated public debate as well. Even\n\n       outside the Court, there are groups advocating in favour of the\n\n       Aadhaar scheme and those who are stoutly opposing the same.\n\n       Interestingly, it is not only the commoners who belong to either of\n\n       the two groups but intelligentsia is also equally divided. There\n\n       have been number of articles, interviews for discourses in favour\n\n       of or against Aadhaar. Those in favour see Aadhaar project as\n\n       ushering the nation into a regime of good governance, advancing\n\n       socio-economic rights, economic prosperity etc. and in the\n\n       process they claim that it may make the nation a world leader.\n\n       Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India, referred\n\n       to the commendations by certain international bodies, including\n\n       the World Bank. We clarify that we have not been influenced by\n\n       such views expressed either in favour or against Aadhaar. Those\n\n       opposing Aadhaar are apprehensive that it may excessively\n\n       intrude into the privacy of citizenry and has the tendency to\n\n       create a totalitarian state, which would impinge upon the\n\n       democratic and constitutional values.                Some such opinions of\n\n       various persons/bodies were referred to during the arguments.\n\n       Notwithstanding the passions, emotions, annoyance, despair,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 6 of 567</span>\n\f       ecstasy, euphoria, coupled with rhetoric, exhibited by both sides\n\n       in equal measure during the arguments, this Court while giving its\n\n       judgment on the issues involved is required to have a posture of\n\n       calmness coupled with objective examination of the issues on the\n\n       touchstone of the constitutional provisions.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5)     Initiative in spearheading the attack on the Aadhaar structure was\n\n       taken by the petitioners, namely, Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.)\n\n       and Mr. Pravesh Khanna, by filing Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of\n\n       2012. At that time, Aadhaar scheme was not under legislative\n\n       umbrella.       In the writ petition the scheme has primarily been\n\n       challenged on the ground that it violates fundamental rights of the\n\n       innumerable citizens of India, namely, right to privacy falling\n\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Few others joined\n\n       the race by filing connected petitions.              Series of orders were\n\n       passed in this petition from time to time, some of which would be\n\n       referred to by us at the appropriate stage.              In 2016, with the\n\n       passing of the Aadhaar Act, these very petitioners filed another\n\n       writ petition challenging the vires of the Act. Here again, some\n\n       more writ petitions have been filed with the same objective. All\n\n       these writ petitions were clubbed together. There are number of\n\n       interventions as well by various individuals, groups, NGOs, etc.,\n\n       some opposing the petitions and some supporting the Aadhaar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 7 of 567</span>\n\f       scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6)     Before we go into the premise on which the attack is laid on the\n\n       constitutional validity of the Aadhaar project and the Aadhaar Act,\n\n       it would be apposite to take note of the events in chronological\n\n       order that shaped the formulation, take off and implementation of\n\n       the Aadhaar scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">7)     On March 03, 2006, approval was given by the Department of\n\n       Information        Technology,        Ministry       of   Communications    and\n\n       Information Technology, Government of India for the project titled\n\n       ‘Unique Identification for BPL Families’ to be implemented by the\n\n       National Informatics Centre (NIC) for over a period of twelve\n\n       months. As a result, a Processes Committee was set up on July\n\n       03, 2006 to suggest the process for updation, modification,\n\n       addition and deletion of data and fields from the core database to\n\n       be created under the Unique Identification for BPL Families\n\n       project.     This Committee, on November 26, 2006, prepared a\n\n       paper known as ‘Strategic Vision Unique Identification of\n\n       Residents’.         Based thereupon, the Empowered Group of\n\n       Ministers (EGoM) was set up on December 04, 2006, to collate\n\n       the National Population Register under the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_3\">Citizenship Act, 1955</a>\n\n       and the Unique Identification Number project of the Department\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                  Page 8 of 567</span>\n\f       of Information Technology. The EGoM was also empowered to\n\n       look into the methodology and specific milestones for early and\n\n       effective completion of projects and to take a final view on these\n\n       projects.      The EGoM was composed of the then Ministers of\n\n       External Affairs, Home Affairs, Law, Panchayati Raj and\n\n       Communications and Information Technology and the then\n\n       Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">8)     Various meetings on the Unique Identification (hereinafter\n\n       referred to as ‘UID’) project were held from time to time. In the\n\n       fourth meeting held on December 22, 2006, various aspects of\n\n       proposed data elements and their formats were discussed.\n\n       Thereafter, in its fifth meeting held on April 27, 2007, it was\n\n       decided that the evolution of UID database would be in three\n\n       stages in principle. The Committee further decided that linkage\n\n       with major partner databases such as Household Survey of RD\n\n       and the individual State Public Distribution System (PDS)\n\n       databases should be taken up in a phased manner. On June 11,\n\n       2007, at the final stage of the project, a presentation on the UID\n\n       project was made to the then Prime Minister by the Cabinet\n\n       Secretary. The sixth meeting of the UID project was held on June\n\n       15, 2007.

Certain issues were raised therein\n\n       and to address those issues, a Committee of Secretaries was\n\n       formed. The said Committee gave its recommendations which\n\n       were discussed by EGoM. After approving the Aadhaar Scheme\n\n       in principle, it instructed the Cabinet Secretary to convene a\n\n       meeting to finalise the detailed organisational structure of the\n\n       UID.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10)    After considering the recommendation of the Cabinet Secretary,\n\n       Notification No. A-43011/02/2009-Admn.I was issued on January\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 11 of 567</span>\n\f       28, 2009 by the Government of India which constituted and\n\n       notified the UIDAI as an attached office under the aegis of the\n\n       Planning Commission. Consequent to the constitution of UIDAI,\n\n       allocation of Rs.147.31 crores for Phase I of Aadhaar enrolments\n\n       was approved by the Finance Minister on the recommendation of\n\n       the Standing Committee on Finance.

Budgets were allocated to UIDAI to enable it to undertake\n\n       its task. Staff was also allocated to it. Meetings of the core group\n\n       took place from time to time. The core group, inter alia, decided\n\n       that it was better to start with the electoral roll database of 2009\n\n       for undertaking the UIDAI project. The status of digitisation of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 12 of 567</span>\n\f       PDS records, state-wise, was sought to be sent from the\n\n       Department of Food and Public Distribution to the Standing\n\n       Commission/UID. This and other steps taken in this direction\n\n       culminated in issuance of Notification dated July 02, 2009\n\n       whereby Mr. Nandan Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman of\n\n       UIDAI for an initial tenure of five years in the rank and status of a\n\n       Cabinet Minister.            He assumed charge on July 24, 2009.\n\n       Thereafter, the Prime Minister’s Council of UIDAI was constituted\n\n       on July 30, 2009 which held its first meeting on August 12, 2009\n\n       where the Chairman of UIDAI made detailed representation on\n\n       the broad strategy and approach of the proposed UID project.\n\n       One of the proposals was to provide a legislative framework for\n\n       UID at the earliest so that it could have the legal sanction to\n\n       perform its function. Some other Committees like the Biometrics\n\n       Standard        Committee,         Demographic         Data   Standards         and\n\n       Verification Procedure Committee were set up as a support\n\n       system to the project, which submitted their respective reports in\n\n       December 2009.              Even a Cabinet Committee on UID was\n\n       constituted vide orders dated October 22, 2009 which was\n\n       headed by the Prime Minister with the aim to cover all issues\n\n       relating      to    UIDAI,       including       its   organisation,      policies,\n\n       programmes, schemes, funding and methodology to be adopted\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                     Page 13 of 567</span>\n\f       for achieving its objectives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">12)    The matter was addressed in the Seventeenth Finance\n\n       Commission Report also which was tabled in the Parliament on\n\n       February 25, 2010.             In this report, the Finance Commission\n\n       suggested targeting of subsidies through UIDAI. By April 2010,\n\n       UIDAI came out with its Strategy Overview.             This Overview\n\n       describes the features, benefits, revenue model and timelines of\n\n       the UIDAI project. Furthermore, it outlined the goal of the UID to\n\n       serve as a universal proof of identity, allowing residents to prove\n\n       their identities anywhere in the country. The project would give\n\n       the Government a clear view of India’s population, enabling it to\n\n       target and deliver services effectively, achieve greater returns on\n\n       social investments and monitor money and resource flows across\n\n       the country. It was felt that crucial to the achievement of this goal\n\n       is the active participation of the central, state and local\n\n       Governments as well as public and private sector entities. Only\n\n       with their support will the project be able to realise a larger vision\n\n       of inclusion and development in India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">13)    A Cabinet Note bearing No. 4(4)/57/2010/CC-UIDAI for the\n\n       Cabinet Committee on UIDAI was submitted on May 12, 2010.\n\n       The Note outlined a brief background of UIDAI, proposed an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 14 of 567</span>\n\f       approach for collection of demographic and biometric attributes of\n\n       residents for the UID project and sought approval of the Cabinet\n\n       Committee for adoption of the aforesaid approach and suggested\n\n       that the same standards and processes be adhered to by the\n\n       Registrar General of India for the NPR exercise and all other\n\n       Registrars in the UID system.                 Rationale for inclusion of iris\n\n       biometrics was also submitted with the aforesaid Cabinet Note to\n\n       explain the need for capturing iris scans at the time of capturing\n\n       biometric details.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">14)    By September 2010 enrolment process of Aadhaar began with\n\n       the nationwide launch of the Aadhaar project. In December 2010,\n\n       UIDAI came out with a report on enrolment process known as\n\n       ‘UID Enrolment Proof-of-Concept Report’ studying enrolment\n\n       proof-of-concept in three rural areas of Karnataka, Bihar and\n\n       Andhra Pradesh published by the UIDAI. According to this report,\n\n       ‘the biometric matching analysis of 40,000 people showed that\n\n       the accuracy levels achieved by both iris and ten fingerprints\n\n       were more than an order of magnitude better compared to using\n\n       either of the two individually.            The multi-modal enrolment was\n\n       adequate to carry out de-duplication on a much larger scale, with\n\n       reasonable expectations of extending it to all residents of India’.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 15 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\f15)    Going by the recommendation of the Chairman of UIDAI for\n\n       providing legislative framework to UIDAI, a Bill was introduced in\n\n       the Rajya Sabha on December 03, 2010 known as ‘National\n\n       Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010’.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">16)    Various other steps were taken to smoothen the process of\n\n       enrolment.         There were studies from time to time on the\n\n       effectiveness of the enrolment process. Notifications/orders were\n\n       also issued by the Reserve Bank of India stating that an Aadhaar\n\n       letter would be recognised by Banks to open bank accounts for a\n\n       resident.       Similar Orders/Notifications were issued by other\n\n       authorities as well. On the first anniversary of Aadhaar launch,\n\n       which fell on September 29, 2011, announcement was made that\n\n       10 crores enrolments and generation of more than 3.75 crores of\n\n       Aadhaar had taken place. Some of the reports submitted in due\n\n       course of time, which are relevant for our purposes, are taken\n\n       note of at this stage:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       (i)     Report of the Task Force on an Aadhaar-Enabled Unified\n\n       Payment Infrastructure for the direct transfer of subsidies on\n\n       Kerosene, LPG and Fertilizer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       (ii)    In March 2012, Fingerprint Authentication Report was\n\n       submitted to UIDAI.

The study\n\n       conducted in the rural setting representing typical demography of\n\n       the population established that it is technically possible to use\n\n       fingerprint to authenticate a resident in 98.13% of the population.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">       The accuracy of 96.5% can be achieved using one best finger\n\n       and 99.3% can be achieved using two fingers.                     Further\n\n       improvement is possible if the device specifications are tightened\n\n       to include only the best devices and certain mechanical guide is\n\n       used to aid proper placement of the finger.

As pointed out above, this writ petition assailed\n\n       Aadhaar scheme primarily on the ground that it violates right to\n\n       privacy which is a facet of fundamental rights enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article\n\n       21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_16\">18)    Counter affidavit thereto was filed by the Union of India as well as\n\n       UIDAI.

UIDAI was\n\n       established in the year 2009 by an administrative order i.e. by\n\n       resolution of the Govt. of India, Planning Commission, vide\n\n       notification dated January 28, 2009.                 The object of the\n\n       establishment of the said Authority was primarily to lay down\n\n       policies to implement the Unique Identification Scheme (for short\n\n       the ‘UIS’) of the Government, by which residents of India were to\n\n       be provided unique identity number. The aim was to serve this as\n\n       proof of identity, which is unique in nature, as each individual will\n\n       have only one identity with no chance of duplication. Another\n\n       objective was that this number could be used for identification of\n\n       beneficiaries for transfer of benefits, subsidies, services and other\n\n       purposes. This was the primary reason, viz. to ensure correct\n\n       identification of targeted beneficiaries for delivery of various\n\n       subsidies, benefits, services, grants, wages and other social\n\n       benefits schemes which are funded from the Consolidated Fund\n\n       of India. It was felt that the identification of real and genuine\n\n       beneficiaries had become a challenge for the Government. In the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 25 of 567</span>\n\f       absence of a credible system to authenticate identity of\n\n       beneficiaries, it was becoming difficult to ensure that the\n\n       subsidies, benefits and services reach to intended beneficiaries.\n\n       As per the Government, failure to establish identity was proving\n\n       to be major hindrance for the successful implementation of the\n\n       welfare programmes and it was hitting hard the marginalised\n\n       section of the society and, in particular, women, children, senior\n\n       citizens, persons with disabilities, migrant unskilled and organised\n\n       workers, and nomadic tribes.                 After the establishment of the\n\n       Authority, vide the aforesaid notification, it started enrolling the\n\n       residents of this country under the UIS. These residents also\n\n       started using Aadhaar number allotted to them. It was found that\n\n       over a period of time, the use of Aadhaar number had increased\n\n       manifold. This necessitated ensuring security of the information\n\n       contained in Aadhaar number as well as the information that\n\n       generated as a result of the use of Aadhaar numbers. It was,\n\n       thus, felt desirable to back the system with a Parliamentary\n\n       enactment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">25)    With this intention, the Aadhaar Bill was introduced with the\n\n       following Introduction:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">               “The Unique Identification Authority of India was\n               established by a resolution of the Government of India in\n               2009.

She, thus, parts with her photograph, fingerprint and\n\n       iris scan at that stage by giving the same to the enrolling agency,\n\n       which may be a private body/person. Likewise, every time when\n\n       such Aadhaar holder intends to receive a subsidy, benefit or\n\n       service and goes to specified/designated agency or person for\n\n       that purpose, she would be giving her biometric information to\n\n       that requesting entity, which, in turn, shall get the same\n\n       authenticated from the Authority before providing a subsidy,\n\n       benefit     or    service.

It militates against the constitutional abiding values and\n\n       its foundational morality and has the potential to enable an\n\n       intrusive state to become a surveillance state on the basis of\n\n       information that is collected in respect of each individual by\n\n       creation of a joint electronic mesh. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_57\">In this manner, the Act strikes\n\n       at the very privacy of each individual thereby offending the right\n\n       to privacy which is elevated and given the status of fundamental\n\n       right by tracing it to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_66\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_67\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">21</a> of the Constitution of\n\n       India by a nine Judge Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_69\">K.S.\n\n       Puttaswamy &amp; Anr. v.

Most of the counsel\n\n       appearing for different petitioners (though not all) conceded that\n\n       there cannot be a serious dispute insofar as allotment of Aadhaar\n\n       number, for the purpose of unique identification of the residents,\n\n       is concerned.         However, apprehensions have been expressed\n\n       about the manner in which the Scheme has been rolled out and\n\n6 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 52 of 567</span>\n\f       implemented.         The entire edifice of the aforesaid projection is\n\n       based on the premise that it forces a person, who intends to enrol\n\n       for Aadhaar, to part with his core information namely biometric\n\n       information in the form of fingerprints and iris scan. These are to\n\n       be given to the enrolment agency in the first instance which is a\n\n       private body and, thus, there is risk of misuse of this vital\n\n       information pertaining to an individual. Further, it is argued that\n\n       the most delicate and fragile part, susceptible to misuse, is the\n\n       authentication process which is to be carried out each time the\n\n       holder of Aadhaar number wants to establish her identity. At that\n\n       stage, not only the individual parts with the biometric information\n\n       again with the RE (which may again be a private agency as well),\n\n       the purpose for which such a person approaches the RE would\n\n       also be known i.e. the nature of transaction which is supposed to\n\n       be undertaken by the said person at that time. Such information\n\n       relating to different transactions of a person across the life of the\n\n       citizen is connected to a central database.          This record may\n\n       enable the State to profile citizens, track their movements, assess\n\n       their habits and silently influence their behaviour. Over a period\n\n       of time, the profiling would enable the State to stifle dissent and\n\n       influence political decision making. It may also enable the State\n\n       to act as a surveillant state and there is a propensity for it to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 53 of 567</span>\n\f       become a totalitarian state. It is stressed that at its core, Aadhaar\n\n       alters the relationship between the citizen and the State.                    It\n\n       diminishes the status of the citizen.                Rights freely exercised,\n\n       liberties freely enjoyed, entitlements granted by the Constitution\n\n       and laws are all made conditional, on a compulsory barter. The\n\n       barter compels the citizen to give up her biometrics ‘voluntarily’,\n\n       allow her biometrics and demographic information to be stored by\n\n       the State and private operators and then used for a process\n\n       termed ‘authentication’.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">               To put it in nutshell, provisions of the Aadhaar Act are\n\n       perceived by the petitioners as giving away of vital information\n\n       about the residents to the State not only in the form of biometrics\n\n       but also about the movement as well as varied kinds of\n\n       transactions which a resident would enter into from time to time.\n\n       The threat is in the form of profiling the citizens by the State on\n\n       the one hand and also misuse thereof by private agencies\n\n       whether it is enrolling agency or requesting agency or even\n\n       private bodies mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1616195/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 57</a> of the Act. In essence, it\n\n       is stated that not only data of aforesaid nature is stored by the\n\n       CIDR, which has the threat of being leaked, it can also be\n\n       misused by non-State actors. In other words, it is sought to be\n\n       highlighted that there is no assurance of any data protection at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 54 of 567</span>\n\f       any level.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_178\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">46)    The respondents, on the other hand, have attempted to shake the\n\n       very foundation of the aforesaid structure of the petitioners’ case.\n\n       They argue that in the first instance, minimal biometric\n\n       information of the applicant, who intends to have Aadhaar\n\n       number, is obtained which is also stored in CIDR for the purpose\n\n       of authentication. Secondly, no other information is stored. It is\n\n       emphasised that there is no data collection in respect of religion,\n\n       caste, tribe, language records of entitlement, income or medical\n\n       history of the applicant at the time of Aadhaar enrolment. Thirdly,\n\n       the Authority also claimed that the entire Aadhaar enrolment eco-\n\n       system is foolproof inasmuch as within few seconds of the\n\n       biometrics having been collected by the enrolling agency, the said\n\n       information gets transmitted the Authorities/CIDR, that too in an\n\n       encrypted form, and goes out of the reach of the enrolling\n\n       agency. Same is the situation at the time of authentication as\n\n       biometric information does not remain with the requesting\n\n       agency. Fourthly, while undertaking the authentication process,\n\n       the Authority simply matches the biometrics and no other\n\n       information is received or stored in respect of purpose, location or\n\n       nature or transaction etc. Therefore, the question of profiling does\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 55 of 567</span>\n\f       not arise at all.

This was the reason for multi-modal enrolment and\n\n       authentication being selected for use in Aadhaar.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">               Only in an unlikely scenario where both iris and fingerprint\n\n       cannot be used for authentication, the mobile number is one of\n\n       the methods for authentication. In cases where authentication\n\n       through mobile number is not possible or feasible, the requesting\n\n       entities have to provide their own exception and backup\n\n       mechanism to ensure services to Aadhaar holders. As part of the\n\n       exception handling mechanism, UIDAI has already implemented\n\n       a digitally signed QR code into e-Aadhaar which allows agencies\n\n       to verify the Aadhaar card in an off-line manner and trust the data\n\n       (based on digital signature validation) without accessing e-KYC\n\n       API service of UIDAI. This is a simple off-line mechanism to\n\n       quickly verify the legitimacy of the Aadhaar card. But, it does not\n\n       ensure that the person holding the card is the owner of that\n\n       Aadhaar number. It needs either manual check of photo against\n\n       the face of the individual (like the way ID is verified at the entry of\n\n       airports) or some form of electronic authentication using Aadhaar\n\n       authentication API or agency specific authentication scheme. QR\n\n       code based verification allows Aadhaar number holders to use\n\n       their ID on a day-to-day purpose without using online e-KYC\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 64 of 567</span>\n\f       authentication. The verification through offline QR code can be\n\n       used for those purposes or cases where proof of presence or\n\n       proof of ownership of card is not required.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_194\">               The Aadhaar Act and Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\n       Regulations, 2016 define special provision for enrolment of\n\n       residents with biometric exception.

These\n\n       figures do not pertain to the number of unique individuals who\n\n       have been denied Aadhaar enrolment resulting in no Aadhaar\n\n       issued to them.

The biometric de-duplication system is\n\n       designed to identify as duplicate those cases where any one of\n\n       the biometrics (ten fingers and two irises) match. However, very\n\n       often it is found that all the biometrics match.             It is highly\n\n       improbable for the biometrics to match unless the same person\n\n       has applied again. There are a number of reasons why the same\n\n       person might apply more than once.                   For instance, many\n\n       individuals innocently apply for enrolment multiple times because\n\n       of the delay in getting their Aadhaar cards due to postal delays,\n\n       loss or destruction of their cards or confusion about how the\n\n       system works. Each time one applies for Aadhaar, the system\n\n       identifies her as a new enrolment but when it recognises that the\n\n       individual’s biometrics match with already those in the database,\n\n       thereafter further checks, including manual check through\n\n       experienced personnels, are done. After that exercise, if it is\n\n       found that the person is already registered, it rejects the\n\n       enrolment application. One of their main reasons for rejection is\n\n       that multiple people would put their biometric details like\n\n       fingerprints for Aadhaar generation either as a fraudulent exercise\n\n       or by mistake, which also would get rejected. There were many\n\n       fakes and frauds in the earlier systems and several reports have\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 68 of 567</span>\n\f       found that almost 50% of the subsidies were getting pilfered away\n\n       by fakes and duplicates in the system. Then, there would also be\n\n       several such people who may have tried to defraud the Aadhaar\n\n       enrolment system as well but failed get multiple Aadhaar numbers\n\n       due to the stringent Aadhaar de-duplication process. Thus, the\n\n       mere fact that 6.23 crore enrolments have been rejected as\n\n       biometric duplicates does not mean that 6.23 crore people have\n\n       been denied an Aadhaar number as has been alleged by the\n\n       petitioners. Any genuine person who does not have an Aadhaar\n\n       number and whose enrolment has been rejected can always\n\n       apply again for enrolment. It is worth noting that none of the de-\n\n       duplication rejects have come forward to lodge complaints either\n\n       with the Authority or with the Government about denial of Aadhaar\n\n       number. None of them have even approached any Court of law.\n\n       Evidently, the genuine residents have got themselves re-enrolled\n\n       and the rest are those who were trying to reach the Aadhaar\n\n       system by fraudulent means.                  That explains why no one has\n\n       approached a court of law complaining denial of Aadhaar number.\n\n       All the enrolment packets received by UIDAI (accepted/rejected)\n\n       are archived in the CIDR irrespective of its status.\n\n\n       (8)     If the figure of rejection of enrolment packets was 8 crore,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 69 of 567</span>\n\f       as on 2015, what is the total rejection figure for enrolment\n\n       packets as on date? How many field studies/physical verification\n\n       have been done to ensure that these persons (who have been\n\n       rejected) are indeed “False or duplicate” enrolments?\n\n       Ans.: The total rejection figure for enrolment packets is 18.0 cr.\n\n       as on March 26, 2018.               These rejections are due to various\n\n       technical reasons like: (i) data quality reject such as address\n\n       incomplete, name incomplete, use of expletives in names,\n\n       address etc. photo is of object, photo of photo, age photo\n\n       mismatch etc.; and (ii) OSI validation reject such as operator /\n\n       supervisor / introducer validation failed, operator / supervisor /\n\n       introducer / Head of Family biometric validation failed etc.\n\n               Those whose enrolments have been rejected for any reason\n\n       and who do not have Aadhaar can re-enrol and obtain Aadhaar.\n\n       Rejection of enrolments do not mean that the person will never be\n\n       able to get Aadhaar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">\n       (9)     What does “any other appropriate response” under Section\n\n       8(4) of the Aadhaar Act include?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">       Ans.:      “Any other appropriate responses” includes e-KYC or\n\n       limited e-KYC data.

No doubt, a person can\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters    Page 83 of 567</span>\n\f       have various documents on the basis of which that individual can\n\n       establish her identify.           It may be in the form of a passport,\n\n       Permanent Account Number (PAN) card, ration card and so on.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">       For the purpose of enrolment itself number of documents are\n\n       prescribed which an individual can produce on the basis of which\n\n       Aadhaar card can be issued. Thus, such documents, in a way,\n\n       are also proof of identity.             However, there is a fundamental\n\n       difference between the Aadhaar card as a mean of identity and\n\n       other documents through which identity can be established.\n\n       Enrolment for Aadhaar card also requires giving of demographic\n\n       information as well as biometric information which is in the form\n\n       of iris and fingerprints. This process eliminates any chance of\n\n       duplication. It is emphasised that an individual can manipulate\n\n       the system by having more than one or even number of PAN\n\n       cards, passports, ration cards etc. When it comes to obtaining\n\n       Aadhaar card, there is no possibility of obtaining duplicate card.\n\n       Once the biometric information is stored and on that basis\n\n       Aadhaar card is issued, it remains in the system with the\n\n       Authority.       Wherever there would be a second attempt for\n\n       enrolling for Aadhaar and for this purpose same person gives his\n\n       biometric information, it would immediately get matched with the\n\n       same biometric information already in the system and the second\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 84 of 567</span>\n\f       request would stand rejected. It is for this reason the Aadhaar\n\n       card is known as Unique Identification (UID). Such an identity is\n\n       unparalleled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_238\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_239\">56)    There is, then, another purpose for having such a system of\n\n       issuing unique identification cards in the form of Aadhaar card. A\n\n       glimpse thereof is captured under the heading ‘Introduction’\n\n       above while mentioning how and under what circumstances the\n\n       whole project was conceptualised. To put it tersely, in addition to\n\n       enabling any resident to obtain such unique identification proof, it\n\n       is also to empower marginalised section of the society,\n\n       particularly those who are illiterate and living in abject poverty or\n\n       without any shelter etc. It gives identity to such persons also.\n\n       Moreover, with the aid of Aadhaar card, they can claim various\n\n       privileges and benefits etc. which are actually meant for these\n\n       people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">               Identity of a person has a significance for every individual in\n\n       his/her life. In a civilised society every individual, on taking birth,\n\n       is given a name. Her place of birth and parentage also becomes\n\n       important as she is known in the society and these demographic\n\n       particulars also become important attribute of her personality.\n\n       Throughout their lives, individuals are supposed to provide such\n\n       information: be it admission in a school or college or at the time of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 85 of 567</span>\n\f       taking job or engaging in any profession or business activity, etc.\n\n       When all this information is available in one place, in the form of\n\n       Aadhaar card, it not only becomes unique, it would also qualify as\n\n       a document of empowerment. Added with this feature, when an\n\n       individual knows that no other person can clone her, it assumes\n\n       greater significance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_241\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_242\">57)    Thus, the scheme by itself can be treated as laudable when it\n\n       comes to enabling an individual to seek Aadhaar number, more\n\n       so, when it is voluntary in nature. Howsoever benevolent the\n\n       scheme may be, it has to pass the muster of constitutionality.\n\n       According to the petitioners, the very architecture of Aadhaar is\n\n       unconstitutional on various grounds, glimpse whereof can be\n\n       provided at this stage:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_243\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">Gist of the challenge to the Aadhaar Scheme as well as the Act:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">58)    The petitioners accept that the case at hand is unique, simply\n\n       because of the reason that the programme challenged here is\n\n       itself without precedent.             According to them, no democratic\n\n       society has adopted a programme that is similar in its command\n\n       and sweep.          The case is about a new technology that the\n\n       Government seeks to deploy and a new architecture of\n\n       governance that it seeks to build on this technology.               The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 86 of 567</span>\n\f       petitioners are discrediting the Government’s claim that biometric\n\n       technology employed and the Aadhaar Act is greatly beneficial.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_244\">       As per the petitioners, this is an inroad into the rights and liberties\n\n       of the citizens which the Constitution of India guarantees. It is\n\n       intrusive in nature. At its core, Aadhaar alters the relationship\n\n       between the citizen and the State. It diminishes the status of the\n\n       citizens.       Rights freely exercised, liberties freely enjoyed,\n\n       entitlements granted by the Constitution and laws are all made\n\n       conditional, on a compulsory barter.                 The barter compels the\n\n       citizens to give up their biometrics ‘voluntarily’, allow their\n\n       biometrics and demographic information to be stored by the State\n\n       and private operators and then used for a process termed\n\n       ‘authentication’. According to them, by the very scheme of the\n\n       Act and the way it operates, it has propensity to cause ‘civil\n\n       death’ of an individual by simply switching of Aadhaar of that\n\n       person.        It is the submission of the petitioners that the\n\n       Constitution balances rights of individuals against State interest.\n\n       The Aadhaar completely upsets this balance and skews the\n\n       relationship between the citizen and the State enabling the State\n\n       to totally dominate the individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_245\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_246\">59)    The challenge is directed at the constitutional validity of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp;

Therefore, rather than\n\n       extending subsidies, benefits and services to the section of\n\n       society for which these are meant, it may have the tendency to\n\n       exclude them from receiving such subsidies, benefits and\n\n       services. The respondents, on the other hand, have stated on\n\n       affidavit that the attempt of the respondents would be to ensure\n\n       that no individual who is eligible for such benefits etc. is deprived\n\n       form receiving those benefits, even when in a particular case, it is\n\n       found that on authentication, his fingerprints or iris are not\n\n       matching and is resulting into failure.

We have eschewed detailed discussion in respect\n\n       of those arguments, which may not have much relevance when\n\n       judging the constitutional validity of the Act and the scheme.\n\n       However, such arguments of exclusion etc. leading to violation of\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_133\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">21</a> are dealt with at an appropriate stage.

Professor Lon Fuller has described these requirements\n\n       collectively as the &#x27;inner morality of law&#x27;.                In addition to\n\n       jurisprudential concept, which is important and an essential\n\n       condition for the rule of law, the substantive concept of the rule of\n\n       law is equally important and inseparable norm of the rule of law in\n\n       real sense. It encompasses the &#x27;right conception&#x27; of the rule of\n\n       law propounded by Dworkin. It means guaranteeing fundamental\n\n       values of morality, justice, and human rights, with a proper\n\n       balance between these and the other needs of the society.\n\n       Justice Aharon Barak, former Chief Justice of Israel, has lucidly\n\n       explained this facet of rule of law in the following manner:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">               “The rule of law is not merely public order, the rule of law is\n               social justice based on public order. The law exists to\n               ensure proper social life. Social life, however, is not a goal\n               in itself but a means to allow the individual to live in dignity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 108 of 567</span>\n\f               and develop himself. The human being and human rights\n               underlie this substantive perception of the rule of law, with\n               a proper balance among the different rights and between\n               human rights and the proper needs of society. The\n               substantive rule of law “is the rule of proper law, which\n               balances the needs of society and the individual”. This is\n               the rule of law that strikes a balance between society&#x27;s\n               need for political independence, social equality, economic\n               development, and internal order, on the one hand, and the\n               needs of the individual, his personal liberty, and his human\n               dignity on the other. The Judge must protect this rich\n               concept of the rule of law.”\n\n               The &#x27;rule of law&#x27;, which is a fine sonorous phrase, is\n\n       dynamic and ever expanding and can be put alongside the\n\n       brotherhood of man, human rights and human dignity. About the\n\n       modern rule of law, Professor Garner observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">               “The concept in its modern dress meets a need that has\n               been felt throughout the history of civilization, law is not\n               sufficient in itself and it must serve some purpose. Man is\n               a social animal, but to live in society he has had to fashion\n               for himself and in his own interest the law and other\n               instruments of government, and as a consequence those\n               must to some extent limit his personal liberties. The\n               problem is how to control those instruments of government\n               in accordance with the Rule of Law and in the interest of\n               the governed.”\n\n\n               Likewise, the basic spirit of our Constitution is to provide\n\n       each and every person of the nation equal opportunity to grow as\n\n       a human being, irrespective of race, caste, religion, community\n\n       and social status. Granville Austin while analyzing the functioning\n\n       of Indian Constitution in first 50 years has described three\n\n       distinguished strands of Indian Constitution: (i) protecting national\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 109 of 567</span>\n\f       unity and integrity, (ii) establishing the institution and spirit of\n\n       democracy; and (iii) fostering social reforms. The strands are\n\n       mutually dependent and inextricably intertwined in what he\n\n       elegantly describes as a &#x27;seamless web&#x27;. And there cannot be\n\n       social reforms till it is ensured that each and every citizen of this\n\n       country is able to exploit his/her potentials to the maximum. The\n\n       Constitution, although drafted by the Constituent Assembly, was\n\n       meant for the people of India and that is why it is given by the\n\n       people to themselves as expressed in the opening words “We the\n\n       People...”.

Our attempt has\n\n       been to strive the balancing of competing Constitutional norms.\n\n       The complex issues are dealt with keeping in view this role of the\n\n       Supreme Court as assigned by the Constitution; albeit within the\n\n       constitutional norms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_300\">\nScope of Judicial Review:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">73)    The aforesaid discussion leads us to pick up and discuss another\n\n       strand viz. the scope of judicial review in such matters.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">74)    Judicial review means the Supremacy of law. It is the power of\n\n       the court to review the actions of the Legislature, the Executive\n\n       and the Judiciary itself and to scrutinize the validity of any law or\n\n       action. It has emerged as one of the most effective instruments of\n\n       protecting       and     preserving       the    cherished   freedoms    in   a\n\n       constitutional democracy and upholding principles such as\n\n       separation of powers and rule of law.

The fundamental nature\n\n       of the Constitution is that of a limiting document, it curtails the\n\n       powers of majoritarianism from hijacking the State. The power of\n\n       review is the shield which is placed in the hands of the most\n\n       judiciaries of constitutional democracies to enable the protection\n\n       of the supreme document.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"94788795\" id=\"span_125\">75)    In <a href=\"/doc/94788795/\" id=\"a_138\">Binoy Viswam v.

Under the Constitution, Supreme Court as well as High\n               Courts are vested with the power of judicial review of not\n               only administrative acts of the executive but legislative\n               enactments passed by the legislature as well. This power is\n               given to the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 226</a> of the\n               Constitution and to the Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 32</a> as\n               well as <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. At the same time, the\n               parameters on which the power of judicial review of\n               administrative act is to be undertaken are different from the\n               parameters on which validity of legislative enactment is to\n               be examined. No doubt, in exercises of its power of judicial\n               review of legislative action, the Supreme Court, or for that\n               matter, the High Courts can declare law passed by\n               Parliament or the State Legislature as invalid. However, the\n               power to strike down primary legislation enacted by the\n               Union or the State Legislatures is on limited grounds.\n               Courts can strike down legislation either on the basis that it\n               falls foul of federal distribution of powers or that it\n               contravenes fundamental rights or other constitutional\n               rights/provisions of the Constitution of India. No doubt,\n               since the Supreme Court and the High Courts are treated\n               as the ultimate arbiter in all matters involving interpretation\n               of the Constitution, it is the courts which have the final say\n               on questions relating to rights and whether such a right is\n               violated or not.

However, while undertaking this\n               exercise of judicial review, the same is to be done at three\n               levels. In the first stage, the Court would examine as to\n               whether impugned provision in a legislation is compatible\n               with the fundamental rights or the constitutional provisions\n               (substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal\n               distribution of powers (procedural judicial review). If it is not\n               found to be so, no further exercise is needed as challenge\n               would fail. On the other hand, if it is found that legislature\n               lacks competence as the subject legislated was not within\n               the powers assigned in the List in Schedule VII, no further\n               enquiry is needed and such a law is to be declared as ultra\n               vires the Constitution. However, while undertaking\n               substantive judicial review, if it is found that the impugned\n               provision appears to be violative of fundamental rights or\n               other constitutional rights, the Court reaches the second\n               stage of review. At this second phase of enquiry, the Court\n               is supposed to undertake the exercise as to whether the\n               impugned provision can still be saved by reading it down\n               so as to bring it in conformity with the constitutional\n               provisions.

Though enacted as a distinct and\n                  independent fundamental right because of its great\n                  importance as a principle ensuring equality of\n                  opportunity in public employment which is so vital to\n                  the building up of the new classless egalitarian\n                  society envisaged in the Constitution, <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 16</a> is\n                  only an instance of the application of the concept of\n                  equality enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 14.</a> In other words, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_182\">Article\n                  14</a> is the genus while <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 16</a> is a species. <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_184\">Article\n                  16</a> gives effect to the doctrine of equality in all matters\n                  relating to public employment. The basic principle\n                  which, therefore, informs both <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_185\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_186\">16</a> is\n                  equality and inhibition against discrimination. Now,\n                  what is the content and reach of this great equalising\n                  principle? It is a founding faith, to use the words of\n                  Bose, J., “a way of life”, and it must not be subjected\n                  to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We\n                  cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all-\n                  embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be\n                  to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic\n                  concept with many aspects and dimensions and it\n                  cannot be “cribbed, cabined and confined” within\n                  traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic\n                  point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In\n                  fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies;\n                  one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the\n                  other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute\n                  monarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it\n                  that it is unequal both according to political logic and\n                  constitutional law and is therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_187\">Article\n                  14</a>, and if it effects any matter relating to public\n                  employment, it is also violative of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 16.</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_189\">Articles\n                  14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_190\">16</a> strike at arbitrariness in State action and\n                  ensure fairness and equality of treatment. They\n                  require that State action must be based on valid\n                  relevant principles applicable alike to all similarly\n                  situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 121 of 567</span>\n\f                  or irrelevant considerations because that would be\n                  denial of equality. Where the operative reason for\n                  State action, as distinguished from motive inducing\n                  from the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate\n                  and relevant but is extraneous and outside the area\n                  of permissible considerations, it would amount to\n                  mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_191\">Articles\n                  14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_192\">16.</a> Mala fide exercise of power and\n                  arbitrariness are different lethal radiations emanating\n                  from the same vice: in fact the latter comprehends the\n                  former.

Now, the question immediately arises as to what is\n                  the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 14:</a> what is the content and\n                  reach of the great equalising principle enunciated in\n                  this article? There can be no doubt that it is a\n                  founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar\n                  on which rests securely the foundation of our\n                  democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be\n                  subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic\n                  approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its\n                  all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would\n                  be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a\n                  dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions\n                  and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and\n                  doctrinaire limits.

Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to\n               exercise control over his or her personality. It finds an\n               origin in the notion that there are certain rights which are\n               natural to or inherent in a human being. Natural rights are\n               inalienable because they are inseparable from the human\n               personality. The human element in life is impossible to\n               conceive without the existence of natural rights. In 1690,\n               John Lockehad in his Second Treatise of Government\n               observed that the lives, liberties and estates of individuals\n\n28 (1975) 2 SCC 148\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 126 of 567</span>\n\f               are as a matter of fundamental natural law, a private\n               preserve. The idea of a private preserve was to create\n               barriers from outside interference. In 1765, William\n               Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England\n               spoke of a “natural liberty”. There were, in his view,\n               absolute rights which were vested in the individual by the\n               immutable laws of nature. These absolute rights were\n               divided into rights of personal security, personal liberty and\n               property. The right of personal security involved a legal and\n               uninterrupted enjoyment of life, limbs, body, health and\n               reputation by an individual.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">               46. Natural rights are not bestowed by the State. They\n               inhere in human beings because they are human.

The dignity of the individual, equality between\n               human beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational\n               pillars of the Indian Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_329\">               S.A.

Therefore, privacy is the necessary condition\n               precedent to the enjoyment of any of the guarantees in\n               Part III. As a result, when it is claimed by rights bearers\n               before constitutional courts, a right to privacy may be\n               situated not only in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 21</a>, but also simultaneously in\n               any of the other guarantees in Part III.

Unauthorised use of such\n                     information may, therefore lead to infringement of\n                     this right; and\n                    The privacy of choice, which protects an individual&#x27;s\n                     autonomy over fundamental personal choices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_257\">               For instance, we can ground physical privacy or privacy\n               relating to the body in Articles 19(1)(d) and (e) read with\n               Article 21; ground personal information privacy under\n               Article 21; and the privacy of choice in Articles 19(1)(a) to\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">               (c), 20(3), 21 and 25.

According\n               to the learned counsel for the petitioner this right is a\n               natural law right which is inalienable. Indeed, the reference\n               order itself, in para 12, refers to this aspect of the\n               fundamental right contained. It was, therefore, argued\n               before us that given the international conventions referred\n               to hereinabove and the fact that this right inheres in every\n               individual by virtue of his being a human being, such right\n               is not conferred by the Constitution but is only recognised\n               and given the status of being fundamental.

A remarkable dissent was that of Khanna,\n               J. [ Khanna, J. was in line to be Chief Justice of India but\n               was superseded because of this dissenting judgment. Nani\n               Palkhivala in an article written on this great Judge&#x27;s\n               supersession ended with a poignant sentence, “To the\n               stature of such a man, the Chief Justiceship of India can\n               add nothing.” Seervai, in his monumental treatise\n               Constitutional Law of India had this to say:“53. If in this\n               Appendix the dissenting judgment of Khanna, J. has not\n               been considered in detail, it is not for lack of admiration for\n               the judgment, or the courage which he showed in\n               delivering it regardless of the cost and consequences to\n               himself. It cost him the Chief Justiceship of India, but it\n               gained for him universal esteem not only for his courage\n               but also for his inflexible judicial independence. If his\n               judgment is not considered in detail it is because under the\n               theory of precedents which we have adopted, a dissenting\n               judgment, however valuable, does not lay down the law\n               and the object of a critical examination of the majority\n               judgments in this Appendix was to show that those\n               judgments are untenable in law, productive of grave public\n               mischief and ought to be overruled at the earliest\n               opportunity.

His reminder that the rule of law did not merely\n               mean giving effect to an enacted law was timely, and was\n               reinforced by his reference to the mass murders of millions\n               of Jews in Nazi concentration camps under an enacted law.\n               However, the legal analysis in this Chapter confirms his\n               conclusion though on different grounds from those which\n               he has given.” (at Appendix p. 2229).] The learned Judge\n               held: (SCC pp. 747 &amp; 751, paras 525 &amp; 531)\n\n                  “525. The effect of the suspension of the right to\n                  move any court for the enforcement of the right\n                  conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 21</a>, in my opinion, is that when a\n                  petition is filed in a court, the court would have to\n                  proceed upon the basis that no reliance can be\n                  placed upon that article for obtaining relief from the\n                  court during the period of emergency. Question then\n                  arises as to whether the rule that no one shall be\n                  deprived of his life or personal liberty without the\n                  authority of law still survives during the period of\n                  emergency despite the Presidential Order suspending\n                  the right to move any court for the enforcement of the\n                  right contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 21.</a> The answer to this\n                  question is linked with the answer to the question as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 129 of 567</span>\n\f                  to whether <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 21</a> is the sole repository of the right\n                  to life and personal liberty. After giving the matter my\n                  earnest consideration, I am of the opinion that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_226\">Article\n                  21</a> cannot be considered to be the sole repository of\n                  the right to life and personal liberty. The right to life\n                  and personal liberty is the most precious right of\n                  human beings in civilised societies governed by the\n                  rule of law. Many modern Constitutions incorporate\n                  certain fundamental rights, including the one relating\n                  to personal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\n                  absolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of\n                  personal security, personal liberty and private\n                  property. The American Declaration of Independence\n                  (1776) states that all men are created equal, and\n                  among their inalienable rights are life, liberty, and the\n                  pursuit of happiness. The Second Amendment to the\n                  US Constitution refers inter alia to security of person,\n                  while the Fifth Amendment prohibits inter alia\n                  deprivation of life and liberty without due process, of\n                  law. The different Declarations of Human Rights and\n                  fundamental freedoms have all laid stress upon the\n                  sanctity of life and liberty. They have also given\n                  expression in varying words to the principle that no\n                  one shall be derived of his life or liberty without the\n                  authority of law. The International Commission of\n                  Jurists, which is affiliated to UNESCO, has been\n                  attempting with, considerable success to give\n                  material content to “the rule of law”, an expression\n                  used in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n                  One of its most notable achievements was the\n                  Declaration of Delhi, 1959. This resulted from a\n                  Congress held in New Delhi attended by jurists from\n                  more than 50 countries, and was based on a\n                  questionnaire circulated to 75,000 lawyers. “Respect\n                  for the supreme value of human personality” was\n                  stated to be the basis of all law (see p. 21 of the\n                  Constitutional and Administrative Law by O.

The right not to be\n                  deprived of one&#x27;s life or liberty without the authority of\n                  law was not the creation of the Constitution. Such\n                  right existed before the Constitution came into force.\n                  The fact that the Framers of the Constitution made an\n                  aspect of such right a part of the fundamental rights\n                  did not have the effect of exterminating the\n                  independent identity of such right and of making\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 21</a> to be the sole repository of that right. Its\n                  real effect was to ensure that a law under which a\n                  person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty\n                  should prescribe a procedure for such deprivation or,\n                  according to the dictum laid down by Mukherjea, J. in\n                  Gopalan case [<a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_229\">A.K.

The conclusion is the same, answering\n               the reference that privacy is not just a common law right,\n               but a fundamental right falling in Part III of the Constitution\n               of India. I agree with this conclusion as privacy is a primal,\n               natural right which is inherent to an individual. However, I\n               am tempted to set out my perspective on the issue of\n               privacy as a right, which to my mind, is an important core of\n               any individual existence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_262\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 131 of 567</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_263\">\f               620. I had earlier adverted to an aspect of privacy — the\n               right to control dissemination of personal information. The\n               boundaries that people establish from others in society are\n               not only physical but also informational. There are different\n               kinds of boundaries in respect to different relations. Privacy\n               assists in preventing awkward social situations and\n               reducing social frictions. Most of the information about\n               individuals can fall under the phrase “none of your\n               business”. On information being shared voluntarily, the\n               same may be said to be in confidence and any breach of\n               confidentiality is a breach of the trust. This is more so in the\n               professional relationships such as with doctors and lawyers\n               which requires an element of candour in disclosure of\n               information. An individual has the right to control one&#x27;s life\n               while submitting personal data for various facilities and\n               services. It is but essential that the individual knows as to\n               what the data is being used for with the ability to correct\n               and amend it. The hallmark of freedom in a democracy is\n               having the autonomy and control over our lives which\n               becomes impossible, if important decisions are made in\n               secret without our awareness or participation.

If the individual permits someone to enter the house it\n               does not mean that others can enter the house.

How it thereafter works out in its inter-\n               play with other fundamental rights and when such\n               restrictions would become necessary would depend on the\n               factual matrix of each case.

While the legitimate expectation of\n\n       privacy may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and from\n\n       the private to the public arena, it is important to underscore that\n\n       privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is\n\n       in a public place. Further, privacy is a postulate of dignity itself.\n\n       Also, privacy concerns arise when the State seeks to intrude into\n\n       the body and the mind of the citizen. This aspect is discussed in\n\n       the following manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_264\">               Dr. D.Y.

The right to privacy is an element of\n               human dignity. The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional\n               relationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 133 of 567</span>\n\f               being can lead a life of dignity by securing the inner\n               recesses of the human personality from unwanted\n               intrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual\n               and the right of every person to make essential choices\n               which affect the course of life. In doing so privacy\n               recognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a\n               human being to fulfill the liberties and freedoms which are\n               the cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the value\n               of privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not\n               to fashion a new fundamental right by a process of\n               amendment through judicial fiat. Neither are the Judges nor\n               is the process of judicial review entrusted with the\n               constitutional responsibility to amend the Constitution. But\n               judicial review certainly has the task before it of\n               determining the nature and extent of the freedoms\n               available to each person under the fabric of those\n               constitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\n               traditionally discharged that function and in the context of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 21</a> itself, as we have already noted, a panoply of\n               protections governing different facets of a dignified\n               existence has been held to fall within the protection of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_341\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_342\">               297. What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\n               postulates the reservation of a private space for the\n               individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n               concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\n               ability of an individual to make choices lies at the core of\n               the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the\n               individual to assert and control the human element which is\n               inseparable from the personality of the individual. The\n               inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in\n               the ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human\n               life. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n               matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\n               over which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The\n               body and the mind are inseparable elements of the human\n               personality. The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the\n               mind can exist on the foundation that each individual\n               possesses an inalienable ability and right to preserve a\n               private space in which the human personality can develop.\n               Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the\n               personality would be in doubt. Recognising a zone of\n               privacy is but an acknowledgment that each individual must\n               be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 134 of 567</span>\n\f               of personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human\n               dignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are\n               intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\n               where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of\n               privacy, an individual is not judged by others. Privacy\n               enables each individual to take crucial decisions which find\n               expression in the human personality. It enables individuals\n               to preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas,\n               ideologies, preferences and choices against societal\n               demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition\n               of heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be different\n               and to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a\n               zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\n               searching glare of publicity in matters which are personal to\n               his or her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to the\n               place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the\n               foundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\n               individual can decide how liberty is best exercised.\n               Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a\n               pattern woven out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a\n               plural culture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_343\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_344\">               322. Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity.\n               Privacy has both a normative and descriptive function. At a\n               normative level privacy subserves those eternal values\n               upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are\n               founded. At a descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle\n               of entitlements and interests which lie at the foundation of\n               ordered liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_345\">               323. Privacy includes at its core the preservation of\n               personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage,\n               procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\n               connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards\n               individual autonomy and recognises the ability of the\n               individual to control vital aspects of his or her life. Personal\n               choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy.\n               Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality\n               and diversity of our culture. While the legitimate\n               expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to\n               the private zone and from the private to the public arenas,\n               it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or\n               surrendered merely because the individual is in a public\n               place. Privacy attaches to the person since it is an\n               essential facet of the dignity of the human being.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 135 of 567</span>\n\f               S.A.

It also embodies a normative one. The normative\n               case for privacy is intuitively simple. Nature has clothed\n               man, amongst other things, with dignity and liberty so that\n               he may be free to do what he will consistent with the\n               freedom of another and to develop his faculties to the\n               fullest measure necessary to live in happiness and peace.\n               The Constitution, through its Part III, enumerates many of\n               these freedoms and their corresponding rights as\n               fundamental rights. Privacy is an essential condition for the\n               exercise of most of these freedoms. Ex facie, every right\n               which is integral to the constitutional rights to dignity, life,\n               personal liberty and freedom, as indeed the right to privacy\n               is, must itself be regarded as a fundamental right.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_347\">               408. Though he did not use the name of “privacy”, it is\n               clear that it is what J.S. Mill took to be indispensable to the\n               existence of the general reservoir of liberty that\n               democracies are expected to reserve to their citizens. In\n               the introduction to his seminal On Liberty (1859), he\n               characterised freedom in the following way:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_267\">                  “This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty.\n                  It comprises, first, the inward domain of\n                  consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in\n                  the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and\n                  feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on\n                  all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral,\n                  or theological. The liberty of expressing and\n                  publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different\n                  principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct\n                  of an individual which concerns other people; but,\n                  being almost of as much importance as the liberty of\n                  thought itself, and resting in great part on the same\n                  reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly,\n                  the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of\n                  framing the plan of our life to suit our own character;\n                  of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as\n                  may follow: without impediment from our fellow\n                  creatures, so long as what we do does not harm\n                  them, even though they should think our conduct\n                  foolish, perverse, or wrong.

Liberty and privacy are integrally connected in a way\n               that privacy is often the basic condition necessary for\n               exercise of the right of personal liberty. There are\n               innumerable activities which are virtually incapable of being\n               performed at all and in many cases with dignity unless an\n               individual is left alone or is otherwise empowered to ensure\n               his or her privacy. Birth and death are events when privacy\n               is required for ensuring dignity amongst all civilised people.\n               Privacy is thus one of those rights “instrumentally required\n               if one is to enjoy” [ Laurence H.

The present case concerns one aspect of\n                  invasion of privacy: wrongful disclosure of private\n                  information. The case involves the familiar\n                  competition between freedom of expression and\n                  respect for an individual&#x27;s privacy. Both are vitally\n                  important rights. Neither has precedence over the\n                  other.

The\n\n       fundamental right to privacy derives from Part-III of the\n\n       Constitution and recognition of this right does not require a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 145 of 567</span>\n\f       constitutional amendment. Privacy is more than merely a\n\n       derivative constitutional right. It is the necessary basis of rights\n\n       guaranteed in the text of the Constitution.           Discussion in this\n\n       behalf is captured in the following passages:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_278\">               Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_279\">               127. The submission that recognising the right to privacy is\n               an exercise which would require a constitutional\n               amendment and cannot be a matter of judicial\n               interpretation is not an acceptable doctrinal position. The\n               argument assumes that the right to privacy is independent\n               of the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_368\">               There lies the error. The right to privacy is an element of\n               human dignity. The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional\n               relationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human\n               being can lead a life of dignity by securing the inner\n               recesses of the human personality from unwanted\n               intrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual\n               and the right of every person to make essential choices\n               which affect the course of life. In doing so privacy\n               recognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a\n               human being to fulfill the liberties and freedoms which are\n               the cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the value\n               of privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not\n               to fashion a new fundamental right by a process of\n               amendment through judicial fiat. Neither are the Judges nor\n               is the process of judicial review entrusted with the\n               constitutional responsibility to amend the Constitution. But\n               judicial review certainly has the task before it of\n               determining the nature and extent of the freedoms\n               available to each person under the fabric of those\n               constitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\n               traditionally discharged that function and in the context of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 21</a> itself, as we have already noted, a panoply of\n               protections governing different facets of a dignified\n               existence has been held to fall within the protection of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_369\">               S.A.

Fitzgerald, Salmond on\n               Jurisprudence at p. 228.] is correct. By the process of\n               enumeration, constitutional courts merely give a name and\n               specify the core of guarantees already present in the\n               residue of constitutional liberty. Over time, the Supreme\n               Court has been able to imply by its interpretative process\n               that several fundamental rights including the right to\n               privacy emerge out of expressly stated fundamental rights.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_370\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_200\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_201\">In Unni Krishnan, J.P. v.

While it intervenes to protect legitimate State\n               interests, the State must nevertheless put into place a\n               robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold\n               requirement. These three requirements apply to all\n               restraints on privacy (not just informational privacy). They\n               emanate from the procedural and content-based mandate\n               of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement that there must be a law\n               in existence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an\n               express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can be\n               deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance\n               with the procedure established by law. The existence of law\n               is an essential requirement. Second, the requirement of a\n               need, in terms of a legitimate State aim, ensures that the\n               nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction\n               falls within the zone of reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_281\">Article\n               14</a>, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. The\n               pursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does\n               not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a\n               postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial review does\n               not reappreciate or second guess the value judgment of\n               the legislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is\n               sought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest\n               arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the\n               means which are adopted by the legislature are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 158 of 567</span>\n\f               proportional to the object and needs sought to be fulfilled\n               by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the\n               guarantee against arbitrary State action because it ensures\n               that the nature and quality of the encroachment on the right\n               is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence,\n               the threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the\n               mutual interdependence between the fundamental\n               guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the\n               protection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The\n               right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of the right to life\n               and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is subject\n               to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_295\">               311. Apart from national security, the State may have\n               justifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data. In\n               a social welfare State, the Government embarks upon\n               programmes which provide benefits to impoverished and\n               marginalised sections of society. There is a vital State\n               interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are not\n               dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do\n               not qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\n               development is coupled with a legitimate concern that the\n               utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for\n               extraneous purposes. Data mining with the object of\n               ensuring that resources are properly deployed to legitimate\n               beneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to insist on the\n               collection of authentic data. But, the data which the State\n               has collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of\n               the State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for\n               extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate\n               concerns of the State are duly safeguarded while, at the\n               same time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention and\n               investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are\n               among the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms\n               are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social\n               welfare      State.

An unauthorised\n               parting of the medical records of an individual which have\n               been furnished to a hospital will amount to an invasion of\n               privacy.

If the State preserves the\n               anonymity of the individual it could legitimately assert a\n               valid State interest in the preservation of public health to\n               design appropriate policy interventions on the basis of the\n               data available to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_415\">               313.

Without discounting\n               that possibility, it needs to be noted that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 21</a> is the\n               bedrock of the privacy guarantee. If the spirit of liberty\n               permeates every claim of privacy, it is difficult, if not\n               impossible, to imagine that any standard of limitation other\n               than the one under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 21</a> applies.

From the\n               United States, where the terminology of “compelling State\n               interest” originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises\n               two things—a “compelling State interest” and a\n               requirement of “narrow tailoring” (narrow tailoring means\n               that the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the\n               objective). As a term, “compelling State interest” does not\n               have definite contours in the US. Hence, it is critical that\n               this standard be adopted with some clarity as to when and\n               in what types of privacy claimsit is to be used. Only in\n               privacy claims which deserve the strictest scrutiny is the\n               standard of compelling State interest to be used. As for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 163 of 567</span>\n\f               others, the just, fair and reasonable standard under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_315\">Article\n               21</a> will apply. When the compelling State interest standard\n               is to be employed, must depend upon the context of\n               concrete cases. However, this discussion sets the ground\n               rules within which a limitation for the right to privacy is to be\n               found.”</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_429\">82)    In view of the aforesaid detailed discussion in all the opinions\n\n       penned by six Hon’ble Judges, it stands established, without any\n\n       pale of doubt, that privacy has now been treated as part of\n\n       fundamental rights. The Court has held, in no uncertain terms,\n\n       that privacy has always been a natural right which gives an\n\n       individual freedom to exercise control over his or her personality.\n\n       The judgment further affirms three aspects of the fundamental\n\n       right to privacy, namely:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_305\">               (i) intrusion with an individual’s physical body;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_306\">               (ii) informational privacy; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_307\">               (iii) privacy of choice.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_308\">83)    As succinctly put by Nariman, J. first aspect involves the person\n\n       himself/herself and guards a person’s rights relatable to his/her\n\n       physical body thereby controlling the uncalled invasion by the\n\n       State.      Insofar as the second aspect, namely, informational\n\n       privacy is concerned, it does not deal with a person’s body but\n\n       deals with a person’s mind. In this manner, it protects a person\n\n       by giving her control over the dissemination of material that is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 164 of 567</span>\n\f       personal to her and disallowing unauthorised use of such\n\n       information by the State.              Third aspect of privacy relates to\n\n       individual’s autonomy by protecting her fundamental personal\n\n       choices.         These aspects have functional connection and\n\n       relationship with dignity. In this sense, privacy is a postulate of\n\n       human dignity itself. Human dignity has a constitutional value\n\n       and its significance is acknowledged by the Preamble. Further,\n\n       by catena of judgments, human dignity is treated as a\n\n       fundamental right and as a facet not only of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_316\">Article 21</a> but that of\n\n       right to equality (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_317\">Article 14</a>) and also part of bouquet of freedoms\n\n       stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 19.</a> Therefore, privacy as a right is intrinsic of\n\n       freedom, liberty and dignity.             Viewed in this manner, one can\n\n       trace positive and negative contents of privacy. The negative\n\n       content restricts the State from committing an intrusion upon the\n\n       life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive content imposes\n\n       an obligation on the State to take all necessary measures to\n\n       protect the privacy of the individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_309\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_230\">84)    A brief summation of the judgment on privacy would indicate that\n\n       privacy is treated as fundamental right. It is predicated on the\n\n       basis that privacy is a postulate of dignity and the concept of\n\n       dignity can be traced to the preamble of the Constitution as well\n\n       as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 21</a> thereof. Further, privacy is considered as a subset\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 165 of 567</span>\n\f       of personal liberty thereby accepting the minority opinion in\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_320\">Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.29               Another</a> significant\n\n       jurisprudential development of this judgment is that right to\n\n       privacy as a fundamental right is not limited to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 21.</a> On the\n\n       contrary, privacy resonates through the entirety of Part III of the\n\n       Constitution which pertains to fundamental rights and, in\n\n       particular, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_322\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_323\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_324\">21.</a> Privacy is also recognised as a\n\n       natural right which inheres in individuals and is, thus, inalienable.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_430\">       In developing the aforesaid concepts, the Court has been\n\n       receptive to the principles in international law and international\n\n       instruments. It is a recognition of the fact that certain human\n\n       rights cannot be confined within the bounds of geographical\n\n       location of a nation but have universal application.              In the\n\n       process, the Court accepts the concept of universalisation of\n\n       human rights, including the right to privacy as a human right and\n\n       the good practices in developing and understanding such rights in\n\n       other countries have been welcomed. In this hue, it can also be\n\n       remarked that comparative law has played a very significant role\n\n       in shaping the aforesaid judgment on privacy in Indian context,\n\n       notwithstanding the fact that such comparative law has only a\n\n       persuasive value.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_431\">\n29 AIR 1963 SC 1295\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 166 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">\f85)     The whole process of reasoning contained in different opinions of\n\n        the Hon’ble Judges would, thus, reflect that the argument that it is\n\n        difficult to precisely define the common denominator of privacy,\n\n        was rejected.         While doing so, the Court referred to various\n\n        approaches in formulating privacy30. An astute and sagacious\n\n        analysis of the judgment by the Centre for Internet and Society\n\n        brings about the following approaches which contributed to\n\n        formulating the following right to privacy:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_310\">       (a)     Classifying privacy on the basis of ‘harms’, thereby adopting\n\n       the approach conceptualised by Daniel Solove.                            In his book,\n\n       Understanding Privacy31, Daniel Solove makes a case for privacy\n\n       being a family resemblance concept.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_311\">       (b)     Classifying privacy on the basis of ‘interests’: Gary\n\n       Bostwick’s taxonomy of privacy is among the most prominent\n\n       amongst the scholarship that sub-areas within the right to privacy\n\n       protect different ‘interests’ or ‘justifications’.                This taxonomy is\n\n       adopted in Chelameswar, J.’s definition of ‘privacy’ and includes\n\n       the three interests of privacy of repose, privacy of sanctuary and\n\n       privacy of intimate decision. Repose is the ‘right to be let alone’,\n\n       sanctuary is the interest which prevents others from knowing,\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_433\">30 See the analysis of this judgment by the Centre for Internet and Society, https://cis-\n   india.org/internet-governance/blog/the-fundamental-right-to-privacy-an-analysis\n31 Daniel Solove, Understanding Privacy, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press,\n   2008.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                          Page 167 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_434\">\n\f       seeing and hearing thus keeping information within the private\n\n       zone, and finally, privacy of intimate decision protects the\n\n       freedom to act autonomously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_435\">       (c)     Classifying privacy as an ‘aggregation of rights’: This\n\n       approach in classifying privacy as a right, as highlighted above, is\n\n       not limited to one particular provision in the Chapter of\n\n       Fundamental Rights under the Constitution but is associated with\n\n       amalgam of different but connected rights.                     In formulating this\n\n       principle, the Court has referred to scholars like Roger Clarke,\n\n       Anita Allen etc. It has led to the recognition of private spaces or\n\n       zones as protected under the right to privacy (thereby extending\n\n       the ambit and scope of spatial privacy), informational privacy and\n\n       decisional autonomy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_436\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_437\">86)    The important question that arises, which is directly involved in\n\n       these cases, is:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_312\">               What is the scope of the right to privacy and in what\n\n       circumstances such a right can be limited?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_313\">87)    Concededly,         fundamental        rights        are not    absolute.       The\n\n       Constitution itself permits State to impose reasonable restrictions\n\n       on these rights under certain circumstances. Thus, extent and\n\n       scope of the right to privacy and how and when it can be limited\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                    Page 168 of 567</span>\n\f       by the State actions is also to be discerned. As noted above,\n\n       Nariman, J. has led the path by observing that “when it comes to\n\n       restrictions on this right, the drill of various Articles to which the\n\n       right    relates      must     be     scrupulously   followed”.    Therefore,\n\n       examination has to be from the point of view of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_325\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_326\">, 19</a>\n\n       and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_327\">21</a> for the reason that right to privacy is treated as having\n\n       intimate connection to various rights in Part III and is not merely\n\n       related to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 21.</a> Looked from this angle, the action of the\n\n       State will have to be tested on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 14.</a> This\n\n       judgment clarifies that the ‘classification’ test adopted earlier has\n\n       to be expanded and instead the law/action is to be tested on the\n\n       ground of ‘manifest arbitrariness’. This aspect has already been\n\n       discussed in detail under the caption ‘Scope of Judicial Review’\n\n       above. When it comes to examining the ‘restrictions’ as per the\n\n       provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution, the judgment proceeds\n\n       to clarify that a law which impacts dignity and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_331\">Article\n\n       21</a>, as well as having chilling effects on free speech which is\n\n       protected by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, must satisfy the standards of judicial\n\n       review under both provisions. Therefore, such restriction must\n\n       satisfy the test of judicial review under: (i) one of the eight\n\n       grounds mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_333\">Article 19(2);</a> and (ii) the restriction\n\n       should be reasonable.

Further, the reasonable restrictions must be\n\n       in the interests of: (i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, (ii) the\n\n       security of the State, (iii) friendly relations with foreign States, (iv)\n\n       public order, (v) decency or morality or (vi) in relation to contempt\n\n       of court, (vii) defamation or (viii) incitement to an offence.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_314\">88)    The judgment further lays down that in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_334\">Article 21</a>,\n\n       the test to be applied while examining a particular provision is the\n\n       ‘just, fair and reasonable test’ thereby bringing notion of\n\n       proportionality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_315\">89)    The petitioners have sought to build their case on the aforesaid\n\n       parameters of privacy and have submitted that this right of\n\n       privacy, which is now recognised as a fundamental right, stands\n\n       violated by the very fabric contained in the scheme of Aadhaar. It\n\n       is sought to be highlighted that the data which is collected by the\n\n       State, particularly with the authentication of each transaction\n\n       entered into by an individual, can be assimilated to construct a\n\n       profile of such an individual and it particularly violates\n\n       informational privacy.            No doubt, there can be reasonable\n\n       restrictions on this right, which is conceded by the petitioners. It\n\n       is, however, argued that right to privacy cannot be impinged\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 170 of 567</span>\n\f       without a just, fair and reasonable law. Therefore, in the first\n\n       instance, any intrusion into the privacy of a person has to be\n\n       backed by a law. Further, such a law, to be valid, has to pass the\n\n       test of legitimate aim which it should serve and also\n\n       proportionality i.e. proportionate to the need for such interference.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_438\">       Not only this, the law in question must also provide procedural\n\n       guarantees against abuse of such interference.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_439\">90)    At the same time, it can also be deduced from the reading of the\n\n       aforesaid judgment that the reasonable expectation of privacy\n\n       may vary from the intimate zone to the private zone and from the\n\n       private zone to the public arena.

Privacy\n               postulates the reservation of a private space for the\n               individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n               concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\n               ability of an individual to make choices lies at the core of\n               the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the\n               individual to assert and control the human element which is\n               inseparable from the personality of the individual. The\n               inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 171 of 567</span>\n\f               the ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human\n               life. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n               matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\n               over which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The\n               body and the mind are inseparable elements of the human\n               personality. The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the\n               mind can exist on the foundation that each individual\n               possesses an inalienable ability and right to preserve a\n               private space in which the human personality can develop.\n               Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the\n               personality would be in doubt. Recognising a zone of\n               privacy is but an acknowledgment that each individual must\n               be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development\n               of personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human\n               dignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are\n               intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\n               where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of\n               privacy, an individual is not judged by others. Privacy\n               enables each individual to take crucial decisions which find\n               expression in the human personality. It enables individuals\n               to preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas,\n               ideologies, preferences and choices against societal\n               demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition\n               of heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be different\n               and to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a\n               zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\n               searching glare of publicity in matters which are personal to\n               his or her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to the\n               place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the\n               foundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\n               individual can decide how liberty is best exercised.\n               Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a\n               pattern woven out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a\n               plural culture.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">               299. Privacy represents the core of the human personality\n               and recognises the ability of each individual to make\n               choices and to take decisions governing matters intimate\n               and personal. Yet, it is necessary to acknowledge that\n               individuals live in communities and work in communities.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_440\">               Their personalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their\n               social environment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives\n               of individuals are as much a social phenomenon. In their\n               interactions with others, individuals are constantly engaged\n               in behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 172 of 567</span>\n\f               the rest of society. Equally, the life of the individual is being\n               consistently shaped by cultural and social values imbibed\n               from living in the community. This state of flux which\n               represents a constant evolution of individual personhood in\n               the relationship with the rest of society provides the\n               rationale for reserving to the individual a zone of repose.\n               The lives which individuals lead as members of society\n               engender a reasonable expectation of privacy. The notion\n               of a reasonable expectation of privacy has elements both\n               of a subjective and objective nature. Privacy at a subjective\n               level is a reflection of those areas where an individual\n               desires to be left alone. On an objective plane, privacy is\n               defined by those constitutional values which shape the\n               content of the protected zone where the individual ought to\n               be left alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\n               expectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand,\n               the individual has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the\n               other, the exercise of individual choices is subject to the\n               rights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an\n               individual who possesses a plot of land may decide to build\n               upon it subject to zoning regulations. If the building bye-\n               laws define the area upon which construction can be raised\n               or the height of the boundary wall around the property, the\n               right to privacy of the individual is conditioned by\n               regulations designed to protect the interests of the\n               community in planned spaces. Hence while the individual is\n               entitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only on\n               the subjective expectation of the individual but on an\n               objective principle which defines a reasonable expectation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_441\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_442\">               307. The sphere of privacy stretches at one end to those\n               intimate matters to which a reasonable expectation of\n               privacy may attach. It expresses a right to be left alone. A\n               broader connotation which has emerged in academic\n               literature of a comparatively recent origin is related to the\n               protection of one&#x27;s identity. Data protection relates closely\n               with the latter sphere. Data such as medical information\n               would be a category to which a reasonable expectation of\n               privacy attaches. There may be other data which falls\n               outside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Apart from\n               safeguarding privacy, data protection regimes seek to\n               protect the autonomy of the individual. This is evident from\n               the emphasis in the European data protection regime on\n               the centrality of consent. Related to the issue of consent is\n               the requirement of transparency which requires a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 173 of 567</span>\n\f                disclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to\n                data transfer and use.”\n\n                S.A.

Democracy requires us to\n               respect and develop the free spirit of human being which is\n               responsible for all progress in human history. Democracy\n               is also a method by which we attempt to raise the living\n               standard of the people and to give opportunities to every\n               person to develop his/her personality. It is founded on\n               peaceful co-existence and cooperative living. If democracy\n               is based on the recognition of the individuality and dignity\n               of man, as a fortiori we have to recognize the right of a\n               human being to choose his sex/gender identity which is\n               integral to his/her personality and is one of the most basic\n               aspect of self-determination, dignity and freedom. In fact,\n               there is a growing recognition that the true measure of\n               development of a nation is not economic growth; it is\n               human dignity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_329\">               107.     More than 225 years ago, Immanuel Kant\n               propounded the doctrine of free will, namely, the free willing\n               individual as a natural law ideal. Without going into the\n               detailed analysis of his aforesaid theory of justice (as we\n               are not concerned with the analysis of his jurisprudence)\n               what we want to point out is his emphasis on the “freedom”\n               of human volition. The concepts of volition and freedom are\n               “pure”, that is not drawn from experience. They are\n               independent of any particular body of moral or legal rules.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_444\">               They are presuppositions of all such rules, valid and\n               necessary for all of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_445\">               108. Over a period of time, two divergent interpretations of\n               the Kantian criterion of justice came to be discussed. One\n               trend was an increasing stress on the maximum of\n               individual freedom of action as the end of law. This may not\n               be accepted and was criticised by the protagonist of\n               “hedonist utilitarianism”, notably Bentham. This school of\n               thought laid emphasis on the welfare of the society rather\n               than an individual by propounding the principle of\n               maximum of happiness to most of the people. Fortunately,\n               in the instant case, there is no such dichotomy between the\n               individual freedom/liberty we are discussing, as against\n               public good. On the contrary, granting the right to choose\n               gender leads to public good. The second tendency of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 177 of 567</span>\n\f               Kantian criterion of justice was found in reinterpreting\n               “freedom” in terms not merely of absence of restraint\n               but in terms of attainment of individual perfection. It is\n               this latter trend with which we are concerned in the present\n               case and this holds good even today. As pointed out\n               above, after the Second World War, in the form of the UN\n               Charter and thereafter there is more emphasis on the\n               attainment of individual perfection. In that united sense at\n               least there is a revival of the natural law theory of justice.\n               Blackstone, in the opening pages in his “Vattelian Fashion”\n               said that the principal aim of society “is to protect\n               individuals in the enjoyment of those absolute rights which\n               were vested in them by the immutable laws of nature….”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_446\">97)    Thus, right of choice and right of self determination were\n\n       accepted as facets of human dignity. It was also emphasised that\n\n       in certain cases, like the case at hand (that of transgenders),\n\n       recognition of this aspect of human dignity would yield happiness\n\n       to the individuals and, at the same time, also be in public good.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_447\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105818923\" id=\"span_246\">98)    Advancement in conceptualising the doctrine of human dignity\n\n       took place in the case of <a href=\"/doc/105818923/\" id=\"a_338\">Shabnam v.

It is in this sense torture,\n\n35 (2015) 6 SCC 702\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 178 of 567</span>\n\f               humiliation, forced labour, etc. all infringe on human dignity.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_448\">               It is in this context many rights of the accused derive from\n               his dignity as a human being. These may include the\n               presumption that every person is innocent until proven\n               guilty; the right of the accused to a fair trial as well as\n               speedy trial; right of legal aid, all part of human dignity.\n               Even after conviction, when a person is spending prison\n               life, allowing humane conditions in jail is part of human\n               dignity. Prisons reforms or Jail reforms measures to make\n               convicts a reformed person so that they are able to lead\n               normal life and assimilate in the society, after serving the\n               jail term, are motivated by human dignity jurisprudence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_449\">               16. In fact, this principle of human dignity has been used\n               frequently by Courts in the context of considering the death\n               penalty itself. Way back in the year 1972, the United States\n               Supreme Court kept in mind this aspect in the case of\n               Furman v. Georgia 408 US 238 (1972). The Court,\n               speaking through Brennan, J., while considering the\n               application of Eighth Amendment&#x27;s prohibition on cruel and\n               unusual punishments, summed up the previous\n               jurisprudence on the Amendment as &#x27;prohibit(ing) the\n               infliction of uncivilized and inhuman punishments. The\n               State, even as it punishes, must treat its members with\n               respect for their intrinsic worth as human beings. A\n               punishment is &#x27;cruel and unusual&#x27;, therefore, if it does not\n               comport with human dignity&#x27;. In Gregg v. Georgia 428 US\n               153 (1976), that very Court, again through Brennan, J.,\n               considered that &#x27;the fatal constitutional infirmity in the\n               punishment of death is that it treats “members of the\n               human race as non-humans, as objects to be toyed with an\n               discarded. (It is), thus, inconsistent with the fundamental\n               premise of the clause that even the vilest criminal remains\n               a human being possessed of common human dignity&#x27;. The\n               Canadian Supreme Court, the Hungarian Constitutional\n               Court and the South African Supreme Court have gone to\n               the extent of holding that capital punishment constitutes a\n               serious impairment of human dignity and imposes a\n               limitation on the essential content of the fundamental rights\n               to life and human dignity and on that touchstone declaring\n               that dignity as unconstitutional.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_450\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175579179\" id=\"span_248\">99)    Next judgment in this line of cases would be that of <a href=\"/doc/175579179/\" id=\"a_339\">Jeeja Ghosh\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 179 of 567</span>\n\f       &amp; Another v.

The rights that are guaranteed to differently-abled\n               persons under the 1995 Act, are founded on the sound\n               principle of human dignity which is the core value of human\n               right and is treated as a significant facet of right to life and\n               liberty. Such a right, now treated as human right of the\n               persons who are disabled, has it roots in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 21</a> of the\n               Constitution. Jurisprudentially, three types of models for\n               determining the content of the constitutional value of\n               human dignity are recognised. These are: (i) Theological\n               Models, (ii) Philosophical Models, and (iii) Constitutional\n               Models. Legal scholars were called upon to determine the\n               theological basis of human dignity as a constitutional value\n               and as a constitutional right. Philosophers also came out\n               with their views justifying human dignity as core human\n               value. Legal understanding is influenced by theological and\n               philosophical views, though these two are not identical.\n               Aquinas and Kant discussed the jurisprudential aspects of\n               human dignity based on the aforesaid philosophies. Over a\n               period of time, human dignity has found its way through\n               constitutionalism, whether written or unwritten. Even right\n               to equality is interpreted based on the value of human\n               dignity. Insofar as India is concerned, we are not even\n               required to take shelter under theological or philosophical\n               theories. We have a written Constitution which guarantees\n               human rights that are contained in Part III with the caption\n               “Fundamental Rights”. One such right enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_341\">Article\n               21</a> is right to life and liberty. Right to life is given a\n               purposeful meaning by this Court to include right to live\n               with dignity. It is the purposive interpretation which has\n               been adopted by this Court to give a content of the right to\n               human dignity as the fulfilment of the constitutional value\n               enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_342\">Article 21.</a> Thus, human dignity is a\n               constitutional value and a constitutional goal. What are the\n               dimensions of constitutional value of human dignity?

It ensures the normative unity\n                  of human rights. This normative unity is expressed in\n                  the three ways: first, the value of human dignity\n                  serves as a normative basis for constitutional rights\n                  set out in the Constitution; second, it serves as an\n                  interpretative principle for determining the scope of\n                  constitutional rights, including the right to human\n                  dignity; third, the value of human dignity has an\n                  important role in determining the proportionality of a\n                  statute limiting a constitutional right.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_333\">               38.

The first and foremost responsibility fixed\n               upon the State is the protection of human dignity without\n               which any other right would fall apart.

Life is basically self-assertion. In the life of a\n               person, conflict and dilemma are expected to be normal\n               phenomena.

State of Punjab</a>, (1996) 2 SCC 648 : 1996 SCC\n               (Cri) 374] , as stated earlier, distinguishes attempt to\n               suicide and abetment of suicide from acceleration of the\n               process of natural death which has commenced. The\n               authorities, we have noted from other jurisdictions, have\n               observed the distinctions between the administration of\n               lethal injection or certain medicines to cause painless\n               death and non-administration of certain treatment which\n               can prolong the life in cases where the process of dying\n               that has commenced is not reversible or withdrawal of the\n               treatment that has been given to the patient because of the\n               absolute absence of possibility of saving the life. To\n               explicate, the first part relates to an overt act whereas the\n               second one would come within the sphere of informed\n               consent and authorised omission. The omission of such a\n               nature will not invite any criminal liability if such action is\n               guided by certain safeguards. The concept is based on\n               non-prolongation of life where there is no cure for the state\n               the patient is in and he, under no circumstances, would\n               have liked to have such a degrading state. The words “no\n               cure” have to be understood to convey that the patient\n               remains in the same state of pain and suffering or the dying\n               process is delayed by means of taking recourse to modern\n               medical technology. It is a state where the treating\n               physicians and the family members know fully well that the\n               treatment is administered only to procrastinate the\n               continuum of breath of the individual and the patient is not\n               even aware that he is breathing. Life is measured by\n               artificial heartbeats and the patient has to go through this\n               undignified state which is imposed on him. The dignity of\n               life is denied to him as there is no other choice but to suffer\n               an avoidable protracted treatment thereby thus indubitably\n               casting a cloud and creating a dent in his right to live with\n               dignity and face death with dignity, which is a preserved\n               concept of bodily autonomy and right to privacy. In such a\n               stage, he has no old memories or any future hopes but he\n               is in a state of misery which nobody ever desires to have.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 185 of 567</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_452\">\f               Some may also silently think that death, the inevitable\n               factum of life, cannot be invited.

Dworkin, being a philosopher-jurist, was aware of the\n               idea of a Constitution and of a constitutional right to human\n               dignity. In his book, Taking Rights Seriously, he noted that\n               everyone who takes rights seriously must give an answer\n               to the question why human rights vis-à-vis the State exist.\n               According to him, in order to give such an answer one must\n               accept, as a minimum, the idea of human dignity. As he\n               writes:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_349\">                  “Human dignity … associated with Kant, but defended\n                  by philosophers of different schools, supposes that\n                  there are ways of treating a man that are inconsistent\n                  with recognising him as a full member of the human\n                  community, and holds that such treatment is\n                  profoundly unjust.”41\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_458\">               296. In his Book, Is Democracy Possible Here?42 Dworkin\n               develops two principles about the concept of human\n               dignity. First principle regards the intrinsic value of every\n               person viz. every person has a special objective value\n               which value is not only important to that person alone but\n               success or failure of the lives of every person is important\n               to all of us. The second principle, according to Dworkin, is\n               that of personal responsibility. According to this principle,\n               every person has the responsibility for success in his own\n               life and, therefore, he must use his discretion regarding the\n               way of life that will be successful from his point of view.\n               Thus, Dworkin&#x27;s jurisprudence of human dignity is founded\n               on the aforesaid two principles which, together, not only\n               define the basis but the conditions for human dignity.\n               Dworkin went on to develop and expand these principles in\n               his book, Justice for Hedgehogs (2011)43.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_459\">               297. When speaking of rights, it is impossible to envisage\n               it without dignity. In his pioneering and all-inclusive Justice\n               for Hedgehogs, he proffered an approach where respect\n               for human dignity, entails two requirements; first, self-\n               respect i.e. taking the objective importance of one&#x27;s own\n\n41 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (A&amp;C Black, 2013) 239.\n42 Ronald Dworkin, Is Democracy Possible Here?

According to Dworkin,\n               these principles form the fundamental criteria supervising\n               what we should do in order to live well.45 They further\n               explicate the rights that individuals have against their\n               political community,46 and they provide a rationale for the\n               moral duties we owe to others. This notion of dignity, which\n               Dworkin gives utmost importance to, is indispensable to\n               any civilised society. It is what is constitutionally recognised\n               in our country and for good reason. Living well is a moral\n               responsibility of individuals; it is a continuing process that is\n               not a static condition of character but a mode that an\n               individual constantly endeavours to imbibe. A life lived\n               without dignity, is not a life lived at all for living well implies\n               a conception of human dignity which Dworkin interprets\n               includes ideals of self-respect and authenticity.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_461\">103) In summation, it can be said that the concept of human dignity\n\n        dates back to thousands of years. Historically, human dignity, as\n\n        a concept, found its origin in different religions which is held to be\n\n        an important component of their theological approach. Jurists\n\n        have given this approach as ‘theological model’ of dignity. It is\n\n        primarily based on the premise that human beings are the\n\n        creation of God and cannot be treated as mere material beings.\n\n        Human identity is more ethical than spiritual because man is\n\n        creation of God; harm to a human being is harm to God. God,\n\n        thus, wishes to grant human being recognition, dignity and\n\n44 Kenneth W. Simons, “Dworkin&#x27;s Two Principle of Dignity: An Unsatisfactory Non-\n   Consequentialist Account of Interpersonal Moral Duties”, 90 Boston Law Rev. 715 (2010)]\n45 Footnote 33 above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_462\">46 Footnote 32 above.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                         Page 188 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_463\">\n\f       authority.      It is also religious belief that God is rational and\n\n       determines his goals for himself. Likewise, human being created\n\n       by God too is rational and determines his own goal. Therefore,\n\n       man has freedom of will. A couple of centuries ago, philosophical\n\n       approach was given to the conception of human dignity. This\n\n       sphere was headed by German Philosopher Immanuel Kant\n\n       whose moral theory is divided into two parts: ethics and right.\n\n       According to Kant, a person acts ethically when he acts by force\n\n       of a duty that a rational agent self-legislates onto his own will.\n\n       Thus, he talked of free will of the human being. For Kant, ethics\n\n       include duties of oneself (for example - to develop one&#x27;s talents)\n\n       and to others (for example - to contribute to their happiness).\n\n       This ability is the human dignity of man. Philosophical approach,\n\n       thus, is metaethical one, which is a journey from ‘human being’\n\n       and ‘remaining human’. This is explained by Professor Upendra\n\n       Baxi as the relationship between ‘self’, ‘others’ and ‘society’. In\n\n       this philosophical sense, dignity is ‘respect’ for an individual\n\n       person based on the principle of freedom and capacity of making\n\n       choices and a good or just social order is one which respects\n\n       dignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and ‘conditions’ as the ‘source of\n\n       free and informed choice’.                 To put it philosophically, each\n\n       individual has a right to live her life the way she wants, without\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 189 of 567</span>\n\f       any subjugation.

Kant also maintains that to use the other as a\n\n       means is the basic immoral act. Everything else that is immoral\n\n       is immoral because of this, so this should be the criterion: Are\n\n       you using the other as a means?                      Someone has put this\n\n       remarkably in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_350\">               “Alexander the Great is not noble, only Gautam the Buddha\n               is noble, for the simple reason that Buddha has no rule\n               over others but he is a matter of himself.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_351\">               There is no part of his being which is not in tune with him.\n               He has come to attain absolute harmony. There is no\n               conflict in him, there is a reign of absolute peace. And his\n               consciousness is supreme, nothing is above it – no instinct,\n               no intellect, nothing is higher than his consciousness.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_352\">104) Historically, a transition has taken place into the idea of dignity by\n\n       transforming the amalgam of theological approach (man as\n\n       creation of God deserving dignity) and philosophical approach\n\n       based on morality, by elevating human dignity as a constitutional\n\n       norm attaching constitutional value to it.             It is a transition from\n\n       ‘respect’ to ‘right’ by making respect as enforceable right. The\n\n       manner in which it has happened in India has been traced above.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_353\">105) From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that dignity as a\n\n       jurisprudential concept has now been well defined by this Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 190 of 567</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_465\">\f       Its essential ingredients can be summarised as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_354\">               The basic principle of dignity and freedom of the individual\n\n       is an attribute of natural law which becomes the right of all\n\n       individuals in a constitutional democracy. Dignity has a central\n\n       normative role as well as constitutional value. This normative role\n\n       is performed in three ways:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_355\">               First, it becomes basis for constitutional rights;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_356\">               Second, it serves as an interpretative principle for\n\n       determining the scope of constitutional rights; and,\n\n               Third, it determines the proportionality of a statute limiting a\n\n       constitutional right. Thus, if an enactment puts limitation on a\n\n       constitutional right and such limitation is disproportionate, such a\n\n       statute can be held to be unconstitutional by applying the doctrine\n\n       of proportionality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_357\">106) As per Dworkin, there are two principles about the concept of\n\n       human dignity. First principle regards an ‘intrinsic value’ of every\n\n       person, namely, every person has a special objective value,\n\n       which value is not only important to that person alone but\n\n       success or failure of the lives of every person is important to all of\n\n       us. It can also be described as self respect which represents the\n\n       free will of the person, her capacity to think for herself and to\n\n       control her own life. The second principle is that of ‘personal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 191 of 567</span>\n\f       responsibility’, which means every person has the responsibility\n\n       for success in her own life and, therefore, she must use her\n\n       discretion regarding the way of life that will be successful from\n\n       her point of view.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_358\">107) Sum total of this exposition is well defined by Professor Baxi by\n\n       explaining that as per the aforesaid view, dignity is to be treated\n\n       as ‘empowerment’ which makes a triple demand in the name of\n\n       ‘respect’ for human dignity, namely:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_359\">       (i) respect for one&#x27;s capacity as an agent to make one&#x27;s own free\n\n       choices;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_360\">       (ii) respect for the choices so made; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_361\">       (iii) respect for one&#x27;s need to have a context and conditions in\n\n       which one can operate as a source of free and informed choice.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_362\">108) In this entire formulation, ‘respect’ for an individual is the fulcrum,\n\n       which is based on the principle of freedom and capacity to make\n\n       choices and a good or just social order is one which respects\n\n       dignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and ‘conditions’ as the ‘source of\n\n       free and informed choice’.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_363\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_266\">109) The aforesaid discourse on the concept of human dignity is from\n\n       an individual point of view. That is the emphasis of the petitioners\n\n       as well. That would be one side of the coin. A very important\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 192 of 567</span>\n\f       feature which the present case has brought into focus is another\n\n       dimension of human dignity, namely, in the form of ‘common\n\n       good’ or ‘public good’. Thus, our endeavour here is to give richer\n\n       and more nuanced understanding to the concept of human\n\n       dignity. Here, dignity is not limited to an individual and is to be\n\n       seen in an individualistic way.

It is just in this\n               that his dignity (personality) consists, by which he raises\n               himself above all other beings in the world that are not\n               human beings and yet can be used, and so overall things.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_368\">112) Charles Bernard Renouvier, a French Philosopher, said:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_369\">               “Republic is a State which best reconciles dignity of\n               individual with dignity of everyone.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_370\">113) Dignity        extended        to   all    citizens    involves   the   idea    of\n\n       communitarism.

It included freedom\n\n       from fear and want as amongst the highest aspirations of the\n\n       common people. This is of course subject to resources of each\n\n       State. But the realisation is contemplated through national effort\n\n       and international cooperation. Evidently, the UDHR adopts a\n\n       substantive or communitarian concept of human dignity.

It has now been well\n\n       recognised that at its core, human dignity contains three\n\n       elements, namely, intrinsic value, autonomy and community\n\n       value. These are known as core values of human dignity. These\n\n       three elements can assist in structuring legal reasoning and\n\n       justifying judicial choices in ‘hard cases’. It has to be borne in\n\n       mind that human dignity is a constitutional principle, rather than\n\n       free standing fundamental rights.                Insofar as intrinsic value is\n\n       concerned, here human dignity is linked to the nature of being.\n\n       We may give brief description of these three contents of the idea\n\n       of human dignity as below:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_483\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_484\">       (I)     Intrinsic Value:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_485\">               The uniqueness of human kind is the product of a\n\n       combination        of    inherent      traits    and     features      –    including\n\n       intelligence, sensibility, and the ability to communicate – that give\n\n       humans a special status in the world, distinct from other\n\n       species.48        The intrinsic value of all individuals results in two\n48 See George Kateb, Human Dignity 5 (2011) (“[W]e can distinguish between the dignity of every\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                     Page 197 of 567</span>\n\f       basic postulates: anti-utilitarian and anti-authoritarian. The former\n\n       consists of the formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative that\n\n       every individual is an end in him or herself, not a means for\n\n       collective goals or the purposes of others.                        The latter is\n\n       synthesized in the idea that the State exists for the individual, not\n\n       the other way around. As for its legal implications, intrinsic value\n\n       is the origin of a set of fundamental rights. The first of these\n\n       rights is the right to life, a basic precondition for the enjoyment of\n\n       any other right. A second right directly related to the intrinsic\n\n       value of each and every individual is equality before and under\n\n       the law. All individuals are of equal value and, therefore, deserve\n\n       equal respect and concern. This means not being discriminated\n\n       against due to race, colour, ethnic or national origin, sex, age or\n\n       mental capacity (the right to non-discrimination), as well as\n\n       respect for cultural, religious, or linguistic diversity (the right to\n\n       recognition). Human dignity fulfills only part of the content of the\n\n       idea of equality, and in many situations it may be acceptable to\n\n       differentiate among people. In the contemporary world, this is\n\n       particularly at issue in cases involving affirmative action and the\n\n       rights of religious minorities. Intrinsic value also leads to the right\n\n       to integrity, both physical and mental.

It is the\n\n       foundation of the free will of individuals, which entitles them to\n\n       pursue the ideals of living well and having a good life in their own\n\n       ways. The central notion is that of self-determination: An\n\n       autonomous person establishes the rules that will govern his or\n\n       her life. Kantian conception of autonomy is the will governed by\n\n       the moral law (moral autonomy). Here, we are concerned with\n\n       personal autonomy, which is value neutral and means the free\n\n       exercise of the will according to one’s own values, interests, and\n\n       desires. Autonomy requires the fulfillment of certain conditions,\n\n       such as reason (the mental capacity to make informed decisions),\n\n       independence (the absence of coercion, manipulation and severe\n\n       want), and choice (the actual existence of alternatives).\n\n       Autonomy, thus, is the ability to make personal decisions and\n\n       choices in life based on one’s conception of the good, without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 199 of 567</span>\n\f       undue external influences. As for its legal implications, autonomy\n\n       underlies a set of fundamental rights associated with democratic\n\n       constitutionalism, including basic freedoms (private autonomy)\n\n       and the right of political participation (public autonomy).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_489\">               It would be pertinent to emphasise here that with the rise of\n\n       the welfare state, many countries in the world (and that includes\n\n       India) also consider a fundamental right to minimum living\n\n       conditions (the existential minimum) in the balancing that results\n\n       into effective autonomy.               Thus, there are three facets of\n\n       autonomy, namely: private autonomy, public autonomy and the\n\n       existential minimum. Insofar as the last component is concerned,\n\n       it is also referred to as social minimum or the basic right to the\n\n       provision of adequate living conditions has its roots in right to\n\n       equality as well. In fact, equality, in a substantive sense, and\n\n       especially autonomy (both private and public), are dependent on\n\n       the fact that individuals are “free from want,” meaning that their\n\n       essential needs are satisfied. To be free, equal, and capable of\n\n       exercising       responsible        citizenship,     individuals   must    pass\n\n       minimum thresholds of well-being, without which autonomy is a\n\n       mere fiction.       This requires access to some essential utilities,\n\n       such as basic education and health care services, as well as\n\n       some elementary necessities, such as food, water, clothing, and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 200 of 567</span>\n\f       shelter. The existential minimum, therefore, is the core content of\n\n       social and economic rights. This concept of minimum social right\n\n       is protected by the Court, time and again.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_490\">\n       (III) Community Value:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_371\">              This element of human dignity as community value relates\n\n       to the social dimension of dignity. The contours of human dignity\n\n       are shaped by the relationship of the individual with others, as\n\n       well as with the world around him. English poet John Donne\n\n       expresses the same sentiments when he says ‘no man is an\n\n       island, entire of itself’ 49. The individual, thus, lives within himself,\n\n       within a community, and within a state. His personal autonomy is\n\n       constrained by the values, rights, and morals of people who are\n\n       just as free and equal as him, as well as by coercive regulation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_372\">       Robert Post identified three distinct forms of social order:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_373\">       community (a “shared world of common faith and fate”),\n\n       management (the instrumental organization of social life through\n\n       law to achieve specific objectives),                    and democracy (an\n\n       arrangement that embodies the purpose of individual and\n\n       collective self-determination.

The relevant question here is in\n\n       what circumstances and to what degree should these actions be\n\n       regarded as legitimate in a constitutional democracy? The liberal\n\n       predicament that the state must be neutral with regard to different\n\n       conceptions of the good in a plural society is not incompatible, of\n\n       course, with limitation resulting from the necessary coexistence of\n\n       different      views     and      potentially     conflicting      rights.        Such\n\n       interferences, however, must be justified on grounds of a\n\n       legitimate idea of justice, an “overlapping consensus” 50 that can\n\n       be shared by most individuals and groups.                          Whenever such\n\n       tension arises, the task of balancing is to be achieved by the\n\n       Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_492\">               We would like to highlight one more significant feature\n\n       which the issues involved in the present case bring about. It is\n\n       the balancing of two facets of dignity of the same individual.\n\n       Whereas, on the one hand, right of personal autonomy is a part\n\n       of dignity (and right to privacy), another part of dignity of the\n\n       same individual is to lead a dignified life as well (which is again a\n50 “Overlapping consensus” is a term coined by John Rawls that identifies basic ideas of justice\n   that can be shared by supporters of different religious, political, and moral comprehensive\n   doctrines.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                       Page 202 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">\n\f       facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_360\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution).

For, there cannot be undue intrusion into the\n\n       autonomy on the pretext of conferment of economic benefits.\n\n       Precisely, this very exercise of balancing is undertaken by the\n\n       Court in resolving the complex issues raised in the petitions.\n\n\nDoctrine of Proportionality:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_374\">117) As noted above, whenever challenge is laid to an action of the\n\n       State on the ground that it violates the right to privacy, the action\n\n       of the State is to be tested on the following parameters:\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_6\">       (a)     the action must be sanctioned by law;\n\n       (b)     the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic\n\n       society for a legitimate aim; and\n\n       (c)     the extent of such interference must be proportionate to the\n\n       need for such interference.\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_375\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99335142\" id=\"span_285\">118) Doctrine of proportionality was explained by the Constitution\n\n       Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/99335142/\" id=\"a_361\">Modern Dental College and\n\n       Research Centre &amp; Ors. v.

According to Aharon Barak\n               (former Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Israel), there are\n               four sub-components of proportionality which need to be\n               satisfied [Aharon Barak, Proportionality: Constitutional\n               Rights and Their Limitation (Cambridge University Press\n               2012)], a limitation of a constitutional right will be\n               constitutionally permissible if:\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_7\">               (i)    it is designated for a proper purpose;\n\n               (ii)    the measures undertaken to effectuate such a\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_377\">               limitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of that\n               purpose;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_378\">               (iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that there\n               are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that\n               same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation; and finally\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_379\">               (iv) there needs to be a proper relation (“proportionality\n               stricto sensu” or “balancing”) between the importance of\n               achieving the proper purpose and the social importance of\n               preventing the limitation on the constitutional right.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_495\">               61.     Modern theory of constitutional rights draws a\n               fundamental distinction between the scope of the\n               constitutional rights, and the extent of its protection. Insofar\n               as the scope of constitutional rights is concerned, it marks\n               the outer boundaries of the said rights and defines its\n               contents. The extent of its protection prescribes the\n               limitations on the exercises of the rights within its scope. In\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 204 of 567</span>\n\f               that sense, it defines the justification for limitations that can\n               be imposed on such a right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_496\">               62. It is now almost accepted that there are no absolute\n               constitutional rights [ Though, debate on this vexed issue\n               still continues and some constitutional experts claim that\n               there are certain rights, albeit very few, which can still be\n               treated as “absolute”. Examples given are:(a) Right to\n               human dignity which is inviolable,(b) Right not to be\n               subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment\n               or punishment. Even in respect of such rights, there is a\n               thinking that in larger public interest, the extent of their\n               protection can be diminished. However, so far such\n               attempts of the States have been thwarted by the judiciary.]\n               and all such rights are related. As per the analysis of\n               Aharon       Barak     [Aharon       Barak,      Proportionality:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_380\">               Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation (Cambridge\n               University Press 2012).] , two key elements in developing\n               the modern constitutional theory of recognising positive\n               constitutional rights along with its limitations are the notions\n               of democracy and the rule of law. Thus, the requirement of\n               proportional limitations of constitutional rights by a sub-\n               constitutional law i.e. the statute, is derived from an\n               interpretation of the notion of democracy itself. Insofar as\n               the Indian Constitution is concerned, democracy is treated\n               as the basic feature of the Constitution and is specifically\n               accorded a constitutional status that is recognised in the\n               Preamble of the Constitution itself. It is also unerringly\n               accepted that this notion of democracy includes human\n               rights which is the cornerstone of Indian democracy. Once\n               we accept the aforesaid theory (and there cannot be any\n               denial thereof), as a fortiori, it has also to be accepted that\n               democracy is based on a balance between constitutional\n               rights and the public interests. In fact, such a provision in\n               <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_362\">Article 19</a> itself on the one hand guarantees some certain\n               freedoms in clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_363\">Article 19</a> and at the same time\n               empowers the State to impose reasonable restrictions on\n               those freedoms in public interest. This notion accepts the\n               modern constitutional theory that the constitutional rights\n               are related. This relativity means that a constitutional\n               licence to limit those rights is granted where such a\n               limitation will be justified to protect public interest or the\n               rights of others. This phenomenon—of both the right and\n               its limitation in the Constitution—exemplifies the inherent\n               tension between democracy&#x27;s two fundamental elements.\n               On the one hand is the right&#x27;s element, which constitutes a\n               fundamental component of substantive democracy; on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 205 of 567</span>\n\f               other hand is the people element, limiting those very rights\n               through their representatives. These two constitute a\n               fundamental component of the notion of democracy,\n               though this time in its formal aspect. How can this tension\n               be resolved? The answer is that this tension is not resolved\n               by eliminating the “losing” facet from the Constitution.\n               Rather, the tension is resolved by way of a proper\n               balancing of the competing principles. This is one of the\n               expressions of the multi-faceted nature of democracy.\n               Indeed, the inherent tension between democracy&#x27;s different\n               facets is a “constructive tension”. It enables each facet to\n               develop while harmoniously coexisting with the others. The\n               best way to achieve this peaceful coexistence is through\n               balancing between the competing interests. Such\n               balancing enables each facet to develop alongside the\n               other facets, not in their place. This tension between the\n               two fundamental aspects—rights on the one hand and its\n               limitation on the other hand—is to be resolved by balancing\n               the two so that they harmoniously coexist with each other.\n               This balancing is to be done keeping in mind the relative\n               social values of each competitive aspects when considered\n               in proper context.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_497\">               63. In this direction, the next question that arises is as to\n               what criteria is to be adopted for a proper balance between\n               the two facets viz. the rights and limitations imposed upon\n               it by a statute. Here comes the concept of “proportionality”,\n               which is a proper criterion. To put it pithily, when a law\n               limits a constitutional right, such a limitation is constitutional\n               if it is proportional. The law imposing restrictions will be\n               treated as proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\n               purpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a\n               purpose are rationally connected to the purpose, and such\n               measures are necessary. This essence of doctrine of\n               proportionality is beautifully captured by Dickson, C.J. of\n               Canada in R. v. Oakes [R. v. Oakes, (1986) 1 SCR 103\n               (Can SC)] , in the following words (at p. 138):\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_381\">                  ‘To establish that a limit is reasonable and\n                  demonstrably justified in a free and democratic\n                  society, two central criteria must be satisfied. First,\n                  the objective, which the measures, responsible for a\n                  limit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to\n                  serve, must be “of” sufficient importance to warrant\n                  overriding a constitutional protected right or freedom\n                  … Second … the party invoking <a href=\"/doc/473983/\" id=\"a_364\">Section 1</a> must show\n                  that the means chosen are reasonable and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 206 of 567</span>\n\f                  demonstrably justified. This involves “a form of\n                  proportionality test…” Although the nature of the\n                  proportionality test will vary depending on the\n                  circumstances, in each case courts will be required to\n                  balance the interests of society with those of\n                  individuals and groups. There are, in my view, three\n                  important components of a proportionality test. First,\n                  the measures adopted must be … rationally\n                  connected to the objective. Second, the means …\n                  should impair “as little as possible” the right or\n                  freedom in question … Third, there must be a\n                  proportionality between the effects of the measures\n                  which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or\n                  freedom, and the objective which has been identified\n                  as of “sufficient importance”. The more severe the\n                  deleterious effects of a measure, the more important\n                  the objective must be if the measure is to be\n                  reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and\n                  democratic society.’\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_498\">               64. The exercise which, therefore, is to be taken is to find\n               out as to whether the limitation of constitutional rights is for\n               a purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a\n               democratic society and such an exercise involves the\n               weighing up of competitive values, and ultimately an\n               assessment based on proportionality i.e. balancing of\n               different interests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_499\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61571\" id=\"span_290\">65. We may unhesitatingly remark that this doctrine of\n               proportionality, explained hereinabove in brief, is enshrined\n               in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_365\">Article 19</a> itself when we read clause (1) along with\n               clause (6) thereof. While defining as to what constitutes a\n               reasonable restriction, this Court in a plethora of judgments\n               has held that the expression “reasonable restriction” seeks\n               to strike a balance between the freedom guaranteed by\n               any of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_366\">Article 19</a> and the\n               social control permitted by any of the clauses (2) to (6).

Further, in order\n               to be reasonable, the restriction must have a reasonable\n               relation to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve,\n               and must not go in excess of that object (see <a href=\"/doc/61571/\" id=\"a_367\">P.P.\n               Enterprises v.

The first integrates the doctrine of\n\n       proportionality into a broader theoretical framework.                   It is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 208 of 567</span>\n\f        propounded by Robert Alexy, premised on the theory of rights as\n\n        principles and optimisation requirements52. For Alexy, all norms\n\n        are either rules or principles. Constitutional rights are principles,\n\n        which means that they must be realised to the greatest extent\n\n        factually and legally possible.                   For Alexy, the principle of\n\n        proportionality follows logically from the nature of constitutional\n\n        rights as principles. On the other hand, Mattias Kumm presented\n\n        his theory of rights adjudication as Socratic contestation, with\n\n        proportionality        principle      at   its    centre.         As     per     Kumm,\n\n        proportionality is the doctrinal tool which allows Judges to assess\n\n        the reasonableness or plausibility, of a policy and thus to\n\n        determine whether it survives Socratic contestation 53. Recently,\n\n        Kai Moller has proposed another theory, which is an autonomy-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_500\">        based theory of what he calls ‘the global model of constitutional\n\n        rights’, at the core of which lies the obligation of the State to take\n\n        the autonomy interests of every person adequately into account 54.\n\n        In this process, his understanding of autonomy leads to one\n\n        consequence, viz., there will often be conflicts of autonomy\n\n        interests, which have to be resolved in line with each agent’s\n\n\n52 Robert Alexy, A Theory of Constitutional Rights, (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002)\n53 M Kumm, ‘The Idea of Socratic Contestation and the Right to Justification: The Point and\n   Purpose of Rights-Based Proportionality Review’ (2010) 4 Law &amp; Ethics of Human Rights 141; M\n   Kumm, ‘Institutionalising Socratic Contestation: The Rationalist Human Rights Paradigm,\n   Legitimate Authority and the point of Judicial Review’ (2007) 1 European Journal of Legal\n   Studies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_501\">54 K Moller, The Global Model of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                           Page 209 of 567</span>\n\f       status as an equal.

At legitimate goal stage, question arises\n\n        as to what does it mean to speak of the goal of a policy, and what\n\n        does it mean to require a goal to be legitimate? 55 With regard to\n\n        the suitability and necessity stages, some of the open issues are\n\n        how to deal with empirical uncertainty: should this lead to wide-\n\n        ranging deference to the elected branches? 56 At the balancing\n\n        stage, we have to ask the question of what it means to say that a\n\n        right is ‘balanced’ against a competing right or public interest.\n\n        One remarkable feature of the German test is that it tends to\n\n        push most of the important issues into the last stage, viz., the\n\n        balancing stage. At the legitimate goal stage, any goal that is\n\n        legitimate will be accepted.                 At the suitability stage, even a\n\n        marginal contribution to the achievement of the goal will suffice.\n\n        At the necessity stage, it is very rare for a policy to fail because\n\n        less      restrictive      alternatives        normally        come        with      some\n\n        disadvantage and cannot, therefore, be considered equally\n\n        effective. Thus, the balancing stage dominates the legal analysis\n\n        and is usually determinative of the outcome.\n\n55 On this issue there is a detailed discussion in M Kumm, ‘Political Liberalism and the Structure of\n   Rights: On the Place and Limits of the Proportionality Requirement’ in Pavlakos (ed), Law,\n   Rights and Discourse: The Legal Philosophy of Robert Alexy (Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2007)\n   131; Moller, the Global Model of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012) ch\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_507\">   7.\n56 As a proposal of how to deal with uncertainty, see Alexy’s ‘Second Law of Balancing’, which he\n   proposes in the Postscript to A Theory of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press,\n   2002).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                            Page 211 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_508\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">\f122) In contrast, Canadian Supreme Court has chartered different\n\n       course while using proportionality test. R. v. Oakes57 (popularly\n\n       known as Oakes test), has held that the objective must be ‘of\n\n       sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally\n\n       protected right or freedom’; there must be a rational connection\n\n       between measure and objective; the means must ‘impair “as little\n\n       as possible” the right or freedom in question’; and finally, ‘there\n\n       must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures\n\n       which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom,\n\n       and the objective which has been identified as of “sufficient\n\n       importance”’.          Under this test, arguably more issues are\n\n       addressed at the earlier stages.                     Instead of accepting any\n\n       legitimate goal, Oakes requires a goal ‘of sufficient importance to\n\n       warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom’.\n\n       And the minimal impairment test is different from the German\n\n       necessity test both in the way in which it is formulated (there is no\n\n       requirement that the less restrictive measure be equally effective)\n\n       and in the way it is applied in practice: the Canadian Supreme\n\n       Court tends to resolve cases at that stage and not, as the\n\n       German Federal Constitutional Court, at the balancing stage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_510\">123) There is a great debate as to which out of the aforesaid two\n57 (1986) 1 SCR 103\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_298\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 212 of 567</span>\n\f       approaches is a better approach. Some jurists are of the view\n\n       that the proper application of the German test leads to a practice\n\n       of constitutional review with two connected problems: first, as\n\n       pointed about above, usually almost all the moral work is done at\n\n       the balancing stage, arguably rendering the earlier stages largely\n\n       useless and throwing doubt on the truth of the popular argument\n\n       that proportionality is a valuable doctrine partly because it\n\n       structures the analysis of rights issues in a meaningful way.\n\n       Secondly, the balancing act at the final stage is often carried out\n\n       in an impressionistic fashion which seems to be largely unguided\n\n       by principle and thus opens the door for subjective, arbitrary and\n\n       unpredictable judgments encroaching on what ought to be the\n\n       proper domain of the democratic legislature.                    These concerns\n\n       can, however, be addressed. According to Bilchitz 58, first concern\n\n       can be addressed by focusing on the necessity stage of the test.\n\n       He takes issue with both the German test – according to which\n\n       almost all policies are necessary because any alternative policy\n\n       will usually have some disadvantage which means that it cannot\n\n       be considered equally effective – and the Canadian minimal\n\n       impairment test – which, taken seriously, narrows down the range\n\n       of constitutionally acceptable policies far too much: ‘minimal\n\n58 ‘Necessity and Proportionality: Towards A Balanced Approach?’, Hart Publishing, Oxford and\n   Portland, Oregon, 2016.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                     Page 213 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_511\">\n\f        impairment’ can be read as insisting that only one measure could\n\n        pass constitutional scrutiny, namely the measure which impairs\n\n        the right least.59         So the alternatives seem to be either to\n\n        construct the necessity (minimal impairment) test as filtering out\n\n        almost nothing or to allow only one policy, thus rendering the\n\n        elected branches partly superfluous.                   In order to preserve a\n\n        meaningful but not unduly strict role for the necessity stage,\n\n        Bilchitz proposes the following inquiry. First, a range of possible\n\n        alternatives to the measure employed by the Government must\n\n        be identified.       Secondly, the effectiveness of these measures\n\n        must be determined individually; the test here is not whether each\n\n        respective measure realises the governmental objective to the\n\n        same extent, but rather whether it realises it in a ‘real and\n\n        substantial manner’.             Thirdly, the impact of the respective\n\n        measures on the right at stake must be determined. Finally, an\n\n        overall judgment must be made as to whether in light of the\n\n        findings of the previous steps, there exists an alternative which is\n\n        preferable; and this judgment will go beyond the strict means-\n\n        ends assessment favoured by Grimm and the German version of\n\n        the proportionality test; it will also require a form of balancing to\n\n\n59 On the various problems which the Canadian Supreme Court created for itself because of its\n   early unfortunate statements on proportionality see S Choudhry, ‘So What Is the Real Legacy of\n   Oakes? Two Decades of Proportionality Analysis under the Canadian Charter’s <a href=\"/doc/473983/\" id=\"a_371\">Section 1</a>’ (2006)\n   34 Supreme Court Law Review 501.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                         Page 214 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_512\">\n\f       be carried out at the necessity stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_513\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_514\">124) Insofar as second problem in German test is concerned, it can be\n\n       taken care of by avoiding ‘ad-hoc balancing’ and instead\n\n       proceeding on some ‘bright-line rules’ i.e. by doing the act of\n\n       balancing on the basis of some established rule or by creating a\n\n       sound rule. We may point out that whereas Chandrachud, J. has\n\n       formulated the test of ‘legitimate state interest’, other two of the\n\n       Judges, namely, Chelameswar and Sapre, JJ. have used the test\n\n       of ‘compelling state interest’ and not ‘legitimate state interest’.\n\n       On the other hand, S.K. Kaul, J. has held that the test to be\n\n       applied is whether the law satisfies ‘public interest’. Nariman, J.,\n\n       on the other hand, pointed out that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_372\">Right to Information Act,\n\n       2005</a> has provided for personal information being disclosed to\n\n       third parties subject to ‘larger public interest’ being satisfied. If\n\n       this test is applied, the result is that one would be entitled to\n\n       invoke ‘large public interest’ in lieu of ‘legitimate state aim’ or\n\n       ‘legitimate state interest’, as a permissible restriction on a claim to\n\n       privacy of an individual – a more lenient test. However, since\n\n       judgment of Chandrachud, J. is on behalf of himself and three\n\n       other Judges and S.K. Kaul, J. has also virtually adopted the\n\n       same test, we can safely adopt the test of ‘legitimate state\n\n       interest’ as the majority opinion, instead of applying the test of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_301\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 215 of 567</span>\n\f       ‘compelling state interest’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_515\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_516\">125) In Modern Dental College &amp; Research Centre, four sub\n\n       components or proportionality which need to be satisfied were\n\n       taken note of.

Of course, while undertaking this exercise it has also\n\n       to be seen that the legitimate goal must be of sufficient\n\n       importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right\n\n       or freedom and also that such a right impairs freedom as little as\n\n       possible.

However, especially where a power vested in\n               the executive is exercised in secret, the risks of\n               arbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have\n               clear, detailed rules on interception of telephone\n               conversations, especially as the technology available for\n               use is continually becoming more sophisticated.

Consequently, the law must indicate the\n               scope of any such discretion conferred on the competent\n               authorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient\n               clarity to give the individual adequate protection against\n               arbitrary interference.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_443\">140) The Court observed that the following minimum safeguards that\n\n       should be set out in law in order to avoid abuses of power for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 228 of 567</span>\n\f       surveillance are: the nature of offences which may give rise to an\n\n       interception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to\n\n       have their telephones tapped; a limit on the duration of telephone\n\n       tapping; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and\n\n       storing the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when\n\n       communicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances\n\n       in which recordings may or must be erased or destroyed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_444\">141) For establishing if the measures were “necessary in a democratic\n\n       society” in pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_445\">               “When balancing the interest of the respondent State in\n               protecting its national security through secret surveillance\n               measures against the seriousness of the interference with\n               an applicant’s right to respect for his or her private life, the\n               national authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation\n               in choosing the means for achieving the legitimate aim of\n               protecting national security. However, this margin is subject\n               to European supervision embracing both legislation and\n               decisions applying it.

The\n               assessment depends on all the circumstances of the case,\n               such as the nature, scope and duration of the possible\n               measures, the grounds required for ordering them, the\n               authorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise\n               them, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law.\n               The Court has to determine whether the procedures for\n               supervising the ordering and implementation of the\n               restrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference”\n               to what is “necessary in a democratic society”.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_446\">142) Two other cases of violation of Article of the European\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 229 of 567</span>\n\f       Convention of Human Rights were cited, namely Digital Rights\n\n       Ireland Ltd. v.

The data included data necessary to\n\n       trace and identify the source of communication and its\n\n       destination, to identify the date, time duration, type of\n\n       communication, IP address, telephone number and other fields.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_528\">       The European Court of Justice (ECJ) evaluated the compatibility\n\n       of the Directive with <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_425\">Articles 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_426\">8</a> of the Charter of\n\n       Fundamental Rights of the European Union and declared the\n\n       Directive to be invalid.

The invasion of right was not\n\n       proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_530\">143) In S and Marper, the storing of DNA profiles and cellular samples\n\n       of any person arrested in the United Kingdom was challenged\n\n       before the ECtHR. Even if the individual was never charged, if\n\n       criminal proceedings were discontinued, or if the person was later\n\n       acquitted of any crime, their DNA profile could nevertheless be\n\n       kept permanently on record. It held that there had been a\n\n       violation of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_428\">Article 8</a> of the ECHR. Fingerprints, DNA profiles and\n\n       cellular samples, constituted personal data and their retention\n\n       was capable of affecting private life of an individual. Retention of\n\n       such data without consent, thus, constitutes violation of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_429\">Article 8</a>\n\n       as they relate to identified and identifiable individuals. The Court\n\n       held that invasion of privacy was not “necessary in a democratic\n\n       society as it did not fulfill any pressing social need. The blanket\n\n       and indiscriminate nature of retention of data was excessive and\n\n       did not strike a balance between private and public interest.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_531\">144) The respondents, on the other hand, rebutted the arguments of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 231 of 567</span>\n\f       the petitioners that the architecture of the Aadhaar Act enables\n\n       State surveillance. It was submitted that bare minimal information\n\n       was obtained from the individual who enrolled for Aadhaar.\n\n       Insofar as demographic information is concerned, it included\n\n       name, date of birth, address, gender, mobile number and email\n\n       address. The latter two are optional and meant for transmitting\n\n       relevant information to the AMH and for One Time Password\n\n       (OTP) based authentication. This information was in respect of\n\n       an individual and is always in public domain. Section 2(k) of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act specifically provides that regulations cannot include\n\n       race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of\n\n       entitlement, income or medical history.              Therefore, sensitive\n\n       information specifically stands excluded. This specific exclusion,\n\n       in the context, ensures that the scope of including additional\n\n       demographic information is very narrow and limited. It was also\n\n       argued that even the biometric information was limited to the\n\n       fingerprints and iris scan, which is considered to be the core\n\n       biometric information.            Such information is, again, frequently\n\n       utilised globally to ascertain the identity of a person.              The\n\n       argument was, thus, that the information gathered was non-\n\n       invasive and non-intrusive identity information.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 232 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_532\">\f145) It was also argued that the very scheme of the Aadhaar and the\n\n       manner in which it operates excludes every possibility of data\n\n       profiling and, therefore, the question of State surveillance would\n\n       not arise. The powerpoint presentation which was given by Dr.\n\n       Pandey, as has been stated above, was referred to, on the basis\n\n       of which it was argued that the Aadhaar design takes full care of\n\n       security of persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_533\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_534\">146) It was also argued by the respondents that identity information\n\n       data resides in the CIDR which is not in the control of the\n\n       Government or the police force. The Authority is a body\n\n       constituted as a body corporate having perpetual succession and\n\n       a common seal. It is regulated by substantive and procedural\n\n       checks to protect the identity information and authentication\n\n       record. This information cannot be published, displayed or posted\n\n       publicly. It does not have the authority to carry out surveillance.\n\n       The State Governments and the police forces cannot obtain the\n\n       information contained in the CIDR or the authentication records\n\n       except in two situations contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/993519/\" id=\"a_430\">Section 33</a> – (i) When\n\n       the District Judge orders so after giving an opportunity of hearing\n\n       to the authority (even in this situation core biometric information\n\n       will not be shared; and (ii) in the interest of National Security\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 233 of 567</span>\n\f       where a Joint Secretary or a superior officer of the Government of\n\n       India specially authorizes in this behalf, and in this case every\n\n       direction is reviewed by an oversight committee chaired by the\n\n       Cabinet Secretary. Further, this direction is limited for three\n\n       months and extendable by a further period of 3 months.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_535\">147) It was submitted that surveillance, if at all, can only be carried out\n\n       by unauthorised use of CIDR information, despite its statutory\n\n       prohibition and punitive injunctions or by other means such as\n\n       physical surveillance. That is, however, an illegal surveillance.\n\n       The architecture of the Act does not allow surveillance. It was\n\n       submitted that the petitioners have not made out a case of\n\n       surveillance by the Authority but points out a mere possibility of\n\n       surveillance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_536\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_537\">148) We may reiterate that the argument of surveillance also has the\n\n       reflections of privacy and in fact the argument is structured on the\n\n       basis that the vital information which would be available with the\n\n       Government can be utilised to create the profiling of individuals\n\n       and retention of such information in the hands of the respondents\n\n       is a risky affair which may enable the State to do the surveillance\n\n       of any individual it wants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_538\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_539\">149) Insofar as the aspect of privacy of individual is concerned, that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 234 of 567</span>\n\f       would be dealt with in detail while addressing that issue.         To\n\n       segregate issue of surveillance from privacy, we are focusing the\n\n       discussion to the aspect whether there is sufficient data available\n\n       with the respondents which may facilitate the profiling and misuse\n\n       thereof or whether there are sufficient safeguards to ward off the\n\n       same.       In the process, we would be discussing the issues\n\n       pertaining to data protection as well. At the same time, there\n\n       would be some overlapping of discussion inasmuch as it will have\n\n       to be seen as to the collection, storage and use of biometric data\n\n       satisfies the proportionality principle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_540\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_541\">150) It is clear that the argument of the petitioners is that on the basis\n\n       of the data available with the Authority, there can be a profiling of\n\n       an individual which may make the surveillance state. And such a\n\n       mass surveillance is not permitted by the Constitution of India.\n\n       The entire foofaraw about the Aadhaar architecture is the so-\n\n       called enormous information that would be available to the\n\n       Government on using Aadhaar card by residents. Two issues\n\n       arise from the respective arguments of the parties:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_447\">       (a)     whether the architecture of the Aadhaar project enables the\n\n       Sate to create a regime of surveillance?; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_448\">       (b)     whether there are adequate provisions for data protection?\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 235 of 567</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_449\">\f151) Insofar as issue (a) above is concerned, after going through the\n\n       various aspects of the Aadhaar project, the provisions of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act and the manner in which it operates, it is difficult to\n\n       accept the argument of the petitioners. The respondents have\n\n       explained that the enrolment and authentication processes are\n\n       strongly regulated so that data is secure. The enrolment agency,\n\n       which collects the biometric and demographic of the individuals\n\n       during enrolment, is appointed either by UIDAI or by a Registrar\n\n       [<a href=\"/doc/629401/\" id=\"a_431\">Section 2(s)</a>].

Categories of\n\n       persons eligible for appointment are limited by the Regulations.\n\n       The agency employs a certified supervisor, an operator and a\n\n       verifier under Enrolment and Update Regulations. Registrars and\n\n       the enrolling agencies are obliged to use the software provided or\n\n       authorized by UIDAI for enrolment purpose. The standard\n\n       software has security features as specified by the Authority. All\n\n       equipment used is as per the specification issued by the\n\n       Authority. The          Registrars       are prohibited   from    using    the\n\n       information collected for any purpose other than uploading the\n\n       information to CIDR.

The Code of Conduct contains specific directions for\n\n       following the confidentiality, privacy and security protocols and\n\n       submission of periodic reports of enrolment. Not only there are\n\n       directions prohibiting manipulation and fraudulent practices but\n\n       the Act contains penal provisions for such violations in Chapter\n\n       VII of the Regulations.

The Authority does not\n\n       collect purpose, location or details of transaction.        Thus, it is\n\n       purpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains\n\n       in silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is\n\n       provided answer only in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ about the authentication of\n\n       the person concerned.                The authentication process is not\n\n       exposed to the Internet world. Security measures, as per the\n\n       provisions of Section 29(3) read with Section 38(g) as well as\n\n       Regulation 17(1)(d) of the Authentication Regulations are strictly\n\n       followed and adhered to.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_451\">       (b)     There are sufficient authentication security measures taken\n\n       as well, as demonstrated in Slides 14, 28 and 29 of the\n\n       presentation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_452\">       (c)     The Authority has sufficient defence mechanism, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 240 of 567</span>\n\f       explained in Slide 30. It has even taken appropriate protection\n\n       measures as demonstrated in Slide 31.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_453\">       (d)     There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture\n\n       Review Board (TARB) and Security Review Committee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_454\">       (e)     During authentication no information about the nature of\n\n       transaction etc. is obtained.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_455\">       (f)     The Authority has mandated use of Registered Devices\n\n       (RD) for all authentication requests. With these, biometric data is\n\n       signed within the device/RD service using the provider key to\n\n       ensure it is indeed captured live. The device provider RD service\n\n       encrypts the PID block before returning to the host application.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_544\">       This RD service encapsulates the biometric capture, signing and\n\n       encryption of biometrics all within it. Therefore, introduction of\n\n       RD in Aadhaar authentication system rules out any possibility of\n\n       use of stored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from\n\n       other source. Requesting entities are not legally allowed to store\n\n       biometrics captured for Aadhaar authentication under <a href=\"/doc/1694942/\" id=\"a_446\">Regulation\n\n       17(1)(a)</a> of the Authentication Regulations.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_545\">       (g)     The Authority gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique device\n\n       code, registered device code used for authentication.

The\n\n       Authority would only know from which device the authentication\n\n       has happened, through which AUA/ASA etc. It does not receive\n\n       any information about at what location the authentication device\n\n       is deployed, its IP address and its operator and the purpose of\n\n       authentication.        Further, the authority or any entity under its\n\n       control is statutorily barred from collecting, keeping or maintaining\n\n       any information about the purpose of authentication under\n\n       Section 32(3) of the Aadhaar Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_546\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_547\">153) After going through the Aadhaar structure, as demonstrated by\n\n       the respondents in the powerpoint presentation from the\n\n       provisions of the Aadhaar Act and the machinery which the\n\n       Authority has created for data protection, we are of the view that\n\n       it is very difficult to create profile of a person simply on the basis\n\n       of biometric and demographic information stored in CIDR. Insofar\n\n       as authentication is concerned, the respondents rightly pointed\n\n       out that there are sufficient safeguard mechanisms.                           To\n\n       recapitulate, it was specifically submitted that there were security\n\n       technologies in place (slide 28 of Dr. Pandey’s presentation), 24/7\n\n       security       monitoring,       data      leak      prevention,   vulnerability\n\n       management programme and independent audits (slide 29) as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 242 of 567</span>\n\f        well as the Authority’s defence mechanism (slide 30).                               It was\n\n        further pointed out that the Authority has taken appropriate pro-\n\n        active protection measures, which included disaster recovery\n\n        plan, data backup and availability and media response plan (slide\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_548\">        31). The respondents also pointed out that all security principles\n\n        are followed inasmuch as: (a) there is PKI-2048 encryption from\n\n        the time of capture, meaning thereby, as soon as data is given at\n\n        the time of enrolment, there is an end to end encryption thereof\n\n        and it is transmitted to the Authority in encrypted form. The said\n\n        encryption is almost foolproof and it is virtually impossible to\n\n        decipher the same; (b) adoption of best-in-class security\n\n        standards and practices; and (c) strong audit and traceability as\n\n        well as fraud detection.                Above all, there is an oversight of\n\n        Technology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and Security\n\n        Review Committee. This Board and Committee consist of very\n\n        high profiled officers. Therefore, the Act has endeavoured to\n\n        provide safeguards67.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_549\">67 We may also take on record responsible statements of the learned Attorney General and Mr.\n   Dwivedi who appeared for UIDAI that no State would be interested in any mass surveillance of\n   1.2 Billion people of the country or even the overwhelming majority of officers and employees or\n   professionals. The very idea of mass surveillance by State which pursues what an ANH does all\n   the time and based on Aadhaar is an absurdity and an impossibility. According to them, the\n   petitioners submission is based on too many imaginary possibilities, viz.:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_456\">   (i) Aadhaar makes it possible for the State to obtain identity information of all ANH. It is\n   possible that UIDAI would share identity information/authentication records in CIDR\n   notwithstanding statutory prohibition and punitive injunctions in the Act. It is possible that the\n   State would unleash its investigators to surveil a sizeable section of the ANH, if not all based on\n   the authentication records. It is submitted that given the architecture of the Aadhaar Act, there\n   are no such possibilities and in any event, submission based on imaginary possibility do not\n   provide any basis for questioning the validity of Aadhaar Act. (ii) None of the writ petitions set\n   forth specific facts and even allegations that any Aadhaar number holder is being subjected to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_332\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                             Page 243 of 567</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_457\">\f154) Issue (b) relates to data protection. According to the petitioners\n\n        there is no data protection and there is a likelihood of misuse of\n\n        data/personal information of the individuals.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_458\">155) The question to be determined is whether the safeguards\n\n        provided for the protection of personal biometric data in the\n\n        Aadhaar Act and Rules are sufficient. The crucial tasks that the\n\n        Court needs to undertake are – (i) to discuss the significance of\n\n        data in the world of technology and its impact; (ii) to determine\n\n        the magnitude of protection that should be accorded to collection,\n\n        storage and use of sensitive biometric data, so that they can\n\n        qualify as proportionate; and (iii) to determine whether the\n\n        Aadhaar Act and Rules provide such data protection, thereby\n\n        obviating any possibility of surveillance.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_459\">(i)    Significance of Data:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_460\">156) Alvin Toffler in his illuminating article titled ‘What will our future be\n\n        like?’ has presented mind boggling ideas.                        Toffler traces the\n\n        transition – from agriculture society to industry society to\n\n        knowledge based society. If we go back to the beginnings of time,\n   surveillance by UIDAI or the Union/States. The emphasis during the argument was only on the\n   possibility of surveillance based on electronic track trails and authentication records. It was\n   asserted that there are tools in the market for track back. The entire case was speculative and\n   conjectural. In Clapper, Director of National Intelligence v. Amnesty International USA, the\n   majority judgment did not approve the submissions in the context of Foreign Intelligence\n   Surveillance Act and one of the reason was that the allegations were conjectural and\n   speculative. There were no facts pleaded on the basis of which the asserted threat could be\n   fairly traced to. However, we have not deliberated on this argument.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_333\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                          Page 244 of 567</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_550\">\f       agriculture was the prime source and the entire mankind was\n\n       based on agriculture. 350 years later with the invention of steam\n\n       engines came the industrialized age and now what we are living\n\n       through is the third gigantic wave, which is way more powerful\n\n       than industrialized age. An age that is based on knowledge.\n\n       Toffler emphasises that in today’s society the only thing that leads\n\n       to creation of wealth is knowledge. Unlike the past wherein\n\n       economics was described as the science of the allocation of\n\n       scarce resources, today we are primarily dependent on\n\n       knowledge and that is not a scarce resource. Times are\n\n       changing, we can no longer trust the straight line projection. His\n\n       view is that we are going from a society which is more and more\n\n       uniform to a highly de-massified society. Knowledge is power.\n\n       We are in the era of information. Probably what Toffler is hinting\n\n       is that access to this vast reservoir of information is available in\n\n       digital world. Information is available online, at the touch of a\n\n       button.

Ok, you get that?

We are always good in agriculture\n               but now we have precision agriculture. You know what that\n               is? See that drone in the sky is connected to a big\n               database and there is sensor at the field and in the field\n               there is drip irrigation and drip fertilization and now we can\n               target with this technology the water that we give, the\n               fertilizer that we give down to the individual plant that\n               needs it.

We commend to the Union Government the need\n               to examine and put into place a robust regime for data\n               protection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful\n               and sensitive balance between individual interests and\n               legitimate concerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the\n               state would include for instance protecting national\n               security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\n               innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing\n               the dissipation of social welfare benefits.

In\n\n       the US context, there is no comprehensive data protection\n\n       regime. This is because of the federal system of American\n\n       government,            there       are       multiple        levels     of      law\n\n       enforcement―federal, state, and local. Different states have\n\n       differing standards for informational privacy. Moreover, the U.S.\n\n       has a sectoral approach to privacy, i.e. laws and regulations\n\n       related to data differ in different sectors such as health sector or\n\n       student sector. In most cases, however, the Fourth Amendment\n\n       which prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_359\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                    Page 270 of 567</span>\n\f       government has been read by courts to envisage various levels\n\n       data protection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_600\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_601\">189) At this juncture, we are not entering the debate as to whether the\n\n       jurisprudence developed in United States is to be preferred or\n\n       E.U. approach would be more suitable.                Fact remains that\n\n       importance to data protection in processing the data of the\n\n       citizens is an accepted norm.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_602\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_603\">190) Observance of this fundamental principle is necessary to prevent\n\n       a disproportionate infringement of the Fundamental Right of\n\n       Privacy of a citizen. The question which now needs to be\n\n       addressed is whether the Aadhaar Act and Rules incorporate\n\n       these principles of data protection. We have already taken note\n\n       of the provisions in the Act, which relate to data protection.\n\n       However, a detailed analysis of the provisions of the Act needs to\n\n       be undertaken for this purpose having regard to the principles\n\n       that have emerged from case law in other jurisdiction and noted\n\n       in paragraph 187 above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_604\">\nData Minimisation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_512\">191) The petitioners have argued that the Act enables data collection\n\n       indiscriminately regarding all aspects of a person (biometrics,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_360\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 271 of 567</span>\n\f       demographic details, authentication records, meta-data related to\n\n       transaction) even though such data has no nexus to the\n\n       purported object of subsidies, thus violating the principle of data\n\n       minimization. The data collected is sufficient to indicate religion,\n\n       class, social status, income, education and intimate personal\n\n       details. Under <a href=\"/doc/179995/\" id=\"a_470\">Section 32</a> of the Act, authentication records are\n\n       stored in the central database in the manner prescribed under the\n\n       Regulations. <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_471\">Regulation 26</a> of the Authentication Regulations\n\n       requires UIDAI           to store       “authentication transaction   data”\n\n       consisting of: (a) authentication request data received including\n\n       PID block; (b) authentication response data sent; (c) meta data\n\n       related to the transaction; and (d) any authentication server side\n\n       configurations as necessary. The authentication record affords\n\n       access to information that can be used and analyzed to\n\n       systematically track or profile an individual and her activities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_513\">192) As per the respondents, Aadhaar involves minimal identity\n\n       information for effective authentication. Four types of information\n\n       collected for providing Aadhaar:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_514\">       (i) Mandatory demographic information comprising name, date of\n\n       birth, address and gender [<a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_472\">Section 2(k)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/768381/\" id=\"a_473\">Regulation 4(1)</a>\n\n       of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016];\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_515\">       (ii) Optional demographic information [<a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_474\">Section 2(k)</a> read with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_361\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 272 of 567</span>\n\f       <a href=\"/doc/716328/\" id=\"a_475\">Regulation 4(2)</a> of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\n       Regulations, 2016];\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_516\">       (iii) Non-core biometric information comprising photograph;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_517\">       (iv) Core biometric information comprising finger print and iris\n\n       scan.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_518\">193) Demographic information, both mandatory and optional, and\n\n       photographs does not raise a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_476\">Article 21</a> unless under special circumstances such as\n\n       juveniles in conflict of law or a rape victim’s identity. Today, all\n\n       global ID cards contain photographs for identification alongwith\n\n       address, date of birth, gender etc. The demographic information\n\n       is readily provided by individuals globally for disclosing identity\n\n       while relating with others and while seeking benefits whether\n\n       provided by government or by private entities, be it registration for\n\n       citizenship, elections, passports, marriage or enrolment in\n\n       educational institutions. Email ids and phone numbers are also\n\n       available in public domain, For example in telephone directories.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_605\">       Aadhaar Act only uses demographic information which are not\n\n       sensitive and where no reasonable expectation of privacy exists -\n\n       name, date of birth, address, gender, mobile number and e mail\n\n       address. <a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_477\">Section 2(k)</a> specifically provides that Regulations\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 273 of 567</span>\n\f       cannot include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language,\n\n       records of entitlement, income or medical history. Thus, sensitive\n\n       information specifically stand excluded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_606\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_607\">194) We find that Section 32 (3) of the Aadhaar Act specifically\n\n       prohibits the authority from collecting, storing or maintaining,\n\n       either directly or indirectly any information about the purpose of\n\n       authentication. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_478\">Regulation 26</a> of Authentication\n\n       Regulations is also to the same effect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_608\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_609\">195) Thus, the principle of data minimization is largely followed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_610\">196) With this, we advert to some other provisions, challenge whereof\n\n       is based on threat to security of the data. These are <a href=\"/doc/126067998/\" id=\"a_479\">Section 2(c)</a>,\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/137331837/\" id=\"a_480\">Section 2(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/41060201/\" id=\"a_481\">Section 2(h)</a> read with Section 10 of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act.         <a href=\"/doc/126067998/\" id=\"a_482\">Section 2(c)</a> pertains to authentication.   It is a\n\n       process by which Aadhaar number along with demographic\n\n       information or biometric information of an individual is submitted\n\n       to the CIDR for its verification. On submission thereof, the CIDR\n\n       verifies the correctness or lack of it. CIDR is defined in <a href=\"/doc/41060201/\" id=\"a_483\">Section\n\n       2(h)</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1954990/\" id=\"a_484\">Section 10</a> lays down that the Authority may engage one or\n\n       more entities to establish or maintain the CIDR and to perform\n\n       any other functions as may be specified by regulations.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_363\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 274 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_611\">\f197) Insofar as authentication process is concerned, that has already\n\n       been taken note of above. The manner in which it is explained by\n\n       the respondent authority, that may not pose much of a problem.\n\n       As noted earlier, while seeking authentication, neither the location\n\n       of the person whoso identity is to be verified nor the purpose for\n\n       which authentication of such identity is needed, comes to the\n\n       knowledge of the Authority and, therefore, such data collected by\n\n       the Authority. Therefore, the threat to real time surveillance and\n\n       profiling may be far-fetched. The respondents have explained\n\n       that <a href=\"/doc/95109658/\" id=\"a_485\">Section 2(d)</a> defines “authentication record” to mean the\n\n       record of the time of authentication, identity of the RE and the\n\n       response provided by the authority”, <a href=\"/doc/61440400/\" id=\"a_486\">Regulation 26 (a)</a> to (d) does\n\n       not go beyond the scope of <a href=\"/doc/95109658/\" id=\"a_487\">Section 2(d)</a>. None of the four\n\n       clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_488\">Regulation 26</a> entitle the authority to store data about\n\n       the purpose for which authentication is being done. The device\n\n       can therefore only tell the authority the identity of the RE, the PID,\n\n       the time and nature of response, the code of the device and the\n\n       authentication server side configurations. Identity of the RE does\n\n       not include details of the organization which is seeking\n\n       authentication as an RE provides authentication service to large\n\n       number of government organizations who have agreements with\n\n       it. Such a mechanism preventing the authority from tracking the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_364\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 275 of 567</span>\n\f       nature of activity for which the authentication was required. To\n\n       illustrate nic.in is an RE which provides authentication service to\n\n       large      number       of    Government             organisations   who     have\n\n       agreements with it. The authentication record would only contain\n\n       information about the identity about the RE.                         It will give\n\n       information only about the RE (nic.in) and not about the\n\n       organisation which is requiring authentication through the RE. In\n\n       most cases the authentication is one time. Mr. Dwivedi has also\n\n       explained that yet again, there may be organisations, which have\n\n       branches in different part of India.                  Assuming Apollo Hospital\n\n       (although in fact it is not an RE) has five branches in India. If\n\n       Apollo Hospital seeks authentication as an RE, the authentication\n\n       record will merely tell the identity of Apollo Hospital and its device\n\n       code, but it will not indicate which branch of Apollo was seeking\n\n       authentication and from which part of the country.                       Further,\n\n       assuming that the Indira Gandhi International Airport is an RE\n\n       and there is requirement of authentication at the point of entry\n\n       and/or exit. All that the record will show that the ANH has entered\n\n       the airport at a particular time but it will not show by which plane\n\n       he is flying and to what destination. At the time of exit, it will only\n\n       show that the person has exited the airport at a particular time. It\n\n       will not show from which flight he has arrived and from which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_365\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                   Page 276 of 567</span>\n\f       destination and at what time he has arrived or with whom he\n\n       travelled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_612\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_613\">198) However, other apprehension of the petitioners is that storing of\n\n       data for a period of seven years as per Regulations 20 and 26/27\n\n       of the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016 is too long a\n\n       period. We may reproduce Regulations 26 and 27 of the Aadhaar\n\n       (Authentication) Regulations, 2016 hereunder:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_519\">               “26.

Insofar as first argument is concerned, there appears to\n\n       be some force in that. If authentication is the only purpose, we\n\n       fail to understand why this authentication record is needed to be\n\n       kept for a period of 2+5 years. No satisfactory explanation in this\n\n       behalf was given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_616\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_617\">200) Insofar as information regarding metadata is concerned, we may\n\n       note that the respondents distinguished between three types of\n\n       meta-data :technical, business and process metadata. Process\n\n       metadata describes the results of various operations such as logs\n\n       key data, start time, end time, CPU seconds used, disk reads,\n\n       disk writes, and rows processed. This data is valuable for\n\n       purposes of authenticating transaction, troubleshooting , security,\n\n       compliance and monitoring and improving performance. They\n\n       submit that the metadata contemplated under this Regulation is\n\n       Process metadata.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_618\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_619\">201) However, metadata is not defined in the Aadhaar Act. In common\n\n       parlance, it is understood as information about data, example\n\n       whereof was given by Mr. Sibal that the text of a message\n\n       exchanged between two persons would be the data itself.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_367\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 278 of 567</span>\n\f       However, surrounding circumstances like when the message was\n\n       sent; from whom and to whom the message was sent; and\n\n       location from which the message was sent would include meta\n\n       data. As noted above, Mr. Dwivedi had tried to explain it away by\n\n       stating that there are three types of meta data, namely, technical,\n\n       business and process meta data. According to him, meta data\n\n       under the Aadhaar Act refers to only process meta data.                      In\n\n       support, he had referred to Section 2(d) of the Aadhaar Act which\n\n       defines ‘authentication record’ to mean the record of the time of\n\n       authentication, identity of requesting entity and the response\n\n       provided by the Authority. He, thus, submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_490\">Regulation 26</a>\n\n       would not go beyond <a href=\"/doc/95109658/\" id=\"a_491\">Section 2(d)</a>.                       However, aforesaid\n\n       explanation that meta data refers to process data only does not\n\n       find specific mention. There is, thus, need to amend <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_492\">Regulation\n\n       26</a> to restrict it to process meta data, and to exclude other type of\n\n       meta data specifically.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_620\">\nPurpose Limitation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_526\">202) As per the petitioners, there is no purpose limitation.

Moreover, under <a href=\"/doc/174899/\" id=\"a_495\">Section 57</a>, the State, a body\n\n       corporate or any person can avail authentication facility and\n\n       access information under CIDR. This creates an open ended and\n\n       unspecified set of laws and contracts for which Aadhaar can be\n\n       used and defeats the principle of informed consent at the time of\n\n       enrolment and purpose limitation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_527\">203) Respondents controvert the aforesaid submission by arguing that\n\n       there is purpose limitation under the Aadhaar Act as purpose of\n\n       use of biometric data in the CIDR is limited to authentication for\n\n       identification. The Aadhaar holder is made aware of such use of\n\n       the Aadhaar card at the time of enrolment. The enrolling agency\n\n       is obliged under the Enrolment Regulations to inform the\n\n       individual about the manner in which the information shall be\n\n       used, the nature of recipients with whom the information is to be\n\n       shared during authentication; and the existence of a right to\n\n       access information, the procedure for making request for such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_369\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                  Page 280 of 567</span>\n\f       access and details of the person/ department to whom request\n\n       can be made.

In that case, the Court\n\n       noted the safety and security risk in the setting up of the nuclear\n\n       power plant in the backdrop of Fukushima disaster and Bhopal\n\n       Gas tragedy. Yet, keeping in view the importance of generation\n\n       of nuclear energy, the Court observed that a balance should be\n\n       struck between production of nuclear energy which was of\n\n       extreme importance for the economic growth, alleviation of\n\n       poverty, generation of employment, and the smaller violation to\n\n78 (2013) 6 SCC 620\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_384\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 294 of 567</span>\n\f       right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_541\">Article 21.</a> It took note of the opinion of experts\n\n       committee and observed that ‘adequate safety measure’ have\n\n       been taken. It noted huge expenditure of money running into\n\n       crores and observed ‘apprehension however legitimate it may be,\n\n       cannot override the justification of the project. Nobody on this\n\n       earth can predict what would happen in future and to a larger\n\n       extent we have to leave it to the destiny. But once the justification\n\n       test is satisfied, the apprehension test is bound to fail.\n\n       Apprehension is something we anticipate with anxiety or fear, a\n\n       fearful anticipation, which may vary from person to person’. The\n\n       Court also held that ‘nuclear power plant is being established not\n\n       to negate right to life but to protect the right to life guaranteed\n\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_542\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. No doubt, the Court took a\n\n       view that this interest of people needed to be respected for their\n\n       human dignity which was divinity. However, it was also stressed\n\n       that generation of nuclear energy was a nuclear necessity and\n\n       the project was for larger public benefit and consequently,\n\n       individual interest or smaller public interest must yield. In such a\n\n       situation, necessity for ‘adequate care, caution, and monitoring at\n\n       every stage’ and ‘constant vigil’ was emphasised.

In the directions of the Court, it was observed\n\n       that ‘maintaining safety is an ongoing process not only at the\n\n       design level but also during the operation’. In the present case\n\n       as well, we have come to the conclusion that Aadhaar Act is a\n\n       beneficial legislation which is aimed at empowering millions of\n\n       people in this country. The justification of this project has been\n\n       taken note of in detail, which the subsequent discussion shall\n\n       also demonstrate. In such a scenario only on apprehension, the\n\n       project cannot be shelved.

The Committee\n\n        recently released its report and the first draft of the Personal Data\n\n        Protection Bill, 2018 which comprehensively addresses the\n\n        processing of personal data where such data has been collected,\n\n79 “Report of the Group of Experts on Privacy” (16 October, 2012), Government of India, available\n   at http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_387\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                         Page 297 of 567</span>\n\f       disclosed, shared or otherwise processed within the territory of\n\n       India. The bill has incorporated provisions and principles from the\n\n       Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (EUGDPR).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_667\">224) The Draft Bill replaces the traditional concepts of data controller\n\n       i.e. the entity which processes data and data subject i.e. the\n\n       natural person whose data is being collected, with data ‘fiduciary’\n\n       and data ‘principal’. It aims to create a trust-based relationship\n\n       between the two.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_668\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_669\">225) The Bill largely incorporates data protection principles from the\n\n       EUGDPR and EU data protection jurisprudence, including fair\n\n       and reasonable processing of data, purpose limitation, collection\n\n       limitation, lawful processing, storage limitation, data quality and\n\n       accountability. The Draft bill and the report cull out rights and\n\n       obligations of the data fiduciary and data controller respectively.\n\n       These rights include the right to access and correction, the right\n\n       to data portability and right to be forgotten – a right to prevent or\n\n       restrict disclosure of personal data by a fiduciary. Most\n\n       importantly, consent has been given a crucial status in the draft\n\n       data protection law. Thus, a primary basis for processing of\n\n       personal data must be individual consent. This consent is\n\n       required to be free, informed, specific, clear and, in an important\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_388\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 298 of 567</span>\n\f       addition, capable of being withdrawn. The Authority under the Bill\n\n       is obligated and empowered to ensure protection of data from\n\n       misuse and compromise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_670\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_671\">226) Processing of biometric data, classified as ‘Sensitive Personal\n\n       Data’ (SPD),          by the data fiduciary mandates additional\n\n       safeguards (mentioned under Chapter IV of the Bill). For\n\n       example, the data fiduciary is required to undertake Data\n\n       Protection Impact Assessment under the provisions of the Bill.\n\n       The Draft Bill allows processing of biometric data for the exercise\n\n       of any function of the State authorised by law for the provision of\n\n       any service or benefit to the data principal. Special provisions to\n\n       protect sensitive and personal data of children also exist. For\n\n       example, Data fiduciaries shall be barred from profiling, tracking,\n\n       or behavioural monitoring of, or targeted advertising directed at,\n\n       children and undertaking any other processing of personal data\n\n       that can cause significant harm to the child.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_672\">227) For security of data and protection of breach, the Draft Bill has\n\n       separate provisions which require use of methods such as de-\n\n       identification and encryption and other steps necessary to protect\n\n       the integrity of personal data and to prevent misuse, unauthorised\n\n       access to, modification, disclosure or destruction of personal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_389\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 299 of 567</span>\n\f       data. The data fiduciary is required to immediately notify the\n\n       Authority of any personal data breach relating to any personal\n\n       data processed by the data fiduciary where such breach is likely\n\n       to cause harm to any data principal. It also incorporates a\n\n       provision for Grievance Redressal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_673\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_674\">228) The Draft Bill creates several exceptions and exemptions for\n\n       processing data by the State. These are situations where rights\n\n       and obligations of data principals and data fiduciaries may not\n\n       apply in totality. Such situations include national security,\n\n       prevention       of    crime,     allocation         of   resources   for   human\n\n       development, protection of revenue, etc. The committee asserts\n\n       that such exceptions have been envisaged in the Puttaswamy\n\n       judgement as legitimate interests of the state and satisfy the\n\n       proportionality test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_675\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_676\">229) The Srikrishna Committee Report and the Draft Data Protection\n\n       Bill are the first articulation of a data protection law in our country.\n\n       They have incorporated many of the progressive data protection\n\n       principles inspired by the EUGDPR. There may be indeed be\n\n       scope for further fine tuning of this law through a consultative\n\n       process, however, we are not far away from a comprehensive\n\n       data protection regime which entrenches informational and data\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_390\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                    Page 300 of 567</span>\n\f       privacy within our laws and legal system.

Puttaswamy has\n\n       affirmed the following –\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_543\">       (i)     privacy has always been a natural right, and the correct\n\n       position has been established by a number of judgments starting\n\n       from Gobind.           Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the\n\n       individual to exercise control over his or her personality. Equally,\n\n       privacy is the necessary condition precedent to the enjoyment of\n\n       any of the guarantees in Part III. The fundamental right to privacy\n\n       would cover at least three aspects—(i) intrusion with an\n\n       individual’s physical body, (ii) informational privacy and (iii)\n\n       privacy of choice. Further, one aspect of privacy is the right to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_393\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 302 of 567</span>\n\f       control the dissemination of personal information. Every individual\n\n       should have a right to be able to control exercise over his/her own\n\n       life and image as portrayed in the world and to control\n\n       commercial use of his/her identity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_544\">       (ii)    The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional relationship with\n\n       dignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can lead a life of\n\n       dignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality\n\n       from unwanted intrusions. While the legitimate expectation of\n\n       privacy may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and from\n\n       the private to the public arena, it is important to underscore that\n\n       privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is\n\n       in a public place. Privacy is a postulate of dignity itself. Privacy\n\n       concerns arise when the State seeks to intrude into the body and\n\n       the mind of the citizen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_545\">       (iii)   Privacy as intrinsic to freedom, liberty and dignity. The right\n\n       to privacy is inherent to the liberties guaranteed by Part-III of the\n\n       Constitution and privacy is an element of human dignity. The\n\n       fundamental right to privacy derives from Part-III of the\n\n       Constitution and recognition of this right does not require a\n\n       constitutional amendment.

In a digital society an individual has the right to\n\n       protect herself by controlling the dissemination of such personal\n\n       information. Compelling an individual to establish her identity by\n\n       planting her biometric at multiple points of service violates privacy\n\n       involving the person. The seeding of Aadhaar in distinct data\n\n       bases enables the content of information about an individual that\n\n       is stored in different silos to be aggregated.

Even\n\n       where a person is availing of a subsidy, benefit or service from\n\n       the State under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_547\">Section 7</a> of the Act, mandatory authentication\n\n       through the Aadhaar platform (without an option to the citizen to\n\n       use an alternative mode of identification) violates the right to\n\n       informational privacy.

The most important assets for these\n\n       network orchestrators is information. Although, individuals share\n\n       information with these entities, such information is scattered, not\n\n       concentrated in a single authority or aggregated.

Given         that     the\n\n       probability of biometric mismatch is greatest for the aged,\n\n       disabled,       and    individuals        engaging         in    manual       labour     –\n\n       amongst         the    most        vulnerable        sections          of   society–the\n\n       decision to use periodic biometric authentications has a\n\n       direct and disparate effect of violating fundamental rights of\n\n       this class. This division bears no rational nexus with the\n\n       question of status for receiving benefits. It leads to under-\n\n       inclusion, and         is    thus     arbitrary,      causing an            <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_561\">Article    14</a>\n\n       violation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_699\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_700\">246) It is also argued that mandatory nature of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_562\">Section 7</a> violates\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_563\">Article 21</a> as well.

Such a test violates the separation of powers\n\n       between the legislature and the judiciary. Even assuming that the\n\n       ‘least intrusive method’ test applies, the exercise of determining\n\n       the least intrusive method of identification is a technical exercise\n\n       and cannot be undertaken in the court of law. Moreover, the\n\n       Petitioners, who have furnished smartcards as an alternative,\n\n       have not established that smartcards are less intrusive than the\n\n       Aadhaar card authentication process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_721\">               The argument of applying the ‘Strict Scrutiny Test’ to test\n\n       the Constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act by the Petitioners was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 321 of 567</span>\n\f       flawed. Strict scrutiny test is a test conceptualised in the United\n\n       States, only applied to ‘super suspect legislations’. This\n\n       compulsion arises because the scope of reasonable restrictions\n\n       not having been specified specifically in the U.S. Constitution.\n\n       That leaves the scrutiny of the Legislations by the courts based\n\n       on the due process clause in the U.S. Constitution. Such a test\n\n       does not have applicability in India. In Ashoka Kumar Thakur\n\n       (2008) 6 SCC 1, the court referred to the test of strict scrutiny,\n\n       narrow tailoring and compelling interest and observed that these\n\n       principles cannot be applied directly to India as affirmative action\n\n       is Constitutionally supported.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_722\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_723\">       (iii)   Act satisfies Proportionality Test\n\n               Ld.

It involves a balancing of two Fundamental Rights: the\n\n       Right to Privacy and the positive obligation of the State to ensure\n\n       right to food, shelter and employment under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_582\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n       Constitution. Aadhaar enables furtherance of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_583\">Article 21</a> by\n\n       eliminating leakages and ensuring that no deserving individual is\n\n       denied her/his entitlement. The                object   of   the Act    i.e.   the\n\n       efficient,     transparent        and      targeted delivery     of subsidies,\n\n       benefits and          services       to    genuine      beneficiaries     is   in,\n\n       furtherance of various facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_584\">Article 21</a> of the poor people\n\n       of India and in furtherance of the Directive Principles of\n\n       State Policy inter alia Articles 38,39, 41, 43, 47 and 48.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_732\">254) It was further argued that <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_585\">Section 7</a> is not a restriction at all and it\n\n       does not require any surrender of Fundamental Rights.

Aadhaar is used as\n\n       means of authentication for availing services, benefits and\n\n       subsidies. Welfare schemes funded from the consolidated fund of\n\n       India such as PDS, scholarship, mid day meals, LPG subsidies,\n\n       free education ensure that the Right to Life and Dignity of citizens\n\n       are being enforced, which includes Justice (Social, Political and\n\n       Economic). It also eliminates inequality with a view to ameliorate\n\n       the poor, Dalits and other downtrodden classes and sections of\n\n       the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_735\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_736\">256) In response to the argument that Fundamental Right to Privacy\n\n       cannot be waived, the Mr.Dwivedi submits that Section 7 of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act does not involve any issue of waiver. When an\n\n       individual undergoes any authentication to establish his identity to\n\n       receive benefits, services or subsidy, he does so to enliven his\n\n       Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_590\">Article 21.</a>\n\n       When an individual makes a choice to enter into a relational\n\n       sphere then his choice as to mode of identification would\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_424\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 327 of 567</span>\n\f       automatically get restricted on account of the autonomy of the\n\n       individuals or institution with whom he wishes to relate. This is\n\n       more so where the individual seeks employment, service ,\n\n       subsidy or benefits. Moreover, Aadhaar is of a Universal nature,\n\n       unlike any other identification card which are not portable. They\n\n       generally have a localized value and limited purpose.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_737\">257) In response to the arguments of the petitioners that Aadhaar\n\n       reduces individuals to numbers, it was submitted that the\n\n       Aadhaar number is absolutely necessary for authentication and it\n\n       is solely used for that purpose. It was argued that the petitioner\n\n       have conflated the concepts of identity and identification.\n\n       Authentication is merely an identification process and does not\n\n       alter the identity of an individual. Further Aadhaar number is a\n\n       randomly generated number and bears no relation to the\n\n       attributes of individuals. It is similar to an examiner allotting codes\n\n       to examinees for administrative convenience.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_738\">258) It was also argued that the State has an obligation to enlivening\n\n       right to food, right to shelter etc envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_591\">Article 21</a> and\n\n       for this purpose they may encroach upon the right of privacy of\n\n       the beneficiaries. The state requires to strike a fair balance\n\n       between the right of privacy and right to life of beneficiaries. An\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_425\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 328 of 567</span>\n\f       example furnished by the counsel for this is the Prohibition Of\n\n       Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act,\n\n       2013, which restricts a scavenger’s right to practice any\n\n       profession, occupation, trade or business under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_592\">Article 19(g)</a> is\n\n       order to enliven <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_593\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_594\">17.</a> The counsel also gave the\n\n       example of the practice of dwarftossing, which was banned in\n\n       France. The law was challenged on ground that it interferes with\n\n       the economic right of one practicing it. The challenge was\n\n       negatived on the ground that permitting such a practice even\n\n       though voluntary will be degrading of human dignity by Human\n\n       Right Committee. Certain choices are restricted /prohibited by the\n\n       Constitution itself (Articles 17,18, 23 and 24). <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_595\">Article 23</a> abolishes\n\n       forced labour so it prohibits even those choosing to indulge in\n\n       forced labour from doing so. The aforesaid actually result in\n\n       enhancement of the Fundamental Right. The person is\n\n       emancipated from a social condition which is below human\n\n       dignity. Similarly <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_596\">Section 7</a> of the Act involves an identification for\n\n       the purpose of enhancing human dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_739\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_740\">259) In response to the argument of Aadhaar causing exclusion, the\n\n       learned      Attorney       General       responded   by   saying   that    if\n\n       authentication fails, despite more than one attempt, then the\n\n       possession of Aadhaar number can be proved otherwise i.e. by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_426\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 329 of 567</span>\n\f       producing the Aadhaar card. And those who do not have Aadhaar\n\n       number can make an application for enrolment and produce the\n\n       enrolment id number).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_741\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_742\">260) Before we proceed to analyse the respective submissions, it has\n\n       also to be kept in mind that all matters pertaining to an individual\n\n       do not qualify as being an inherent part of right to privacy. Only\n\n       those matters over which there would be a reasonable\n\n       expectation of privacy are protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_597\">Article 21.</a> This can be\n\n       discerned from the reading of Paras 297 to 307 of the judgment,\n\n       relevant portions whereof have already been quoted above.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_743\">261) We may also clarify that the arguments of privacy are examined\n\n       in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_598\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_599\">8</a> and the provisions related\n\n       thereto under the Aadhaar Act. Validity of the other provisions of\n\n       the Aadhaar Act, which is questioned in these proceedings, is\n\n       dealt with separately. As per Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act in case\n\n       an individual wants to avail any subsidy benefit or services, she is\n\n       required to produce the Aadhaar number and, therefore, it\n\n       virtually becomes compulsory for such a person. To that extent\n\n       the petitioners may be right in submitting that even if enrolment in\n\n       Aadhaar is voluntary, it assumes the character of compulsory\n\n       enrolment for those who want to avail the benefits under Section\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_427\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 330 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_744\">\f       7.     Likewise, authentication, as mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_600\">Section 8</a>, also\n\n       becomes imperative. The relevant question, therefore, is as to\n\n       whether invasion into this privacy meets the triple requirements or\n\n       right to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_745\">       (i)     Requirement of law : The Parliament has now passed\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_601\">Aadhaar Act, 2016</a>. Therefore, law on the subject in the form of a\n\n       statute very much governs the field and, thus, first requirement\n\n       stands satisfied. We may point out at this stage that insofar as\n\n       period from 2009 (when the Aadhaar scheme was launched with\n\n       the creation of Authority vide notification No. A-43011/02/2009-\n\n       Admin. I dated January 28, 2009 till the date Aadhaar Act came\n\n       into force i.e. March 26, 2016, it is the argument of the petitioners\n\n       that insofar as this period is concerned, it is not backed by any\n\n       law and, therefore, notification dated January 28, 2009 should be\n\n       struck down on this ground itself and all acts done including\n\n       enrolment under the Aadhaar scheme from 2009 to 2016 should\n\n       be invalidated. This aspect we propose to deal at a later stage.\n\n       At this juncture, we are looking into the vires of Aadhaar Act.

In fact, such\n               benefits are reaped primarily by rich and upper middle\n               classes, resulting into widening the gap between the rich\n               and the poor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_750\">               125.1.2.

It is not only that the income distribution has\n                  been getting more unequal in recent years (a\n                  characteristic that India shares with China), but also\n                  that the rapid rise in real wages in China from which\n                  the working classes have benefited greatly is not\n                  matched at all by India&#x27;s relatively stagnant real\n                  wages. No less importantly, the public revenue\n                  generated by rapid economic growth has not been\n                  used to expand the social and physical infrastructure\n                  in a determined and well-planned way (in this India is\n                  left far behind by China). There is also a continued\n                  lack of essential social services (from schooling and\n                  health care to the provision of safe water and\n                  drainage) for a huge part of the population. As we will\n                  presently discuss, while India has been overtaking\n                  other countries in the progress of its real income, it\n                  has been overtaken in terms of social indicators by\n                  many of these countries, even within the region of\n                  South Asia itself (we go into this question more fully in\n                  Chapter 3, ‘India in Comparative Perspective’).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_574\">                      To point to just one contrast, even though India\n                  has significantly caught up with China in terms of\n                  GDP growth, its progress has been very much slower\n                  than China&#x27;s in indicators such as longevity, literacy,\n                  child undernourishment and maternal mortality.

Even\n                  Nepal has been catching up, to the extent that it now\n                  has many social indicators similar to India&#x27;s, in spite\n                  of its per capita GDP being just about one third.\n                  Whereas twenty years ago India generally had the\n                  second best social indicators among the six South\n                  Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri\n                  Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan), it now looks second worst\n                  (ahead only of problem-ridden Pakistan). India has\n                  been climbing up the ladder of per capita income\n                  while slipping down the slope of social indicators.”\n\n               125.1.3. It is in this context that not only sustainable\n               development is needed which takes care of integrating\n               growth and development, thereby ensuring that the benefit\n               of economic growth is reaped by every citizen of this\n               country, it also becomes the duty of the Government in a\n               welfare State to come out with various welfare schemes\n               which not only take care of immediate needs of the\n               deprived class but also ensure that adequate opportunities\n               are provided to such persons to enable them to make their\n               lives better, economically as well as socially. As mentioned\n               above, various welfare schemes are, in fact, devised and\n               floated from time to time by the Government, keeping aside\n               substantial amount of money earmarked for spending on\n               socially and economically backward classes. However, for\n               various reasons including corruption, actual benefit does\n               not reach those who are supposed to receive such\n               benefits. One of the main reasons is failure to identify these\n               persons for lack of means by which identity could be\n               established of such genuine needy class. Resultantly, lots\n               of ghosts and duplicate beneficiaries are able to take\n               undue and impermissible benefits. A former Prime Minister\n               of this country [ Late Shri Rajiv Gandhi] has gone on record\n               to say that out of one rupee spent by the Government for\n               welfare of the downtrodden, only 15 paisa thereof actually\n               reaches those persons for whom it is meant. It cannot be\n               doubted that with UID/Aadhaar much of the malaise in this\n               field can be taken care of.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_751\">263) It may be highlighted at this stage that the petitioners are making\n\n       their claim on the basis of dignity as a facet of right to privacy. On\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_433\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 336 of 567</span>\n\f       the other hand, Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is aimed at offering\n\n       subsidies, benefits or services to the marginalised section of the\n\n       society for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated\n\n       from time to time. That also becomes an aspect of social justice,\n\n       which is the obligation of the State stipulated in Para IV of the\n\n       Constitution.       The rationale behind <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_602\">Section 7</a> lies in ensuring\n\n       targeted delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are\n\n       funded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In discharge of its\n\n       solemn Constitutional obligation to enliven the        Fundamental\n\n       Rights of life and personal liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_603\">Article 21</a>) to ensure Justice,\n\n       Social, Political and Economic and to eliminate inequality (Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_752\">       14) with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the Dalits, the\n\n       Central Government has launched several welfare schemes.\n\n       Some such schemes are PDS, scholarships, mid day meals, LPG\n\n       subsidies, etc. These schemes involve 3% percentage of the\n\n       GDP and involve a huge amount of public money.              Right to\n\n       receive these benefits, from the point of view of those who\n\n       deserve the same, has now attained the status of fundamental\n\n       right based on the same concept of human dignity, which the\n\n       petitioners seek to bank upon. The Constitution does not exist for\n\n       a few or minority of the people of India, but “We the people”. The\n\n       goals set out in the Preamble of the Constitution do not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_434\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 337 of 567</span>\n\f       contemplate statism and do not seek to preserve justice, liberty,\n\n       equality an fraternity for those who have the means and\n\n       opportunity to ensure the exercise of inalienable rights for\n\n       themselves. These goals are predominantly or at least equally\n\n       geared to “secure to all its citizens”, especially, to the\n\n       downtrodden, poor and exploited, justice, liberty, equality and “to\n\n       promote” fraternity assuring dignity. Interestingly, the State has\n\n       come forward in recognising the rights of deprived section of the\n\n       society to receive such benefits on the premise that it is their\n\n       fundamental right to claim such benefits. It is acknowledged by\n\n       the respondents that there is a paradigm shift in addressing the\n\n       problem of security and eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.\n\n       The shift is from the welfare approach to a right based approach.\n\n       As a consequence, right of everyone to adequate food no more\n\n       remains based on Directive Principles of State Policy (Art 47),\n\n       though the said principles remain a source of inspiration. This\n\n       entitlement has turned into a Constitutional fundamental right.\n\n       This Constitutional obligation is reinforced by obligations under\n\n       International Convention. The Universal Declaration of Human\n\n       Rights (Preamble, <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_604\">Article 22</a> <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_605\">&amp; 23</a>) and International Covenant on\n\n       Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to which India is a\n\n       signatory, also casts responsibilities on all State parties to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_435\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 338 of 567</span>\n\f       recognize the right of everyone to adequate food. Eradicating\n\n       extreme poverty and hunger is one of the goals under the\n\n       Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations.                             The\n\n       Parliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/193125601/\" id=\"a_606\">National Security Food Act, 2013</a> to\n\n       address the issue of food security at the household level. The\n\n       scheme of the Act designs a targeted public distribution system\n\n       for providing food grains to those below BPL. The object is to\n\n       ensure to the people adequate food at affordable prices so that\n\n       people may live a life with dignity. The reforms contemplated\n\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1843082/\" id=\"a_607\">Section 12</a> of the Act include, application of information and\n\n       communication technology tools with end to end computerization\n\n       to ensure transparency and to prevent diversion, and leveraging\n\n       Aadhaar        for     unique      biometric         identification   of   entitled\n\n       beneficiaries.        <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_608\">The Act</a> imposes obligations on the Central\n\n       Government, State Government and local authorities vide\n\n       Chapter VIII, IX and X. <a href=\"/doc/179995/\" id=\"a_609\">Section 32</a> contemplates other welfare\n\n       schemes.

Indeed, it may be urged\n                  that the interest of the few is in fact the attainment of\n                  those rights, since in no other environment is stability\n                  to be assured.”\n\n               1478. A modern State has to usher in and deal with large\n               schemes having social and economic content. It has to\n               undertake the challenging task of what has been called\n               social engineering, the essential aim of which is the\n               eradication of the poverty, uplift of the downtrodden, the\n               raising of the standards of the vast mass of people and the\n               narrowing of the gulf between the rich and the poor. As\n               occasions arise quite often when the individual rights clash\n               with the larger interests of the society, the State acquires\n               the power to subordinate the individual rights to the larger\n               interests of society as a step towards social justice. As\n               observed by Roscoe Pound on p. 434 of Volume I of\n               Jurisprudence under the heading “Limitations on the Use of\n               Property”:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_578\">                  “Today the law is imposing social limitations —\n                  limitations regarded as involved in social life.

The\n\n       Court had passed orders enforcing the Government to take steps\n\n       to ensure the effective implementation of the Food Distribution\n\n       Schemes created by the Famine Code. Series of interim orders\n\n       were passed aimed at bringing immediate relief to the drought\n\n       affected individuals. The benefits of the schemes were converted\n\n       into legal entitlements by orders dated November 28, 2001\n\n       passed in the said case. Amongst other things, the Court ordered\n\n       government to complete the identification of people who fell into\n\n       the groups targeted for food distribution, issue cards to allow\n\n       these people to collect the grain and distribute the grain to the\n\n       relevant centres.          The order also provided for governmental\n\n       inspections to ensure fair quality grain.

It is to be kept in mind that while acknowledging\n\n       that economic considerations would play a role in determining the\n\n       full content of the right to life, the Court also held that right\n\n       included the protection of human dignity and all that is attached to\n\n       it, ‘namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition,\n\n       clothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and\n\n       expressing oneself in diverse forms’ (See <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_625\">Francis Coralie Mullin\n\n       v.

It is, thus,\n\n       of some significance to remark that it is this Court which has been\n\n       repeatedly insisting that benefits to reach the most deserving and\n\n       should not get frittered mid-way.                We are of the opinion that\n\n       purpose of Aadhaar Act, as captured in the Statement of Objects\n\n       and Reasons and sought to be implemented by Section 7 of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act, is to achieve the stated objectives. This Court is\n\n       convinced by its conscience that the Act is aimed at a proper\n\n       purpose, which is of sufficient importance.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_769\">(b)    Suitability or rationale connection stage:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_592\">277) We are also of the opinion that the measures which are\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_770\">98 (1981) 2 SCR 516\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_455\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 348 of 567</span>\n\f       enumerated and been taken as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_626\">Section 7</a>\n\n       read with Section 5 of the Aadhaar Act are rationally connected\n\n       with the fulfillment of the objectives contained in the Aadhaar Act.\n\n       It may be mentioned that the scheme for enrolling under the\n\n       Aadhaar Act and obtaining the Aadhaar number is optional and\n\n       voluntary.      It is given the nomenclature of unique identity.     A\n\n       person with Aadhaar number gets an identity. No doubt, there\n\n       are many other modes by which a person can be identified.\n\n       However, certain categories of persons, particularly those living in\n\n       abject poverty and those who are illiterate will not be in a position\n\n       to get other modes of identity like Pan Card, Passport etc. That\n\n       apart giving unique identity of each resident of the country is a\n\n       special feature of this scheme, more so, when it comes with the\n\n       feature stated above, namely, no person can have more than one\n\n       Aadhaar number; Aadhaar number given to a particular person\n\n       cannot be reassigned again to any individual even if that is\n\n       cancelled and there is hardly any possibility to have fake identity.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_771\">278) As pointed out above, enrolling for Aadhaar is not the serious\n\n       concern of the petitioners. It is only the process of authentication\n\n       and other related issues which bothers the petitioners which shall\n\n       be considered at the appropriate stage. At this point of time, we\n\n       are discussing the issue as to whether the limitation on the rights\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_456\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 349 of 567</span>\n\f       of the individuals is rationally connected to the fulfillment of the\n\n       purpose contained in the Aadhaar Act. Here, <a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_627\">Section 5</a> talks of\n\n       special measures for issuance of Aadhaar number to certain\n\n       categories of persons.            It gives identity to those persons who\n\n       otherwise may not have any such identity.                In that manner, it\n\n       recognises them as residents of this nation and in that form gives\n\n       them their ‘dignity’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_772\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_773\">279) <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_628\">Section 7</a>, which provides for necessity of authentication for\n\n       receipt of certain subsidies, benefits and services has a definite\n\n       purpose and this authentication is to achieve the objectives for\n\n       which Aadhaar Act is enacted, namely, to ensure that such\n\n       subsidies, benefits and services reach only the intended\n\n       beneficiaries. We have seen rampant corruption at various levels\n\n       in implementation of benevolent and welfare schemes meant for\n\n       different classes of persons.              It has resulted in depriving the\n\n       actual beneficiaries to receive those subsidies, benefits and\n\n       services which get frittered away though on papers, it is shown\n\n       that they are received by the persons for whom they are meant.\n\n       There have been cases of duplicate and bogus ration cards, BPL\n\n       cards, LPG connections etc.                    Some persons with multiple\n\n       identities getting those benefits manifold. Aadhaar scheme has\n\n       been successful, to a great extent, in curbing the aforesaid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_457\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 350 of 567</span>\n\f       malpractices. By providing that the benefits for various welfare\n\n       schemes shall be given to those who possess Aadhaar number\n\n       and after undergoing the authentication as provided in Section 8\n\n       of the Aadhaar Act, the purpose is to ensure that only rightful\n\n       persons receive these benefits. Non-action is not costly. It’s the\n\n       affirmative action which costs the Government. And that money\n\n       comes from exchequer.                  So, it becomes the duty of the\n\n       Government to ensure that it goes to deserving persons.\n\n       Therefore, second component also stands fulfilled.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_774\">(c)    Necessity Stage:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_775\">280) Insofar as third component is concerned, most of it stands\n\n       answered while in the discussion that has ensued in respect of\n\n       component No. 1 and 2. The manner in which malpractices have\n\n       been committed in the past leaves us to hold that apart from the\n\n       system of unique identity in Aadhaar and authentication of the\n\n       real beneficiaries, there is no alternative measure with lesser\n\n       degree of limitation which can achieve the same purpose. In fact,\n\n       on repeated query by this Court, even the petitioners could not\n\n       suggest any such method.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_776\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_777\">(d)    Balancing Stage:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_778\">281) With this, we now advert to the most important component of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_458\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 351 of 567</span>\n\f       proportionality i.e. balancing between importance of achieving the\n\n       proper purpose and the social importance of preventing the\n\n       limitation on the constitutional right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_779\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_780\">282) Argument of the petitioners is that Aadhaar project creates the\n\n       architect of surveillance state and society, which is antithetical to\n\n       the principles of democracy. It is premised on the basis that the\n\n       Aadhaar project enables the State to profile citizens, track their\n\n       movements, assess their habits and silently influence their\n\n       behaviour throughout their lives.                    It may stifle dissent and\n\n       influence political decision making.                   It is also argued that\n\n       aggregation, storage and use of such stored information is\n\n       violative of fundamental right to privacy, dignity and individual\n\n       autonomy. Informational privacy is expected as part of right to\n\n       privacy. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_629\">The Act</a> allows data aggregation as well. Such an Act is\n\n       unconstitutional as there is violation of a fundamental rights but\n\n       there is absence of procedural safeguards to protect data in the\n\n       Act. It is also argued that extent of information collected with the\n\n       use of Aadhaar, specially by the methodology of authentication, is\n\n       not proportionate to the ‘compelling interest of the State’ and\n\n       there are various other methods available for identification. It is,\n\n       thus, disproportionate and unreasonable state compulsion.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_459\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 352 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_781\">\f283) The respondents, on the other hand, have argued that there\n\n       cannot be any reasonable expectation of privacy inasmuch as the\n\n       Aadhaar Act operates in the public and relationally sphere and\n\n       not in the core, private or personal sphere of the residents.\n\n       Moreover, it involves minimal identity information for effective\n\n       authentication which stands the test of reasonableness. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_630\">The Act</a>\n\n       is, thus, least intrusive and strict scrutiny test does not apply in\n\n       the proportionality test. It is also the case of the respondents that\n\n       the Aadhaar Act does not allow aggregation at all and, therefore,\n\n       all the apprehension are ill-founded and have no basis. It is also\n\n       submitted that the Aadhaar Act is, in fact, the facilitator in\n\n       empowering various facets of right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_631\">Article 21</a> and\n\n       thereby ensures that unprivileged class is also able to live with\n\n       human dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_782\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_783\">284) Before undertaking this exercise of balancing, we would like to\n\n       point out that we are not convinced with the argument of the\n\n       respondents that there cannot be any reasonable expectation of\n\n       privacy.      No doubt, the information which is gathered by the\n\n       UIDAI (whether biometric or demographic) is parted with by the\n\n       individuals to other agencies/body corporates etc. in many other\n\n       kinds of transactions as well, as pointed out by the respondents.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_460\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 353 of 567</span>\n\f       However, the matter is to be looked into from the angle that this\n\n       information is collected and stored by the State or instrumentality\n\n       of the State. Therefore, it becomes important to find out as to\n\n       whether it meets the test of proportionality, and satisfies the\n\n       condition that the measure must not have disproportionate impact\n\n       on the right-holder (balancing stage). However, at the same time,\n\n       the fact that such information about individuals is in public domain\n\n       may become a relevant factor in undertaking the exercise of\n\n       balancing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_784\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_785\">285) We have already traced the objectives with which the Aadhaar\n\n       Act has been enacted. No doubt, there is a right to privacy, which\n\n       is now entrenched in fundamental rights. On the other hand, we\n\n       are also concerned with the rights of those persons whose dignity\n\n       is sought to be ensured by giving them the facilities which are\n\n       necessary to live as dignified life. Therefore, balancing has to be\n\n       done at two levels:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_593\">       (i)     Whether, ‘legitimate state interest’ ensures ‘reasonable\n\n       tailoring’? There is a minimal intrusion into the privacy and the\n\n       law is narrowly framed to achieve the objective. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_632\">Here the Act</a> is to\n\n       be tested on the ground that whether it is found on a balancing\n\n       test that the social or public interest and the reasonableness of\n\n       the restrictions outweigh the particular aspect of privacy, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_461\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 354 of 567</span>\n\f       claimed by the petitioners. This is the test we have applied in the\n\n       instant case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_594\">       (ii)    There needs to be balancing of two competing fundamental\n\n       rights, right to privacy on the one hand and right to food, shelter\n\n       and employment on the other hand. Axiomatically both the rights\n\n       are founded on human dignity. At the same time, in the given\n\n       context, two facets are in conflict with each other. The question\n\n       here would be, when a person seeks to get the benefits of welfare\n\n       schemes to which she is entitled to as a part of right to live life\n\n       with dignity, whether her sacrifice to the right to privacy, is so\n\n       invasive that it creates imbalance?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_595\">286) In a way, both the aforesaid questions have some overlapping\n\n       inasmuch as even while finding answer to the second question, it\n\n       will have to be determined as to whether there is a least intrusion\n\n       into the privacy of a person while ensuring that the individual gets\n\n       the benefits under the welfare schemes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_596\">287) The respondents seemed to be right when they argue that all\n\n       matters pertaining to an individual do not qualify as being an\n\n       inherent part of right to privacy.                   Only those which concern\n\n       matters over which there can be a reasonable expectation of\n\n       privacy would be protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_633\">Article 21.</a> In this behalf, we may\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_462\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 355 of 567</span>\n\f       recapitulate the discussion on some significant aspects in\n\n       Puttaswamy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_597\">                 Privacy postulates the reservation of a private space,\n\n       described as the right to be let alone. The integrity of the body\n\n       and the sanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation of the\n\n       individual’s ‘right to preserve a private space in which the human\n\n       personality can develop’ and this involves the ability to make\n\n       choices. In this sense privacy is a postulate of human dignity\n\n       itself.     The inviolable nature of the human personality is\n\n       manifested in the ability to make decisions on matters intimate to\n\n       human life. The autonomy of the individual is associated ‘over\n\n       matters which can be kept private.                   These are concerns over\n\n       which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy’. Thoughts and\n\n       behavioral patterns which are intimate to an individual are entitled\n\n       to a zone of privacy where one is free of social expectations. In\n\n       that zone of privacy an individual is not judged by others. The\n\n       judgment refers to the expert group report and identifies nine\n\n       privacy principles pertaining to notice, choice and consent,\n\n       collection limitation, purpose limitation, access and correction,\n\n       non disclosure of information, security of data, openness or\n\n       proportionality as to the scale, scope and sensitivity to the data\n\n       collected, and accountability.             At the same time, privacy is a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_463\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 356 of 567</span>\n\f       subset of liberty. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. It\n\n       lies across the spectrum of protected freedoms.             Further, the\n\n       notion of reasonable expectation of privacy has both subjective\n\n       and objective elements.              At a subjective level it means ‘an\n\n       individual desires to be left alone’. On an objective plain privacy\n\n       is defined by those Constitutional values which shape the content\n\n       of the protected zone where the individual ‘ought to be left alone’.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_598\">       Further, the notion of reasonable expectation of privacy ensures\n\n       that while on the one hand, the individual has a protected zone of\n\n       privacy, yet on the other ‘the exercise of individual choices is\n\n       subject the right of others to lead orderly lives’. The extent of the\n\n       zone of privacy would, therefore, depend upon both the\n\n       subjective expectation and the objective principle which defines a\n\n       reasonable expectation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_599\">               It is pertinent to point out that while dealing with\n\n       informational privacy, the judgment notes that privacy concerns\n\n       are seriously an issue in the age of information. It also notes the\n\n       data mining processes together with knowledge discovery, and\n\n       the age of big data. The court finds that data regulation and\n\n       individual privacy raises complex issues requiring delicate\n\n       balances to be drawn between the legitimate concerns of the\n\n       State and individual interest in the protection of privacy, and in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_464\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 357 of 567</span>\n\f       this sphere, data protection assumes significance. Data such as\n\n       medical information would be a category to which a reasonable\n\n       expectation of privacy attaches. There may be other data which\n\n       falls outside the reasonable expectation paradigm.              Data\n\n       protection regimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_600\">       This is a complex exercise involving careful balancing. In this\n\n       balancing process, following parameters are to be kept in mind:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_601\">       (i)     The judgment also holds that the legitimate expectation of\n\n       privacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private zone and\n\n       from the private to the public arenas. However, ‘the privacy is not\n\n       lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public\n\n       space’.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_602\">       (ii)    One of the chief concerns is that ‘while the web is a source\n\n       of lawful activity – both personal and commercial, concerns of\n\n       National security intervene since the seamless structure of the\n\n       web can be exploited by terrorist to wreak havoc and destruction\n\n       on civilized societies.’ Noting an article of Richard A. Posner,\n\n       which says ‘privacy is the terrorist’s best friend..’ It is observed\n\n       that this formulation indicates that State has legitimate interest\n\n       when it monitors the web to secure the Nation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_603\">       (iii)   Apart from National security, State may have justifiable\n\n       reasons for the collection and storage of data as where it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_465\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 358 of 567</span>\n\f       embarks upon programs to provide benefits to impoverished and\n\n       marginalized sections of society and for ensuring that scarce\n\n       public resources are not dissipated and diverted to non-eligible\n\n       recipients.      Digital platforms are a vital tool of ensuring good\n\n       governance in a social welfare State and technology is a powerful\n\n       enabler.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_604\">288) In the first instance, therefore, it is to be seen as to whether the\n\n       petitioners claim on the information supplied while authentication\n\n       to be protected is based on reasonable expectation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_605\">289) ‘Reasonable Expectation’ involves two aspects.              First, the\n\n       individual or individuals claiming a right to privacy must establish\n\n       that their claim involves a concern about some harm likely to be\n\n       inflicted upon them on account of the alleged act. This concern\n\n       ‘should be real and not imaginary or speculative’. Secondly, ‘the\n\n       concern should not be flimsy or trivial’. It should be a reasonable\n\n       concern.        It has to be borne in mind that the concept of\n\n       ‘reasonable expectation’ has its genesis in the US case laws. UK\n\n       judgments adopted the test of reasonable expectation from the\n\n       US jurisprudence. The ECHR and ECJ judgments reveal a little\n\n       divergence with regard to right of privacy. The ECHR in general\n\n       adopts the approach that ‘a person’s reasonable expectation as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_466\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 359 of 567</span>\n\f       to privacy may be significant, although, not necessarily\n\n       conclusive factor’. This perhaps explains the apparent conflict as\n\n       regards finger prints.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_606\">290) In the leading case Katz v. US99 Reasonable Expectation was\n\n       stated to embrace two distinct questions. The first was whether\n\n       the individual, by his conduct has exhibited an actual (subjective\n\n       expectation of privacy), and the second, whether the subjective\n\n       expectation is one that the society is prepared to recognize as\n\n       reasonable. This was also followed in Smith v. Marlyand100.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_607\">291) In       the   judgment        of   Court      of Appeal    in   R.

Secondly, the claimant must enjoy on the\n\n       facts a reasonable expectation of privacy.

This information becomes essential for\n\n       authentication use in a public sphere and in relational context.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_623\">296) It may also be mentioned that with the advent of science and\n\n       technology, finger print and iris scan have been considered to be\n\n       the most accurate and non invasive mode of identifying an\n\n       individual. It is for this reason that these are taken also for driving\n\n       licenses, passports, visa as well as at the time of registration of\n\n       documents by the State. These are also used in mobile phones,\n\n       laptops, lockers etc. for private use.

However, as stated\n\n       earlier as well, the issue is not of taking the aforesaid information\n\n       for the purpose of enrolling in Aadhaar and for authentication. It\n\n       is the storage and retention of this data, whenever authentication\n\n       takes place, about which the concerns are raised by the\n\n       petitioners. The fears expressed by the petitioners are that with\n\n       the storage and retention of such data, profile of the persons can\n\n       be created which is susceptible to misuse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_795\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_796\">297) This aspect has already been dealt with earlier and apprehension\n\n       of the petitioners are taken care of. To recapitulate, at the time of\n\n       enrolment, the data collected is minimal and there is no data\n\n       collection in respect of religion, caste, tribe, language of records\n\n       of entitlement income or medical history of the applicant at the\n\n       time of Aadhaar enrolment.                Full care is taken that even the\n\n       minimal data collected at the time of enrolment does not remain\n\n       with the enrolment agency and immediately gets transmitted to\n\n       CIDR. Even at the time of authentication, the only exercise which\n\n       is undertaken by the Authority is to see that the finger prints\n\n       and/or iris scan of the concerned person sent for authentication\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_471\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 364 of 567</span>\n\f       match with the one which is in the system of Authority.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_797\">298) Let us advert to the second facet of balancing, namely, balancing\n\n       of two fundamental rights. As already pointed out above, the\n\n       Aadhaar Act truly seeks to secure to the poor and deprived\n\n       persons an opportunity to live their life and exercise their liberty.\n\n       By ensuring targeted delivery through digital identification, it not\n\n       only provides them a nationally recognized identity but also\n\n       attempts to ensure the delivery of benefits, service and subsidies\n\n       with the aid of public exchequer/Consolidated Fund of India.\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/193125601/\" id=\"a_643\">National Security Food Act, 2013</a> passed by the Parliament seeks\n\n       to address the issue of food, security at the household level.

When in the twelfth and\n               thirteenth centuries our modern conception of a right first\n               appeared, one of the earliest examples offered was the\n               right of those in dire need to receive aid from those in\n               surplus. This right was used to articulate the attractive\n               view of property prevalent in the medieval Church. God\n               has given all things to us in common, but as goods will not\n               be cared for and usefully developed unless assigned to\n               particular individuals, we creatures have instituted systems\n               of property. In these systems, however, an owner is no\n               more than a custodian. We all thus have a right, if we\n               should fall into great need, to receive necessary goods or,\n               failing that, to take them from those in surplus.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_639\">               One finds, every occasionally, what seem to be human\n               rights to welfare asserted in the Enlightenment, for\n               example, by John Locke, Tom Paine, and William Cobbett.\n               Following the Enlightenment, right to welfare have often\n               appeared in national constitutions; for example, the French\n               constitutions of the 1790s, the Prussian Civil Code (1794),\n               the Constitutions of Sweden (1809), Norway (1814), The\n               Netherlands (1814), Denmark (1849), and, skipping to the\n               twentieth century, the Soviet Union (1936)-though it is not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_477\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 369 of 567</span>\n\f               always clear that the drafters of these various documents\n               thought of these fundamental civil rights as also human\n               rights. By the end of the nineteenth century, political\n               theorists were beginning to make a case that welfare rights\n               are basic in much the sense that Civil and political rights\n               are. But it was Franklin Roosevelt who did most to bring\n               welfare rights into public life. The Atlantic Charter (1941),\n               signed by Roosevelt and Churchill but in this respect\n               primarily Roosevelt’s initiative, declared that in addition to\n               the classical civil and political freedoms here were also\n               freedoms from want and fear. In his State of the Union\n               message of 1944, Roosevelt averred :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_640\">               We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true\n               individual freedom cannot exist without economic security\n               and independence. ‘Necessitous men are not free men’…\n\n               In our day these economic truths have become accepted\n               as self evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second\n               Bill of Rights…\n               Among these are : The right to a useful and remunerative\n               job…. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food\n               and clothing and recreation…\n               The United Nations committee charged with drafting the\n               Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), chaired by\n               Eleanor Roosevelt, included most of the now standard\n               welfare rights; rights to social security, to work, to rest and\n               leisure, to medical care, to education, and ‘to enjoy the arts\n               and to share in scientific advancements and its benefits’.\n               The Universal Declaration is a good example of how\n               extensive-some would say lavish-proposed welfare rights\n               have become.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_641\">               ...If human rights are protections of a form of life that is\n               autonomous and free, they should protect life as well as\n               that form of it. But if they protect life, must they not also\n               ensure the wherewithal to keep body and soul together-\n               that is, some minimum material provision? And as mere\n               subsistence-that is, keeping body and soul together-is too\n               meager to ensure normative agency, must not human\n               rights guarantee also whatever leisure and education and\n               access to the thought of others that are also necessary to\n               being a normative agent?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_642\">               That is the heart of the case. It appeals to our picture of\n               human agency and argues that both life and certain\n               supporting goods are integral to it. Life and certain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_478\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 370 of 567</span>\n\f               supporting goods are necessary conditions of being\n               autonomous and free. Many philosophers employ this\n               necessary – condition argument to establish a human right\n               to welfare-or, at least, to establish the right’s being as basic\n               as any other rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_643\">               I too want to invoke the necessary-conditions arguments; I\n               should only want to strengthen it. It is now common to say\n               that liberty rights and welfare rights are ‘indivisible’. But\n               that, also, is too weak. It asserts that one cannot enjoy the\n               benefits of liberty rights without enjoying the benefits of\n               welfare rights, and vice versa. But something stronger still\n               may be said. There are forms of welfare that are\n               empirically necessary conditions of a person’s being\n               autonomous and free, but there are also forms that are\n               logically necessary-part of what we mean in saying that a\n               person has these rights. The value in which human rights\n               are grounded is the value attaching to normative agency.\n               The norm arising from this value, of course, prohibits\n               persons from attacking another’s autonomy and liberty.\n               But it prohibits more. The value concerned is being a\n               normative agent, a self-creator, made in god’s image….\n               The value resides not simply in one’s having the\n               undeveloped, unused capacities for autonomy and liberty\n               but also in exercising them-not just in being able to be\n               autonomous but also in actually being so. The norm\n               associated with this more complex value would address\n               other ways of failing to be an agent. It would require\n               protecting another person from losing agency, at least if\n               one can do this without great cost to oneself; it would\n               require helping to restore another’s agency if it has already\n               been lost, say through giving mobility to the crippled or\n               guidance to the blind, again with the same proviso. All of\n               this is involved simply in having a right to autonomy or to\n               liberty. Welfare claims are already part of the content of\n               these rights. What, then, should we think of the common\n               division of basic rights into ‘classical’ liberty rights and\n               welfare rights? Into which of these two classes does the\n               right to autonomy or to liberty go? Into which of the two\n               classes do the difficult, apparently borderline cases go,\n               such as rights to life, to property, to the pursuit of\n               happiness, to security of person, and to privacy? The\n               sensible response would be to drop the distinction. What is\n               more, a right to welfare is a human right.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_644\">               36.

Sometimes the lack of\n               substantive freedoms relates directly to economic poverty,\n               which robs people of the freedom to satisfy hunger, or to\n               achieve sufficient nutrition, or to obtain remedies for\n               treatable illnesses, or the opportunity to be adequately\n               clothed or sheltered, or to enjoy clean water or sanitary\n               facilities.

In the instant case, a holistic view of the matter,\n\n       having regard to the detailed discussion hereinabove, would\n\n       amply demonstrate that enrolment in Aadhaar of the unprivileged\n\n       and marginalised section of the society, in order to avail the fruits\n\n       of welfare schemes of the Government, actually amounts to\n\n       empowering these persons.                 On the one hand, it gives such\n\n       individuals their unique identity and, on the other hand, it also\n\n       enables such individuals to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of\n\n       the Government which are floated as socio-economic welfare\n\n       measures to uplift such classes.                     In that sense, the scheme\n\n       ensures dignity to such individuals. This facet of dignity cannot\n\n       be lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged. We are, by no\n\n       means, accepting that when dignity in the form of economic\n\n       welfare is given, the State is entitled to rob that person of his\n\n       liberty. That can never be allowed. We are concerned with the\n\n       balancing of the two facets of dignity.                  Here we find that the\n\n       inroads into the privacy rights where these individuals are made\n\n       to part with their biometric information, is minimal. It is coupled\n\n       with the fact that there is no data collection on the movements of\n\n       such individuals, when they avail benefits under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_658\">Section 7</a> of the\n\n       Act thereby ruling out the possibility of creating their profiles.

It\n                  therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of\n                  liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must\n                  confess that there are serious problems of defining\n                  the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\n                  autonomy must also be placed in the context of other\n                  rights and values.”\n\n                  By calling upon the contesting candidate to disclose\n                  the assets and liabilities of his/her spouse, the\n                  fundamental right to information of a voter/citizen is\n                  thereby promoted. When there is a competition\n                  between the right to privacy of an individual and the\n                  right to information of the citizens, the former right\n                  has to be subordinated to the latter right as it serves\n                  the larger public interest. The right to know about the\n                  candidate who intends to become a public figure and\n                  a representative of the people would not be effective\n                  and real if only truncated information of the assets\n                  and liabilities is given. It cannot be denied that the\n                  family relationship and social order in our country is\n                  such that the husband and wife look to the properties\n                  held by them as belonging to the family for all\n                  practical purposes, though in the eye of law the\n                  properties may distinctly belong to each of them. By\n                  and large, there exists a sort of unity of interest in the\n                  properties held by spouses. The property being kept\n                  in the name of the spouse benami is not unknown in\n                  our country. In this situation, it could be said that a\n                  countervailing or paramount interest is involved in\n                  requiring a candidate who chooses to subject\n                  himself/herself to public gaze and scrutiny to furnish\n                  the details of assets and liabilities of the spouse as\n                  well. That is one way of looking at the problem. More\n                  important, it is to be noted that Parliament itself\n                  accepted in principle that not only the assets of the\n                  elected candidates but also his or her spouse and\n                  dependent children should be disclosed to the\n                  constitutional authority and the right of privacy should\n                  not come in the way of such disclosure;...”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_489\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 379 of 567</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_666\">\f311) In Vernonia School District 47J v.

The principles as regards reasonable restriction as\n               has been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\n               restriction should not be excessive and in public interest.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_812\">               The legislation should not invade the rights and should not\n               smack of arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot\n               be determined by laying down any abstract standard or\n               general pattern. It would depend upon the nature of the\n               right which has been infringed or sought to be infringed.\n               The ultimate “impact”, that is, effect on the right has to be\n               determined. The “impact doctrine” or the principle of\n               “inevitable effect” or “inevitable consequence” stands in\n               contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a legislation or a\n               statutory provision depending upon the circumstances of\n               the case. The prevailing conditions of the time and the\n               principles of proportionality of restraint are to be kept in\n               mind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a\n               provision regard being had to the nature of the right. The\n               nature of social control which includes public interest has a\n               role. The conception of social interest has to be borne in\n               mind while considering reasonableness of the restriction\n               imposed on a right. The social interest principle would\n               include the felt needs of the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_813\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n               Balancing of fundamental rights\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_814\">               136. To appreciate what we have posed hereinabove, it is\n               necessary to dwell upon balancing the fundamental rights.\n               It has been argued by the learned counsel for the\n               petitioners that the right conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_665\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n               has to be kept at a different pedestal than the individual\n               reputation which has been recognised as an aspect of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_666\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In fact the submission is that\n               right to freedom of speech and expression which includes\n               freedom of press should be given higher status and the\n               individual&#x27;s right to have his/her reputation should yield to\n               the said right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_493\">In this regard a passage from <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_667\">Sakal Papers\n               (P) Ltd.

It cannot, like\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_494\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 381 of 567</span>\n\f                  the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the\n                  interest of the general public. If a law directly affecting\n                  it is challenged, it is no answer that the restrictions\n                  enacted by it are justifiable under clauses (3) to (6).\n                  For, the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_668\">Article 19</a> is to enumerate different\n                  freedoms separately and then to specify the extent of\n                  restrictions to which they may be subjected and the\n                  objects for securing which this could be done. A\n                  citizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the\n                  freedoms together and clause (1) does not prefer one\n                  freedom to another. That is the plain meaning of this\n                  clause. It follows from this that the State cannot make\n                  a law which directly restricts one freedom even for\n                  securing the better enjoyment of another freedom.”\n                                                       (emphasis supplied)</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_815\">               137. Having bestowed our anxious consideration on the\n               said passage, we are disposed to think that the above\n               passage is of no assistance to the petitioners, for the issue\n               herein is sustenance and balancing of the separate rights,\n               one under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_669\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the other, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_670\">Article 21.</a>\n               Hence, the concept of equipoise and counterweighing\n               fundamental rights of one with other person. It is not a case\n               of mere better enjoyment of another freedom. In Acharya\n               Maharajshri Narendra Prasadji Anandprasadji Maharaj v.\n               State of Gujarat [Acharya Maharajshri Narendra Prasadji\n               Anandprasadji Maharaj v. State of Gujarat, (1975) 1 SCC\n               11], it has been observed that a particular fundamental\n               right cannot exist in isolation in a watertight compartment.\n               One fundamental right of a person may have to coexist in\n               harmony with the exercise of another fundamental right by\n               others and also with reasonable and valid exercise of\n               power by the State in the light of the directive principles in\n               the interests of social welfare as a whole. The Court&#x27;s duty\n               is to strike a balance between competing claims of different\n               interests…\n\n                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_816\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1838704\" id=\"span_495\">194. Needless to emphasise that when a law limits a\n               constitutional right which many laws do, such limitation is\n               constitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing\n               restriction is proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\n               purpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a\n               purpose are rationally connected to the purpose, and such\n               measures are necessary. Such limitations should not be\n               arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_496\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 382 of 567</span>\n\f               in the interest of the public. Reasonableness is judged with\n               reference to the objective which the legislation seeks to\n               achieve, and must not be in excess of that objective (see\n               <a href=\"/doc/1838704/\" id=\"a_671\">P.P. Enterprises v. Union of India [P.P. Enterprises</a> v. Union\n               of India, (1982) 2 SCC 33 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 341]).</span> Further,\n               the reasonableness is examined in an objective manner\n               from the standpoint of the interest of the general public and\n               not from the point of view of the person upon whom the\n               restrictions are imposed or abstract considerations (see\n               Mohd.

It\n\n       was argued by the petitioners that the entire authentication\n\n       process is probabilistic in nature inasmuch as case of a genuine\n\n       person for authentication can result in rejection as biometric\n\n       technology does not guarantee 100% accuracy. It may happen\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_497\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 383 of 567</span>\n\f       for various reasons, namely, advance age, damage to fingerprints\n\n       due to accident, etc. Even in case of children the fingerprints\n\n       may change when they grow up. The emphasis was that there\n\n       was a possibility of failure in authentication for various reasons\n\n       and when it happens it would result in the exclusion rather than\n\n       inclusion. In such eventuality an individual would not only be\n\n       denied the benefits of welfare schemes, it may threaten his very\n\n       identity and existence as well and it would be violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_672\">Articles\n\n       14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_673\">21</a> of the Constitution. The Authority has claimed that\n\n       biometric accuracy is 99.76%. It was, however, submitted that\n\n       where more than 110 crores of persons have enrolled\n\n       themselves, even 0.232% failure would be a phenomenal figure,\n\n       which comes to 27.60 lakh people.                    Therefore, the rate of\n\n       exclusion is alarming and this would result in depriving needy\n\n       persons to enjoy their fundamental rights, which is the so-called\n\n       laudable objective trumpeted by the respondents.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_820\">       TO DICTATE FURTHER\n\n       Re. : Studies on exclusion\n\n       Re. : Finger prints of disabled, old persons etc. See other\n\n       mode of identity\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_821\">315) The aforesaid apprehensions are sought to be assuaged by the\n\n       respondents by submitting that <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_674\">Section 7</a> of the Act nowhere says\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_498\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 384 of 567</span>\n\f       that if authentication fails, the concerned person would be\n\n       deprived of subsidies, benefits or services. It is only an enabling\n\n       provision. It also provides that in case of such a failure, such an\n\n       individual would be permitted to establish her identity by any\n\n       other means so that genuine persons are not deprived of their\n\n       benefits which are mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_675\">Section 7</a> as the entire Act is to\n\n       facilitate delivery of those benefits to such persons.            Learned\n\n       Attorney General also referred to the Circular dated October 24,\n\n       2017 in this behalf which is issued by the Authority.                 That,\n\n       according to us, takes care of the problem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_822\">316) We understand and appreciate that execution of the Aadhaar\n\n       scheme, which has otherwise a laudable objective, is a ‘work in\n\n       progress’.       There have been substantial improvements in the\n\n       system over a period of time from the date of its launch. It was\n\n       stated by the learned Attorney General as well as Mr. Rakesh\n\n       Dwivedi, at the Bar, that whenever difficulties in implementation\n\n       are brought to the notice of the respondents, remedial measures\n\n       are taken with promptness.                Cases of denial of services are\n\n       specifically looked into which is very much needed in a welfare\n\n       State and there can be a genuine hope that with the fine tuning of\n\n       technology, i.e. the mode of advancement at rapid pace, such\n\n       problems and concerns shall also be completely taken care of.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_499\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 385 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_823\">\f317) In fairness to the petitioners, it is worth mentioning that they have\n\n       referred to the research carried out by some individuals and even\n\n       NGOs which have been relied upon to demonstrate that there are\n\n       number of instances leading to the exclusion i.e. the benefits are\n\n       allegedly denied on the ground of failure of authentication. The\n\n       respondents have refuted such studies. These become disputed\n\n       question of facts. It will be difficult to invalidate provisions of\n\n       Parliamentary legislations on the basis of such material, more\n\n       particularly, when their credence has not been tested.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_824\">318) That apart, there is another significant and more important aspect\n\n       which needs to be highlighted. The objective of the Act is to plug\n\n       the leakages and ensure that fruits of welfare schemes reach the\n\n       targeted population, for whom such schemes are actually meant.\n\n       This is the larger purpose, and very important public purpose,\n\n       which the Act is supposed to subserve. We have already held\n\n       that it fulfills legitimate aim and there is a rational connection\n\n       between the provisions of the Act and the goals which it seeks to\n\n       attain. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_676\">The Act</a> passes the muster of necessity stage as well\n\n       when we do not find any less restrictive measure which could be\n\n       equally effective in achieving the aim.              In a situation like this\n\n       where the Act is aimed at achieving the aforesaid public purpose,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_500\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 386 of 567</span>\n\f       striving to benefit millions of deserving people, can it be\n\n       invalidated only on the ground that there is a possibility of\n\n       exclusion of some of the seekers of these welfare schemes?\n\n       Answer has to be in the negative. We may hasten to add that by\n\n       no means, we are accepting that if such an exclusion takes place,\n\n       it is justified.        We are only highlighting the fact that the\n\n       Government seems to be sincere in its efforts to ensure that no\n\n       such exclusion takes place and in those cases where an\n\n       individual who is rightfully entitled to benefits under the scheme is\n\n       not denied such a benefit merely because of failure of\n\n       authentication. In this scenario, the entire Aadhaar project cannot\n\n       be shelved. If that is done, it would cause much more harm to the\n\n       society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_825\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_826\">319) We are also conscious of the situation where the formation of\n\n       fingerprints may undergo change for various reasons.          It may\n\n       happen in the case of a child after she grows up; it may happen\n\n       in the case of an individual who gets old; it may also happen\n\n       because of damage to the fingers as a result of accident or some\n\n       disease etc. or because of suffering of some kind of disability for\n\n       whatever reason. Even iris test can fail due to certain reasons\n\n       including blindness of a person. We again emphasise that no\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_501\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 387 of 567</span>\n\f       person rightfully entitled to the benefits shall be denied the same\n\n       on such grounds. It would be appropriate if a suitable provision\n\n       be made in the concerned regulations for establishing an identity\n\n       by alternate means, in such situations. Furthermore, if there is a\n\n       0.232% failure in authentication, it also cannot be said that all\n\n       these failures were only in those cases where authentication was\n\n       for the purpose of utilising for the benefit of the welfare schemes,\n\n       i.e. with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_677\">Section 7</a> of the Act.                     It could have\n\n       happened in other cases as well.                     Be as it may, there is yet\n\n       another angle which has to be kept in mind and cannot be\n\n       ignored.       We have already highlighted above as to how the\n\n       Aadhaar project is aimed at serving a much larger public interest.\n\n       The Authority has claimed that biometric accuracy is 99.76% and\n\n       the petitioners have also proceeded on that basis.                        In this\n\n       scenario, if the Aadhaar project is shelved, 99.76% beneficiaries\n\n       are going to suffer. Would it not lead to their exclusion? It will\n\n       amount to throwing the baby out of hot water along with the\n\n       water. In the name of 0.232% failure (which can in any case be\n\n       remedied) should be revert to the pre-Aadhaar stage with a\n\n       system       of    leakages,        pilferages        and   corruption   in   the\n\n       implementation of welfare schemes meant for marginalised\n\n       section of the society, the full fruits thereof were not reaching to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_502\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                  Page 388 of 567</span>\n\f       such people?           The Aadhaar programme was conceived and\n\n       conceptualised by Mr. Nandan Nilekani under the leadership of\n\n       then Prime Minister, a great economist himself. It went through\n\n       rigorous process of testing about its effectiveness before it is\n\n       launched. This has been stated in the beginning. The entire aim\n\n       behind launching this programme is the ‘inclusion’ of the\n\n       deserving persons who need to get such benefits. When it is\n\n       serving much larger purpose by reaching hundreds of millions of\n\n       deserving persons, it cannot be crucified on the unproven plea of\n\n       exclusion of some.             We again repeat that the Court is not\n\n       trivialising the problem of exclusion if it is there. However, what\n\n       we are emphasising is that remedy is to plug the loopholes rather\n\n       than axe a project, aimed for the welfare of large section of the\n\n       society.        Obviously, in order to address the failures of\n\n       authentication, the remedy is to adopt alternate methods for\n\n       identifying such persons, after finding the causes of failure in their\n\n       cases.        We have chosen this path which leads to better\n\n       equilibrium and have given necessary directions also in this\n\n       behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_827\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_828\">320) Another facet which needs examination at this stage is the\n\n       meaning that is to be assigned to the expression ‘benefits’\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_503\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 389 of 567</span>\n\f       occurring in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, along with ‘subsidies’\n\n       and ‘services’. It was argued that the expression ‘benefits’ is very\n\n       lose and wide and the respondents may attempt to bring within its\n\n       sweep any and every kind of governmental activity in the name of\n\n       welfare of communities, which would result in making the\n\n       requirement of Aadhaar virtually mandatory. It was pointed out\n\n       that by issuing various circulars the Government has already\n\n       brought within the sweep of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_678\">Section 7</a>, almost 139 such\n\n       subsidies, services and benefits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_829\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_830\">321) No doubt, the Government cannot take umbrage under the\n\n       aforesaid provision to enlarge the scope of subsidies, services\n\n       and benefits. ‘Benefits’ should be such which are in the nature of\n\n       welfare schemes for which resources are to be drawn from the\n\n       Consolidated Fund of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_831\">\n       Therefore actions by CBSE, NEET, JEE and UGC requirements\n\n       for scholarship shall not be covered under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_679\">Section 7</a>, unless it is\n\n       demonstrated that the expenditure is incurred from Consolidated\n\n       Fund of India. Further, the expression ‘benefit’ has to be read\n\n       ejusdem generis with the preceding word ‘subsidies’.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_832\">322) We also make it clear that a benefit which is earned by an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_504\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 390 of 567</span>\n\f       individual (e.g. pension by a government employee) cannot be\n\n       covered under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_680\">Section 7</a> of the Act, as it is the right of the\n\n       individual to receive such benefit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_833\">       At the same time, we have gone through the list of notifications\n\n       which are issued under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. We find\n\n       that most of these notifications pertain to various welfare\n\n       schemes under which benefits, subsidies or services are provided\n\n       to the intending recipients. Moreover, in order to avail the\n\n       benefits, only one time verification is required except for few\n\n       services where annual verification is needed. It is only in respect\n\n       of fertilizer subsidy where authentication is required every time\n\n       the fertilizer is disbursed. However, it is clarified that fertilizer is\n\n       also given on the basis of other documents such as Kisan Credit\n\n       Card, etc. At the same time, we hope that the respondents shall\n\n       not unduly expand the scope of ‘subsidies, services and benefits’\n\n       thereby widening the net of Aadhaar, where it is not permitted\n\n       otherwise.        Insofar as notifications relating to children are\n\n       concerned, we have already dealt with the same separately. We,\n\n       thus, conclude this aspect as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_672\">       (a)     ‘benefits’ and ‘services’ as mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_681\">Section 7</a> should be\n\n       those which have the colour of some kind of subsidies etc.,\n\n       namely,       welfare      schemes        of    the   Government   whereby\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_505\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 391 of 567</span>\n\f       Government is doling out such benefits which are targeted at a\n\n       particular deprived class.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_673\">       (b)     The expenditure thereof has to be drawn from the\n\n       Consolidated Fund of India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_674\">       (c)     On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC etc. cannot make\n\n       the requirement of Aadhaar mandatory as they are outside the\n\n       purview of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_682\">Section 7</a> and are not backed by any law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_834\">Children:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_675\">323) Though, we have upheld, in general, the validity of Section 7 of\n\n       the Aadhaar Act, one specific aspect thereof is yet to be\n\n       considered. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_683\">Section 7</a> mandates requirement of Aadhaar for the\n\n       purposes of receiving certain subsidies, benefits and services.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_835\">       Thus, any individual who wants to seek any of these subsidies,\n\n       benefits and services is compulsorily required to have an\n\n       Aadhaar number. This will include children as well. Some of the\n\n       petitioners as well as some other applicants who have intervened\n\n       in these petitions have expressed their concern about the\n\n       mandatory requirement of Aadhaar for children and subsequent\n\n       linking for realising their basic rights including education. They\n\n       have referred to various circulars and notifications issued through\n\n       various functionaries, schools, The Ministry of Human Resource\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_506\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 392 of 567</span>\n\f       Development (MHRD) which have mandated production of\n\n       Aadhaar card details for the children seeking admission to\n\n       schools and to link the Aadhaar of the students already enrolled.\n\n       We have held that Aadhaar is a voluntary scheme and, therefore,\n\n       the Aadhaar number is to be alloted to an individual on his\n\n       ‘consent’.      No doubt, for the purposes of utilising any of the\n\n       benefits under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, it becomes\n\n       necessary to have Aadhaar number. However, the question is as\n\n       to whether it can be extended to children? It is more so when\n\n       they are not under legal capacity to provide any ‘consent’ under\n\n       the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_836\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_837\">324) <a href=\"/doc/154644006/\" id=\"a_684\">Article 21A</a> of the Constitution guarantees right to education and\n\n       makes it fundamental right of the children between 6 years and\n\n       14 years of age. Such a right cannot be taken away by imposing\n\n       requirement of holding Aadhaar card, upon the children.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_838\">325) In view thereof, admission of a child in his school cannot be\n\n       covered under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act as it is neither\n\n       subsidy nor service. No doubt, the expression ‘benefit’ occurring\n\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_685\">Section 7</a> is very wide. At the same time, it has to be given\n\n       restrictive meaning and the admission of children in the schools,\n\n       when they have fundamental right to education, would not be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_507\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 393 of 567</span>\n\f       covered by <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_686\">Section 7</a>, in our considered view. The respondents\n\n       made an attempt to justify the linkage of Aadhaar with child\n\n       information and records by arguing that there have been several\n\n       instances of either impersonations at examinations or bogus\n\n       admissions which have the potential to pilfer away various\n\n       scholarship schemes which the Government provides for weaker\n\n       sections from time to time.              If this is the objective, then also\n\n       requirement of Aadhaar cannot insisted at the time of admission\n\n       but only at the stage of application for Government scholarships.\n\n       Insofar as impersonation at examination is concerned, that can\n\n       be easily checked and contained by other means with effective\n\n       checks and balances. When there are alternative means,\n\n       insistence on Aadhaar would not satisfy the test or proportionality.\n\n       This would violate the privacy right of the children importance\n\n       whereto is given by the Constitution Bench in K.S. Puttaswamy in\n\n       the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_676\">               “633. Children around the world create perpetual digital\n               footprints on social network websites on a 24/7 basis as\n               they learn their ‘ABCs’: Apple, Bluetooth, and Chat followed\n               by Download, E-Mail, Facebook, Google, Hotmail, and\n               Instagram.       They should not be subjected to the\n               consequences of their childish mistakes and naivety, their\n               entire life. Privacy of children will require special protection\n               not just in the context of the virtual world, but also the real\n               world.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_677\">326) It is also important to note herein that the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_687\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_508\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 394 of 567</span>\n\f       2015 while addressing children in need of care and protection\n\n       and children in conflict with law enunciates that the records of the\n\n       children are confidential and will not be parted with unless\n\n       requested by the Children’s Court. In contrast, the submission of\n\n       the Union justifying linking of Aadhaar with student records on\n\n       malpractice in examinations and potential bogus admissions with\n\n       no safeguards whatsoever.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_678\">327) It has to be kept in mind that when the children are incapable of\n\n       giving consent, foisting compulsion of having Aadhaar card upon\n\n       them would be totally disproportionate and would fail to meet the\n\n       proportionality test. As the law exists today, a child can hold\n\n       property, operate a bank account, be eligible to be a nominee in\n\n       an insurance policy or a bank account or have any financial\n\n       transaction only through a legal guardian who has to be a major\n\n       of sound mind. In cases where a child is in conflict with the law,\n\n       the child is given a special criminal trial under the <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_688\">Juvenile Justice\n\n       (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</a> and there is a\n\n       mandatory requirement for the records to be kept confidential and\n\n       destroyed so that the criminal record of the child is not\n\n       maintained. This is the position in law contained in <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_689\">Section 11</a> of\n\n       the Indian Contract Act, 1872, Section 45ZA of the Banking\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_509\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 395 of 567</span>\n\f        <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_690\">Regulation Act, 1949</a>, <a href=\"/doc/610691/\" id=\"a_691\">Section 39</a> of the Insurance Act, 1938,\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1742535/\" id=\"a_692\">Section 90</a> of the Indian Penal Code (which provides that consent\n\n        of the child who is under 12 years of age shall not be regarded as\n\n        consent) etc. Thus, when a child is not competent to contract;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_839\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1258611\" id=\"span_510\">not in a position to consent; barred from transferring property;\n\n        prohibited from           taking     employment;          and not        allowed to\n\n        open/operate bank accounts and, as a consequence, not in a\n\n        position to negotiate her rights, thirsting upon compulsory\n\n        requirement of holding Aadhaar would be an inviable inroad into\n\n        their fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_693\">Article 21.</a> The restriction imposed\n\n        on such a right in the form of an Aadhaar cannot be treated as\n\n        constitutionally justified. We may also mention here that State is\n\n        supposed to keep in mind the best interest of the children which\n\n        is regarded as primary consideration in our Constitution (See\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1258611/\" id=\"a_694\">R.D.

The\n\n        convention on the Rights of Child 108 reiterates that the best\n\n        interests of the child will be the basic concern of the parents or\n\n        legal guardians of the child. The Constitution affirms acting in the\n\n        best interest of the children and confers the responsibility on the\n\n        State to not only safeguard the best interests of children but also\n\n        act in furtherance of it. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\n107(2007) 15 SCC 49\n108India acceded to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1992 to reiterate its\n   commitment to the cause of the children.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_511\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                       Page 396 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_840\">\n\f       State is constitutionally bound to facilitate and enable the parents\n\n       and guardians of the children to assert their rights and act in their\n\n       best interest and this has to be done without having any\n\n       mandatory directives to it. The onus of overseeing and lawfully\n\n       safeguarding the rights and immunities, to which children are\n\n       entitled to, rests on the State and the authorities under it. Giving\n\n       proper education to children and ensuring that they become\n\n       valuable citizens of this nation subserves public interest.

Further,\n\n       the task of collection of sensitive personal biometric and\n\n       demographic data and information for the purpose of storage\n\n       cannot be given to private hands. However, having regard to the\n\n       nature of process that has been explained by the Authority, which\n\n       ensures that immediately on enrolment, the concerned data\n\n       collected by the private entity is beyond its control; it gets\n\n       encrypted; and stands transmitted to CIDR, we do not find any\n\n       basis of the apprehension expressed by the petitioners.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_884\">335) Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_757\">Section 2(v)</a> is concerned which defines resident, there\n\n       is nothing wrong with the definition.                The grievance of the\n\n       petitioners is that the Aadhaar Act creates no credible machinery\n\n       for availing a claim that a person has been residing in India for\n\n       182 days or more.                 Apprehension is expressed that this\n\n       expression may also facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants.\n\n       These aspects can be taken care of by the respondents by\n\n       providing appropriate mechanism. We direct the respondents to\n\n       do the needful in this behalf. However, that would not render the\n\n       definition unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_885\">336) <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_758\">Section 3</a>, by the very language thereof, mentions that it is an\n\n       enabling provision which ‘entitles’ every resident to obtain\n\n       Aadhaar number. Therefore, it is voluntary in nature. This is so\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_527\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 412 of 567</span>\n\f       held by Division Bench of this Court in Binoy Viswam in the\n\n       following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_719\">               “93. Before proceeding to discuss this argument, one\n               aspect of the matter needs clarification. There was a\n               debate as to whether the Aadhaar Act is voluntary or even\n               that Act makes enrolment under Aadhaar mandatory.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_720\">               94. First thing that is to be kept in mind is that the Aadhaar\n               Act is enacted to enable the Government to identify\n               individuals for delivery of benefits, subsidies and services\n               under various welfare schemes. This is so mentioned in\n               Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act which states that proof of\n               Aadhaar number is necessary for receipt of such subsidies,\n               benefits and services. At the same time, it cannot be\n               disputed that once a person enrols himself and obtains\n               Aadhaar number as mentioned in Section 3 of the Aadhaar\n               Act, such Aadhaar number can be used for many other\n               purposes. In fact, this Aadhaar number becomes the\n               Unique Identity (UID) of that person. Having said that, it is\n               clear that there is no provision in the Aadhaar Act which\n               makes enrolment compulsory. May be for the purpose of\n               obtaining benefits, proof of Aadhaar card is necessary as\n               per <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_759\">Section 7</a> of the Act. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_760\">Section 7</a> stipulates\n               that if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to enable an\n               individual, he shall be offered alternate and viable means\n               of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or\n               service. According to the petitioners, this proviso, which\n               acknowledges alternate and viable means of identification,\n               and therefore makes Aadhaar optional and voluntary and\n               the enrolment is not necessary even for the purpose of\n               receiving subsidies, benefits and services under various\n               schemes of the Government. The respondents, however,\n               interpret the proviso differently and their plea is that the\n               words “if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to an\n               individual” deal with only that situation where application\n               for Aadhaar has been made but for certain reasons\n               Aadhaar number has not been assigned as it may take\n               some time to give Aadhaar card. Therefore, this proviso is\n               only by way of an interim measure till Aadhaar number is\n               assigned, which is otherwise compulsory for obtaining\n               certain benefits as stated in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_886\">               Fact remains that as per the Government and UIDAI itself,\n               the requirement of obtaining Aadhaar number is voluntary.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_528\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 413 of 567</span>\n\f               It has been so claimed by UIDAI on its website and\n               clarification to this effect has also been issued by UIDAI.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_887\">               95. Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar is voluntary. However,\n               it is a moot question as to whether for obtaining benefits as\n               prescribed under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, it is\n               mandatory to give Aadhaar number or not is a debatable\n               issue which we are not addressing as this very issue is\n               squarely raised which is the subject-matter of other writ\n               petition filed and pending in this Court.”\n\n\n               Therefore, the apprehension of the petitioners that <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_761\">Section\n\n       3</a> is mandatory stands assuaged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_888\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_889\">337) <a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_762\">Section 5</a> is a special measure for issuance of Aadhaar number\n\n       to certain category of persons which attempts to take care of\n\n       certain disabilities with which certain individuals may be suffering.\n\n       Therefore, this provision is for the benefit of the categories of\n\n       persons mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_763\">Section 5</a>. No doubt, it mentions children\n\n       and persons with disabilities as well, that is an aspect is already\n\n       dealt with separately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_890\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_891\">338) <a href=\"/doc/191105/\" id=\"a_764\">Section 6</a> deals only with the updation of demographic and\n\n       biometric information.

Such apprehensions have already been taken care of\n\n       while discussing the issue no. 1 pertaining to surveillance.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_894\">340) We have already discussed in detail the purpose of constituting\n\n       the Authority.

We do not find that this provision\n\n       gives excessive delegation to the Authority. These aspects have\n\n       already been discussed while determining the issue pertaining to\n\n       surveillance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_897\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_898\">342) Apprehension expressed qua <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_770\">Section 29</a> are equally unfounded.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_899\">       This Section rather imposes restrictions on sharing information.\n\n       No doubt, sub-section (2) states that the identity information (and\n\n       specifically excludes core biometric information) can be shared\n\n       only in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in such a\n\n       manner as may be specified by Regulations. That would not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_530\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 415 of 567</span>\n\f       make the provision unconstitutional when it is with the consent of\n\n       the individual. In case, any regulation is made which permits\n\n       sharing       of      information       that     may   contain   undesirable\n\n       circumstance/reason for sharing information, such a regulation\n\n       can always be struck down.                     Insofar as sub-section (4) is\n\n       concerned, it is generally in favour of the residents/individuals\n\n       inasmuch as it states that information collected or created under\n\n       this Act shall not be published, displayed or posted publicly. The\n\n       is grievance, however, is that this provision enables the Authority\n\n       to publish or display etc. such an information ‘for the purposes as\n\n       may be specified by regulations’. The apprehension is that under\n\n       this provision, the Government can always make regulations\n\n       permitting         publication    of    such     information   under   certain\n\n       circumstances. At present, regulations which are in force are the\n\n       Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations, 2016. Chapter II\n\n       thereof is titled ‘restriction on sharing of identity information’.\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_771\">Regulation 3(1)</a> which falls under this chapter puts a categorical\n\n       ban on sharing of core biometric information collected by the\n\n       Authority under the Act, by mandating that it shall not be sharing\n\n       with anyone for any reason whatsoever. Sub-regulation (2) of\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_772\">Regulation 3</a> permits sharing of demographic information and\n\n       photograph of an individual collected by the Authority under the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_531\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 416 of 567</span>\n\f       Act, only with the consent of the Aadhaar number holder, that too\n\n       for authentication process in accordance with Authentication\n\n       Regulations.        As already held by us, insofar as utilisation of\n\n       subsidies,        benefits      and      services    are   concerned,      the\n\n       authentication would be needed by the provider of such services\n\n       which would be the requesting entity and this provision has\n\n       already been upheld.              Sub-regulation (3) permits sharing of\n\n       authentication records of Aadhaar number holder with him in\n\n       accordance with <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_773\">Regulation 28</a> of the Authentication Regulations.\n\n       This provision facilitates obtaining the information from the\n\n       Authority by the Aadhaar number holder herself. We are, thus, of\n\n       the opinion that <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_774\">Section 29</a> and the sharing regulations are the\n\n       provisions enacted to protect the interest of Aadhaar card holders\n\n       as they put restrictions on the sharing of information, which may\n\n       be described as provisions pertaining to data protection and\n\n       surveying legitimate state aim/interest as well. No doubt, <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_775\">Section\n\n       29</a> gives power to the delegatee to make regulations. However,\n\n       as already clarified above, as and when a regulation is made,\n\n       which impinges upon the privacy right of the Aadhaar card\n\n       holders, that can always be challenged.

Those provisions put a bar on\n\n       the disclosure of an information thereby protecting the information\n\n       available with the UIDAI in respect of any person. However, as\n\n       per sub-section (1), such information can be disclosed if there is\n\n       an order of a court which order is not inferior to that of a District\n\n       Judge.       This provision, therefore, only states that in suitable\n\n       cases, if court passes an order directing an Authority to disclose\n\n       such an information, then the Authority would be obliged to do so.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_902\">       Thus, an embargo contained in <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_787\">Sections 28</a> and <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_788\">29</a> is partially\n\n       lifted only in the eventuality on passing an order by the court not\n\n       inferior to that of District Judge.                  This itself is a reasonable\n\n       safeguard. Obviously, in any proceedings where the Court feels\n\n       such an information is necessary for the determination of\n\n       controversy that is before the Court, before passing such an\n\n       order, it would hear the concerned parties which will include the\n\n       person in respect of whom the disclosure of information is sought.\n\n       We, therefore, clarify that provisions of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1670053/\" id=\"a_789\">Section\n\n       33</a> by reading into the provisions that an individual whose\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_534\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                  Page 419 of 567</span>\n\f       information is sought to be released shall be afforded an\n\n       opportunity of hearing. There is a reasonable presumption that\n\n       the said court shall take into consideration relevant law including\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_790\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution as well as privacy rights or other\n\n       rights of that person before passing such an order. Moreover, a\n\n       person in respect of whom order is passed shall also be heard\n\n       and will have right to challenge the order in a higher forum. Not\n\n       only this, proviso to <a href=\"/doc/964140/\" id=\"a_791\">Section 33(1)</a> puts an additional safeguard by\n\n       providing that even UIDAI shall be heard before an order is\n\n       passed to this effect by the Court. In that sense, the Authority is\n\n       to act as trustee and it may object to passing of the order by the\n\n       court.     Such a happening is actually taken place.      We have\n\n       already noticed that against the order of the High Court of\n\n       Bombay in some criminal proceedings, order was passed\n\n       directing the Authority to give biometric information of a person,\n\n       the Authority had filed Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2524\n\n       of 2014 challenging the said order on the ground that giving of\n\n       such biometric information was contrary to the provisions of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act as the information was confidential.        This Court\n\n       stays the operation of the said order which depicts that there are\n\n       sufficient safeguards provided in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1670053/\" id=\"a_792\">Section 33</a>\n\n       itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_903\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_535\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 420 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_904\">\f345) Adverting to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1670053/\" id=\"a_793\">Section 33</a>, it can be seen that this\n\n       provision enables disclosure of information including identity\n\n       information records in the interest of national security.        This\n\n       provision further states that the Authority is obliged to disclose\n\n       such information in pursuance of a direction of an officer not\n\n       below the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India\n\n       specially authorised in this behalf by an order of the Central\n\n       Government. Proviso thereto sub-section (2) puts an additional\n\n       safeguard by prescribing that every direction issued under this\n\n       sub-section shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee\n\n       consisting of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the\n\n       Government of India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the\n\n       Department of Electronics and Information Technology before it\n\n       takes effect. Further, such a direction is valid only for a period of\n\n       three months from the date of its issue which can be extended by\n\n       another three months.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_905\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_906\">346) Main contention of the petitioners in challenging the provisions of\n\n       sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1670053/\" id=\"a_794\">Section 33</a> are that no definition of national\n\n       security is provided and, therefore, it is a loose ended provision\n\n       susceptible to misuse. It is also argued that there is no\n\n       independent oversight disclosure of such data on the ground of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_536\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 421 of 567</span>\n\f       security and also that the provision is unreasonable and\n\n       disproportionate and, therefore, unconstitutional.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_907\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"29985173\" id=\"span_537\">347) We may point out that this Court has held in Ex-Armymen’s\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/29985173/\" id=\"a_795\">Protection Services Private Limited v.

We would like to reproduce following\n\n       discussion therefrom:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_727\">               “16. What is in the interest of national security is not a\n               question of law. It is a matter of policy. It is not for the court\n               to decide whether something is in the interest of the State\n               or not. It should be left to the executive. To quote Lord\n               Hoffman in Secy. of State for Home Deptt. v. Rehman\n               [(2003) 1 AC 153 : (2001) 3 WLR 877 : (2002) 1 All ER 122\n               (HL)] : (AC p. 192C)\n\n                  “… [in the matter] of national security is not a\n                  question of law.

Thus, in a situation of national security, a party cannot\n               insist for the strict observance of the principles of natural\n               justice. In such cases, it is the duty of the court to read into\n               and provide for statutory exclusion, if not expressly\n               provided in the rules governing the field. Depending on the\n               facts of the particular case, it will however be open to the\n               court to satisfy itself whether there were justifiable facts,\n               and in that regard, the court is entitled to call for the files\n               and see whether it is a case where the interest of national\n               security is involved. Once the State is of the stand that the\n               issue involves national security, the court shall not disclose\n               the reasons to the affected party.”\n\n\n110 (2014) 5 SCC 409\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_538\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                Page 422 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_910\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_539\">348) Even in K.S. Puttaswamy, this Court has recognised data\n\n       retention by the Government which may be necessitated in the\n\n       public interest and in the interest of national security. We may\n\n       also usefully refer to the judgment of People’s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_796\">Civil\n\n       Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of India &amp; Anr.111</a>. In that case, action\n\n       of telephone tapping was challenged as serious invasion of\n\n       individual’s privacy.         The Court found that <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_797\">Section 5(2)</a> of the\n\n       Telegraph Act, 1885 permits the interception of messages in\n\n       circumstances mentioned therein i.e. ‘occurrence of any public\n\n       emergency’ or ‘in the interest of public safety’.              The Court\n\n       explained these expressions in the following manner:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_728\">               “28. <a href=\"/doc/641728/\" id=\"a_798\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act permits the interception of\n               messages in accordance with the provisions of the said\n               section. “Occurrence of any public emergency” or “in the\n               interest of public safety” are the sine qua non for the\n               application of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/641728/\" id=\"a_799\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Act.\n               Unless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of\n               public safety demands, the authorities have no jurisdiction\n               to exercise the powers under the said section. Public\n               emergency would mean the prevailing of a sudden\n               condition or state of affairs affecting the people at large\n               calling for immediate action. The expression “public safety”\n               means the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk\n               for the people at large. When either of these two conditions\n               are not in existence, the Central Government or a State\n               Government or the authorised officer cannot resort to\n               telephone-tapping even though there is satisfaction that it\n               is necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of\n               sovereignty and integrity of India etc. In other words, even\n               if the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary or\n               expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty and\n               integrity of India or the security of the State or friendly\n               relations with sovereign States or public order or for\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_911\">111 (1997) 1 SCC 301\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_540\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 423 of 567</span>\n\f               preventing incitement to the commission of an offence, it\n               cannot intercept the messages or resort to telephone-\n               tapping unless a public emergency has occurred or the\n               interest of public safety or the existence of the interest of\n               public safety requires. Neither the occurrence of public\n               emergency nor the interest of public safety are secretive\n               conditions or situations. Either of the situations would be\n               apparent to a reasonable person.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_912\">349) Having regard to the aforesaid legal position, disclosure of\n\n       information in the interest of national security cannot be faulted\n\n       with.      However, we are of the opinion that giving of such\n\n       important power in the hands of Joint Secretary may not be\n\n       appropriate. There has to be a higher ranking officer along with,\n\n       preferably, a Judicial Officer. The provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1881144/\" id=\"a_800\">Section\n\n       33(2)</a> of the Act to the extent it gives power to Joint Secretary is,\n\n       therefore, struck down giving liberty to the respondents to suitably\n\n       enact a provision on the aforesaid lines, which would adequately\n\n       protect the interest of individuals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_913\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_914\">350) We now advert to the challenge laid to Section 47 of the Aadhaar\n\n       Act, which is captioned as ‘cognizance of offences’, it reads as\n\n       under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_729\">               “47.

Insofar as\n\n       investigation of these offences is concerned, <a href=\"/doc/1927329/\" id=\"a_804\">Section 45</a> provides\n\n       that a police officer not below the rank of Inspector of Police shall\n\n       investigate any offence under this Act. <a href=\"/doc/308356/\" id=\"a_805\">Section 46</a>, thereafter,\n\n       clarifies that penalties imposed under this Act shall not prevent\n\n       the imposition of any other penalty or punishment under any\n\n       other law for the time being in force. This scheme of Chapter VII\n\n       makes very strict provisions in respect of enforcement of the Act\n\n       which includes data protection as well. Last provision in Chapter\n\n       VII is <a href=\"/doc/454297/\" id=\"a_806\">Section 47</a> which provides that the cognizance would be\n\n       taken only on a complaint made by the Authority or any officer or\n\n       person authorised by it.               Petitioners feel aggrieved by this\n\n       provision as it does not permit an individual citizen whose rights\n\n       are violated, to initiate the criminal process. Apprehensions are\n\n       expressed by submitting that there may be a possibility where the\n\n       Authority itself or some Governmental Authority may be guilty of\n\n       committing the offences under the Act and, in such a situation,\n\n       the Authority or any officer or person authorised by it may choose\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_542\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 425 of 567</span>\n\f       not to file any complaint.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_733\">353) According to the respondents, the rationale behind <a href=\"/doc/454297/\" id=\"a_807\">Section 47</a> is\n\n       to maintain purity and integrity of CIDR and the entire enrolment\n\n       storage in the CIDR and authentication exercise can be handled\n\n       only by the Authority. For this reason, it is the Authority which is\n\n       empowered to lodge the complaint.

We may first take note of the\n\n       exact language of this provision:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_922\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_734\">113(2014) 9 SCC 772\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_545\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 427 of 567</span>\n\f               “57. Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent the use of\n               Aadhaar number for establishing the identity of an\n               individual for any purpose, whether by the State or any\n               body corporate or person, pursuant to any law, for the time\n               being in force, or any contract to this effect: Provided that\n               the use of Aadhaar number under this section shall be\n               subject to the procedure and obligations under <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_821\">section 8</a>\n               and Chapter VI.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_735\">356) In first blush, the provision appears to be innocuous. It enables\n\n       Aadhaar holder to establish her identity for any purpose as well.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_923\">       In that sense, it may amount to empowering the Aadhaar number\n\n       holder, when she is carrying unique identity. It is her identity card\n\n       which she is able to use not only for the purposes mentioned in\n\n       the Aadhaar Act but also for any other purpose.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_924\">357) The petitioners, however, have pricked the provision with the\n\n       submission that it may be susceptible to making deep in-roads in\n\n       the privacy of individuals and is utterly disproportionate. The taint\n\n       in the provision, as projected by the petitioners, is that it brings in\n\n       private parties as well, apart from the State within the fold of\n\n       Aadhaar network giving untrammeled opportunity to them to\n\n       invade the privacy of such user. The offending portion of the\n\n       provision, according to them, is that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_736\">       (a)    It   allows     ‘any     body      corporate   or   person’   (thereby\n\n       encompassing private bodies/persons as well) to make use of\n\n       authentication process, once an individual offers Aadhaar number\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_546\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 428 of 567</span>\n\f       for establishing her identity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_737\">       (b)     The expression ‘for any purpose’ is wide enough, which\n\n       may be susceptible to misuse.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_738\">       (c)     This is permitted not only pursuant to any law for time being\n\n       in force but also pursuant to ‘any contract to this effect’ which\n\n       would mean that individuals may be forced to give their consent\n\n       in the form of contract for a purpose that may be justified or not\n\n       thereby permitting the private parties to collect biometric\n\n       information about the said individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_739\">358) It is argued that there are no procedural safeguards governing\n\n       the actions of the private entities. Equally no remedy is provided\n\n       in case such body corporate or person fails or denies services. In\n\n       this hue, it is also argued that it is an excessive piece of\n\n       legislation inasmuch as taking the umbrage of ‘any law’, the\n\n       regulations etc. can be framed by including within its fold much\n\n       more than what is provided by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. It,\n\n       therefore, according to the petitioners, does not meet the test of\n\n       proportionality. Mr. Divan submits that <a href=\"/doc/174899/\" id=\"a_822\">Section 57</a> is also patently\n\n       unconstitutional inasmuch as it allows an unrestricted extension\n\n       of the Aadhaar platform to users who may be government\n\n       agencies or private sector operators. Moreover, this provision\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_547\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 429 of 567</span>\n\f       enables the seeding of the Aadhaar number across service\n\n       providers and other gateways and thereby enables the\n\n       establishment of a surveillance state. The impugned provision\n\n       enables the spread of applications and Aadhaar dependent\n\n       delivery systems that are provided not from Consolidated Fund of\n\n       India resources but through any other means. He also submits\n\n       that <a href=\"/doc/174899/\" id=\"a_823\">section 57</a> also enables commercial exploitation of an\n\n       individual’s biometrics and demographic information by the\n\n       Respondents as well as private entities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_740\">359) As mentioned above, the respondents contend that it is only an\n\n       enabling provision which gives further facilities to Aadhaar card\n\n       holder, as per her choice and is, thus, enacted for the benefit of\n\n       such individuals.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_741\">360) We have already discussed in detail the principles on which\n\n       doctrine of proportionality is built upon and the test which need to\n\n       be satisfied. To put in nutshell, the proportionality principles seek\n\n       to safeguard citizens from excessive Government measures. The\n\n       inquiry, in such cases, is that a particular measure must not be\n\n       disproportionate in two distinctive utilitarian senses:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_742\">       (i)     The cost or burdens of the measure must not clearly exceed\n\n       the likely benefits, which can be described as ‘ends’ or ‘ends-\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_548\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 430 of 567</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_925\">\f       benefits’ proportionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_926\">       (ii)    The measure must not be clearly more costly or more\n\n       burdensome than equally alternative measures, which is also\n\n       described by some jurists as a concept of necessity and narrow\n\n       tailoring and can be referred to as ‘means’ or ‘alternative-means’\n\n       proportionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_927\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_928\">361) We have also discussed in detail the principle of proportionality\n\n       that is developed in certain foreign legal regimes, particularly\n\n       Germany and Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\n\n       Oakes114 developed a two-tier constitutional control test. Once\n\n       the claimant has proved a violation of a right guaranteed in the\n\n       charter, the government must satisfy two criteria to establish that\n\n       the limit on individual rights “can be demonstrably justified in a\n\n       free and democratic society.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_929\">362) First, measures limiting a constitutionally protected right must\n\n       serve an important objective that “relate[s] to concerns which are\n\n       pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society.”\n\n       Legislation limiting the rights of English-speaking parents in\n\n       Quebec to educate their children in English-speaking schools 115\n\n       has been found lacking an important public objective. Likewise,\n\n114(1986) 1 SCR 103\n115Quebec Ass’n of Protestant Sch. Bds. v. Quebec (A.G.), (1984) 2 SCR 66\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_549\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                   Page 431 of 567</span>\n\f       the Supreme Court of Canada was unable to find any legitimate\n\n       public objective that justified denying protection to gays and\n\n       lesbians under Alberta’s human rights law in Vriend v. Alberta116.\n\n       In R. v. Zundel117, it also prohibited an intrusive use of a law that\n\n       was unrelated to the objectives originally contemplated by the\n\n       Parliament when that law was enacted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_930\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_931\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117218345\" id=\"span_550\">363) Secondly, once an important public objective or end has been\n\n       established, the selected means to attain it must be “reasonable\n\n       and demonstrably justified.” The Court said in <a href=\"/doc/117218345/\" id=\"a_824\">R. v. Big M Drug\n\n       Mart Ltd.118</a> that this determination involves “a form of\n\n       proportionality test”. Although, it varies depending on the facts of\n\n       the case, the test involves the balancing of public and individual\n\n       interests based on three principles, which are as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_743\">       (i)     the means must be rationally related to the objective. The\n\n       court has infrequently struck down legislation for lack of any\n\n       rational relation to the objective pursued.          It employs a rather\n\n       deferential and contextual approach to determine the rational\n\n       relation of a provision to the desired end.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_744\">       (ii)    The means should “impair ‘as little as possible’ the right or\n\n       freedom in question.” This is believe to be the decisive element\n\n\n116(1998) 1 SCR 493\n117(1992) 2 SCR 731\n118 (1985) 1 SCR 295\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_551\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 432 of 567</span>\n\f       of proportionality review. It requires that the legislature adopt the\n\n       least intrusive measure capable of attaining the desired objective.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_932\">       (iii)   The public objective and actual effects of the means\n\n       adopted for its attainment must be proportionate to an important\n\n       public end or objective. The court noted that even if the means\n\n       satisfies the first two criteria, it may be declared unconstitutional\n\n       in view of its disproportionate harmful effects on an individual.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_933\">364) Insofar as development of law in Germany is concerned, as\n\n        already discussed in detail, proportionality is defined “as an\n\n        expression of general right of the citizen towards the State that\n\n        his freedom should be limited by the public authorities only to the\n\n        extent indispensable for the protection of the public interest.” 119\n\n        The principle of proportionality in German law incorporates three\n\n        important subprinciples: suitability, necessity, and proportionality\n\n        in the narrower sense. According to the High Court of Germany,\n\n        any government interference with basic rights must be suitable\n\n        and necessary for reaching the ends sought. Its disadvantages to\n\n        individuals “are generally only permissible if the protection of\n\n        others or of the public interest requires them, after having due\n\n        regard to the principle of proportionality.”\n\n\n119 See Nicholas Emiliou, The Principle of Proportionality in European Law: A comparative Study 5\n   (Kluwer Law Int’l. 1996).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_552\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                        Page 433 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_934\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_935\">\f365) The European Union has, by and large, adopted the German\n\n        system. We have also taken note of the development of doctrine\n\n        of proportionality in India through various judgments120.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_936\">366) We may mention here that insofar as U.S. Supreme Court is\n\n        concerned, it has refused to apply the least intrusive test 121\n\n        Though there was a debate at the bar as to whether this Court\n\n        should adopt European approach of applying least intrusive test\n\n        or go by American approach which repeatedly refused to apply\n\n        this test. Without going into this debate, even when we apply the\n\n        accepted norms <a href=\"/doc/117218345/\" id=\"a_825\">laid down by</a> this Court in Modern Dental\n\n        College and Research Centre and K.S.

It was argued that even the Act makes provisions for\n\n       informed consent which is to be obtained from individuals at the\n\n       time of enrolment and absence of such consent makes the very\n\n       enrolment as impermissible thereby violating the right to privacy\n\n       and such acts cannot be validated.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_747\">370) The contention of the respondents, on the other hand, is that by\n\n       the very nature of the provision, it is intended to be prospective in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_556\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 435 of 567</span>\n\f       nature with a clear purport in mind, namely, to validate the\n\n       notification dated August 21, 2009 vide which the Authority was\n\n       created       and     the       Aadhaar        scheme   was   launched     by\n\n       administrative fiat.

According to us, this\n\n       terminology used in the provision by the legislature is clearly to\n\n       cover all actions of the Authority including enrolment of\n\n       individuals into Aadhaar scheme. The words ‘shall be deemed to\n\n       have been validly done or taken under this Act’ at the end of the\n\n       Section put the things beyond any pale of doubt. The legislative\n\n       intent is clear, namely, to make the provision retrospective so as\n\n       to cover the actions of the Authority from the date of its\n\n       establishment.

This section provides for framing a\n                  scheme for giving effect to a Tribunal&#x27;s award. The\n                  scheme, inter alia provides for the establishment of\n                  the authority, its term of office and other conditions of\n                  service, etc. But the mere creation of such an agency\n                  will not be able to ensure implementation of a\n                  Tribunal&#x27;s award. Any agency set up under Section 6-\n                  A cannot really function without the cooperation of the\n                  States concerned.

It was\n               suggested to make the award effectively enforceable. The\n               language employed in <a href=\"/doc/964822/\" id=\"a_845\">Section 6(2)</a> suggests that the\n               decision of the Tribunal shall have the same force as the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_563\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 438 of 567</span>\n\f               order or decree of this Court. There is a distinction between\n               having the same force as an order or decree of this Court\n               and passing of a decree by this Court after due\n               adjudication.

The purpose is to\n               have the binding effect of the Tribunal&#x27;s award and the\n               effectiveness of enforceability. Thus, it has to be narrowly\n               construed regard being had to the purpose it is meant to\n               serve.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_755\">               75.

It is also the duty of the\n                  court to imagine the fiction with all real consequences\n                  and instances unless prohibited from doing so. That\n                  apart, the use of the term “deemed” has to be read in\n                  its context and further, the fullest logical purpose and\n                  import are to be understood. It is because in modern\n                  legislation, the term “deemed” has been used for\n                  manifold purposes.

A country may have\n               the ‘Constitution’ but not necessary ‘Constitutionalism’. For\n               example, a country with a dictatorship, where the dictator’s\n               word is law, can be said to have a ‘Constitution’ but not\n               ‘Constitutionalism’.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_762\">               The underlying difference between the two concepts is that\n               a Constitution ought not merely to confer powers on the\n               various organs of the government, but also seek to restrain\n               those powers. Constitutionalism recognises the need for\n               government but insists upon limitations being placed upon\n               governmental powers. Constitutionalism envisages checks\n               and balances and putting the powers of the legislature and\n               the executive under some restraints and not making them\n               uncontrolled and arbitrary. Unlimited powers jeopardise\n               freedom of the people ... If the Constitution confers\n               unrestrained power on either the legislature or the\n               executive, it might lead to an authoritarian, oppressive\n               government... to preserve the basic freedoms of the\n               individual, and to maintain his dignity and personality, the\n               Constitution should be permeated with ‘Constitutionalism’:\n               it should have some in-built restrictions on the powers\n               conferred by it on governmental organs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_763\">               ‘Constitutionalism’ connotes in essence limited government\n               or a limitation on government.

As PROFESSOR VILE has remarked: “Western\n               institutional theorists have concerned themselves with the\n               problems of ensuring that the exercise of governmental\n               power...should be controlled in order that it should not itself\n               be destructive of the values it was intended to promote.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_764\">376) Mr. Divan then cited various paragraphs from the cases of State\n\n       of M.P. v.

One ought\n               to witness in daily decisions an “acceptance of\n               constitutional obligations” not just within the text of the\n               Constitution but also its “silences”. To thus reawaken is to\n               be “obeisant to the constitutional conscience with a sense\n               of constitutional vision”.

There cannot be any dispute about the manner in\n               which Mr Shyam Divan explained the concept of “limited\n               Government” in his submissions. Undoubtedly, the\n               Constitution of India, as an instrument of governance of the\n               State, delineates the functions and powers of each wing of\n               the State, namely, the Legislature, the Judiciary and the\n               Executive. It also enshrines the principle of separation of\n               powers which mandates that each wing of the State has to\n               function within its own domain and no wing of the State is\n               entitled to trample over the function assigned to the other\n               wing of the State. This fundamental document of\n               governance also contains principle of federalism wherein\n               the Union is assigned certain powers and likewise powers\n               of the State are also prescribed. In this context, the Union\n               Legislature i.e. Parliament, as well as the State\n               Legislatures are given specific areas in respect of which\n               they have power to legislate. That is so stipulated in\n               Schedule VII to the Constitution wherein List I enumerates\n               the subjects over which Parliament has the dominion, List II\n               spells out those areas where the State Legislatures have\n               the power to make laws while List III is the Concurrent List\n               which is accessible both to the Union as well as the State\n               Governments. The scheme pertaining to making laws by\n               Parliament as well as by the legislatures of the State is\n               primarily contained in <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_875\">Articles 245</a> to 254 of the\n               Constitution. Therefore, it cannot be disputed that each\n               wing of the State has to act within the sphere delineated for\n               it under the Constitution. It is correct that crossing these\n               limits would render the action of the State ultra vires the\n               Constitution. When it comes to power of taxation,\n               undoubtedly, power to tax is treated as sovereign power of\n               any State.

Again, this concept of limited\n               government is woven around <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_888\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_977\">               88.    Undoubtedly, we are in the era of liberalised\n               democracy. In a democratic society governed by the\n               Constitution, there is a strong trend towards the\n               constitutionalisation of democratic politics, where the\n               actions of democratically elected Government are judged in\n               the light of the Constitution. In this context, judiciary\n               assumes the role of protector of the Constitution and\n               democracy, being the ultimate arbiter in all matters\n               involving the interpretation of the Constitution.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_978\">387) We may observe that the matter is examined keeping in view the\n\n       fundamental principles of constitutionalism in mind, and more\n\n       particularly the principle that the concept of ‘limited government’\n\n       is applicable having regard to the fact that the three limbs of the\n\n       State are to act within the framework of a written Constitution\n\n       which assigns specific powers to each of the wing of the State\n\n       and this presupposes that the sovereign power of the Parliament\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_605\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 456 of 567</span>\n\f       is circumscribed by the provisions of the Constitution and the\n\n       legislature is supposed to Act within the boundaries delineated by\n\n       the Constitution. The constitutionalism, which is the bedrock of\n\n       rule of law, is to be necessarily adhered to by the Parliament.\n\n       Further, the power of judicial review which is accorded to the\n\n       courts can be exercised to strike down any legislation or\n\n       executive action if it is unconstitutional.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_979\">388) When we examine this issue in the context of discussion on\n\n       various issues already dealt with, it is difficult to agree with the\n\n       sweeping proposition advanced by the petitioners that the\n\n       Aadhaar project is destructive of limited government and\n\n       constitutional trust. These submissions are premised on the\n\n       architecture of the Aadhaar being constitutionally intrusive which\n\n       threatens the autonomy of individuals and has a tendency of\n\n       creating a surveillance state.             In support, the petitioners have\n\n       referred to certain provisions of the Aadhaar Act.                     Some\n\n       provisions which we found offending                  are struck down, some\n\n       others have been read down and some are tweaked with. We\n\n       feel that the statutory regime that would now govern the citizenry,\n\n       wards off such a danger, if any.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_980\">\nMONEY BILL\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_606\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 457 of 567</span>\n\f       Is the Aadhaar Act a validly enacted law having been passed as\n       a Money Bill?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_981\">389) Mr. Chidambaram and Mr. Datar had laid attack on the Act on the\n\n       ground that the Bill it could not have been introduced and passed\n\n       by the Parliament as Money Bill.

A question may arise as to\n               what is the exact significance or scope of the word ‘only’\n               and whether and how far that word goes to modify or\n               control the wide and general words ‘imposition, abolition,\n               remission, etc.’.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_826\">                      I think, prima facie, that the word ‘only’ is not\n               restrictive of the scope of the general terms. If a Bill\n               substantially deals with the imposition, abolition, etc., of a\n               tax, then the mere fact of the inclusion in the Bill of other\n               provisions which may be necessary for the administration\n               of that tax or, I may say, necessary for the achievement of\n               the objective of the particular Bill, cannot take away the Bill\n               from the category of Money Bills. One has to look to the\n               objective of the bill. Therefore, if the substantial provisions\n               of the Bill aim at imposition, abolition, etc., of any tax then\n               the other provisions would be incidental and their inclusion\n               cannot be said to take it away from the category of a\n               Money Bill. Unless one construes the word ‘only’ in this\n               way it might lead to make <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_913\">article 110</a> a nullity. No tax can\n               be imposed without making provisions for its assessment,\n               collection, administration, reference to courts or tribunals,\n               etc, one can visualise only one section in a Bill imposing\n               the main tax and there may be fifty other sections which\n               may deal with the scope, method, manner, etc., of that\n               imposition.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_827\">                     Further, we have also to consider the provisions of\n               sub-clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_914\">article 110;</a> and these provisions may be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_616\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 466 of 567</span>\n\f               helpful to clarify the scope of the word ‘only’, not directly\n               but indirectly.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_828\">396) It was further submitted that though clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_915\">Article 110</a>\n\n       stipulates that decision of the Speaker on whether a Bill is a\n\n       Money Bill or not is final, that did not mean that it was not subject\n\n       to the judicial scrutiny and, therefore, in a given case, the Court\n\n       was empowered to decide as to whether decision of the Speaker\n\n       was constitutionally correct. In respect of Bill in question, it was\n\n       argued that though <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_916\">Section 7</a> states that subsidies, benefits and\n\n       services shall be provided from Consolidated Fund of India which\n\n       was an attempt to give it a colour of Money Bill, some of the other\n\n       provisions, namely, clauses 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the Bill\n\n       (which corresponds to Sections 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the\n\n       Aadhaar Act) do not fall under any of the clauses of <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_917\">Article 110</a> of\n\n       the Constitution. Therefore, some provisions which were other\n\n       than those covered by Money Bill and, therefore, introduction of\n\n       the Bill as Money Bill was clearly inappropriate.            It was also\n\n       argued that, in this scenario, entire Act was bound to fail as there\n\n       is no provision for severing clauses in Indian Constitution, unlike\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1704110/\" id=\"a_918\">Section 55</a> of the Australian Constitution.

It is not the creation of\n\n       Aadhaar number per se which is the core of the Act, rather, that is\n\n       only a means to identify the correct beneficiary and ensure\n\n       “targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services”, the\n\n       expenditure for which is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of\n\n       India. A conjoint reading of the preamble to the Act along with\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_926\">Section 7</a> clearly discloses the legislative intent and the object of\n\n       the Act, which is to ensure that subsidy, benefit or service for\n\n       which expenditure is incurred from or the receipt therefrom forms\n\n       part of, the Consolidated Fund of India should be targeted to\n\n       reach the intended beneficiary. It was argued, without prejudice\n\n       to the above, that the decision of the Speaker incorporated into a\n\n       certificate sent to the President is final and cannot be the subject\n\n       matter of judicial review.

The growth of “bicameralism” in parliamentary forms\n               of Government has been functionally associated with the\n               need for effective federal structures. This nexus between\n               the role of “Second Chambers” or Upper Houses of\n               Parliament and better coordination between the Central\n               Government and those of the constituent units, was\n               perhaps first <a href=\"/doc/38264736/\" id=\"a_981\">laid down in</a> definite terms with the\n               Constitution of the United States of America, which was\n               ratified by the thirteen original States of the Union in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_649\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 477 of 567</span>\n\f               year 1787. The Upper House of the Congress of USA,\n               known as the Senate, was theoretically modelled on the\n               House of Lords in the British Parliament, but was totally\n               different from the latter with respect to its composition and\n               powers.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_854\">               75. Since then, many nations have adopted a bicameral\n               form of Central Legislature, even though some of them are\n               not federations. On account of colonial rule, these British\n               institutions of parliamentary governance were also\n               embodied in the British North America Act, 1867 by which\n               the Dominion of Canada came into existence and the\n               Constitution of India, 1950. In Canada, Parliament consists\n               of the House of Commons and the Senate (the Upper\n               House). Likewise, the Parliament of the Union of India\n               consists of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the\n               Rajya Sabha (Council of States, which is the Upper\n               House). In terms of their functions as agencies of\n               representative democracies, the Lower Houses in the\n               legislatures of India, USA and Canada, namely, the Lok\n               Sabha, the House of Representatives and the House of\n               Commons broadly follow the same system of composition.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1007\">               As of now, Members of the Lower Houses are elected from\n               pre-designated constituencies through universal adult\n               suffrage. The demarcation of these constituencies is in\n               accordance with distribution of population, so as to accord\n               equity in the value of each vote throughout the territory of\n               the country. However, with the existence of constituent\n               States of varying areas and populations, the representation\n               accorded to these States in the Lower House becomes\n               highly unequal. Hence, the composition of the Upper\n               House has become an indicator of federalism, so as to\n               more adequately reflect the interests of the constituent\n               States and ensure a mechanism of checks and balances\n               against the exercise of power by Central authorities that\n               might affect the interests of the constituent States.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1008\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1009\">               79. The genesis of the Indian Rajya Sabha on the other\n               hand benefited from the constitutional history of several\n               nations which allowed the Constituent Assembly to\n               examine the federal functions of an Upper House.\n               However, “bicameralism” had been introduced to the\n               provincial legislatures under the British rule in 1921. <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_982\">The\n               Government of India Act, 1935</a> also created an Upper\n               House in the federal legislature, whose members were to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_650\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 478 of 567</span>\n\f               be elected by the members of provincial legislatures and in\n               case of Princely States to be nominated by the rulers of\n               such territories. However, on account of the realities faced\n               by the young Indian Union, a Council of States (the Rajya\n               Sabha) in the Union Parliament was seen as an essential\n               requirement for a federal order. Besides the former British\n               provinces, there were vast areas of Princely States that\n               had to be administered under the Union. Furthermore, the\n               diversity in economic and cultural factors between regions\n               also posed a challenge for the newly-independent country.\n               Hence, the Upper House was instituted by the Constitution-\n               framers which would substantially consist of members\n               elected by the State Legislatures and have a fixed number\n               of nominated members representing non-political fields.\n               However, the distribution of representation between the\n               States in the Rajya Sabha is neither equal nor entirely\n               based on population distribution. A basic formula is used to\n               assign relatively more weightage to smaller States but\n               larger States are accorded weightage regressively for\n               additional population. Hence the Rajya Sabha incorporates\n               unequal representation for States but with proportionally\n               more representation given to smaller States. The theory\n               behind such allocation of seats is to safeguard the interests\n               of the smaller States but at the same time giving adequate\n               representation to the larger States so that the will of the\n               representatives of a minority of the electorate does not\n               prevail over that of a majority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1010\">               80.

It is also\n\n       accepted by the petitioners that <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_998\">Section 7</a> is the main provision of\n\n       the Act. In fact, Introduction to the Act as well as the Statement\n\n       of Objects and Reasons very categorically record that the main\n\n       purpose of Aadhaar Act is to ensure that such subsidies, benefits\n\n       and services reach those categories of persons, for whom they\n\n       are actually meant. <a href=\"/doc/10438020/\" id=\"a_999\">Sections 2(f)</a>, (w) and (x) of the Aadhaar Act\n\n       define benefit, service and subsidy respectively.

It is also clear that various\n\n       schemes which can be contemplated by the aforesaid provisions,\n\n       relate to vulnerable and weaker section of the society. Whether\n\n       the social justice scheme would involve a subsidy or a benefit or\n\n       a service is merely a matter of the nature and extent of\n\n       assistance and would depend upon the economic capacity of the\n\n       State. Even where the state subsidizes in part, whether in cash\n\n       or kind, the objective of emancipation of the poor remains the\n\n       goal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_654\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 482 of 567</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_859\">\f408) The respondents are right in their submission that the expression\n\n       subsidy, benefit or service ought to be understood in the context\n\n       of targeted delivery to poorer and weaker sections of society. Its\n\n       connotation ought not to be determined in the abstract. For as an\n\n       abstraction one can visualize a subsidy being extended by\n\n       Parliament to the King; by Government to the Corporations or\n\n       Banks; etc. The nature of subsidy or benefit would not be the\n\n       same when extended to the poor and downtrodden for producing\n\n       those conditions without which they cannot live a life with dignity.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1014\">       That is the main function behind the Aadhaar Act and for this\n\n       purpose, enrolment for Aadhaar number is prescribed in Chapter\n\n       II which covers <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_1000\">Sections 3</a> to <a href=\"/doc/191105/\" id=\"a_1001\">6</a>.

However, it becomes\n\n       compulsory for those who seeks to receive any subsidy, benefit\n\n       or service under the welfare scheme of the Government\n\n       expenditure whereof is to be met from the Consolidated Fund of\n\n       India. It follows that authentication under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1002\">Section 7</a> would be\n\n       required as a condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service\n\n       only when such a subsidy, benefit or service is taken care of by\n\n       Consolidated Fund of India.

Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/1218766/\" id=\"a_1005\">Section 23</a> is\n\n       concerned, it deals with powers and functions of the Authority.\n\n       Sub-section (1) thereof says that the Authority shall develop the\n\n       policy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar numbers to\n\n       individuals and perform authentication thereof under this Act. As\n\n       mentioned above, under Section 3 of the Aadhaar Act, Aadhaar\n\n       number is to be issued and authentication is performed under\n\n       Section 8 of the Aadhaar Act.

While allotment of\n               multiple PANs to one person has the risk of diversion of\n               income of person into several PANs resulting in evasion of\n               tax, the allotment of same PAN to multiple persons results\n               in wrong aggregation and assessment of incomes of\n               several persons as one taxable entity represented by\n               single PAN.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1033\">               60.4.

In the case of\n               Aadhaar, 100% verification is possible due to availability of\n               online Aadhaar authentication service provided by the\n               UIDAI.

Seeding of Aadhaar number into PAN database will\n               allow a robust way of de-duplication as Aadhaar number is\n               de-duplicated using biometric attributes of fingerprints and\n               iris images. The instance of a duplicate Aadhaar is almost\n               non-existent. Further seeding of Aadhaar will allow the\n               Income Tax Department to weed out any undetected\n               duplicate PANs. It will also facilitate resolution of cases of\n               one PAN allotted to multiple persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1035\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_666\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 493 of 567</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1036\">\f                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1037\">               104.

His\n               whole emphasis was that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_1050\">Section 139-AA</a> of the Act did not\n               satisfy the second limb of the twin tests of classification as,\n               according to him, this provision had no rational nexus with\n               the object sought to be achieved. In this behalf, his\n               submission was that if the purpose of the provision was to\n               curb circulation of black money, such an object was not\n               achievable by seeding PAN with Aadhaar inasmuch as\n               Aadhaar is only for individuals. His submission was that it\n               is only the individuals who are responsible for generating\n               black money or money laundering. This was the basis for\n               Mr Datar&#x27;s submission.

Unearthing black money or checking money\n               laundering is to be achieved to whatever extent possible.\n               Various measures can be taken in this behalf. If one of the\n               measures is introduction of Aadhaar into the tax regime, it\n               cannot be denounced only because of the reason that the\n               purpose would not be achieved fully. Such kind of menace,\n               which is deep-rooted, needs to be tackled by taking\n               multiple actions and those actions may be initiated at the\n               same time. It is the combined effect of these actions which\n               may yield results and each individual action considered in\n               isolation may not be sufficient. Therefore, rationality of a\n               particular measure cannot be challenged on the ground\n               that it has no nexus with the objective to be achieved. Of\n               course, there is a definite objective. For this purpose alone,\n               individual measure cannot be ridiculed. We have already\n               taken note of the recommendations of SIT on black money\n               headed by Justice M.B. Shah. We have also reproduced\n               the measures suggested by the Committee headed by\n               Chairman, CBDT on “Measures to Tackle Black Money in\n               India and Abroad”. They have, in no uncertain terms,\n               suggested that one singular proof of identity of a person for\n               entering into finance/business transactions, etc. may go a\n               long way in curbing this foul practice. That apart, even if\n               solitary purpose of de-duplication of PAN cards is taken\n               into consideration, that may be sufficient to meet the\n               second test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1051\">Article 14.</a> It has come on record that 11.35\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_667\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 494 of 567</span>\n\f               lakh cases of duplicate PAN or fraudulent PAN cards have\n               already been detected and out of this 10.52 lakh cases\n               pertain to individual assessees. Seeding of Aadhaar with\n               PAN has certain benefits which have already been\n               enumerated. Furthermore, even when we address the\n               issue of shell companies, fact remains that companies are\n               after all floated by individuals and these individuals have to\n               produce documents to show their identity. It was sought to\n               be argued that persons found with duplicate/bogus PAN\n               cards are hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to\n               have such a provision. We cannot go by percentage\n               figures. The absolute number of such cases is 10.52 lakhs,\n               which figure, by no means, can be termed as miniscule, to\n               harm the economy and create adverse effect on the nation.\n               The respondents have argued that Aadhaar will ensure that\n               there is no duplication of identity as biometrics will not\n               allow that and, therefore, it may check the growth of shell\n               companies as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1039\">                                   xx             xx        xx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1040\">               127.

The gap may be due\n                  to issuance of duplicate PAN cards and death of\n                  some PAN card holders.

It is significant to note\n                  that the number of PAN card holders has increased\n                  by 117.7 per cent between 2005-06 to 2009-10\n                  whereas the number of returns filed in the same\n                  period has increased by 14.4 per cent only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1042\">                  The total direct tax collection has increased by 128.8\n                  per cent during the period 2005-06 to 2009-10. The\n                  increase in the tax collection was around nine times\n                  as compared to increase in the assessee base.

However, it would be pertinent to comment\n               that even as per the observations of the Special\n               Investigation Team (SIT) on black money headed by\n               Justice M.B. Shah, one of the reasons is that persons have\n               the option to quote their PAN or UID or passport number or\n               driving licence or any other proof of identity while entering\n               into financial/business transactions. Because of this\n               multiple methods of giving proofs of identity, there is no\n               mechanism/system at present to collect the data available\n               with each of the independent proofs of ID. For this reason,\n               even SIT suggested that these databases be\n               interconnected. To the same effect is the recommendation\n               of the Committee headed by Chairman, CBDT on\n               measures to tackle black money in India and abroad which\n               also discusses the problem of money laundering being\n               done to evade taxes under the garb of shell companies by\n               the persons who hold multiple bogus PAN numbers under\n               different names or variations of their names. That can be\n               possible if one uniform proof of identity, namely, UID is\n               adopted. It may go a long way to check and minimise the\n               said malaise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_884\">               125.3. Thirdly, Aadhaar or UID, which has come to be\n               known as the most advanced and sophisticated\n               infrastructure, may facilitate law-enforcement agencies to\n               take care of problem of terrorism to some extent and may\n               also be helpful in checking the crime and also help\n               investigating agencies in cracking the crimes. No doubt,\n               going by the aforesaid, and may be some other similarly\n               valid considerations, it is the intention of the Government to\n               give fillip to Aadhaar movement and encourage the people\n               of this country to enrol themselves under the Aadhaar\n               Scheme.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_885\">               126. Whether such a scheme should remain voluntary or it\n               can be made mandatory imposing compulsiveness on the\n               people to be covered by Aadhaar is a different question\n               which shall be addressed at the appropriate stage. At this\n               juncture, it is only emphasised that mala fides cannot be\n               attributed to this scheme. In any case, we are concerned\n               with the vires of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_1055\">Section 139-AA</a> of the Income Tax Act,\n               1961 which is a statutory provision. This Court is, thus,\n               dealing with the aspect of judicial review of legislation.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_672\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 499 of 567</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1047\">\f               Insofar as this provision is concerned, the explanation of\n               the respondents in the counter-affidavit, which has already\n               been reproduced above, is that the primary purpose of\n               introducing this provision was to take care of the problem\n               of multiple PAN cards obtained in fictitious names. Such\n               multiple cards in fictitious names are obtained with the\n               motive of indulging into money laundering, tax evasion,\n               creation and channelising of black money. It is mentioned\n               that in de-duplication exercises, 11.35 lakh cases of\n               duplicate PANs/fraudulent PANs have been detected. Out\n               of these, around 10.52 lakhs pertain to the individual\n               assessees. Parliament in its wisdom thought that one PAN\n               to one person can be ensured by adopting Aadhaar for\n               allotment of PAN to individuals. As of today, that is the only\n               method available i.e. by seeding of existing PAN with\n               Aadhaar. It is perceived as the best method, and the only\n               robust method of de-duplication of PAN database. It is\n               claimed by the respondents that the instance of duplicate\n               Aadhaar is almost non-existent. It is also claimed that\n               seeding of PAN with Aadhaar may contribute to widening of\n               the tax case as well, by checking the tax evasions and\n               bringing into tax hold those persons who are liable to pay\n               tax but deliberately avoid doing so.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1048\">423) It has been stated by the respondents, on affidavit, that analysis\n\n       of Form 61/60 data using PAN Aadhaar linkage shows that a\n\n       large number of PAN holders do not quote their PAN in the\n\n       prescribed transactions to prevent linking of the transactions to\n\n       the PAN. The analysis was performed by matching the Aadhaar\n\n       number and person name reported in Form 61 (which was\n\n       possible only due to linking of financial transactions/accounts with\n\n       Aadhaar) with the Aadhaar and name of the entity available in the\n\n       ITD PAN database (possible due to linking of PAN with Aadhaar).\n\n       This analysis identified 1.65 crore non-PAN transactions reported\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_673\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters            Page 500 of 567</span>\n\f       through Form 61 (relating to FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18) where\n\n       PAN of the transacting party was present in the PAN database\n\n       and was not mentioned filing a wrong form deliberately. These\n\n       transactions totalled to around Rs. 33,000 crore (based on\n\n       transaction amount reported). This is the amount of undisclosed\n\n       high value transaction which would have gone undetected had it\n\n       not been for Aadhaar linkage. Similar matching has also helped\n\n       populating PAN in 1.12 lakh non-PAN transactions reported under\n\n       Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT). Majority of the non-\n\n       PAN transactions reported are around Deposit in Cash,\n\n       Investment in time deposit, Sale of immovable property, Purchase\n\n       of immovable property and Opening an account (other than\n\n       savings and time deposit). Thus, linking of PAN with Aadhaar will\n\n       significantly enhance legitimate collection of country’s revenue.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1049\">424) Taking into account the aforesaid consideration as well as other\n\n       factors mentioned above, we feel that there is a justifiable reason\n\n       with the State for collection and storage of data in the form of\n\n       Aadhaar and linking it with PAN insofar as <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_1056\">Section 139AA</a> of the\n\n       Income Tax Act is concerned. We would like to reproduce para\n\n       311 of K.S. Puttaswamy judgment, which reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_886\">               “311. Apart from national security, the State may have\n               justifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data.

There is a vital State\n               interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are not\n               dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do\n               not qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\n               development is coupled with a legitimate concern that the\n               utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for\n               extraneous purposes. Data mining with the object of\n               ensuring that resources are properly deployed to legitimate\n               beneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to insist on the\n               collection of authentic data. But, the data which the State\n               has collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of\n               the State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for\n               extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate\n               concerns of the State are duly safeguarded while, at the\n               same time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention and\n               investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are\n               among the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms\n               are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social\n               welfare     State.   Information     technology—legitimately\n               deployed is a powerful enabler in the spread of innovation\n               and knowledge.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_887\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145623382\" id=\"span_675\">425) Following passages from <a href=\"/doc/145623382/\" id=\"a_1057\">Subramanian Swamy v.

The test of reasonableness cannot\n               be determined by laying down any abstract standard or\n               general pattern. It would depend upon the nature of the\n               right which has been infringed or sought to be infringed.\n               The ultimate “impact”, that is, effect on the right has to be\n               determined. The “impact doctrine” or the principle of\n               “inevitable effect” or “inevitable consequence” stands in\n               contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a legislation or a\n               statutory provision depending upon the circumstances of\n               the case. The prevailing conditions of the time and the\n               principles of proportionality of restraint are to be kept in\n               mind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a\n               provision regard being had to the nature of the right. The\n               nature of social control which includes public interest has a\n               role. The conception of social interest has to be borne in\n               mind while considering reasonableness of the restriction\n               imposed on a right.

Needless to emphasise that when a law limits a\n               constitutional right which many laws do, such limitation is\n               constitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing restriction is\n               proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if the\n               measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\n               connected to the purpose, and such measures are necessary.\n               Such limitations should not be arbitrary or of an excessive\n               nature beyond what is required in the interest of the public.\n               Reasonableness is judged with reference to the objective which\n               the legislation seeks to achieve, and must not be in excess of\n               that objective (see P.P. Enterprisesv. Union of India). Further,\n               the reasonableness is examined in an objective manner from\n               the standpoint of the interest of the general public and not from\n               the point of view of the person upon whom the restrictions are\n               imposed or abstract considerations (see <a href=\"/doc/93885/\" id=\"a_1059\">Mohd.

It was argued that those persons who do not choose to\n\n       enrol for Aadhaar number would not be in a position to open the\n\n       bank account or even operate the existing bank account and\n\n       there is no valid explanation as to why all bank accounts had to\n\n       be authenticated. It was also argued that provisions of the Rule\n\n       referred to companies, firms, trust etc. as well, though the\n\n       Aadhaar Act is meant for establishing identity of individuals only.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1055\">       It was further submitted that in case a person fails to link Aadhaar\n\n       with the bank account, such person would be rendered ineligible\n\n       to operate the bank account, which would amount to forfeiting her\n\n       money lying in the account which belongs to her. This amounts\n\n       to depriving the person from her property and is, therefore,\n\n       violative of <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_1065\">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution as such a deprivation\n\n       can take place only by primary legislation and not by subordinate\n\n       legislation in the form of Rules. Much emphasis was also laid on\n\n       the argument that the amended Rule does not pass the\n\n       proportionality test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1056\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1057\">428) Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General, refuted\n\n       the aforesaid submissions.

It is administrative in\n\n       nature. The respondents have, however, tried to justify the same\n\n       on the ground that there have been numerous instances where\n\n       non-verification of SIM cards have posed serious security threats.\n\n       Having regard to the same, this Court had given direction in\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1070\">Lokniti Foundation v. Union of India &amp; Anr.157</a> for the linking of SIM\n\n       card with Aadhaar and it is pursuant to those directions that the\n\n       Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recommended this\n\n       step. Therefore, as per the respondents, Circular dated March\n\n       23, 2017 is the outcome of the aforesaid directions and\n\n       recommendations which should be treated as backing of law.\n\n       According to them, direction of this Court is a law under <a href=\"/doc/157198/\" id=\"a_1071\">Article\n\n\n157 (2017) 7</a> SCC 155\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_696\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 517 of 567</span>\n\f       141 of the Constitution. In addition, it is also argued that since\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_1072\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the\n\n       Central      Government          to    issue         licenses   for   establishing,\n\n       maintaining and working telegraphs, it is within the power of the\n\n       Central Government to grant such licenses with condition and,\n\n       therefore, Circular dated March 23, 2017 may be read as\n\n       condition for grant of licenses. On this premise, attempt is to\n\n       show that the Circular is issued in exercise of the powers\n\n       contained in <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_1073\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 which is\n\n       the force of law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1074\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1075\">440) In order to appreciate the respondents’ contentions, we\n\n       reproduce the relevant portion of Circular dated March 23, 2017,\n\n       which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_948\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182504723\" id=\"span_697\">“Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its order dated 06.02.2017\n               passed in Writ Petition (C) No. 607/2016 filed by <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1074\">Lokniti\n               Foundation v/s Union of India</a>, while taking into cognizance\n               of “Aadhaar based e-KYC process for issuing new\n               telephone connection” issued by the Department, has inter-\n               alia observed that “an effective process has been evolved\n               to ensure identity verification, as well as, the addresses of\n               all mobile phone subscribers for new subscribers.

Thus, the\n\n       Circular is not issued in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_1075\">Section 4</a> of the\n\n       Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (though that itself would be debatable\n\n       as to whether <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_1076\">Section 4</a> gives such a power at all). Insofar as\n\n       observations of this Court <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1077\">in that case</a> are concerned, it is clear\n\n       that in the said brief order, this Court did not go into the issue as\n\n       to whether linking of SIM card with Aadhaar would be violate of\n\n       privacy rights of the citizens. In that petition filed as a Public\n\n       Interest Litigation, a prayer was made to the effect that identity of\n\n       each subscriber and also the numbers should be verified so that\n\n       unidentified and unverified subscribers are not allowed to misuse\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_699\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 519 of 567</span>\n\f       mobile numbers. In response, the Union of India had filed the\n\n       counter affidavit bringing to the notice of the Court that the\n\n       Department had launched Aadhaar based e-KYC for issuing\n\n       mobile connections.             Based on this statement, orders were\n\n       passed by this Court. Lis, which is the subject matter of instant\n\n       petitions, was not raised in the said case. Obviously, the Court\n\n       did not deliberate on the aspects of necessity of such a provision\n\n       in the light of right to privacy. It was a case where both the sides\n\n       were at ad idem. In the absence of any such issue or discussion\n\n       thereupon, such a case cannot be treated as precedent and as a\n\n       corollary it cannot be termed as ‘law’ within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_1078\">Article\n\n       13</a> or <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_1079\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution. Moreover, we are unable to\n\n       read the order in Lokniti Foundation as a direction of the Court. It\n\n       simply disposed of the petition after recording the submission of\n\n       the Union of India to the effect that the grievance of the petitioner\n\n       therein stood redressed by evolving the procedure of linking. On\n\n       that the Court simply observed that undertaking given to this\n\n       Court will be seriously taken and given effect to. No doubt, the\n\n       Central Government, as a licensor, can impose conditions while\n\n       granting licenses under <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_1080\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act,\n\n       1885.      However, such directions/conditions have to be legally\n\n       valid.

Here, the case made out by the\n\n       petitioners is that it infringes their right to privacy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1078\">442) We are of the opinion that not only such a circular lacks backing\n\n       of a law, it fails to meet the requirement of proportionality as well.\n\n       It does not meet ‘necessity stage’ and ‘balancing stage’ tests to\n\n       check the primary menace which is in the mind of the respondent\n\n       authorities.       There can be other appropriate laws and less\n\n       intrusive alternatives. For the misuse of such SIM cards by a\n\n       handful of persons, the entire population cannot be subjected to\n\n       intrusion into their private lives.                  It also impinges upon the\n\n       voluntary nature of the Aadhaar scheme.                       We find it to be\n\n       disproportionate and unreasonable state compulsion. It is to be\n\n       borne in mind that every individual/resident subscribing to a SIM\n\n       card does not enjoy the subsidy benefit or services mentioned in\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1081\">Section 7</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1079\">               We, therefore, have no hesitation in declaring the Circular\n\n       dated March 23, 2017 as unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1080\">\nViolation of the orders passed by this Court:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_951\">       Whether certain actions of the respondents are in contravention\n       of the interim orders passed by the Court, if so, the effect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_701\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 521 of 567</span>\n\f       thereof?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_952\">443) It was vehemently argued that this Court had passed number of\n\n       interim orders (which have already been taken note of in the\n\n       beginning of this judgment) categorically stating that the Aadhaar\n\n       enrolment is voluntary; that no person would be forced to enrol\n\n       under the scheme; that a person would be told about the\n\n       voluntary nature of the scheme; and that enrolment shall not be\n\n       given      to   any     illegal    migrant.          As   per   the   petitioners,\n\n       notwithstanding these orders, the Central Government as well as\n\n       the State Governments have issued various notifications\n\n       requiring Aadhaar authentication for benefits, subsidies and\n\n       schemes mandatory.

The notifications\n\n       and circulars etc. are issued under this provision.                    Therefore,\n\n       technically speaking, it cannot be held that these circulars are\n\n       issued in contravention of the orders passed by this Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_954\">445) We feel that it would have been better had a clarification been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_702\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                    Page 522 of 567</span>\n\f       obtained from the Court after the passing of the Aadhaar Act\n\n       before issuing such circulars and orders under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1083\">Section 7</a>. When\n\n       the matter is sub judice in the Court and certain orders operating,\n\n       the respondents should have shown some fairness by taking that\n\n       route, which expectation would be high where the respondent is\n\n       the State. However, it would be difficult to hold the respondents\n\n       in contempt of the orders passed by this Court. We may note\n\n       that similar argument was advanced in Binoy Viswam, namely,\n\n       insertion of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_1084\">Section 139AA</a> in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1085\">Income Tax Act</a> was in breach of\n\n       interim orders passed by this Court. This argument was repelled\n\n       in the following manner:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_955\">               “99.    Main emphasis, however, is on the plea that\n               Parliament or any State Legislature cannot pass a law that\n               overrules a judgment thereby nullifying <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1086\">the said decision</a>,\n               that too without removing the basis of the decision. This\n               argument appears to be attractive inasmuch as few orders\n               are passed by this Court in pending writ petitions which are\n               to the effect that the enrolment of Aadhaar would be\n               voluntary. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the\n               orders have been passed in the petitions where Aadhaar\n               Scheme floated as an executive/administrative measure\n               has been challenged. In those cases, the said orders are\n               not passed in a case where the Court was dealing with a\n               statute passed by Parliament. Further, these are interim\n               orders as the Court was of the opinion that till the matter is\n               decided finally in the context of right to privacy issue, the\n               implementation of the said Aadhaar Scheme would remain\n               voluntary. In fact, the main issue as to whether Aadhaar\n               card scheme whereby biometric data of an individual is\n               collected violates right to privacy and, therefore, is\n               offensive of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1087\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution or not is yet to be\n               decided. In the process, the Constitution Bench is also\n               called upon to decide as to whether right to privacy is a\n               part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1088\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution at all. Therefore, no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_703\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters             Page 523 of 567</span>\n\f               final decision has been taken. In a situation like this, it\n               cannot be said that Parliament is precluded from or it is\n               rendered incompetent to pass such a law. That apart, the\n               argument of the petitioners is that the basis on which the\n               aforesaid orders are passed has to be removed, which is\n               not done. According to the petitioners, it could be done only\n               by making the Aadhaar Act compulsory. It is difficult to\n               accept this contention for two reasons: first, when the\n               orders passed by this Court which are relied upon by the\n               petitioners were passed when the Aadhaar Act was not\n               even enacted. Secondly, as already discussed in detail\n               above, the Aadhaar Act and the law contained in <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_1089\">Section\n               139-AA</a> of the Income Tax Act deal with two different\n               situations and operate in different fields. This argument of\n               legislative incompetence also, therefore, fails.”\n\n\n\nSummary and Conclusions:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_956\">446) (a)       The architecture and structure of the Aadhaar Act reveals\n\n       that the UIDAI is established as a statutory body which is given\n\n       the task of developing the policy, procedure and system for\n\n       issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and also to perform\n\n       authentication thereof as per the provisions of the Act. For the\n\n       purpose of enrolment and assigning Aadhaar numbers, enrolling\n\n       agencies are recruited by the Authority. All the residents in India\n\n       are eligible to obtain an Aadhaar number. To enable a resident to\n\n       get Aadhaar number, he is required to submit demographic as\n\n       well as biometric information i.e., apart from giving information\n\n       relating to name, date of birth and address, biometric information\n\n       in the form of photograph, fingerprint, iris scan is also to be\n\n       provided. Aadhaar number given to a particular person is treated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_704\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 524 of 567</span>\n\f       as unique number as it cannot be reassigned to any other\n\n       individual.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_957\">       (b)     Insofar as subsidies, benefits or services to be given by the\n\n       Central Government or the State Government, as the case may\n\n       be, is concerned, these Governments can mandate that receipt of\n\n       these subsidies, benefits and services would be given only on\n\n       furnishing proof of possession of Aadhaar number (or proof of\n\n       making an application for enrolment, where Aadhaar number is\n\n       not assigned).         An added requirement is that such individual\n\n       would undergo authentication at the time of receiving such\n\n       benefits etc. A particular institution/body from which the aforesaid\n\n       subsidy, benefit or service is to be claimed by such an individual,\n\n       the intended recipient would submit his Aadhaar number and is\n\n       also required to give her biometric information to that agency. On\n\n       receiving       this    information       and        for   the   purpose   of    its\n\n       authentication, the said agency, known as Requesting Entity\n\n       (RE), would send the request to the Authority which shall perform\n\n       the job of authentication of Aadhaar number. On confirming the\n\n       identity of a person, the individual is entitled to receive subsidy,\n\n       benefit or service.         Aadhaar number is permitted to be used by\n\n       the holder for other purposes as well.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_958\">       (c)     In this whole process, any resident seeking to obtain an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_705\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                   Page 525 of 567</span>\n\f       Aadhaar number is, in the first instance, required to submit her\n\n       demographic information and biometric information at the time of\n\n       enrolment. She, thus, parts with her photograph, fingerprint and\n\n       iris scan at that stage by giving the same to the enrolling agency,\n\n       which may be a private body/person. Likewise, every time when\n\n       such Aadhaar holder intends to receive a subsidy, benefit or\n\n       service and goes to specified/designated agency or person for\n\n       that purpose, she would be giving her biometric information to\n\n       that RE, which, in turn, shall get the same authenticated from the\n\n       Authority before providing a subsidy, benefit or service.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_959\">       (d)     Attack of the petitioners to the Aadhaar programme and its\n\n       formation/structure under the Aadhaar Act is founded on the\n\n       arguments that it is a grave risk to the rights and liberties of the\n\n       citizens of this country which are secured by the Constitution of\n\n       India. It militates against the constitutional abiding values and its\n\n       foundational morality and has the potential to enable an intrusive\n\n       state to become a surveillance state on the basis of information\n\n       that is collected in respect of each individual by creation of a joint\n\n       electronic mesh.          In this manner, the Act strikes at the very\n\n       privacy of each individual thereby offending the right to privacy\n\n       which is elevated and given the status of fundamental right by\n\n       tracing it to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1090\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1091\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1092\">21</a> of the Constitution of India by a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_706\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 526 of 567</span>\n\f       nine Judge Bench judgment of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_960\">       (e)     The respondents, on the other hand, have attempted to\n\n       shake the very foundation of the aforesaid structure of the\n\n       petitioners’ case. They argue that in the first instance, minimal\n\n       biometric information of the applicant, who intends to have\n\n       Aadhaar number, is obtained which is also stored in CIDR for the\n\n       purpose of authentication.              Secondly, no other information is\n\n       stored. It is emphasised that there is no data collection in respect\n\n       of religion, caste, tribe, language records of entitlement, income\n\n       or medical history of the applicant at the time of Aadhaar\n\n       enrolment.        Thirdly, the Authority also claimed that the entire\n\n       Aadhaar enrolment eco-system is foolproof inasmuch as within\n\n       few seconds of the biometrics having been collected by the\n\n       enrolling agency, the said information gets transmitted the\n\n       Authorities/CIDR, that too in an encrypted form, and goes out of\n\n       the reach of the enrolling agency. Same is the situation at the\n\n       time of authentication as biometric information does not remain\n\n       with the requesting agency.                 Fourthly, while undertaking the\n\n       authentication process, the Authority simply matches the\n\n       biometrics and no other information is received or stored in\n\n       respect of purpose, location or nature or transaction etc.\n\n       Therefore, the question of profiling does not arise at all.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_707\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 527 of 567</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_961\">\f       (f)     In the aforesaid scenario, it is necessary, in the first\n\n       instance, to find out the extent of core information, biometric as\n\n       well as demographic, that is collected and stored by the Authority\n\n       at the time of enrolment as well as at the time of authentication.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1081\">       This exercise becomes necessary in order to consider the\n\n       argument of the petitioners about the profiling of the Aadhaar\n\n       holders.       On going through this aspect, on the basis of the\n\n       powerpoint presentation given by Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO\n\n       of UIDAI, and the arguments of both the sides, including the\n\n       questions which were put by the petitioners to Dr. Pandey and the\n\n       answers thereupon, the Court has come to the conclusion that\n\n       minimal possible data, demographic and biometric, is obtained\n\n       from the Aadhaar holders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1082\">       (g) The Court also noticed that the whole architecture of Aadhaar\n\n       is devised to give unique identity to the citizens of this country.\n\n       No doubt, a person can have various documents on the basis of\n\n       which that individual can establish her identify. It may be in the\n\n       form of a passport, PAN card, ration card and so on. For the\n\n       purpose of enrolment itself number of documents are prescribed\n\n       which an individual can produce on the basis of which Aadhaar\n\n       card can be issued. Thus, such documents, in a way, are also\n\n       proof of identity.        However, there is a fundamental difference\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_708\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 528 of 567</span>\n\f       between the Aadhaar card as a mean of identity and other\n\n       documents through which identity can be established. Enrolment\n\n       for Aadhaar card also requires giving of demographic information\n\n       as well as biometric information which is in the form of iris and\n\n       fingerprints. This process eliminates any chance of duplication.\n\n       It is emphasised that an individual can manipulate the system by\n\n       having more than one or even number of PAN cards, passports,\n\n       ration cards etc. When it comes to obtaining Aadhaar card, there\n\n       is no possibility of obtaining duplicate card. Once the biometric\n\n       information is stored and on that basis Aadhaar card is issued, it\n\n       remains in the system with the Authority. Wherever there would\n\n       be a second attempt for enrolling for Aadhaar and for this\n\n       purpose same person gives his biometric information, it would be\n\n       immediately get matched with the same biometric information\n\n       already in the system and the second request would stand\n\n       rejected.      It is for this reason the Aadhaar card is known as\n\n       Unique Identification (UID). Such an identity is unparalleled.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1083\">       (h)     There is, then, another purpose for having such a system of\n\n       issuing unique identification cards in the form of Aadhaar card. A\n\n       glimpse thereof is captured under the heading ‘Introduction’\n\n       above, while mentioning how and under what circumstances the\n\n       whole project was conceptualised. To put it tersely, in addition to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_709\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 529 of 567</span>\n\f       enabling any resident to obtain such unique identification proof, it\n\n       is also to empower marginalised section of the society,\n\n       particularly those who are illiterate and living in abject poverty or\n\n       without any shelter etc. It gives identity to such persons also.\n\n       Moreover, with the aid of Aadhaar card, they can claim various\n\n       privileges and benefits etc. which are actually meant for these\n\n       people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1084\">       (i)     Identity of a person has a significance for every individual in\n\n       his/her life. In a civilised society every individual, on taking birth,\n\n       is given a name. Her place of birth and parentage also becomes\n\n       important as she is known in the society and these demographic\n\n       particulars also become important attribute of her personality.\n\n       Throughout their lives, individuals are supposed to provide such\n\n       information: be it admission in a school or college or at the time of\n\n       taking job or engaging in any profession or business activity, etc.\n\n       When all this information is available in one place, in the form of\n\n       Aadhaar card, it not only becomes unique, it would also qualify as\n\n       a document of empowerment. Added with this feature, when an\n\n       individual knows that no other person can clone her, it assumes\n\n       greater significance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_1085\">       (j)     Thus, the scheme by itself can be treated as laudable when\n\n       it comes to enabling an individual to seek Aadhaar number, more\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_710\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 530 of 567</span>\n\f       so, when it is voluntary in nature. Howsoever benevolent the\n\n       scheme may be, it has to pass the muster of constitutionality.\n\n       According to the petitioners, the very architecture of Aadhaar is\n\n       unconstitutional on various grounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1086\">       (k)     The Court has taken note of the heads of challenge of the\n\n       Act, Scheme and certain Rules etc. and clarified that the matter is\n\n       examined with objective examination of the issues on the\n\n       touchstone of the constitutional provisions, keeping in mind the\n\n       ethos of constitutional democracy, rule of law, human rights and\n\n       other basic features of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1087\">               Discussing the scope of judicial review, the Court has\n\n       accepted that apart from two grounds noticed in Binoy Viswam,\n\n       on which legislative Act can be invalidated [(a) the Legislature\n\n       does not have competence to make the law; and b) law made is\n\n       in violation of fundamental rights or any other constitutional\n\n       provision], another ground, namely, manifest arbitrariness, can\n\n       also be the basis on which an Act can be invalidated. The issues\n\n       are examined having regard to the aforesaid scope of judicial\n\n       review.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1088\">       (l)     From the arguments raised by the petitioners and the\n\n       grounds of challenge, it becomes clear that the main plank of\n\n       challenge is that the Aadhaar project and the Aadhaar Act\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_711\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters     Page 531 of 567</span>\n\f       infringes right to privacy. Inbuilt in this right to privacy is the right\n\n       to live with dignity, which is a postulate of right to privacy. In the\n\n       process, discussion leads to the issue of proportionality, viz.\n\n       whether measures taken under the Aadhaar Act satisfy the\n\n       doctrine of proportionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1089\">       (m) In view of the above, the Court discussed the contours of\n\n       right to privacy, as <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1093\">laid down in</a> K.S. Puttaswamy, principle of\n\n       human dignity and doctrine of proportionality. After taking note of\n\n       the discussion contained in different opinions of six Hon’ble\n\n       Judges, it stands established, without any pale of doubt, that\n\n       privacy has now been treated as part of fundamental right. The\n\n       Court has held that, in no uncertain terms, that privacy has\n\n       always been a natural right which given an individual freedom to\n\n       exercise control over his or her personality. The judgment further\n\n       affirms three aspects of the fundamental right to privacy, namely:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_962\">               (i) intrusion with an individual’s physical body,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_963\">               (ii) informational privacy and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_964\">               (iii) privacy of choice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_965\">       (n)     As succinctly put by Nariman, J., first aspect involves the\n\n       person himself/herself and guards a person’s rights relatable to\n\n       his physical body thereby controlling the uncalled invasion by the\n\n       State. Insofar as second aspect, namely, informational privacy is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_712\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 532 of 567</span>\n\f       concerned, it does not deal with a person’s body but deals with a\n\n       person’s mind. In this manner, it protects a person by giving her\n\n       control over the dissemination of material that is personal to her\n\n       and disallowing unauthorised use of such information by the\n\n       State. Third aspect of privacy relates to individual’s autonomy by\n\n       protecting her fundamental personal choices.          These aspects\n\n       have functional connection and relationship with dignity. In this\n\n       sense, privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself.         Human\n\n       dignity has a constitutional value and its significance is\n\n       acknowledged by the Preamble. Further, by catena of judgments,\n\n       human dignity is treated as fundamental right as a facet not only\n\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1094\">Article 21</a>, but that of right to equality (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1095\">Article 14</a>) and also part\n\n       of bouquet of freedoms stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1096\">Article 19.</a> Therefore, privacy\n\n       as a right is intrinsic of freedom, liberty and dignity. Viewed in this\n\n       manner, one can trace positive and negative contents of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1090\">       The negative content restricts the State from committing an\n\n       intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive\n\n       content imposes an obligation on the State to take all necessary\n\n       measures to protect the privacy of the individual.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1091\">       (o)     In developing the aforesaid concepts, the Court has been\n\n       receptive to the principles in international law and international\n\n       instruments. It is a recognition of the fact that certain human\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_713\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 533 of 567</span>\n\f       rights cannot be confined within the bounds of geographical\n\n       location of a nation but have universal application.          In the\n\n       process, the Court accepts the concept of universalisation of\n\n       human rights, including the right to privacy as a human right and\n\n       the good practices in developing and understanding such rights in\n\n       other countries have been welcomed. In this hue, it can also be\n\n       remarked that comparative law has played a very significant role\n\n       in shaping the aforesaid judgment on privacy in Indian context,\n\n       notwithstanding the fact that such comparative law has only\n\n       persuasive value.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1092\">               The whole process of reasoning contained in different\n\n       opinions of the Hon’ble Judges would, thus, reflect that the\n\n       argument that it is difficult to precisely define the common\n\n       denominator of privacy, was rejected. While doing so, the Court\n\n       referred to various approaches to formulating privacy\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1093\">       (p)     We have also remarked above, the taxonomy of privacy,\n\n       namely, on the basis of ‘harms’, ‘interest’ and ‘aggregation of\n\n       rights’. We have also discussed the scope of right to privacy with\n\n       reference to the cases at hand and the circumstances in which\n\n       such a right can be limited. In the process, we have also taken\n\n       note of the passage from the judgment rendered by Nariman, J.\n\n       in K.S. Puttaswamy stating the manner in which law has to be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_714\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 534 of 567</span>\n\f       tested when it is challenged on the ground that it violates the\n\n       fundamental right to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1094\">       (q)     One important comment which needs to be made at this\n\n       stage relates to the standard of judicial review while examining\n\n       the validity of a particular law that allegedly infringes right to\n\n       privacy. The question is as to whether the Court is to apply ‘strict\n\n       scrutiny’ standard or the ‘just, fair and reasonableness’ standard.\n\n       In the privacy judgment, different observations are made by the\n\n       different Hon’ble Judges and the aforesaid aspect is not\n\n       determined authoritatively, may be for the reason that the Bench\n\n       was deciding the reference on the issue as to whether right to\n\n       privacy is a fundamental right or not and, in the process, it was\n\n       called upon to decide the specific questions referred to it. This\n\n       Court preferred to adopt a ‘just, fair and reasonableness’\n\n       standard which is in tune with the view expressed by majority of\n\n       Judges in their opinion. Even otherwise, this is in consonance\n\n       with the judicial approach adopted by this Court while construing\n\n       ‘reasonable restrictions’ that the State can impose in public\n\n       interest, as provided in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1097\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. Insofar as\n\n       principles of human dignity are concerned, the Court, after taking\n\n       note of various judgments where this principle is adopted and\n\n       elaborated, summed up the essential ingredients of dignity\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_715\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 535 of 567</span>\n\f       jurisprudence by noticing that the basic principle of dignity and\n\n       freedom of the individual is an attribute of natural law which\n\n       becomes the right of all individuals in a constitutional democracy.\n\n       Dignity has a central normative role as well as constitutional\n\n       value. This normative role is performed in three ways:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_966\">               First, it becomes basis for constitutional rights;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_967\">               Second, it serves as an interpretative principle for\n\n       determining the scope of constitutional rights; and,\n\n               Third, it determines the proportionality of a statute limiting a\n\n       constitutional right. Thus, if an enactment puts limitation on a\n\n       constitutional right and such limitation is disproportionate, such a\n\n       statute can be held to be unconstitutional by applying the doctrine\n\n       of proportionality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_968\">       (r)     As per Dworkin, there are two principles about the concept\n\n       of human dignity,          First principle regards an ‘intrinsic value’ of\n\n       every person, namely, every person has a special objective value\n\n       which value is not only important to that person alone but success\n\n       or failure of the lives of every person is important to all of us. It\n\n       can also be described as self respect which represents the free\n\n       will of the person, her capacity to think for herself and to control\n\n       her own life.            The second principle is that of ‘personal\n\n       responsibility’, which means every person has the responsibility\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_716\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 536 of 567</span>\n\f       for success in her own life and, therefore, she must use her\n\n       discretion regarding the way of life that will be successful from her\n\n       point of view.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_969\">       (s)     Sum total of this exposition can be defined by explaining\n\n       that as per the aforesaid view dignity is to be treated as\n\n       ‘empowerment’ which makes a triple demand in the name of\n\n       ‘respect’ for human dignity, namely:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_970\">               (i) respect for one&#x27;s capacity as an agent to make one&#x27;s own\n\n               free choices;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_971\">               (ii) respect for the choices so made; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_972\">               (iii) respect for one&#x27;s need to have a context and conditions\n\n               in which one can operate as a source of free and informed\n\n               choice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_973\">       (t)     In the entire formulation of dignity right, ‘respect’ for an\n\n       individual is the fulcrum, which is based on the principle of\n\n       freedom and capacity to make choices and a good or just social\n\n       order is one which respects dignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and\n\n       ‘conditions’ as the ‘source of free and informed choice’.           The\n\n       aforesaid discourse on the concept of human dignity is from an\n\n       individual point of view. That is the emphasis of the petitioners as\n\n       well.    That would be one side of the coin.         A very important\n\n       feature which the present case has brought into focus is another\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_717\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters        Page 537 of 567</span>\n\f       dimension of human dignity, namely, in the form of ‘common\n\n       good’ or ‘public good’. Thus, our endeavour here is to give richer\n\n       and more nuanced understanding to the concept of human\n\n       dignity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_974\">       (u)     We, therefore, have to keep in mind humanistic concept of\n\n       Human Dignity which is to be accorded to a particular segment of\n\n       the society and, in fact, a large segment. Their human dignity is\n\n       based on the socio-economic rights that are read in to the\n\n       Fundamental Rights as already discussed above.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1095\">               When we read socio-economic rights into human dignity,\n\n       the community approach also assumes importance along with\n\n       individualistic approach to human dignity. It has now been well\n\n       recognised that at its core, human dignity contains three\n\n       elements, namely, Intrinsic Value, Autonomy and Community\n\n       Value. These are known as core values of human dignity. These\n\n       three elements can assist in structuring legal reasoning and\n\n       justifying judicial choices in ‘hard cases’.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1096\">       (v)     When it comes to dignity as a community value, it\n\n       emphasises the role of the community in establishing collective\n\n       goals and restrictions on individual freedoms and rights on behalf\n\n       of a certain idea of good life. The relevant question here is in\n\n       what circumstances and to what degree should these actions be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_718\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters    Page 538 of 567</span>\n\f       regarded as legitimate in a constitutional democracy? The liberal\n\n       predicament that the state must be neutral with regard to different\n\n       conceptions of the good in a plural society is not incompatible, of\n\n       course, with limitation resulting from the necessary coexistence of\n\n       different     views      and     potentially      conflicting      rights.        Such\n\n       interferences, however, must be justified on grounds of a\n\n       legitimate idea of justice, an “overlapping consensus” 158 that can\n\n       be shared by most individuals and groups.                         Whenever such\n\n       tension arises, the task of balancing is to be achieved by the\n\n       Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1097\">               We would like to highlight one more significant feature\n\n       which the issues involved in the present case bring about. It is\n\n       the balancing of two facets of dignity of the same individual.\n\n       Whereas, on the one hand, right of personal autonomy is a part of\n\n       dignity (and right to privacy), another part of dignity of the same\n\n       individual is to lead a dignified life as well (which is again a facet\n\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1098\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution). Therefore, in a scenario where\n\n       the State is coming out with welfare schemes, which strive at\n\n       giving dignified life in harmony with human dignity and in the\n\n       process some aspect of autonomy is sacrificed, the balancing of\n\n       the two becomes an important task which is to be achieved by the\n158“Overlapping consensus” is a term coined by John Rawls that identifies basic ideas of justice\n   that can be shared by supporters of different religious, political, and moral comprehensive\n   doctrines.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_719\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                       Page 539 of 567</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1098\">\n\f       Courts. For, there cannot be undue intrusion into the autonomy\n\n       on the pretext of conferment of economic benefits.\n\n       (w)     In this way, the concept of human dignity has been widened\n\n       to deal with the issues at hand.                     As far as doctrine of\n\n       proportionality is concerned, after discussing the approaches that\n\n       are adopted by the German Supreme Court and the Canadian\n\n       Supreme Court, which are somewhat different from each other,\n\n       this Court has applied the tests as <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1099\">laid down in</a> Modern Dental\n\n       College &amp; Research Centre, which are approved in K.S.\n\n       Puttaswamy as well.

The Authority does not\n\n       collect purpose, location or details of transaction.        Thus, it is\n\n       purpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains\n\n       in silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is\n\n       provided answer only in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ about the authentication of\n\n       the person concerned.

With these, biometric data is\n\n       signed within the device/RD service using the provider key to\n\n       ensure it is indeed captured live. The device provider RD service\n\n       encrypts the PID block before returning to the host application.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1102\">       This RD service encapsulates the biometric capture, signing and\n\n       encryption of biometrics all within it. Therefore, introduction of\n\n       RD in Aadhaar authentication system rules out any possibility of\n\n       use of stored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from\n\n       other source.

Insofar as\n\n       authentication is concerned, the respondents rightly pointed out\n\n       that there are sufficient safeguard mechanisms. To recapitulate, it\n\n       was specifically submitted that there was security technologies in\n\n       place (slide 28 of Dr. Pandey’s presentation), 24/7 security\n\n       monitoring, data leak prevention, vulnerability management\n\n       programme and independent audits (slide 29) as well as the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_723\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 543 of 567</span>\n\f       Authority’s defence mechanism (slide 30). It was further pointed\n\n       out that the Authority has taken appropriate pro-active protection\n\n       measures, which included disaster recovery plan, data backup\n\n       and availability and media response plan (slide 31).                   The\n\n       respondents also pointed out that all security principles are\n\n       followed inasmuch as: (a) there is PKI-2048 encryption from the\n\n       time of capture, meaning thereby, as soon as data is given at the\n\n       time of enrolment, there is an end to end encryption thereof and it\n\n       is transmitted to the Authority in encrypted form.             The said\n\n       encryption is almost foolproof and it is virtually impossible to\n\n       decipher the same; (b) adoption of best-in-class security\n\n       standards and practices; and (c) strong audit and traceability as\n\n       well as fraud detection.             Above all, there is an oversight of\n\n       Technology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and Security\n\n       Review Committee. This Board and Committee consists of very\n\n       high profiled officers. Therefore, the Act has endeavoured to\n\n       provide safeguards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1105\">       (d)     Insofar as use and protection of data is concerned, having\n\n       regard to the principles enshrined in various cases, Indian and\n\n       foreign, the matter is examined from the stand point of data\n\n       minimisation, purpose limitation, time period for data retention,\n\n       data protection and security (qua CIDR, requisite entities,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_724\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters           Page 544 of 567</span>\n\f       enrolment agencies and Registrars, authentication service\n\n       agency,      hacking,       biometric      solution        providers,    substantive\n\n       procedural or judicial safeguards).

Only those matters over which there would be a\n\n       reasonable expectation of privacy are protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1104\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1112\">       This can be discerned from the reading of Paras 297 to 307 of the\n\n       judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1113\">       (b)     The Court is also of the opinion that the triple test <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1105\">laid down\n\n       in</a> order to adjudge the reasonableness of the invasion to privacy\n\n       has been made. The Aadhaar scheme is backed by the statute,\n\n       i.e. the Aadhaar Act. It also serves legitimate State aim, which\n\n       can be discerned from the Introduction to the Act as well as the\n\n       Statement of Objects and Reasons which reflect that the aim in\n\n       passing the Act was to ensure that social benefit schemes reach\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_726\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters          Page 546 of 567</span>\n\f       the deserving community. The Court noted that the failure to\n\n       establish identity of an individual has proved to be a major\n\n       hindrance for successful implementation of those programmes as\n\n       it was becoming difficult to ensure that subsidies, benefits and\n\n       services reach the unintended beneficiaries in the absence of a\n\n       credible system to authenticate identity of beneficiaries. The\n\n       Statement of Objects and Reasons also discloses that over a\n\n       period of time, the use of Aadhaar number has been increased\n\n       manifold and, therefore, it is also necessary to take measures\n\n       relating to ensuring security of the information provided by the\n\n       individuals while enrolling for Aadhaar card.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1114\">       (c)     It may be highlighted that the petitioners are making their\n\n       claim on the basis of dignity as a facet of right to privacy. On the\n\n       other hand, Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is aimed at offering\n\n       subsidies, benefits or services to the marginalised section of the\n\n       society for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated\n\n       from time to time. That also becomes an aspect of social justice,\n\n       which is the obligation of the State stipulated in Para IV of the\n\n       Constitution.       The rationale behind <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1106\">Section 7</a> lies in ensuring\n\n       targeted delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are\n\n       funded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In discharge of its\n\n       solemn Constitutional obligation to enliven the       Fundamental\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_727\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 547 of 567</span>\n\f       Rights of life and personal liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1107\">Article 21</a>) to ensure Justice,\n\n       Social, Political and Economic and to eliminate inequality (Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1115\">       14) with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the Dalits, the\n\n       Central Government has launched several welfare schemes.\n\n       Some such schemes are PDS, scholarships, mid day meals, LPG\n\n       subsidies, etc. These schemes involve 3% percentage of the\n\n       GDP and involve a huge amount of public money.              Right to\n\n       receive these benefits, from the point of view of those who\n\n       deserve the same, has now attained the status of fundamental\n\n       right based on the same concept of human dignity, which the\n\n       petitioners seek to bank upon. The Constitution does not exist for\n\n       a few or minority of the people of India, but “We the people”. The\n\n       goals set out in the Preamble of the Constitution do not\n\n       contemplate statism and do not seek to preserve justice, liberty,\n\n       equality an fraternity for those who have the means and\n\n       opportunity to ensure the exercise of inalienable rights for\n\n       themselves. These goals are predominantly or at least equally\n\n       geared to “secure to all its citizens”, especially, to the\n\n       downtrodden, poor and exploited, justice, liberty, equality and “to\n\n       promote” fraternity assuring dignity. Interestingly, the State has\n\n       come forward in recognising the rights of deprived section of the\n\n       society to receive such benefits on the premise that it is their\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_728\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 548 of 567</span>\n\f       fundamental right to claim such benefits. It is acknowledged by\n\n       the respondents that there is a paradigm shift in addressing the\n\n       problem of security and eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.\n\n       The shift is from the welfare approach to a right based approach.\n\n       As a consequence, right of everyone to adequate food no more\n\n       remains based on Directive Principles of State Policy (Art 47),\n\n       though the said principles remain a source of inspiration. This\n\n       entitlement has turned into a Constitutional fundamental right.\n\n       This Constitutional obligation is reinforced by obligations under\n\n       International Convention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_1116\">       (d)       Even the petitioners did not seriously question the purpose\n\n       and bona fides of the Legislature enacting the law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1117\">       (e)       The Court also finds that the Aadhaar Act meets the test of\n\n       proportionality as the following components of proportionality\n\n       stand satisfied:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_990\">         (i)      A measure restricting a right must have a legitimate goal\n                  (legitimate goal stage).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_991\">         (ii)     It must be a suitable means of furthering this goal\n                  (suitability or rationale connection stage).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_992\">         (iii)    There must not be any less restrictive but equally effective\n                  alternative (necessity stage).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_993\">         (iv)     The measure must not have a disproportionate impact on\n                  the right holder (balancing stage).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_994\">       (f)       In the process, the Court has taken note of various\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_729\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters         Page 549 of 567</span>\n\f       judgments pronounced by this Court pertaining to right to food,\n\n       issuance of BPL Cards, LPG connections and LPG cylinders at\n\n       minimal cost, old age and other kind of pensions to deserving\n\n       persons,       scholarships        and     implementation   of   MGNREGA\n\n       scheme.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_995\">       (g)     The purpose behind these orders was to ensure that the\n\n       deserving beneficiaries of the scheme are correctly identified and\n\n       are able to receive the benefits under the said scheme, which is\n\n       their entitlement.         The orders also aimed at ensuring ‘good\n\n       governance’ by bringing accountability and transparency in the\n\n       distribution system with the pious aim in mind, namely, benefits\n\n       actually reached those who are rural, poor and starving.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_996\">       (h)     All this satisfies the necessity stage test, particularly in the\n\n       absence of any less restrictive but equally effective alternative.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_997\">       (i)     Insofar as balancing is concerned, the matter is examined\n\n       at two levels:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_998\">             (i) Whether, ‘legitimate state interest’ ensures ‘reasonable\n\n             tailoring’?

This is the\n\n             test we have applied in the instant case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_999\">             (ii)     There needs to be balancing of two competing\n\n             fundamental rights, right to privacy on the one hand and right\n\n             to food, shelter and employment on the other hand.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1118\">             Axiomatically both the rights are founded on human dignity. At\n\n             the same time, in the given context, two facets are in conflict\n\n             with each other. The question here would be, when a person\n\n             seeks to get the benefits of welfare schemes to which she is\n\n             entitled to as a part of right to live life with dignity, whether her\n\n             sacrifice to the right to privacy, is so invasive that it creates\n\n             imbalance?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1119\">       (j)      In the process, sanctity of privacy in its functional\n\n       relationship with dignity is kept in mind where it says that\n\n       legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from intimate zone to\n\n       the private zone and from the private to public arena.\n\n       Reasonable          expectation       of    privacy    is   also   taken     into\n\n       consideration. The Court finds that as the information collected at\n\n       the time of enrolment as well as authentication is minimal,\n\n       balancing at the first level is met.                 Insofar as second level,\n\n       namely, balancing of two competing fundamental rights is\n\n       concerned, namely, dignity in the form of autonomy (informational\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_731\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters                 Page 551 of 567</span>\n\f       privacy) and dignity in the form of assuring better living standards\n\n       of the same individual, the Court has arrived at the conclusion\n\n       that balancing at the second level is also met.        The detailed\n\n       discussion in this behalf amply demonstrates that enrolment in\n\n       Aadhaar of the unprivileged and marginalised section of the\n\n       society, in order to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of the\n\n       Government, actually amounts to empowering these persons. On\n\n       the one hand, it gives such individuals their unique identity and,\n\n       on the other hand, it also enables such individuals to avail the\n\n       fruits of welfare schemes of the Government which are floated as\n\n       socio-economic welfare measures to uplift such classes. In that\n\n       sense, the scheme ensures dignity to such individuals. This facet\n\n       of dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged.\n\n       We are, by no means, accepting that when dignity in the form of\n\n       economic welfare is given, the State is entitled to rob that person\n\n       of his liberty. That can never be allowed. We are concerned with\n\n       the balancing of the two facets of dignity. Here we find that the\n\n       inroads into the privacy rights where these individuals are made\n\n       to part with their biometric information, is minimal. It is coupled\n\n       with the fact that there is no data collection on the movements of\n\n       such individuals, when they avail benefits under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1109\">Section 7</a> of the\n\n       Act thereby ruling out the possibility of creating their profiles. In\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_732\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 552 of 567</span>\n\f       fact, this technology becomes a vital tool of ensuring good\n\n       governance in a social welfare state. We, therefore, are of the\n\n       opinion that the Aadhaar Act meets the test of balancing as well.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1120\">       (k)     Insofar as the argument based on probabilistic system of\n\n       Aadhaar, leading to ‘exclusion’ is concerned, the Authority has\n\n       claimed that biometric accuracy is 99.76% and the petitioners\n\n       have also proceeded on that basis.                   In this scenario, if the\n\n       Aadhaar project is shelved, 99.76% beneficiaries are going to\n\n       suffer. Would it not lead to their exclusion? It will amount to\n\n       throwing the baby out of hot water along with the water. In the\n\n       name of 0.232% failure (which can in any case be remedied)\n\n       should be revert to the pre-Aadhaar stage with a system of\n\n       leakages, pilferages and corruption in the implementation of\n\n       welfare schemes meant for marginalised section of the society,\n\n       the full fruits thereof were not reaching to such people?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1121\">       (l)     The entire aim behind launching this programme is the\n\n       ‘inclusion’ of the deserving persons who need to get such\n\n       benefits. When it is serving much larger purpose by reaching\n\n       hundreds of millions of deserving persons, it cannot be crucified\n\n       on the unproven plea of exclusion of some. It is clarified that the\n\n       Court is not trivialising the problem of exclusion if it is there.\n\n       However, what we are emphasising is that remedy is to plug the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_733\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 553 of 567</span>\n\f       loopholes rather than axe a project, aimed for the welfare of large\n\n       section of the society. Obviously, in order to address the failures\n\n       of authentication, the remedy is to adopt alternate methods for\n\n       identifying such persons, after finding the causes of failure in their\n\n       cases.       We have chosen this path which leads to better\n\n       equilibrium and have given necessary directions also in this\n\n       behalf, viz:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1000\">            (i)       We have taken on record the statement of the learned\n\n            Attorney General that no deserving person would be denied\n\n            the benefit of a scheme on the failure of authentication.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1001\">            (ii)      We are also conscious of the situation where the\n\n            formation of fingerprints may undergo change for various\n\n            reasons. It may happen in the case of a child after she grows\n\n            up; it may happen in the case of an individual who gets old; it\n\n            may also happen because of damage to the fingers as a result\n\n            of accident or some disease etc. or because of suffering of\n\n            some kind of disability for whatever reason.

However, apprehension of the\n\n       petitioners is that this provision entitles Government to share the\n\n       information ‘for the purposes of as may be specified by\n\n       regulations’.      The Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations,\n\n       2016, as of now, do not contain any such provision.

If such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_738\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters               Page 558 of 567</span>\n\f       an order is passed, in that eventuality, he shall also have right to\n\n       challenge such an order passed by approaching the higher court.\n\n       During the hearing before the concerned court, the said individual\n\n       can always object to the disclosure of information on accepted\n\n       grounds in law, including <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1143\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution or the\n\n       privacy rights etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1130\">       (f)     Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/1881144/\" id=\"a_1144\">Section 33(2)</a> is concerned, it is held that\n\n       disclosure of information in the interest of national security cannot\n\n       be faulted with.             However, for determination of such an\n\n       eventuality, an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary\n\n       should be given such a power. Further, in order to avoid any\n\n       possible misuse, a Judicial Officer (preferably a sitting High Court\n\n       Judge) should also be associated with. We may point out that\n\n       such provisions of application of judicial mind for arriving at the\n\n       conclusion that disclosure of information is in the interest of\n\n       national security, are prevalent in some jurisdictions.

We\n\n       read down this provision to mean that such a purpose has to be\n\n       backed by law. Further, whenever any such “law” is made, it\n\n       would be subject to judicial scrutiny. (b) Such purpose is not\n\n       limited pursuant to any law alone but can be done pursuant to\n\n       ‘any contract to this effect’ as well. This is clearly impermissible\n\n       as a contractual provision is not backed by a law and, therefore,\n\n       first requirement of proportionality test is not met. (c) Apart from\n\n       authorising the State, even ‘any body corporate or person’ is\n\n       authorised to avail authentication services which can be on the\n\n       basis of purported agreement between an individual and such\n\n       body corporate or person. Even if we presume that legislature\n\n       did not intend so, the impact of the aforesaid features would be to\n\n       enable commercial exploitation of an individual biometric and\n\n       demographic information by the private entities. Thus, this part of\n\n       the provision which enables body corporate and individuals also\n\n       to seek authentication, that too on the basis of a contract between\n\n       the individual and such body corporate or person, would impinge\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_740\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters       Page 560 of 567</span>\n\f       upon the right to privacy of such individuals.

The Rajya\n\n       Sabha, therefore, becomes an important institution signifying\n\n       constitutional fedaralism. It is precisely for this reason that to\n\n       enact any statute, the Bill has to be passed by both the Houses,\n\n       namely, Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha.

It is also accepted by the\n\n       petitioners that <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1155\">Section 7</a> is the main provision of the Act. In fact,\n\n       introduction to the Act as well as Statement of Objects and\n\n       Reasons very categorically record that the main purpose of\n\n       Aadhaar Act is to ensure that such subsidies, benefits and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_742\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters      Page 562 of 567</span>\n\f       services reach those categories of persons, for whom they are\n\n       actually meant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1137\">       (c)     As all these three kinds of welfare measures are sought to\n\n       be extended to the marginalised section of society, a collective\n\n       reading thereof would show that the purpose is to expand the\n\n       coverage of all kinds of aid, support, grant, advantage, relief\n\n       provisions, facility, utility or assistance which may be extended\n\n       with the support of the Consolidated Fund of India with the\n\n       objective of targeted delivery.                It is also clear that various\n\n       schemes which can be contemplated by the aforesaid provisions,\n\n       relate to vulnerable and weaker section of the society. Whether\n\n       the social justice scheme would involve a subsidy or a benefit or\n\n       a service is merely a matter of the nature and extent of\n\n       assistance and would depend upon the economic capacity of the\n\n       State. Even where the state subsidizes in part, whether in cash\n\n       or kind, the objective of emancipation of the poor remains the\n\n       goal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1138\">       (d)     The respondents are right in their submission that the\n\n       expression subsidy, benefit or service ought to be understood in\n\n       the context of targeted delivery to poorer and weaker sections of\n\n       society.      Its connotation ought not to be determined in the\n\n       abstract. For as an abstraction one can visualize a subsidy being\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_743\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 &amp; connected matters              Page 563 of 567</span>\n\f       extended by Parliament to the King; by Government to the\n\n       Corporations or Banks; etc.               The nature of subsidy or benefit\n\n       would not be the same when extended to the poor and\n\n       downtrodden for producing those conditions without which they\n\n       cannot live a life with dignity.           That is the main function behind\n\n       the Aadhaar Act and for this purpose, enrolment for Aadhaar\n\n       number is prescribed in Chapter                 II which covers Sections 3 to\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1139\">       6. Residents are, thus, held entitled to obtain Aadhaar number.\n\n       We may record here that such an enrolment is of voluntary\n\n       nature. However, it becomes compulsory for those who seeks to\n\n       receive any subsidy, benefit or service under the welfare scheme\n\n       of the Government expenditure whereof is to be met from the\n\n       Consolidated Fund of India. It follows that authentication under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1156\">Section 7</a> would be required as a condition for receipt of a\n\n       subsidy, benefit or service only when such a subsidy, benefit or\n\n       service is taken care of by Consolidated Fund of India.\n\n       Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1157\">Section 7</a> is the core provision of the Aadhaar Act and\n\n       this provision satisfies the conditions of <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_1158\">Article 110</a> of the\n\n       Constitution.

This amounts to\n\n       depriving a person of his property.

Individually,\n\neach presents specific claims: of technology as the great enabler; and of\n\nbiometrics as the unique identifier. As recombinant elements, they create as it\n\nwere, new genetic material. Combined together, they present unforeseen\n\nchallenges for governance in a digital age. Part of the reason for these\n\nchallenges is that our law evolved in a radically different age and time. The\n\nlaw evolved instruments of governance in incremental stages. They were\n\nsuited to the social, political and economic context of the time. The forms of\n\nexpression which the law codified were developed when paper was\n\nubiquitous. The limits of paper allowed for a certain freedom: the freedom of\n\nindividuality and the liberty of being obscure. Governance with paper could\n\nlapse into governance on paper. Technology has become a universal\n\nlanguage which straddles culture and language. It confronts institutions of\n\ngovernance with new problems. Many of them have no ready answers.\n\n\n\n2     Technology questions the assumptions which underlie our processes of\n\nreasoning. It reshapes the dialogue between citizens and the state. Above all,\n\nit tests the limits of the doctrines which democracies have evolved as a shield\n\nwhich preserves the sanctity of the individual.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_753\">                                        6</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART A\n\n\n3         In understanding the interface between governance, technology and\n\nfreedom, this case will set the course for the future. Our decision must\n\naddress the dialogue between technology and power. The decision will\n\nanalyse the extent to which technology has reconfigured the role of the state\n\nand has the potential to reset the lines which mark off no-fly zones: areas\n\nwhere the sanctity of the individual is inviolable. Our path will define our\n\ncommitment to limited government. Technology confronts the future of\n\nfreedom itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1155\">\n\n4         Granville Austin, the eminent scholar of the Indian Constitution had\n\nprescient comments on the philosophy of the Indian Constitution. He found it\n\nin three strands:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1035\">                   “The Constitution…may be summarized as having three\n                   strands: protecting and enhancing national unity and integrity;\n                   establishing the institutions and spirit of democracy; and\n                   fostering a social revolution to better the mass of Indians...the\n                   three strands are mutually dependent and inextricably\n                   intertwined. Social revolution could not be sought or gained at\n                   the expense of democracy. Nor could India be truly\n                   democratic unless the social revolution had to establish a just\n                   society. Without national unity, democracy would be\n                   endangered and there would be little progress toward social\n                   and economic reform. And without democracy and reform, the\n                   nation would not hold together. With these three strands, the\n                   framers had spun a seamless web. Undue strain on, or\n                   slackness in any one strand would distort the web and risk its\n                   destruction and, with it, the destruction of the nation.\n                   Maintaining harmony between the strands predictably would\n                   present those who later work the Constitution with great\n                   difficulties…”2\n\n\n\n\n2   Granville Austin, Working a Democratic Constitution: A History of the Indian Experience, Oxford University\n    Press (2003) at page 6\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_754\">                                                       7</span>\n\f                                                                                                  PART A\n\n\nThese three strands are much like the polycentric web of which Lon Fuller has\n\nspoken.3 A pull on one strand shakes the balance between the others.

The difficulties that Granville Austin had\n\npredicted would arise in harmonising the strands of the “seamless web” are\n\nmanifested in the present case. This case speaks to the need to harmonise\n\nthe commitment to social welfare while safeguarding the fundamental values\n\nof a liberal constitutional democracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1157\">\n\n6         To usher in a social revolution, India espoused the framework of a\n\nwelfare state. The Directive Principles are its allies. The state is mandated to\n\npromote the welfare of its citizens by securing and protecting as effectively as\n\npossible a social order in which there is social, economic and political justice.\n\nGovernment plays a vital role in the social and economic upliftment of the\n\nnation’s citizenry by espousing equitable distribution of resources and creating\n\nequal opportunities. These are ideals that are meant to guide and govern\n\nState action.

Through its rights\n\njurisprudence, this Court has attempted to safeguard the rights in Part III and\n\nto impart enforceability to at least some of the Part IV rights by reading them\n\ninto the former, as intrinsic to a constitutionally protected right to dignity. The\n\nDirective Principles are a reminder of the positive duties which the state has to\n\nits citizens. While social welfare is a foundational value, the Constitution is the\n\nprotector of fundamental human rights. In subserving both those ideals, it has\n\nweaved a liberal political order where individual rights and freedoms are at the\n\nheart of a democratic society. The Constitution seeks to fulfil its liberal values\n\nby protecting equality, dignity, privacy, autonomy, expression and other\n\nfreedoms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1158\">\n\n8          Two recent books have explored the complexities of human identity.

He draws\n\ninspiration from the Roman playwright Terence who observes: “I am human. I\n\nthink nothing human alien to me.” Francis Fukuyama, on the other hand has a\n\ndistinct nuance about identity. In “Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the\n\nPolitics of Enlightenment5, he writes about how nations can facilitate\n\n“integrative national identities” based on liberal democratic values.

Can technologies which are held out to bring\n\nopportunities for growth, also violate fundamental human freedoms? Second,\n\nif the answer to the first is in the affirmative, how should the balance be struck\n\nbetween these competing interests?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1163\">\n\n13    Efficiency is a significant facet of institutional governance.

At the\n\nheart of the grounds on which the Aadhaar project has been challenged, lies\n\nthe issue of power. Our Constitution is a transformative document in many\n\nways. One of them is in defining and limiting the State’s powers, while\n\nexpanding the ambit of individual rights and liberties. It protects citizens from\n\ntotalitarian excesses and establishes order between the organs of the State,\n\nbetween the State and citizens and between citizens. Most importantly, it\n\nreaffirms the position of the individual as the core defining element of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_759\">                                       12</span>\n\f                                                                           PART A\n\n\npolity. That is the justification to restrain power by empowering all citizens to\n\nbe authors of their destiny. According to the Petitioners, the technological\n\npotential as well as the actual implementation of the Aadhaar project alters the\n\nbalance between the state and its citizens in this relational sphere and has the\n\npotential   to   permanently   redistribute   power   within   the   constitutional\n\nframework.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1164\">\n\n14    As far as citizen-state relations are concerned, the Constitution was\n\nframed to balance the rights of the individual against legitimate State interests.\n\nBeing transformative, it has to be interpreted to meet the needs of a changing\n\nsociety. As the interpreter of the Constitution, it is the duty of this Court to be\n\nvigilant against State action that threatens to upset the fine balance between\n\nthe power of the state and rights of citizens and to safeguard the liberties that\n\ninhere in our citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1165\">\n\n15    <a href=\"/doc/182504723/\" id=\"a_1166\">The present case</a> involves issues that travel to the heart of our\n\nconstitutional structure as a democracy governed by the rule of law.

As\n                   there is no assurance that public power will always, or even in\n                   most cases, be exercised in favour of the deprived and\n                   dispossessed, an important conception of development itself\n                   is accountability, by the wielders of public power, to the\n                   people affected by it and people at large. Accountability is the\n                   medium through which we can strike and maintain a balance\n                   between the governors and the governed.”10\n\n\n\nThese are some of the unique challenges of this case. They must be analysed\n\nin the context of our constitutional framework. The all-encompassing nature of\n\nthe Aadhaar project, its magnitude and the resultant impact on citizens’\n\nfundamental rights, make it imperative to closely scrutinize the structure and\n\neffect of the project.

Dignity is the core which unites the\n                    fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to\n                    achieve for each individual the dignity of existence. Privacy\n                    with its attendant values assures dignity to the individual and\n                    it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be\n                    of true substance.

Statutes may protect fundamental rights; they\n                    may also infringe them. In case any existing statute or any\n                    statute to be made in the future is an infringement of the\n                    inalienable right to privacy, this Court would then be required\n                    to test such statute against such fundamental right and if it is\n                    found that there is an infringement of such right, without any\n                    countervailing societal or public interest, it would be the duty\n                    of this Court to declare such legislation to be void as\n                    offending the fundamental right to privacy.”36\n\n\n\nA constitutional right may embody positive and negative ‘aspects’. They\n\nsignify mandates. At an affirmative level, they emphasise the content and\n\ndiversity of our liberties. As a ‘negative’, they impose restraints on the state\n\nand limit the power of the state to intrude upon the area of personal freedom.\n\n‘Negative’ in this sense reflects a restraint: the fundamental rights are a\n\nrestraining influence on the authority of power. In addition to keeping itself\n\nwithin the bounds of its authority, the state may have a positive obligation to\n\nperform.

Informational privacy\n\nrequires the state to protect it by adopting positive steps to safeguard its\n\ncluster of entitlements. The right to informational privacy is not only vertical\n\n(asserted and protected against state actors) but horizontal as well.\n\nInformational privacy requires legal protection because the individual cannot\n\nbe left to an unregulated market place. Access to and exploitation of individual\n\npersonal data – whether by state or non-state entities – must be governed by\n\na legal regime built around the principles of consent, transparency and\n\nindividual control over data at all times.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1183\">\n\n32         Privacy, being an intrinsic component of the right to life and personal\n\nliberty, it was held that the limitations which operate on those rights, under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1186\">Article 21</a>, would operate on the right to privacy.

From the\n                    United States where the terminology of ‘compelling state\n                    interest’ originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises two\n                    things- a ‘compelling state interest’ and a requirement of\n                    ‘narrow tailoring’ (narrow tailoring means that the law must be\n                    narrowly framed to achieve the objective). As a term,\n                    compelling state interest does not have definite contours in\n                    the US. Hence, it is critical that this standard be adopted with\n                    some clarity as to when and in what types of privacy claims it\n                    is to be used. Only in privacy claims which deserve the\n                    strictest scrutiny is the standard of compelling State\n                    interest to be used. As for others, the just, fair and\n                    reasonable standard under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1194\">Article 21</a> will apply. When\n                    the compelling State interest standard is to be employed\n                    must depend upon the context of concrete cases.”40\n                    (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nJustice Chelameswar’s view accepts the ‘fair, just and reasonable’ standard in\n\nthe generality of cases, carving an exception in cases of a certain category\n\nwhere a heightened scrutiny must apply.

Privacy is integral to the realization of human\n\ndignity and liberty. A society which protects privacy, values the worth of\n\nindividual self-realization.

There cannot be any dignity for those who suffer\n\n      starvation, subjugation, deprivation and marginalization and those who\n\n      are compelled to do work which is intrinsically below human dignity;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_801\">                                        53</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1176\">\f                                                                            PART C\n\n\nviii. The Aadhaar number does not convert individuals to numbers. The\n\n      Aadhaar number is necessary for authentication and it is solely used for\n\n      that purpose. The petitioners have conflated the concepts of identity and\n\n      identification. Authentication through a number is merely a technological\n\n      requirement which does not alter the identity of an individual;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1177\">ix.   Even if there is a conflict between the right to privacy and the right to food\n\n      and shelter, the Aadhaar Act strikes a fair balance. The Aadhaar Act\n\n      ensures human dignity and the right to life and liberty, hence there would\n\n      be no reasonable expectation of privacy and autonomy;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1178\">x.    The requirement to obtain an Aadhaar number under the Aadhaar Act\n\n      does not reflect a lack of trust in citizens. Authentication by the State\n\n      does not presume that all its citizens are dishonest. The provisions of the\n\n      Aadhaar Act are merely regulatory in nature - similar to the process of\n\n      frisking at airports or other offices - since there is no effective method to\n\n      ensure targeted delivery;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1179\">xi.   The “least intrusive test” is not applicable in the present case. The\n\n      requirement that the least intrusive means of achieving the State object\n\n      must be adopted, has been rejected by Indian courts in a catena of\n\n      decisions as it involves a value judgment and second guessing the\n\n      wisdom of the legislature.

The Aadhaar Act as a whole does not violate the fundamental right to\n\n       privacy;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1235\">ii.    The factors that save the Aadhaar Act from failing the proportionality test\n\n       are (a) Voluntariness to subject one ’s identity information to obtain\n\n       the Aadhaar ; (b) Informed consent when such identity information is\n\n       utilized; and (c) A draw on the Consolidated Fund of India;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1236\">iii.

The right to privacy cannot be asserted vicariously on behalf of others in\n\n      a representative capacity in a Public Interest Litigation, because unlike\n\n      other constitutional rights, right to privacy is a personal right. No <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1327\">Section 7</a>\n\n      beneficiary has claimed a violation of their right to privacy despite the\n\n      pendency of the petitions for 6 years before this Court and therefore, the\n\n      Petitioners&#x27; challenge, in a representative capacity, to <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1328\">section 7</a> on the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_814\">                                         66</span>\n\f                                                                           PART C\n\n\n        ground of a violation of the right to privacy of third parties is not\n\n        maintainable;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1243\">ii.     There is no increased threat to privacy due to Aadhaar at the level of\n\n        requesting entities (RE) for the following reasons:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1244\">        a. REs are already in possession of personal information of individuals\n\n            and inclusion of Aadhaar does not in any manner increase the threat\n\n            to privacy;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1245\">        b. Any information disclosed by REs will not be on account of Aadhaar\n\n            and will have to be dealt with under domain specific legislations, or a\n\n            data protection regime or agreements between the REs and their\n\n            customers; and\n\n        c. REs have data of their own customers and not of other REs’\n\n            customers, so there is no possibility of surveillance.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1246\">iii.    Safeguards against disclosure of information in the Aadhaar Act are\n\n        superior to the safeguards <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_1329\">laid down in</a> the PUCL case51. <a href=\"/doc/971685/\" id=\"a_1330\">Sections 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_1331\">28</a>\n\n        and <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_1332\">29</a> along with Chapter VII which deals with Offences and Penalties,\n\n        provide for protection of information and <a href=\"/doc/1670053/\" id=\"a_1333\">Section 33</a> lays down a strict\n\n        procedure for disclosure. Even though the Aadhaar Act is not required to\n\n        meet the same standard as <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_1334\">laid down in</a> PUCL, the safeguards in the Act\n\n        are not only adequate with regard to identity information and\n\n        authentication records, but far exceed the safeguards laid down PUCL;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1247\">51   (2011) 14 SCC 331\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_815\">                                           67</span>\n\f                                                                             PART C\n\n\n\niv.   The petitioners cannot contend that Section 33(2) of the Aadhaar Act\n\n      goes against the principles of natural justice and is disproportionate (as it\n\n      does not define the term “national security”) for the following reasons:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1248\">      a. What is in the interest of “national security” is not a question of law but\n\n         that of policy lying in the executive domain; and\n\n      b. Principles of natural justice cannot be observed strictly in a situation\n\n         implicating national security. In such cases, it is the duty of the court to\n\n         read into and provide for statutory exclusion.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1249\">v.    The laws, which are under challenge, are a part of a concerted scheme to\n\n      promote redistributive justice and ensure substantive equality, in\n\n      furtherance of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1335\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_1336\">, 38</a>, 39B and 39C. These laws ensure a more\n\n      transparent and a cleaner system, root out revenue leakages and evasion\n\n      of taxes, thereby giving genuine beneficiaries their rightful share in\n\n      subsidies;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1250\">vi.   The object of the Aadhaar Act, contrary to what the petitioners have\n\n      argued, is totally unrelated to suppression of freedom of speech and any\n\n      incidental effect, if at all, would not implicate the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1337\">Article\n\n      19(1)(a);</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1251\">vii. The petitioners cannot contend that Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act is\n\n      arbitrary or unreasonable for the following reasons:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_816\">                                         68</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1252\">\f                                                                         PART C\n\n\n    a. The offences and penalties under the Act are intended to maintain the\n\n       purity of data of the Aadhaar number holder and the integrity of the\n\n       CIDR, which are integral in achieving the object of the Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1253\">    b. Enrolment, storage of data in CIDR, and authentications are so vast\n\n       and inherently technical that any breach of the provisions, can be\n\n       effectively dealt with by the UIDAI;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1254\">    c. The individual has not been left remediless, as he/she can make a\n\n       complaint to the UIDAI directly or through the grievance redressal\n\n       centre [<a href=\"/doc/179995/\" id=\"a_1338\">Regulation 32</a> of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\n       Regulations, 2016]. After a complaint has been made, the UIDAI\n\n       would be obliged to examine the complaint and accordingly lodge a\n\n       complaint in a Court in terms of Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1255\">    d. Section 56 of the Aadhaar Act makes it clear that application of other\n\n       laws, like the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1339\">IT Act</a>, is not barred.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1256\">viii. Aadhaar must be made mandatory under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act for\n\n    the following reasons:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1257\">    a. Because of the involvement of biometrics, it is almost impossible for\n\n       one person to obtain two Aadhaar numbers. This will help in checking\n\n       the entry of fake and duplicate beneficiaries into any welfare scheme;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1258\">    b. Other methods which were employed over the last 70 years to check\n\n       duplication, siphoning of money in welfare schemes, large-scale tax\n\n       evasion, generation of black money, and appearance and re-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_817\">                                        69</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1259\">\f                                                                           PART C\n\n\n        appearance of duplicates, have turned out to be futile. If Aadhaar is\n\n        made voluntary, the same problems are likely to creep back into the\n\n        system; and\n\n     c. The State is bound to deploy the best technology available to it to\n\n        ensure proper allocation of resources as there is a constitutional\n\n        mandate upon the State under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1340\">Article 14</a> to efficiently utilize its\n\n        resources.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1260\">ix. There is no conflict between the Aadhaar Act and the Income Tax Act as\n\n     they are both stand alone laws and their scope of operation is different;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1261\">x.   Through the Aadhaar Act, the State is furthering the following obligations\n\n     under Part III and Part IV of the Constitution and international obligations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1262\">     a. The State has a positive obligation for securing socio-economic rights\n\n        like the basic right to food, shelter and livelihood of people arising out\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1341\">Article 21</a>, even though it is worded negatively;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1263\">     b.

An entitlement postulates a right. A\n\nright contemplates a liberty, for it is in the exercise of the liberty that the\n\nindividual asserts a right. What is a matter of an entitlement is evidently a\n\nmatter of option and not a compulsion. That constitutes the fundamental\n\npostulate of <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_1369\">Section 3</a>. However, the entitlement to obtain the Aadhaar\n\n\n\n\n55   <a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_1370\">Section 2(v)</a> states: “resident” means an individual who has resided in India for a period or periods amounting\n     in all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of\n     application for enrolment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_825\">                                                         76</span>\n\f                                                                                                       PART D\n\n\nnumber is conditioned by the requirement of submitting demographic and\n\nbiometric information and participating in the process of enrolment.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1204\">43       The collection of demographic and biometric information is carried out\n\nby an enrolling agency. “Enrolling agency” has been defined under <a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_1371\">Section\n\n2(l)</a> of the Act as an agency, appointed by UIDAI or a Registrar56, for collecting\n\ndemographic and biometric information of individuals under the Act. The\n\nenrolling agency need not be an entity of the state. The definition opens the\n\nspace for engagement of private entities in the collection of individual\n\ninformation for the process of enrolment. The enrolling agencies have to set\n\nup enrolment centers and they have to function in accordance with the\n\nprocedure specified by UIDAI.57 Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_1372\">Section 3</a> requires the\n\nenrolling agency to disclose to the individual, who is undergoing enrolment,\n\nthree important facets. The first is the manner in which the information which\n\nis disclosed by the individual would be used. The second relates to the nature\n\nof the recipients with whom the information is likely to be shared during the\n\ncourse of authentication. The third is founded upon the individual’s right of\n\naccess to the information disclosed. All these three facets are crucial to the\n\nlegislative design because they try to place individual autonomy at the\n\nforefront of the process. An individual who discloses biometric and\n\ndemographic information has a statutory entitlement to fully understand how\n\nthe information which is disclosed is going to be used and with whom the\n\n56 <a href=\"/doc/545792/\" id=\"a_1373\">Section 2(s)</a> states: “Registrar” means any entity authorised or recognised by the Authority for the purpose of\n   enrolling individuals under this Act\n57 <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1374\">Regulation 7</a>, Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_826\">                                                       77</span>\n\f                                                                            PART D\n\n\ninformation is likely to be shared during authentication.58 Access of the\n\ninformation supplied to the individual, it has been argued, is an integral feature\n\nof the design created by the statute. These three facets are conditions\n\nprecedent to the disclosure of information by the individual. Before the\n\nindividual does so, he or she must have a full disclosure which would enable\n\nthem to form an informed decision on the exercise of the choice which\n\nunderlies an entitlement to an Aadhaar number. The entitlement which is\n\nrecognised by sub-section (1) is enforced by the mandatory requirements of\n\nsub-section (2).              Before an Aadhaar number is issued, sub-section (3)\n\nrequires the authority to verify the information disclosed, in the manner\n\nprescribed by regulations. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1375\">The Act</a> leaves it to regulations to specify how\n\nverification will be carried out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1205\">\n\n44         <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_1376\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_1377\">5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/191105/\" id=\"a_1378\">6</a> indicate the characteristics which are attributed to\n\nAadhaar numbers, legislative recognition of the steps necessary to ensure\n\nfinancial inclusion and the requirement of periodical updation of information.\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/339978/\" id=\"a_1379\">Section 4</a>, three important features attach to the possession of an\n\nAadhaar number.

The condition which it embodies is for the receipt of a subsidy,\n\nbenefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred or the receipts form\n\npart of the Consolidated Fund of India.

Alternately, the individual has to\n\nfurnish proof that he or she possesses an Aadhaar number. However, if an\n\nAadhaar number has not been assigned to the individual, he or she would\n\nhave to make an application for enrolment. In a situation where no Aadhaar\n\nnumber has been assigned as yet, the proviso stipulates that alternate and\n\nviable means of identification would be provided to the individual for the\n\ndelivery of subsidies, benefits or services. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1391\">Section 7</a> indicates that while the\n\ncentral or state governments can mandate that an individual must undergo\n\nauthentication as a condition for the receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service, a\n\nfailure of authentication cannot be held out as a ground to deny benefits,\n\nsubsidies or services.

But in\n\n167176 and 167877 respectively, the Commons passed two resolutions to\n\ncurtail the powers of the House of Lords so that only the Commons had the\n\nsole right to direct or limit the scope of a Bill regarding taxation and\n\ngovernment expenditure.

The phrase used in the\n\nAct of 1911 expressly excluded courts from exercising their power of judicial\n\nreview over the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons. This\n\nlanguage was used in the 1911 Act to put an end to the constitutional\n\nskirmishes experienced by the House of Lords and the House of Commons in\n\nBritain for more than five hundred years, leading to the enactment of the 1911\n\nAct.92 The deviation from incorporating the language, used in the 1911 Act,\n\ninto the Indian Constitution is reflective of the intention of our Constitution\n\nmakers that they did not want to confer the same status on the power\n\nassigned to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as is provided to the Speaker of\n\nthe House of Commons. Had their intention been otherwise, they would have\n\nused the same language as that provided under the 1911 Act. Finality would\n\noperate as between the Houses of Parliament.

That is not so in India. Ours is a system founded on the\n\nsupremacy of the Constitution. Judicial review is an essential component of\n\nconstitutional supremacy. A Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/9416991/\" id=\"a_1529\">Kalpana\n\nMehta v Union of India93</a> has, while noticing this distinction, held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1378\">                    “…The fundamental difference between the two systems lies\n                    in the fact that parliamentary sovereignty in the Westminster\n                    form of government in the UK has given way, in the Indian\n                    Constitution, to constitutional supremacy.

The\n                    Constitution does not allow for the existence of absolute\n                    power in the institutions which it creates. Judicial review as a\n                    part of the basic features of the Constitution is intended to\n                    ensure that every institution acts within its bounds and\n                    limits.”94\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1294\">70         The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles\n\nprevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the\n\nConstitution are subject to its norms.                          No constitutional institution wields\n\nabsolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the\n\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason. The\n\nConstitution makers have envisaged a role for the judiciary as the expounder\n\nof the Constitution. The provisions relating to the judiciary, particularly those\n\nregarding the power of judicial review, were framed, as Granville Austin\n\nobserved, with “idealism”95. Courts of the country are expected to function as\n\nguardians of the Constitution and its values. Constitutional courts have been\n\nentrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public\n\nfunctionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional\n\noffice created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional\n\nparameters. Judicial review protects the principles and the spirit of the\n\nConstitution. Judicial review is intended as a check against arbitrary conduct\n\nof individuals holding constitutional posts. It holds public functionaries\n\naccountable to constitutional duties.

Constitutional\n\ninstitutions cannot be seen as focal points for the accumulation of power and\n\nprivilege. They are held in trust by all those who occupy them for the moment.\n\nThe impermanence of power is a sombre reflection for those who occupy\n\nconstitutional offices. The Constitution does not contemplate a debasement of\n\nthe institutions which it creates. The office of the Speaker of the House of\n\nPeople, can be no exception. The decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha in\n\ncertifying a Bill as a Money Bill is liable to be tested upon the touchstone of its\n\ncompliance with constitutional principles. Nor can such a decision of the\n\nSpeaker take leave of constitutional morality.\n\n\n\n71    Our Constitution does not provide absolute power to any institution. It\n\nsets the limits for each institution. Our constitutional scheme envisages a\n\nsystem of checks and balances. The power of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha,\n\nto decide whether a Bill is a Money Bill, cannot be untrammelled. The\n\ncontention that the decision of Speaker is immune from judicial review and\n\ncannot be questioned, is contrary to the entire scheme of the Constitution,\n\nwhich is premised on transparency, non-arbitrariness and fairness. The\n\nphrase “shall be final” used in <a href=\"/doc/1753411/\" id=\"a_1530\">Article 110(3)</a> has been adopted, as mentioned\n\nearlier, from <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_1531\">Article 22</a> of the Irish Constitution. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_1532\">Article 22</a> of\n\nthe Irish Constitution provide a mechanism for review of the certificate issued\n\nby the Speaker. Recourse is provided under the Irish Constitution by which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_869\">                                       117</span>\n\f                                                                          PART E\n\n\nthe members of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament can request the\n\nPresident of Ireland to refer the question of whether a Bill is a Money Bill, to a\n\nCommittee of Privileges. If the President refers the question to this\n\nCommittee, the decision of the Committee stands “final and conclusive”. The\n\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly did not adopt this mechanism. Absence\n\nof this mechanism does not mean that the decision of the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha cannot be subject to checks and balances, of which judicial review is\n\nan indispensable facet. The Speaker has to act within the domain, which the\n\nConstitution accords to the office of the Speaker. The power conferred on the\n\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha cannot be exercised arbitrarily, for it could damage\n\nthe scheme of the Constitution. Judicial review is the ultimate remedy to\n\nensure that the Speaker does not act beyond constitutional entrustment.\n\n\n\n72    The scope of the phrase “shall be final” can also be understood by\n\nlooking at the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly. The constitutional\n\nfoundation of <a href=\"/doc/352055/\" id=\"a_1533\">Article 110(4)</a> is based upon a suggestion of the Expert\n\nCommittee on Financial Provisions that when a Money Bill is transmitted from\n\nthe Lower House to the Upper House, it should be endorsed by the Speaker’s\n\ncertificate, so as to prevent any controversy “about the matter outside the\n\nLower House”. Therefore, the finality provided to the decision of the Speaker\n\nas to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, is aimed at avoiding any\n\ncontroversy on the issue in the Rajya Sabha and before the President. Had it\n\nbeen intended to prevent the court from adjudicating upon the validity of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_870\">                                       118</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART E\n\n\ndecision of the Speaker, the language of the Article would have made it\n\nexplicit.

A constitutional function is\n\nentrusted to the Speaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill under <a href=\"/doc/1753411/\" id=\"a_1570\">Article 110(3)</a>,\n\nto which the attributes of a judicial power do not apply. Indeed, the power\n\nwhich is entrusted to the Speaker under <a href=\"/doc/1753411/\" id=\"a_1571\">Article 110(3)</a> is integral to the\n\nlegislative process. But, the fact that the authority which a constitutional\n\nfunctionary exercises is not of a judicial character, is not sufficient to lead to\n\nthe conclusion that a finality clause governing the exercise of that power\n\nmakes it immune from judicial review. Where the entrustment of the power is\n\nsubject to the due fulfilment of constitutional norms, the exercise of jurisdiction\n\nis amenable to judicial review, to the extent necessary to determine whether\n\nthere has been a violation of a constitutional mandate. The nature and extent\n\nof judicial review would undoubtedly vary from a situation where finality has\n\nbeen attached to a judicial, administrative or quasi-judicial power. However, a\n\nclause on finality notwithstanding, it is open to the constitutional court to\n\ndetermine as to whether there has been a violation of a constitutional mandate\n\nas a result of which the decision suffers from a constitutional infirmity. The\n\nentrustment of a constitutional function to the Speaker under <a href=\"/doc/1753411/\" id=\"a_1572\">Article 110(3)</a> to\n\ncertify a Bill as a Money Bill is premised on the fulfilment of the norms\n\nstipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_1573\">Article 110(1).</a> A certification can be questioned on the ground\n108   Ibid, at page 708\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_878\">                                                 122</span>\n\f                                                                         PART E\n\n\nthat the Bill did not fulfil the conditions stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_1574\">Article 110(1)</a> to be\n\ndesignated as a Money Bill.

Law under a colonial regime was not just an instrument to maintain\n\norder but was a source of subordination.        Recognition of the vesting of\n\nabsolute authority was but a reflection of the premise that those who ruled\n\ncould not be questioned. Those who were ruled had to accept the authority of\n\nthe ruler. Nothing can be as divorced from constitutional principle as these\n\nnormative foundations of colonial law and history. The notion that power is\n\nabsolute is inconsistent with a Constitution which subjects the entrustment of\n\nfunctions to public functionaries to the restraints which accompany it. Our law\n\nmust recognise the need to liberate its founding principles from its colonial\n\npast. The Court should not readily accept the notion that the authority vested\n\nin a constitutional functionary is immune from judicial review. In the absence\n\nof a specific exclusion of judicial review, none can be implied. Moreover, any\n\nexclusion of judicial review must be tested on the anvil of its functionality. A\n\nspecific exclusion of judicial review, in order to be valid, must serve a\n\nconstitutional function. The test of functionality must relate to whether an\n\nexclusion of review is necessary to fulfil the overarching need for the proper\n\ndischarge of a constitutional role. Exclusion of review, to be valid, must fulfil\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_879\">                                      123</span>\n\f                                                                                        PART E\n\n\nthe requirement of a constitutional necessity. Its purpose cannot be to shield\n\nan excess of power from being questioned before the Court. Nor is the fact\n\nthat a power is vested in a high functionary a ground to shield it from scrutiny.\n\nThe ultimate test is whether the exclusion of judicial review is express and\n\nspecific and, whether such an exclusion is designed to achieve a\n\nconstitutional purpose that meets the test of functionality, assessed in terms of\n\na constitutional necessity. In the seventh decade of the republic, our\n\ninterpretation of the Constitution must subserve the need to liberate it from its\n\ncolonial detritus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1300\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107225908\" id=\"span_880\">This approach was adopted by a seven judge Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/107225908/\" id=\"a_1575\">Krishna\n\nKumar Singh v State of Bihar109</a>.

The appellant, which was a firm registered under the Mysore Sales\n\nTax Act, had to pay an additional amount as sales tax due to change in the\n\ncurrency. It was argued that by the substitution of 2 naya paisas (the new\n\ncurrency) in place of 3 pies (the old currency) as tax, there was a change in\n\nthe tax imposed by the Mysore Sales Tax Act, which could only have been\n\ndone by passing a Money Bill under <a href=\"/doc/771463/\" id=\"a_1605\">Articles 198</a><a href=\"/doc/1862193/\" id=\"a_1606\">, 199</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1391108/\" id=\"a_1607\">207</a> of the\n\nConstitution and since no Money Bill was introduced or passed for the\n\nenhancement of the tax, the tax was illegal and invalid. The contention,\n\ntherefore, was that the procedure envisaged for passing a Money Bill ought to\n\nhave been, but was not, followed. The Constitution Bench dismissed the\n\nappeal, holding that the substitution of a new coinage i.e. naya paisas in place\n\nof annas, pice and pies did not amount to an enhancement of tax. It was held\n\nto be merely a substitution of one coinage by another of equivalent value. This\n\nCourt held that the levy of tax in terms of naya paisas was not unconstitutional\n\nnor was it a taxing measure but it dealt merely with the conversion of the old\n\ncoinage into new coinage.

Democracies with a Presidential form of\n\ngovernment have adopted bicameral legislatures, the United States being the\n\nleading example. Among Parliamentary democracies, India and the UK have\n\nadopted bicameral legislatures. They are predominant in federal countries.\n\nWhere second chambers exist, they vary in terms of powers and composition.\n\nTogether, their powers and composition shape the impact that they have on\n\nlegislation.127 The phenomenon of the bicameral system has two different\n\nhistoric origins. It was first established in England, and later in the US.128 Both\n\nthese models have been replicated across the globe.\n\n\n\n85      Britain developed some of the earliest institutional practices that came\n\nto be emulated through the Western world. A separate powerful legislature\n\nwas initiated when King John in 1215 gave a written commitment to seek the\n\nconsent of Parliament to levy taxes to which he was entitled by feudal\n\nprerogative. Over the next five centuries, the British Parliament was\n\ntransformed from an institution summoned at the desire of the ruler to one\n\nwhich met on regular occasions to develop policy inclinations independent of\n\nthe wishes of the ruler.129 In the fourteenth century, Parliament was divided\n\ninto two chambers: one chamber (the House of Lords) in which debate took\n\nplace with the feudal lords and a second chamber (the House of Commons)\n\n\n127 Fathali M.

The lower chamber, the\n\nCommons,             represented         individuals        satisfying     a     substantial       property\n\nrequirement. The two chambers in Britain reflected a kind of class division.\n\nBefore the beginning of the eighteenth century, several factors such as civil\n\nwar, regicide, experimentation with a republic, and the restoration of the titular\n\nmonarch caused power to be permanently shifted from the King to\n\nParliament.131\n\n\n\nAround the same time, the British colonies in North America were crafting\n\ninstitutions of their own. Colonial legislatures were being conceptualized on\n\nsimilar lines, with some exceptions, to British Parliament. The Constitution for\n\nthe newly formed United States adopted a bicameral system.132 The\n\nlegislature in the United States was innovative, for it created a bicameral\n\narrangement that replaced a class basis (as was in existence in Britain) for\n\nchamber representation with a modified federal basis. The Constitutional\n\nConvention of 1787 had provided for a lower chamber, a directly-elected\n\nHouse of Representatives, where each voter had an equal vote in elections,\n\nand an upper chamber, a Senate, to which each state could send two\n\nmembers, elected indirectly by the state parliaments.

A system with two differently composed chambers was ultimately\n\nchosen to be the only way out of the deadlock.133 The rationale for a\n\nbicameral legislature comprising of a directly elected Lower House and an\n\nindirectly elected Upper House was best articulated by James Madison, in the\n\nFederalist Papers:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1406\">                 “First… a senate, as a second branch of the legislative\n                 assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first,\n                 must be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It\n                 doubles the security to the people, by requiring the\n                 concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation\n                 or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would\n                 otherwise be sufficient…\n                 Second. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the\n                 propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to\n                 the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be\n                 seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious\n                 resolutions…\n                 Third. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want\n                 of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of\n                 legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called\n                 for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued\n                 in appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent\n                 motive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study\n                 of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of\n                 their country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a\n                 variety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative\n                 trust… A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to\n                 the object of government, which is the happiness of the\n                 people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that\n                 object can be best attained…\n                 Fourth.

The literature on bicameralism has\n\nhighlighted the importance of having a second chamber in the legislature of a\n\nstate. William Riker has emphasized that a bicameral structure acts as a\n\ncontrol over the tyranny of a majority.135 Levmore similarly echoes this\n\nthought:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1409\">                 “At the very least, if the two chambers consider an issue\n                 simultaneously, one chamber’s agenda setter will be at the\n                 mercy of the order of consideration in the second chamber.\n                 Bicameralism can thus be understood as an antidote to the\n                 manipulative power of the convenor, or agenda setter, when\n                 faced with cycling preferences.”136\n\n\n\n\n134  James Madison, The Federalist No. 62 – The Senate, The Federalist Papers (1788), available at\n   http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa62.html\n135 William H.

In emerging democracies, and up until the\n                 present day, the choice of a bicameral system appears as a\n                 means of dispelling fear about the consequences of\n                 democratisation and reconciling established elites with the\n                 democratisation process. In developed democracies, the\n                 rationale of a bicameral system is now sought primarily in the\n                 possibility of combining different systems of representation\n                 (particularly in federal systems) and in the possibility of\n                 reconsideration by a different chamber in the legislative,\n                 making it possible to avoid making mistakes and enhancing\n                 both the quality and the stability of the legislation. In majority\n                 systems of the Westminster model - where the government is\n                 part of the lower house and it tends to have a stable majority -\n                 a senate moreover is sometimes ascribed the role of giving\n                 more independent input into the parliamentary work, less\n                 determined by party discipline, and of paying more attention\n                 to the interests of minorities. A bicameral system is, for that\n                 reason, sometimes recommended as a means to protect\n                 minorities against a tyranny of the majority… Finally, a\n                 bicameral system may also increase efficiency because it is\n                 possible to divide the legislative workload between two\n                 chambers. That can be the case when the two chambers\n                 absorb a sort of division of labour (e.g. an emphasis on\n                 technical legal quality in the senate). In many bicameral\n                 systems, moreover, it can be decided to put bills to either\n                 house, and the senate also has a right of initiative.”138\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1315\">87      The importance of the second chamber increases when there is no\n\nsingle party rule in Parliament.

The 1935 Act became the blueprint\n\nfor the structure of Parliament in the new Constitution. The Rajya Sabha, as\n\nthe Upper House of the Parliament, was adopted into the Constitution.

An analysis of the Bills revised by the\n\nRajya Sabha reveals that in a number of cases, the changes recommended\n\nby the Rajya Sabha in the Bills passed by the Lok Sabha were eventually\n\ncarried out.157 The Dowry Prohibition Bill is an example of a legislation in\n\nwhich the Rajya Sabha’s insistence on amendments led to the convening of a\n\njoint sitting158 of the two Houses and in that sitting, one of the amendments\n\n\n\n\n154 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\n   pages 7-8\n155 (2006) 7 SCC 1\n156 Ibid, at page 47\n157 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\n\n    page 5\n158 Dr Ambedkar explained that the joint sitting had been kept at the centre because of the federal character of\n\n    the Central Legislature.

The bicameral nature of Indian Parliament is integral to the\n\nworking of the federal Constitution. It lays down the foundations of our\n\ndemocracy. That it forms a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, is\n\nhence based on constitutional principle. The decision of the Speaker on\n\nwhether a Bill is a Money Bill is not a matter of procedure. It directly impacts\n\non the role of the Rajya Sabha and, therefore, on the working of the federal\n\npolity.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1422\">94         There is a constitutional trust which attaches to the empowerment of\n\nthe Speaker of the Lok Sabha to decide whether a legislative measure is a\n\nMoney Bill. Entrustment of the authority to decide is founded on the\n\nexpectation that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha will not dilute the existence of\n\na co-ordinate institution in a bicameral legislature. A constitutional trust has\n\nbeen vested in the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. By declaring an\n\nordinary Bill to be a Money Bill, the Speaker limits the role of the Rajya\n\nSabha. This power cannot be unbridled or bereft of judicial scrutiny. If the\n\npower of the Speaker is exercised contrary to constitutional norms, it will not\n\nonly limit the role of the Rajya Sabha, but denude the efficacy of a legislative\n\nbody created by the Constitution.

For a Bill to be a\n\nMoney Bill, it must contain “only provisions” dealing with every or any one of\n\nthe matters set out in sub-clauses (a) to (g) of clause 1 of <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_1660\">Article 110.</a> The\n\nexpression “if it contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following\n\nmatters, namely...” is crucial. Firstly, the expression “if” indicates a condition\n\nand it is only upon the condition being fulfilled that the deeming fiction of a Bill\n\nbeing a Money Bill for the purposes of the Chapter will arise. Secondly, to be a\n\nMoney Bill, the Bill should have only those provisions which are referable to\n\nclauses (a) to (g). The condition is much more stringent than stipulating that\n\nthe Bill should incorporate any of the matters spelt out in clauses (a) to (g).\n\nThe words “only provisions” means that besides the matters in sub clauses (a)\n\nto (g), the Bill shall not include anything else. Otherwise, the expression “only”\n\nwill have no meaning. The word “only” cannot be treated to be otiose or\n\nredundant. Thirdly, the two expressions “if it contains only provisions” and\n\n“namely” indicate that sub-clauses (a) to (g) are exhaustive of what a Money\n\nBill may contain. The contents of a Money Bill have to be confined to all or any\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_915\">                                        150</span>\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n\nof the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (g). Fourthly, sub-clause (g)\n\ncovers any matter incidental to sub-clauses (a) to (f). A matter is incidental\n\nwhen it is ancillary to what is already specified. Sub-clause (g) is not a\n\nresiduary entry which covers all other matters other than those specified in\n\nsub-clauses (a) to (f). If sub-clause (g) were read as a catch-all residuary\n\nprovision, it would defeat the purpose of defining a class of Bills as Money\n\nBills. What is incidental under sub-clause (g) is that which is ancillary to a\n\nmatter which is already specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f). The test is not\n\nwhether it is incidental to the content of a Bill but whether it is incidental to any\n\nof the matters specifically enumerated in sub-clauses (a) to (f). The Attorney\n\nGeneral would request the court to read the word “only” before “if” and not\n\nwhere it occurs. If the submission were to be accepted, it would lead to the\n\nconsequence that the Bill would be a Money Bill if it contained provisions\n\ndealing with clause (a) to (g), even if it contained other provisions not relatable\n\nto these clauses.

This means that the whole Bill need\n                   not be a money Bill: it may contain other provisions, but if\n                   there is any provision about taxation or borrowing, etc. It will\n                   come under this <a href=\"/doc/53397808/\" id=\"a_1676\">Section 37</a>, and the recommendation of the\n                   Governor-General is necessary. Now <a href=\"/doc/1226972/\" id=\"a_1677\">article 90</a> says that a\n                   Bill shall be deemed to be a money Bill if it contains only\n                   provisions dealing with the imposition, regulation, etc., of\n                   any tax or the borrowing of money, etc. This can mean\n                   that if there is a Bill which has other provisions and also\n                   a provision about taxation or borrowing etc., it will not\n                   become a money Bill. If that is the intention I have\n                   nothing to say; but that if that is not the intention I must\n                   say the word &quot;only&quot; is dangerous, because if the Bill\n                   does all these things and at the same time does\n                   something else also it will not be a money Bill.

The concern of these two members was that the word “only”\n\nrestricts the scope of a Bill being passed as a Money Bill. Their apprehension\n\nwas that if a Bill has other provisions which are unrelated to the clauses\n\nmentioned in draft <a href=\"/doc/1226972/\" id=\"a_1678\">Article 90</a>, the Bill would not qualify to be a Money Bill in\n\nview of the word “only”.

An attempt to provide a legislative framework\n\ngoverning the Aadhaar project was first made by introducing the National\n\nIdentification Authority of India Bill, 2010 (“NIA Bill”). The NIA Bill was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_934\">                                       166</span>\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n\nintroduced in the Rajya Sabha on 3 December 2010. The Preamble of the Bill\n\nindicated its purpose:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1429\">            “A Bill to provide for the establishment of the National\n            Identification Authority of India for the purpose of issuing\n            identification numbers to individuals residing in India and to\n            certain other classes of individuals and manner of\n            authentication of such individuals to facilitate access to\n            benefits and services to such individuals to which they are\n            entitled and for matters connected therewith or incidental\n            thereto.”\n\n\n\nThe main objective of the Bill was to establish the National Identification\n\nAuthority of India to issue unique identification numbers (called ‘Aadhaar’) to\n\nresidents of India and to any other category of people for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating access to benefits and services. Chapter II (Clauses 3 to 10) of the\n\nBill dealt with Aadhaar numbers. Clause 3 of the Bill entitled every resident to\n\nobtain an Aadhaar number on providing demographic and biometric\n\ninformation to the Authority in such manner as may be specified. Clause 4(3)\n\nstated that an Aadhaar number shall be accepted, subject to authentication,\n\nas proof of identity of the Aadhaar number holder. Chapter III (Clauses 11 to\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1430\">23) dealt with the National Identification Authority of India. Clause 11 provided\n\nfor establishment of the Authority by the Central Government. Clause 23\n\nempowered the Authority to develop the policy, procedure and systems for\n\nissuing Aadhaar numbers to residents and to perform authentication. Clause\n\n23(2)(h) stated that the Authority may specify the usage and applicability of\n\nthe Aadhaar number for delivery of various benefits and services.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1336\">Establishing, operating and maintaining of the Central Identities Data\n\nRepository (CIDR) by the Authority was provided under Clause 23(2)(j).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_935\">                                           167</span>\n\f                                                                          PART E\n\n\nChapter IV (Clauses 24 to 27) provide for grants, accounts and audit and\n\nannual reports related to the Authority. Clause 25 stated that the fees or\n\nrevenue collected by the Authority shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund\n\nof India and the entire amount would be transferred to the Authority. Chapter\n\nV (Clauses 28 and 29) dealt with creation of an Identity Review Committee\n\nand its functions. The functions of the Review Committee included\n\nascertaining the extent and pattern of usage of Aadhaar numbers across the\n\ncountry and preparing a report annually along with recommendations. Chapter\n\nVI (Clauses 30 to 33) dealt with the protection of individual identity information\n\nand authentication records. Clause 30(1) required the Authority to ensure the\n\nsecurity and confidentiality of identity information and authentication records of\n\nindividuals. Clause 30(2) required the Authority to take measures (including\n\nsecurity safeguards) to ensure that the information in the possession or\n\ncontrol of the Authority (including information stored in the Central Identities\n\nData Repository) is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorised\n\naccess or use or unauthorised disclosure. Clause 33 stated that individual\n\ninformation may be disclosed pursuant a court order or in the interest of\n\nnational security. Chapter VII (Clauses 34 to 46) created offences and\n\npenalties under the law. Clause 47 empowered the Central Government to\n\nsupersede the Authority. Clause 50 authorized the Authority to delegate to any\n\nMember, officer of the Authority or any other person such of its powers and\n\nfunctions (except the power under Clause 53). Clause 57 sought to validate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_936\">                                       168</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n\nactions taken by the Central Government under the Planning Commission’s\n\nnotification of 2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1337\">\n\n111     Since the UID programme involved complex issues, the NIA Bill was\n\nreferred, on 10 December 2010, to the Standing Committee on Finance,\n\nchaired by Mr Yashwant Sinha, for examination and report. The Standing\n\nCommittee comprised of 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 members\n\nfrom the Rajya Sabha. The Standing Committee submitted its Report175 on 11\n\nDecember 2011. The Report raised several objections to the Bill, which\n\nincluded those summarised below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1431\">(i)   Since law making was underway, the bill being pending, any executive\n\n      action is as violative of Parliament’s prerogatives as promulgation of an\n\n      ordinance while one of the Houses of Parliament is in session;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1432\">(ii) While the country is facing a serious problem of illegal immigrants and\n\n      infiltration from across the borders, the National Identification Authority of\n\n      India Bill, 2010 proposes to entitle every resident to obtain an Aadhaar\n\n      number, apart from entitling such other category of individuals as may be\n\n      notified from time to time. This will, it is apprehended, make even illegal\n\n      immigrants entitled for an Aadhaar number;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1433\">(iii) The issue of a unique identification number to individuals residing in India\n\n      and other classes of individuals under the Unique Identification (UID)\n\n\n175Forty-Second Report, Standing Committee on Finance (2011-12), available at\n  http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/uid%20report.pdf\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_937\">                                                   169</span>\n\f                                                                        PART E\n\n\n    Scheme is riddled with serious lacunae and concern areas. For example,\n\n    the full or near full coverage of marginalized sections for issuing Aadhaar\n\n    numbers could not be achieved mainly due to two reasons viz. (a) the\n\n    UIDAI doesn’t have the statistical data relating to them; and (b) estimated\n\n    failure of biometrics is expected to be as high as 15% because a large\n\n    chunk of population is dependent on manual labour;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1434\">(iv) Despite the presence of serious differences of opinion within the\n\n    Government on the UID scheme, the scheme continues to be\n\n    implemented in an overbearing manner without regard to legalities and\n\n    other social consequences;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1435\">(v) The UID scheme lacks clarity on many issues including even the basic\n\n    purpose of issuing an “Aadhaar” number. Although the scheme claims\n\n    that obtaining an Aadhaar number is voluntary, an apprehension has\n\n    developed in the minds of people that in future, services / benefits\n\n    including food entitlements would be denied in case they do not an have\n\n    an Aadhaar number;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1436\">(vi) It is also not clear as to whether possession of an Aadhaar number would\n\n    be made mandatory in future for availing of benefits and services. Even if\n\n    the Aadhaar number links entitlements to targeted beneficiaries, it may\n\n    not ensure that beneficiaries have been correctly identified. Thus, the\n\n    present problem of proper identification would persist;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_938\">                                     170</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1338\">\f                                                                            PART E\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1339\">(vii) Though there are significant differences between the identity system of\n\n    other countries and the UID scheme, yet there are lessons from the\n\n    global experience to be learnt before proceeding with the implementation\n\n    of the UID scheme, which the Ministry of Planning has ignored\n\n    completely;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1340\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1341\">(viii) Considering the huge database and possibility of misuse of information,\n\n    the enactment of a national data protection law is a pre-requisite for any\n\n    law that deals with large scale collection of information from individuals\n\n    and its linkages across separate databases. In the absence of data\n\n    protection legislation, it would be difficult to deal with issues like access to\n\n    and misuse of personal information, surveillance, profiling, linking and\n\n    matching of data bases and securing confidentiality of information;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1342\">(ix) The Standing Committee strongly disapproved of the hasty manner in\n\n    which the UID scheme was approved. Unlike many other schemes /\n\n    projects, no comprehensive feasibility study, which ought to have been\n\n    done before approving such an expensive scheme, was done involving all\n\n    aspects of the UID scheme including a cost-benefit analysis, comparative\n\n    costs of Aadhaar numbers and various existing forms of identity, financial\n\n    implications and prevention of identity theft, for example, using hologram\n\n    enabled ration cards to eliminate fake and duplicate beneficiaries;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1343\">(x) The UID scheme may end up being dependent on private agencies,\n\n    despite contractual agreements made by the UIDAI with several private\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_939\">                                       171</span>\n\f                                                                       PART E\n\n\n    vendors. As a result, the beneficiaries may be forced to pay over and\n\n    above the charges to be prescribed by the UIDAI for availing of benefits\n\n    and services, which are now available free of cost;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1344\">(xi) The scheme is full of uncertainty in technology as a complex scheme is\n\n    built up on untested and unreliable technology and on several\n\n    assumptions. It is also not known as to whether the proof of concept\n\n    studies and assessment studies undertaken by the UIDAI have explored\n\n    the possibilities of maintaining accuracy to a large level of enrolment of\n\n    1.2 billion people; and\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1345\">(xii) The Committee felt that entrusting the responsibility of verification of\n\n    information of individuals to the registrars to ensure that only genuine\n\n    residents get enrolled into the system may have far reaching\n\n    consequences for national security. Given the limitation of any\n\n    mechanism such as a security audit by an appropriate agency that would\n\n    be set up for verifying the information, it is not evident as to whether a\n\n    complete verification of information of all Aadhaar number holders is\n\n    practically feasible; and whether it would deliver the intended results\n\n    without compromising national security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_1346\">\n\nWith these apprehensions about the UID scheme, the Standing Committee on\n\nFinance categorically conveyed that the National Identification Authority of\n\nIndia Bill, 2010 was not acceptable. The Committee urged the Government to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_940\">                                     172</span>\n\f                                                                          PART E\n\n\nreconsider and review the UID scheme and the proposals contained in the Bill\n\nand bring forth a fresh legislation before Parliament. Ultimately, the NIA Bill\n\nwas withdrawn from the Rajya Sabha on 3 March, 2016.\n\n\n\n112   A comparison of the Aadhaar Act 2016 and NIA Bill 2010 reveals that\n\nboth have a common objective and framework − establishing a system of\n\nunique identity numbers, which would be implemented and monitored by a\n\nstatutory authority. The NIA Bill was not a Money Bill. It was never passed by\n\nthe Rajya Sabha. The Bill was scrutinized by a Standing Committee on\n\nFinance, which had 10 members from the Rajya Sabha and 21 from the Lok\n\nSabha. The NIA Bill did not contain a provision, similar to Section 7 of the\n\nAadhaar Act. Yet, as discussed earlier, the presence of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1785\">Section 7</a> does not\n\nmake the Aadhaar Act a Money Bill. Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money\n\nBill deprived the Rajya Sabha of its power to reject or amend the Bill. Since\n\nthe Aadhaar Act in its current form was introduced as a Money Bill in the Lok\n\nSabha,   the   Rajya    Sabha    had    no   option   other   than   of   making\n\nrecommendations to the Bill. The recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha\n\n(which also included deletion of <a href=\"/doc/174899/\" id=\"a_1786\">Section 57</a>) were rejected by the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe legislative history is a clear pointer to the fact that the subsequent\n\npassage of the Bill as a Money Bill by-passed the constitutional authority of\n\nthe Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha was deprived of its legitimate\n\nconstitutional role by the passage of the Bill as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_941\">                                       173</span>\n\f                                                                          PART E\n\n\n113   The Court must also address the contention of the Respondents that\n\nthe Aadhaar Act is “in pith and substance” a Money Bill. The learned Attorney\n\nGeneral for India has submitted that though the Act has ancillary provisions,\n\nits main objective is the delivery of subsidies, benefits and services flowing out\n\nof the Consolidated Fund of India and that the other provisions are related to\n\nthe main purpose of the Act which was giving subsidies and benefits. It has\n\nbeen submitted that the real test to be applied in the present dispute is the\n\ndoctrine of pith and substance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1347\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1057797\" id=\"span_942\">114   This Court has applied the doctrine of pith and substance when the\n\nlegislative competence of a legislature to enact a law is challenged.

The\n\nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution distributes legislative powers between\n\nthe Union and the States.

The scheme of distribution has varied\n                  with different Constitutions, but even when the Constitution\n                  enumerates elaborately the topics on which the Centre and\n                  the States could legislate, some overlapping of the fields of\n                  legislation is inevitable. The British North America Act, 1867,\n                  which established a federal Constitution for Canada,\n                  enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/105799473/\" id=\"a_1789\">Sections 91</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942568/\" id=\"a_1790\">92</a> the topics on which the\n                  Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate.\n                  Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be\n                  fairly full and comprehensive, it was not long before it\n                  was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections\n                  overlapped, and the Privy Council had time and again to\n                  pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the\n                  Dominion and Provincial legislatures. It was in this\n                  situation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine, that\n                  for deciding whether an impugned legislation was intra\n                  vires, regard must be had to its pith and substance.

For identification, additional information which is already stored in\n\ndatabases is needed since biometric systems can only compare information\n\nwhich is already submitted.185 Integral to such a system is the matching of a\n\nclaim of identity with biometric data collected and stored earlier.\n\n\n\nIn general, biometric applications are referred to as systems which allow one\n\nto authenticate claims. The verb ‘to authenticate’ can be described as ‘making\n\nauthentic, legally valid’.186 Originally, fingerprints were the most commonly\n\nknown and used biometric traits, but with improvements in technology,\n\nmultiple sources of biometric information have emerged.

This is particularly acute, given the fact that\n\ntechnological advancements have far outpaced legislative change. As a\n\nconsequence, the safeguards necessary to ensure protection of human rights\n\nand data protection are often missing. The lack of regulatory frameworks, or\n\nthe inadequacy of existing frameworks, has societal and ethical consequences\n\nand poses a constant risk that the concepts of privacy, liberty and other\n\nfundamental freedoms will be misunderstood, eroded or devalued.197\n\n\n\n123     Privacy has been recognized as a fundamental human right in various\n\nnational constitutions and numerous global and regional human rights treaties.\n\nIn today’s digital age, the right to privacy is “the cornerstone that safeguards\n\nwho we are and supports our on-going struggle to maintain our autonomy and\n\nself-determination in the face of increasing state power.”198\n\n\n\n124     The proliferation of biometric technology has facilitated the invasion of\n\nindividual privacy at an unprecedented scale. The raw information at the heart\n\nof biometrics is personal by its very nature.199 The Aadhaar Act recognises\n\nthis as sensitive personal information. Biometric technology is unique in the\n\nsense that it uses part of the human body or behaviour as the basis of\n\nauthentication or identification and is therefore intimately connected to the\n197 Ibid\n198 Privacy International, Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?, available at\n   https://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf\n199 Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_956\">                                                     185</span>\n\f                                                                               PART F\n\n\nindividual concerned. While biometric technology raises some of the same\n\nissues that arise when government agencies or private firms collect any\n\npersonal information about citizens, there are specific features that distinguish\n\nbiometric data from other personal data, making concerns about biometric\n\ntechnology of particular importance with regard to privacy protection.200\n\n\n\n125          There are two main groups of privacy- related interests that are directly\n\npertinent to the contemporary discussion on the ethical and legal implications\n\nof biometrics.201 The first group falls under ‘informational privacy’ and is\n\nconcerned with control of personal information. The ability to control personal\n\ninformation about oneself is closely related to the dignity of the individual, self-\n\nrespect and sense of personhood. The second interest group falls under the\n\nrubric of ‘physical privacy’. This sense of privacy transcends the purely\n\nphysical and is aimed essentially at protecting the dignity of the human\n\nperson. It is a safeguard against intrusions into persons’ physical bodies and\n\nspaces. Another issue is of property rights with respect to privacy, which\n\nconcerns the appropriation and ownership of interests in human personality. In\n\nmany jurisdictions, the basis of informational privacy is the notion that all\n\ninformation about an individual is in some fundamental way their own\n\nproperty, and it is theirs to communicate or retain as they deem fit.\n\n\n\n\n200   Ibid\n201   Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_957\">                                            186</span>\n\f                                                                         PART F\n\n\n126   The collection of most forms of biometric data requires some\n\ninfringement of the data subject’s personal space. Iris and fingerprint scanners\n\nrequire close proximity of biometric sensors to body parts such as eyes, hands\n\nand fingertips.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1363\">\n\nEven in the context of law enforcement and forensic identification, the use of\n\nfingerprinting is acknowledged to jeopardise physical privacy. Many countries\n\nhave laws and regulations which are intended to regulate such measures, in\n\norder to protect the individual’s rights against infringement by state powers\n\nand law enforcement. However, biometrics for the purpose of authentication\n\nand identification is different as they do not have a specific goal of finding\n\ntraces related to a crime but are instead conducted for the purpose of\n\ngenerating identity information specific to an individual. This difference in\n\npurpose actually renders the collection of physical biometrics a more serious\n\nbreach of integrity and privacy. It indicates that there may be a presumption\n\nthat someone is guilty until proven innocent. This would be contrary to\n\ngenerally accepted legal doctrine that a person is innocent until proven guilty\n\nand will bring a lot of innocent people into surveillance schemes.\n\n\n\n127   Concerns about physical privacy usually take a backseat as compared\n\nto concerns about informational privacy. The reason for this is that physical\n\nintrusion resulting from the use of biometric technology usually results from\n\nthe collection of physical information. However, for some people of specific\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_958\">                                      187</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART F\n\n\ncultural or religious backgrounds, even the mental harm resulting from\n\nphysical intrusion maybe quite serious.202\n\n\n\nAnother concern is that the widespread usage of biometrics substantially\n\nundermines the right to remain anonymous.203 People desire anonymity for a\n\nvariety of reasons, including that it is fundamental to their sense of freedom\n\nand autonomy. Anonymity may turn out to be the only tool available for\n\nordinary people to defend themselves against being profiled. Thus, it is often\n\nargued that biometric technology should not be the appropriate choice of\n\ntechnology as biometrics by its very nature is inconsistent with anonymity.\n\nGiven the manner in which personal information can be linked and identified\n\nusing biometric data, the ability to remain anonymous is severely diminished.\n\nWhile some argue that “it is not obvious that more anonymity will be lost when\n\nbiometrics are used”, this argument may have to be evaluated in light of the\n\nfact that there is no existing identifier that can be readily equated with\n\nbiometrics.204 No existing identifier can expose as much information as\n\nbiometric data nor is there any other identifier that is supposed to be so\n\nuniversal, long-lasting and intimately linked as biometrics. To say that the use\n\nof biometrics will not cause further loss of anonymity may thus be overly\n\noptimistic. Semi-anonymity maybe possible, provided that the biometric\n\nsystem is carefully designed from the inception.\n\n\n\n202 Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013).\n203 Ibid\n204 Ibid\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_959\">                                                     188</span>\n\f                                                                                                       PART F\n\n\nAnother significant change brought about by biometric technology is the\n\nprecipitous decline of ‘privacy by obscurity’, which is essentially “a form of\n\nprivacy afforded to individuals inadvertently by the inefficiencies of paper and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_960\">                                           205</span>\nother legacy recordkeeping.”                     Now that paper records worldwide are giving\n\nway to more efficient digital record-keeping and identification, this form of\n\nprivacy is being extinguished, and sometimes without commensurate data\n\nprivacy protections put in place to remedy the effects of the changes.”206\n\n\n\n128       Biometrically          enhanced           identity       information,         combined           with\n\ndemographic data such as address, age and gender, among other data, when\n\nused in increasingly large, automated systems creates profound changes in\n\nsocieties, particularly in regard to data protection, privacy, and security.\n\nBiometrics are at the very heart of identification systems. There are numerous\n\ninstances in history where the persecution of groups of civilians on the basis\n\nof race, ethnicity and religion was facilitated through the use of identification\n\nsystems.

The\n\npotential fear is that there are situations where there are few or no benefits to\n\nbe gained from strong user verification / identification and this is where\n\nbiometric technology may be unnecessary.207 (Example: When ascertaining\n\nwhether an individual is old enough to go to a bar and drink alcohol, it is\n\nunnecessary to know who the person is, when all that is needed to be\n\ndemonstrated is that the individual is of legal age). Fundamental rights are\n\nlikely to be violated in case biometrics are used for applications merely\n\nrequiring a low level of security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1366\">\n\n130        Biometric data, by its very nature, is intrinsically linked to characteristics\n\nthat make us ‘humans’ and its broad scope brings together a variety of\n\npersonal elements. It is argued that the collection, analysis and storage of\n\nsuch innate data is dehumanising as it reduces the individual to but a number.\n\nUltimately, organisations and governmental agencies must demonstrate that\n\nthere is a compelling legitimate interest in using biometric technology and that\n\nan obligatory fingerprint requirement is reasonably related to the objective for\n\nwhich it is required. One way of avoiding unnecessary collection of biometric\n\ndata is to set strict legal standards to ensure that the intrusion into privacy is\n\ncommensurate with and proportional to the need for the collection of bio-\n\nmetric data.208\n\n\n\n\n207   Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013).\n208   Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_963\">                                                       190</span>\n\f                                                                           PART F\n\n\nF.2        Consent in the collection of biometric data\n\n\n131        Rules on the collection of physical data by government agencies usually\n\nspecify under what conditions a person can be required to provide fingerprints\n\nand/or bodily tissues.

This action of UIDAI raises privacy concerns especially since the\n\nfingerprints were collected from rural regions where people may not have\n\nbeen aware or made aware by UIDAI before collection of fingerprints, of the\n\npossible privacy harms of giving up biometrics.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_972\">                                     199</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART F\n\n\nBSC          after     reviewing       international        standards        and      current      national\n\nrecommendations, concluded that a fingerprints-based biometric system was\n\nto be at the core of UIDAI’s de-duplication efforts and that the ISO 19794\n\nseries of biometrics standards for fingerprints, face and iris set by the\n\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) were most suitable for the UID\n\nproject.229 BSC also observed that while a fingerprints-based biometric system\n\nshall be at the core of UIDAI’s de-duplication efforts, its accuracy in the Indian\n\ncontext could not predicted in the absence of empirical data:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1448\">                     “The Committee notes that face is the most commonly\n                     captured biometric, and frequently used in manual checking.\n                     However, stand-alone, automatic face recognition does not\n                     provide a high level of accuracy, and can only be used to\n                     supplement a primary biometric modality.

The uniqueness of biometric data is not\n\nabsolute, it is relative. Not everyone will have a particular biometric trait, or an\n\nindividual’s biometric trait may be significantly different from the ‘normal’\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_985\">                                        212</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART F\n\n\nexpected trait. Some people may be missing fingerprints due to skin or other\n\ndisease, which may cause further problems when enrolling a large population\n\nin a fingerprint-based register. Discrimination concerns may also be raised in\n\nsuch a case. Therefore, a large scale biometric scheme will usually need to\n\nutilise more than one biometric. For example- both fingerprint and face to\n\nensure all people can be enrolled.254\n\n\n\nThe stability of even so called stable types of biometric data is not absolute.\n\nEach time an individual places a fingerprint on a fingerprint reader, the pattern\n\nmay appear to be the same from a short distance, but there are actually small\n\ndifferences in the pattern due to dryness, moisture and elasticity of the skin.\n\nMoreover, cuts and scratches can alter the pattern. Similarly, even the iris, a\n\npopular biometric measurement suffers from difficulties in obtaining a valid\n\nimage. The iris can also be hindered by specula reflections in uncontrolled\n\nlighting situations. These problems also apply to other relatively stable\n\nbiometric identifiers.255\n\n\n\n151     Sections 6256 and 31(2)257 of the Aadhaar Act place an additional onus\n\non individual Aadhaar holders to update their information.

Critics of the Aadhaar\n\nprogram however point to the fact that provisions for updation fly in the face of\n\nUIDAI’s repeated advertisements that Aadhaar enrolment is a “one-time”\n\naffair, as it is not and will never be. Moreover, there is no way in which a\n\nperson can estimate that he or she is due for an update, as this is not\n\nsomething that can be discerned by actions as innocuous as looking in the\n\nmirror or at one’s fingers, and therefore there remains no objective means of\n\ncomplying with the above sections. In fact, an authentication failure and a\n\nsubsequent denial of welfare benefits, a subsidy or a service that an individual\n\nis entitled to might be the only way one comes to the conclusion that his or her\n\nbiometrics need to be updated in the CIDR.258\n\n\n\nMoreover, since the promise of Aadhaar as a unique identity hinges on the\n\nuniqueness of biometrics, it would be logical to assume that any update to\n\nbiometric data should go through the same rigour as a new enrolment.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/143897288/\" id=\"a_1846\">Regulation 19(a)</a>, entitled ‘Modes of Updating Residents Information’ under\n\nChapter IV of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016\n\nprovides:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1406\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1461\">258 L.

On the other hand, the fundamental rights are justiciable because\n\n<a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_1859\">Article 13</a> provides that a law which takes them away or abridges them will be\n\nvoid. The conflict as Gadbois sees it is this:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1488\">                  “the directive principles are a set of instructions to the\n                  Government of the day to legislate into being a welfare state,\n                  which means, of course, an emphasis on the social and\n                  economic uplift of the community at large and a\n                  corresponding subtraction from individual rights. It is the duty\n                  of the Government to apply these principles in making laws.\n                  In short, the Constitution confers upon the Supreme Court the\n                  task of making the fundamental rights meaningful against\n                  possible infringements by the legislatures and executives,\n                  and makes it obligatory for the Government to bring about\n                  changes in the social and economic life of the nation,\n                  changes which were bound to affect adversely some private\n                  rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1489\">                  It is conceivable at least, that both the Supreme Court and the\n                  Government could have pursued their respective tasks\n                  without conflict, but this did not happen. The legislatures,\n                  purporting to be doing no more than carrying out the duties\n                  prescribed in the directive principles, enacted legislation\n                  which the Supreme Court found to be in conflict with some of\n                  the fundamental rights.”285\n\n\n283 Ibid, at pages 193-194\n284 Ibid, at page 195\n285 Ibid, at pages 195-196\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_998\">                                                  225</span>\n\f                                                                            PART G\n\n\nThis formulation by Gadbois formed part of a dissertation in April 1965. The\n\nevolution of jurisprudence in India since then has altered the Constitutional\n\ndialogue. Over time, the values enshrined in the Directive Principles have\n\nbeen read into the guarantees of freedom in Part III. In incremental stages, the\n\nrealisation of economic freedom has been brought within the realm of\n\njusticiability, at least as a measure of the reasonableness of legislative\n\nprogrammes designed to achieve social welfare.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1490\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1215719\" id=\"span_999\">163        As our constitutional jurisprudence has evolved, the Directive Principles\n\nhave been recognised as being more than a mere statement of desirable\n\ngoals. By a process of constitutional interpretation, the values contained in\n\nthem have been adopted as standards of reasonableness to expand the\n\nmeaning and ambit of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the\n\nConstitution.286 In doing so, judicial interpretation has attempted to imbue a\n\nsubstantive constitutional content to the international obligations assumed by\n\nIndia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International\n\nCovenant on Economic and Social and Cultural Rights. Eradicating extreme\n\npoverty and hunger is a significant facet of the Millennium Development Goals\n\nof the United Nations. Social welfare legislation is but a step to achieve those\n\ngoals. The enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/193125601/\" id=\"a_1860\">National Food Security Act</a> 2013 constituted a\n\nmilestone in legislative attempts to provide food security at the household\n\nlevel. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1861\">The Act</a> discerns a targeted Public Distribution System for providing\n\nfood-grains to those below the poverty line.

Development in the constitutional context is not only\n\neconomic development assessed in terms of conventional indicators such as\n\nthe growth of the gross domestic product or industrial output. The central\n\nexercise of development in a constitutional sense is addressing the\n\n“deprivation, destitution and oppression”289 that plague an individual’s life.\n\n\n\n165      In a traditional sense, freedom and liberty mean an absence of\n\ninterference by the state into human affairs. Liberty assumes the character of\n\na shield. The autonomy of the individual is protected from encroachment by\n\nthe state. This formulation of political rights reflects the notion that the state\n\nshall not be permitted to encroach upon a protected sphere reserved for\n\nindividual decisions and choices. What the state is prevented from doing is\n\ncouched in a negative sense. Civil and political rights operate as restraints on\n\nstate action. They postulate a restriction on the state. Isaiah Berlin formulates\n\nthe negative conception of liberty thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1491\">                “I am … free to the degree to which no man or body of man\n                interferes with my activity. Political liberty is simply the area\n                within which a man can act unobstructed by others.”290\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1418\">166      Individual freedom, in this conception, imposes a duty of restraint on the\n\nstate.     Modern ideas of neo liberalism have funnelled this notion.

A free market economy with minimum state control, in\n\nthis view, is regarded as integral to protecting individual rights and freedoms.\n\nFA Hayek construes the content of liberty as meaning the absence of\n\nobstacles. Resultantly, this notion of liberty regards the role of the state in a\n\nnarrow jurisprudential frame. Attempts by the state to pursue social justice or\n\nto use its authority for redistribution of wealth would in this conception not be a\n\nlegitimate use of state power.291\n\n\n\n167        The notion that liberty only consists of freedom from restraint does not\n\ncomplete the universe of its discourse. Broader notions of liberty are cognizant\n\nof the fact that individuals must be enabled to pursue their capacities to the\n\nfullest degree. Social and economic discrimination poses real barriers to\n\naccess education, resources and the means to a dignified life. This approach\n\nto understanding the content of freedom construes the ability to lead a\n\ndignified existence as essential to the conception of liberty and freedom. The\n\nintegral relationship between removal of socio-economic inequality and\n\nfreedom has been eloquently set out by Amartya Sen in “Development as\n\nFreedom”292:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1492\">                    “Development requires the removal of major sources of\n                    unfreedom: poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic\n                    opportunities as well as systematic social deprivation, neglect\n                    of public facilities as well as intolerance or overactivity of\n                    repressive states.     Despite unprecedented increases in\n                    overall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary\n                    freedoms to vast numbers – perhaps even the majority-of\n                    people.

In other cases, the unfreedom links closely\n                        to the lack of public facilities and social care, such as the\n                        absence of epidemiological programs, or of organized\n                        arrangements for health care or educational facilities, or of\n                        effective institutions for the maintenance of local peace and\n                        order. In still other cases, the violation of freedom results\n                        directly from a denial of political and civil liberties by\n                        authoritarian regimes and from imposed restrictions on the\n                        freedom to participate in the social, political and economic life\n                        of the community.”\n\n\nIn Sen’s analysis,                   human       development is influenced                  by economic\n\nopportunities, political liberties, social powers, and the enabling conditions of\n\ngood health, basic education, and the encouragement and cultivation of\n\ninitiatives. Taking it further, Sen has recognized an important co-relation in\n\nterms of the non-availability of basic economic conditions:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1493\">                        “Economic unfreedom, in the form of extreme poverty, can\n                        make a person a helpless prey in the violation of other kinds\n                        of freedom… Economic unfreedom can breed social\n                        unfreedom, just as social or political unfreedom can also\n                        foster economic unfreedom.”293\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1419\">168         The notion of freedom as an agency has been developed by Sen as\n\npart of the ‘capability theory’. The necessary consequence of focusing upon\n\nmajor sources of unfreedom, in a social and economic perspective, is that the\n\nremoval of these restraints is essential to the realization of freedom. If true\n\nfreedom is to be achieved through the removal of conditions which cause\n\nsocial and economic deprivation, the role of the state is not confined to an\n\nabsence of restraint. On the contrary, the state has a positive obligation to\n\n\n\n293   Ibid, at page 8\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1004\">                                                        230</span>\n\f                                                                                                   PART G\n\n\nenhance individual capabilities. Martha Nussbaum294 argues that realising\n\nfreedom requires the state to discharge positive duties. Nussbaum expresses\n\na threshold level of capability below which true human functioning is not\n\navailable. Freedom is seen in terms of human development and is the process\n\nby which individuals can rise above capability thresholds. In the realisation of\n\nbasic rights, the state is subject to positive duties to further the fulfilment of\n\nfreedom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1420\">\n\n169     The broader conception of freedom and liberty which emerges from the\n\nwritings of Sen and Nussbaum has direct consequences upon how we view\n\ncivil and political rights and socio-economic rights. The distinction between\n\nthe two sets of rights becomes illusory once civil and political rights are\n\nregarded as comprehending within their sweep a corresponding duty to take\n\nsuch measures as would achieve true freedom. Henry Shue295 suggests that\n\nrights give rise to corresponding duties. These duties include:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1494\">(i) a duty to respect;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1495\">(ii) a duty to protect; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1496\">(iii) a duty to fulfil.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1421\">Duties of respect embody a restraint on affecting the rights of others. Duties\n\nto protect mandate that the state must restrain others in the same manner as\n\nit restrains itself. The state’s duty of non-interference extends to private\n\nindividuals. The duty to fulfil connotes aiding the deprived in the realisation of\n\n\n294Martha Nussbaum, Women and Human Development, Cambridge University Press, (2000)\n295Henry Shue, Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence and US Foreign Policy, Princeton University Press, Second\n  Edition (1996)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1005\">                                                    231</span>\n\f                                                                               PART G\n\n\nrights. This imposes a corresponding duty to create the conditions which will\n\nfacilitate the realisation of the right.        The right which is protected for the\n\nindividual will also signify an expectation that the state must create institutions\n\nenabling the exercise of facilitative measures or programmes of action, of an\n\naffirmative nature. The state has affirmative obligations to fulfil in the\n\nrealisation of rights. These positive duties of the state are readily apparent in\n\nthe context of welfare entitlements when the state must adopt affirmative\n\nsteps to alleviate poverty and the major sources of economic and social non-\n\nfreedom. But the thesis of Nussbaum and Shue have an important role for the\n\nstate to discharge in ensuring the fulfilment of political rights as well. In a\n\nhighly networked and technology reliant world, individual liberty requires the\n\nstate to take positive steps to protect individual rights. Data protection and\n\nindividual privacy mandate that the state put in place a positive regime which\n\nrecognises, respects and protects the individual from predatory market places.\n\nThe state has a positive duty to create an autonomous regulatory framework\n\nin which the individual has access to remedies both against state and non-\n\nstate actors, both of whom pose grave dangers of assault on the individual as\n\nan autonomous entity. Failure to discharge that duty is a failure of the state to\n\nrespect, protect and fulfil rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1422\">Dr Ambedkar’s prophetic final address to the Constituent Assembly elaborates\n\nthat vision:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1497\">               “On the social plane, we have in India a society based on the\n               principle of graded inequality with elevation for some and\n               degradation for others.

According to the State,\n\nthough the Aadhaar programme is not in itself a social security programme,\n\nthe institutional framework established by the Act, seeks to act, in a way, as\n\nan extension of social security programmes. The State has a legitimate\n\nconcern to check that the welfare benefits which it marks for those, who are\n\nentitled, reach them without diversion. The Aadhaar programme, it is argued,\n\nacts as an instrument for the realization of the benefits arising out of the social\n\nsecurity programmes. The Aadhaar programme, it was further contended,\n\nfulfils the State’s concern that its resources are utilised fully for human\n\ndevelopment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_1432\">\n\nIt has been contended by the Respondents that since the establishment of the\n\nUIDAI in 2009, its basic mandate is to provide a unique identity number to\n\nresidents.

Second, it would be used for the purpose of identifying\n\nbeneficiaries for the transfer of social welfare benefits, provided by the state.\n\nThe rationale for establishing a method of identification is to ensure that the\n\nbenefits provided by social welfare programmes formulated by the State reach\n\nthe beneficiaries for whom they are intended.                          As a policy intervention, a\n\nunique measure of identification is intended, it has been argued, to secure\n\nfinancial inclusion. A significant hurdle in the success of social welfare\n\nprogrammes is that benefits do not reach the targeted population.

The\n\nnature of their work renders their lives peripatetic. Nomadic tribes, particularly\n\nin inaccessible areas, may not have fixed homes. In many cases, traditional\n\noccupations require individuals to move from place to place, dependent on\n\nseasonal changes. Then again, groups of citizens including women, children\n\nand the differently abled may face significant difficulties in accessing benefits\n\nunder publicly designed social welfare programmes as a result of factors such\n\nas gender, age and disability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1433\">\n\n176   Unequal access to welfare benefits provided by the State becomes a\n\nsignificant source of deprivation resulting in a denial of the means to sustain\n\nlife and livelihood. Before the adoption of Aadhaar based-identity, there were\n\nmultiple platforms for identification of residents. They created a situation\n\nwhere those with no identity had no access to the means of sustaining a\n\ndignified life. Equally significant, as a policy intervention, was the issue of\n\ncapture. While on the one hand, large swathes of the population had no\n\naccess to welfare assistance, benefits could be captured by persons not\n\nentitled to them either by the assertion of fake or multiple identities. Setting up\n\na fake identity enables an individual to pass off as another and to secure a\n\nbenefit to which that individual is not entitled. Fake identities compound the\n\nproblem of capture by allowing individuals to receive multiple benefits through\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1017\">                                       242</span>\n\f                                                                         PART G\n\n\nshell identities. Policy makers were confronted with the serious problems\n\nposed by fake and multiple identities since they imposed a burden on the\n\nexchequer while at the same time diluting the efficacy of state designed social\n\nwelfare measures. The burden on the exchequer is illustrated by situations\n\nwhere persons who are not entitled to benefits secure them in the guise of\n\nbeing persons entitled to them. When imposters secure benefits which are\n\nnot meant for them, they deprive in the process, persons who are genuinely\n\nentitled to benefits. The class of beneficiaries of social welfare programmes is,\n\nso to speak, adulterated by the capture of benefits by those not entitled to\n\nthem. This raises serious concerns of the deprivation of human rights. The\n\ncapture of benefits has the consequence of depriving those to whom these\n\nbenefits should legitimately flow, of the measures designed by the state to\n\nprotect its populace from human want and need. The resources deployed by\n\nthe state are from its public revenues. When designing a unique measure of\n\nidentification, the state must be guided by the necessity of ensuring financial\n\ninclusion and of protecting against financial exclusion. Every citizen who is\n\neligible for social welfare benefits should obtain them.     No person who is\n\nentitled should be excluded. Individuals who do not qualify for social welfare\n\nbenefits should not capture them by passing off as individuals entitled.\n\nEnforcing and implementing a robust platform for identification of beneficiaries\n\nmust ensure that social welfare benefits reach the hands of those who fulfil the\n\nconditions of eligibility and are not captured by rent-seeking behaviour of\n\nthose to whom social welfare benefits are not designed. This constitutes a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1018\">                                      243</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART G\n\n\nlegitimate object of state policy. Reaching out to the targeted population is a\n\nvalid constitutional purpose. Social welfare measures are an intrinsic part of\n\nstate policy designed to facilitate dignified conditions of existence to the\n\nmarginalised, especially those who live below the poverty line. Identification\n\nof beneficiaries is crucial to the fulfilment of social welfare programmes.\n\n\n\n177   These concerns form the basis of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of\n\nFinancial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016. As its\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons explains:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1519\">             “The correct identification of targeted beneficiaries for delivery\n             of various subsides, benefits, services, grants, wages and\n             other social benefits schemes which are funded from the\n             Consolidated Fund of India has become a challenge for the\n             Government. The failure to establish identity of an individual\n             has proved to be a major hindrance for successful\n             implementation of these programmes. This has been a grave\n             concern for certain categories of persons, such as women,\n             children, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, migrant\n             unskilled and unorganised workers, and nomadic tribes.

An identity is a\n\nstatement of who an individual is. Our identities define who we are. They\n\nexpress what we would wish the world to know us as. The human personality\n\nis, at a certain level, all about identity, for it is through the assertion of identity\n\nthat each individual seeks to preserve the core of his or her humanity. An\n\nidentity is the persona which an individual puts forth in a multitude of\n\nrelationships. The significance of our identity lies in our ability to express the\n\ncore of our beings. When the Constitution protects our right to be and to be\n\nwhat we are, it creates a space where the individual is immune from\n\ninterference.    By recognizing our liberty as autonomous persons, the\n\nConstitution recognizes our ability to preserve and shape our identities in\n\ninteractions with others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1437\">\n\n\nIdentity may be, but is not always based upon immutable characteristics that\n\nare defined at birth. What is immutable may not be or, at any rate, is not\n\ngenerally understood as being capable of change.               But even here, the\n\nimmutability of our features is relative to our own existence and is capable of\n\nbeing shaped by the social milieu in which human beings lead their lives.\n\nFeatures about our biological being which are defined at birth are, after all, not\n\nas constraining upon our identities as is often assumed to be the case. That\n\nis because these immutable features are also constantly engaged with our\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1022\">                                         247</span>\n\f                                                                           PART G\n\n\nsocial and cultural environment.

Identification is\n\na matter of proof- of establishing that a person is actually, the individual who\n\nclaims a right or entitlement. In their daily interactions, individuals have to\n\ndistinguish themselves from others, whether it be in the course of\n\nemployment, travel, civil union, location, community perspectives, revenue\n\nobligations or access to benefits. Identification is a proof of identity or\n\nevidence of identity. Identification is mandatory in numerous activities of day\n\nto day life: a passport is necessary for international travel, a voter ID is\n\nrequired for exercising electoral rights, a driving license is necessary to ply a\n\nvehicle and an arms license is needed to possess a fire arm. The holder of a\n\npolicy of medical insurance will have a card depicting his or her identity which\n\nis a proof of holding a valid policy for availing medical benefits.\n\n\n\n\n181   Under international law, recognition of identity is an obligation of a\n\nnation state. <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_1880\">Article 6</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides\n\nthat “everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the\n\nlaw”. <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_1881\">Article 16</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is in\n\nsimilar terms. <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_1882\">Article 8</a> of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\n\nmandates that State parties undertake to respect the right of the child to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1023\">                                        248</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART G\n\n\npreserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as\n\nrecognized by law without unlawful interference.

Shah notes that ever since 2009, the terms ‘identity’ and\n\n‘identification’ were used as part of the Aadhaar project inter-changeably,\n\nintroducing “a curious conflation and interoperability”310 between these\n\nnotions. ‘Identification’ is the ability of a network device to identify an individual\n\nby scanning unique data sets, from personal information to biometric details\n\nsuch as finger print and iris scan, which would be stored in a massive\n\ncentralized database. UIDAI posited that identification took place through its\n\nyes/no mechanism by which the centralised database would provide a\n\nresponse to whether the biometric details submitted for authentication match\n\nthose in the repository. Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a\n\nmeans of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also\n\noffered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not\n\nhave possessed one at all. Shah, in the course of his article, has this to state\n\nabout the conflation between identity and identification in the Aadhaar project:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1534\">                 “This ambiguity and conflation cannot merely be attributed to\n                 a semantic slip of the keyboard, but to a much larger\n                 phenomenon which points to the construction of a new notion\n                 of the individual, through big data streams and measures of\n                 self-quantification. It offers us a techno-social framework\n                 where the machine function of identification is wedded to the\n                 human expression of identity, and thus offers an inroad into\n                 looking at what happens when our identities are mediated,\n                 mitigated, facilitated, and contained by the ways in which the\n                 networked technologies of authentication and verification\n                 operate.

This is\n                   why the Aadhaar enrolment system, for instance, does not\n                   check the veracity of the information that the individual gives\n                   it. For the enrolment, the individual needs no proof to\n                   substantiate or validate the information provided. The name,\n                   the address, the description, etc. are empty signifiers and it is\n                   possible for anybody to assume any identity as long as they\n                   give the inviolable data of biometric recognition. Thus, the\n                   identity of the person being enrolled and registered is almost\n                   insignificant and has value only in how it would now always\n                   identify the individual through the credentials or information\n                   provided. The Aadhaar network governance system is\n                   concerned only with the identifiers rather than the narrative,\n                   iterative, forms of identity and expression, and this is where\n                   we begin examining the ways in which identity is shaped,\n                   understood, and used to construct the notion of an individual\n                   in computation systems.”311\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1444\">185          Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity\n\nis expressed and the right not to be identified.

As the custodian of the fund, the Union Government, it\n\nhas been submitted by the respondents, had the Aadhaar Act enacted through\n\nParliament. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1897\">The Act</a> places a restriction on the right of the individual to utilize\n\nany other identification save and except for the Aadhaar number, for the\n\npurpose of availing of a subsidy, benefit or service that involves an\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund. The purpose of making an Aadhaar\n\nnumber mandatory for the delivery of benefits, services and subsidies funded\n\nfrom the Consolidated Fund is to confirm the identity of the individual to whom\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1032\">                                               255</span>\n\f                                                                             PART G\n\n\nthe benefit is being transferred. This was in order to ensure that the benefits\n\nunder social welfare programmes funded by the Consolidated Fund reach the\n\nhands of targeted beneficiaries. The Union Government which expends huge\n\nsums of money in its welfare schemes was apprised of the fact that money\n\nwhich was meant for the beneficiaries was being siphoned off through ghosts\n\nand duplicates. As a result, genuine beneficiaries would be deprived of their\n\nbasic rights. Cornering of benefits by the creation of bogus identities seriously\n\nimpacted upon social welfare measures adopted by the Union Government as\n\nan instrument of fostering social and economic development. It was to deal\n\nwith this evil that the Aadhaar project assumed a statutory character in 2016.\n\nThrough the provisions of the law, Parliament intended that Aadhaar should\n\nbecome an effective instrument of de-duplication. This is premised on the\n\nview of the legislating body that the use of biometrics would render it difficult, if\n\nnot impossible, to obtain fake identities.       Aadhaar, in other words, was\n\nadopted as a matter of legislative policy to curb the evil of shell companies\n\nand ghost identities. Where the State expends large sums on social welfare\n\nprojects, it has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the resources which it\n\ndeploys reach the hands of those for whom they are meant.\n\n\n\n\nThus, there are two important facets of the Aadhaar regime which must be\n\nnoticed. The first is that under <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_1898\">Section 3</a>, it is a voluntary option of the\n\nindividual to choose Aadhaar as a form of identification. However, if the\n\nindividual seeks a subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1033\">                                        256</span>\n\f                                                                         PART G\n\n\nincurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, Aadhaar becomes a mandatory\n\nrequirement. The second important feature is the requirement of informed\n\nconsent when the individual parts with identity information. The mandate of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_1899\">Section 7</a> must be understood from the perspective of the obligation imposed\n\non the State to ensure effective and efficient utilization of public resources.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1532561/\" id=\"a_1900\">Article 266</a> reinforces that mandate in its stipulation that all monies out of the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India can only be appropriated in accordance with law,\n\nfor the purpose of and in the manner provided by the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195355186\" id=\"span_1034\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147712062\" id=\"span_1035\">The State\n\nis a trustee of public resources.

In a seminal essay on human rights in\n\n1984 which he calls the “the great gift of classical and contemporary human\n\nthought to culture and civilization”319, he discusses the widening sphere of\n\nhuman rights thought and action to new arenas and constituencies as “New\n\nrights arise from the womb of the old.”320 He draws on the distinction between\n\nbasic human needs and human rights and argues that the constant struggle\n\nbetween these two forces is the essence of the difference between the right to\n\nbe human approach and the human rights approach.321 It is rightly pointed out\n\nthat a discussion on human rights will always constitute an inherent aspect of\n\nthe larger debate of development. He opines that whatever meaning maybe\n\nascribed to the term “development”, it must ensure that people will not be\n\ndeprived of the right to remain human:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1455\">\n\n317 Ibid\n318 Ibid\n319Upendra Baxi, From Human Rights to the Right to be Human: Some Heresies, India International Centre\n\n   Quarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3/4, Pg.185, (December 1986)\n320 Ibid, at page 185\n321 Ibid\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1039\">                                                   260</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART H\n\n\n                   “Whatever it may be made to mean, “development” must at\n                   least mean this: people will be given the right to be and\n                   remain human. Total and continuing destitution and\n                   impoverishment exposes people to a loss of their humanity. In\n                   no society that takes human rights seriously should there be\n                   allowed a state of affairs where human beings become sub-\n                   human—that is, when they perforce have to surrender even\n                   those sonorously recited &quot;inalienable&quot; rights of man… The\n                   expression &quot;human rights&quot; presupposes a level at which\n                   biological entities are bestowed with the dignity of being\n                   called human. The bearers of human rights must have an\n                   implicit right to be and remain human, allowing them some\n                   autonomy of choice in planning survival.”322\n\n\n\nThus, the broader matrix of human rights includes within it the inalienable and\n\nfundamental right to always ‘be and remain human’. Professor Upendra Baxi\n\nnotes that this broader debate between human rights and the ‘right to be\n\nhuman’ is reflective of the bread vs freedom conflict. It is noted that\n\nhistorically, freedom might have been chosen over bread due to the vast\n\nenumeration of liberal rights it includes, despite the acute awareness that\n\nwithout bread, freedom of speech and assembly, of association, of\n\nconscience and religion, of political participation, symbolic adult suffrage may\n\nall be meaningless.323                At the same time, Baxi points out the danger in\n\nchoosing bread at the cost of freedom, given that historically in the absence of\n\nfreedom, human beings have been subject to the most egregious indignities:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1551\">                         “The provision of &quot;bread&quot; may justify indefinite\n                         postponement of the provision of any kind of\n                         &quot;freedom&quot;. In the absence of such freedom, even the\n                         promised &quot;bread&quot; may not be realized by the masses;\n                         indeed, they even lose, in the process, their power to\n                         protest at the indignity of regime sponsored starvation.\n                         This, indeed, is a possibility which has materialized\n                         more often than not.”324\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1456\">322 Ibid, at page 187\n323  Ibid, at page 186\n324 Ibid, at page 190\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1040\">                                                     261</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART H\n\n\nBaxi concludes that the choice between bread and freedom is a false\n\nantithesis. The challenge is not a choice in the abstract between bread and\n\nfreedom but rather the balancing of the two:325\n\n                     “But the issues are not really &quot;bread&quot; and/or &quot;freedom&quot; in the\n                     abstract, but rather who has how much of each, for how long,\n                     at what cost to others, and why. Some people have both\n                     &quot;bread&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;; others have &quot;freedom&quot; but little\n                     &quot;bread&quot; or none at all; yet others have half a loaf (which is\n                     better than none, surely!) with or without freedom; and still\n                     others have a precarious mix where &quot;bread&quot; is assured if\n                     certain (not all) freedoms are bartered.”326\n\n\n\nIt is the foremost duty of the State to work towards achieving and maintaining\n\na fine balance, taking into account these myriad considerations. The State\n\nmust always be guided by the knowledge and sense of duty that in a true\n\ndemocracy, the citizens cannot be made to choose between rights and needs,\n\nas they are equally entitled to both. As the sentinel of justice and protector of\n\nfundamental rights, it is the responsibility of this Court to act as a check and\n\nensure that government action or inaction does not endanger or threaten to\n\ndisturb the balance that the Constitution seeks to achieve. It is imperative to\n\nremember that both ‘bread’ and ‘freedom’ play a vital role in the guaranteeing\n\nto our citizens the gamut of human rights and freedoms that make human\n\nexistence meaningful.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1457\">\n\n191        While exercising judicial review, courts are often confronted with\n\nsituations involving conflicts between rights, tensions between individuals\n\narising from the assertion of rights and discord arising out of the assertion of\n325   Ibid, at page 186\n326   Ibid, at page 186\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1041\">                                                    262</span>\n\f                                                                            PART H\n\n\nthe same right by two or more individuals. Conflicts between rights arise when\n\nthe assertion of a fundamental human right by an individual impacts upon the\n\nexercise of distinct freedoms by others. The freedom of one individual to\n\nspeak and to express may affect the dignity of another. A person may be\n\naggrieved when the free exercise of the right to speak by someone impinges\n\nupon his or her reputation, which is integral to the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1904\">Article 21.</a>\n\nA conflict will, in such a situation, arise between a right which is asserted\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1905\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> by one citizen and the sense of injury of another who\n\nclaims protection of the right to dignity under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1906\">Article 21.</a> Conflicts also arise\n\nwhen the exercise of rights is perceived to impact upon the collective identity\n\nof another group of persons. Conflicts may arise when an activity or conduct\n\nof an individual, in pursuit of a freedom recognised by the Constitution,\n\nimpinges upon the protection afforded to another individual under the rubric of\n\nthe same human right. Such a situation involves a conflict arising from a\n\nfreedom which is relatable to the same constitutional guarantee. Privacy is an\n\nassertion of the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1907\">Article 21.</a> The right to a dignified existence\n\nis also protected by the same Article. A conflict within <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1908\">Article 21</a> may involve a\n\nsituation when two freedoms are asserted as political rights. A conflict may\n\nalso envisage a situation where an assertion of a political right under the\n\numbrella of the right to life stands in conflict with the assertion of an economic\n\nright which is also comprehended by the protection of life under the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1458\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1042\">                                        263</span>\n\f                                                                        PART H\n\n\nSuch conflicts require the court to embark on a process of judicial\n\ninterpretation. The task is to achieve a sense of balance. An ideal situation\n\nwould be one which would preserve the core of the right for both sets of\n\ncitizens whose entitlements to freedom appear to be in conflict. Realistically,\n\ndrawing balances is not a simple task. Balances involve sacrifices and the\n\nforegoing of entitlements.    In making those decisions, a certain degree of\n\nvalue judgment is inevitable. The balance which the court draws may be open\n\nto criticism in regard to its value judgment on the relative importance ascribed\n\nto the conflicting rights in judicial decision making. In making those fine\n\nbalances, the court can pursue an objective formulation by relying upon those\n\nvalues which the Constitution puts forth as part of its endeavour for a just\n\nsociety. Our Constitution has in Part III recognised the importance of political\n\nfreedom. In Part IV, the Constitution has recognised our social histories of\n\ndiscrimination and prejudice which have led to poverty, deprivation and the\n\nabsence of a dignified existence to major segments of society. Holding Part III\n\nin balance with Part IV is integral to the vision of social and economic justice\n\nwhich the Constitution has sought to achieve consistent with political\n\ndemocracy. Difficult as this area is, a balancing of rights is inevitable, when\n\nrights asserted by individuals are in conflict.\n\n\n\n192   Several decisions of this Court over the last two decades have sought\n\nto bring order to the clash between fundamental rights. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_1043\">In People’s Union for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1044\">                                        264</span>\n\f                                                                                    <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_1909\">PART H\n\n\nCivil Liberties (PUCL) v Union of India327</a>, this Court was called upon to\n\nbalance the right to information of voters (requiring the disclosure of the\n\nassets of candidates and their spouses at an election) with the right to privacy\n\nimplicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1910\">Article 21.</a> In drawing the balance, a bench of three Judges of this\n\nCourt gave primacy to the entitlement of citizens to be informed about the\n\naffairs of those who would represent them in electoral democracy.

To\n                   elaborate, as in this case, the accused has a fundamental\n                   right to have a fair trial under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1930\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n                   Similarly, the victims who are directly affected and also form a\n                   part of the constituent of the collective, have a fundamental\n                   right for a fair trial. Thus, there can be two individuals both\n                   having legitimacy to claim or assert the right. The factum of\n                   legitimacy is a primary consideration.

However, when there is intra-\n                   conflict of the right conferred under the same article, like fair\n                   trial in this case, the test that is required to be applied, we are\n                   disposed to think, it would be “paramount collective interest”\n                   or “sustenance of public confidence in the justice\n                   dispensation system”.336\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1463\">196        These decisions indicate that the process of resolving conflicts arising\n\nout of the assertion of different fundamental rights and conflicts within the\n\nsame fundamental right, necessarily involves judicial balancing.

In seeking to draw the balance between political freedoms and\n\neconomic freedoms, the Court must preserve the euphony between\n\nfundamental rights and directive principles. It is on their co-existence that the\n\nedifice of the Constitution is founded. Neither can exist without the other.\n\nDemocracy rejects the totalitarian option of recognising economic entitlements\n\nwithout political liberty. Economic rights have become justiciable because of\n\nthe constitutional guarantees founded on freedom and the rule of law. The\n\nConstitution is founded on democratic governance and is based on the\n\nprotection of individual freedom. Freedom comprehends both fundamental\n\npolitical freedoms as well as basic human rights. A just balance between the\n\ntwo is integral to the fulfilment of India’s constitutional commitment to realise\n\nhuman liberty in a social context which is cognizant of the histories of\n\ndiscrimination and prejudice suffered by large segments of our society. Where\n\nthe question is related to the limiting the right to privacy, Puttaswamy requires\n\nthe test of proportionality. It has, therefore, to be tested whether the Aadhaar\n\nscheme fulfils the test of proportionality.\n\n\n\n197      The test of proportionality, which began as an unwritten set of general\n\nprinciples of law, today constitutes the dominant “best practice” judicial\n\nstandard for resolving disputes that involve either a conflict between two rights\n\nclaims or between a right and a legitimate government interest. 337 It has\n\n\n337JudMathews and Alec Stone Sweet, All things in Proportion?

It has been raised to the rank\n\nof a fundamental constitutional principle,340 and represents a global shift from\n\na culture of authority to a culture of justification.341 Servin argues that\n\njurisprudence on privacy has evolved from the “right to be let alone”, to now\n\nbeing centered around the principle of proportionality.342\n\n\n\n198       Subjecting the Aadhaar scheme to the test of proportionality does not\n\nmean that the Court is second-guessing the wisdom of the legislature. State\n\naction must be subjected to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it passes\n\nconstitutional muster. The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and\n\nextent of the State’s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the\n\nrights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be\n\nproportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging\n\nof welfare leakage and better targeting).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1464\">\n\n\n338Alec  Stone Sweet &amp; Jud Mathews, Proportionality Balancing and Global Constitutionalism, Columbia\n   Journal of Transnational Law, Vol. 47 (2008)\n339Jud Mathews and Alec Stone Sweet, All things in Proportion?

Aharon Barak, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\n\nIsrael has described the importance of the proportionality test as thus:343\n\n                  “Examination of the test of proportionality (in the narrow\n                  sense) returns us to first principles that are the foundation of\n                  our constitutional democracy and the human rights … Our\n                  democracy is characterized by the fact that it imposes limits\n                  on the ability to violate human rights; that it is based on the\n                  recognition that surrounding the individual there is a wall\n                  protecting his right, which cannot be breached even by\n                  majority.”\n\n\n\nIn applying the proportionality test, the Court cannot mechanically defer to the\n\nState’s assertions. Especially given the intrusive nature of the Aadhaar\n\nscheme, such deference to the legislature is inappropriate. The State must\n\ndischarge its burden by demonstrating that rights-infringing measures were\n\nnecessary and proportionate to the goal sought to be achieved.\n\n\n\nH.2      Proportionality standard in Indian jurisprudence\n\n\n199      In India, the principle of proportionality has a long jurisprudential history\n\nwhich has been adverted to in a judgment344 of this Court:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1560\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1285195\" id=\"span_1054\">“On account of a Chapter on Fundamental Rights in Part III of\n                  our Constitution right from 1950, Indian Courts did not suffer\n                  from the disability similar to the one experienced by English\n                  Courts for declaring as unconstitutional legislation on the\n                  principle of proportionality or reading them in a manner\n\n343 Adalah v.

The Appellant also\n\nchallenged <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_1999\">Section 3</a> of the Act, which provided for biometric data to be stored\n\nin a register. The Supreme Court, after taking into consideration witness\n\ntestimonies on the purpose of data collection, noted that though there may\n\nhave been a legitimate aim for storing and collecting this data, “sufficiently\n\nstrong reasons…to establish that such storage and retention of data for an\n\nindefinite period is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” were not\n\nestablished.403 Thus, the Court held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1599\">                  “… it is inconceivable that there can be such uncontrolled\n                  access to personal data in the absence of the vital safeguards\n                  afforded by judicial control. The potential for misuse or abuse\n                  of the exercise of the powers granted under the law would be\n                  significantly disproportionate to the legitimate aim which the\n                  defendants have claimed in order to justify the retention and\n                  storage of personal data under the Data Protection Act.”404\n\n\n\nThus, while the Supreme Court noted that the law providing for the storage\n\nand retention of personal biometric data constituted a permissible derogation\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1767760/\" id=\"a_2000\">Section 9(2)</a> of the Constitution,405 it held that since the Respondent had\n\nnot established that provisions dealing with storage and retention were\n\nreasonably justifiable in a democratic society, they were unconstitutional.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1483\">403  Ibid, at page 31\n404  Ibid, at page 33\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1088\">405</span>\n    <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_2001\">Article 9.</a> Protection of privacy of home and other property: (2) Nothing contained in or done under the authority\n   of any law shall be held to be consistent with or in contravention of this section to the extent that the law in\n   question makes provision - (a) in the interests of defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public\n   health, town and country planning, the development or utilisation of mineral resources or the development or\n   utilisation of any other property in such a manner as to promote the public benefit; (b) for the purpose of\n   protecting the rights or freedoms of other persons; (c) to enable an officer or agent of the government or a local\n   authority, or a body corporate established by law for public purpose, to enter on the premises of any person in\n   order to value those premises for the purpose of any tax, rate or due, or in order to carry out work connected\n   with any property that is lawfully on those premises and that belongs to the government, the local authority or\n   that body corporate, as the case may be; or (d) to authorise, for the purpose of enforcing the judgement or\n   order of a court in any civil proceedings, the search of any person or property by order of a court or the entry\n   upon any premises by such order, Except so far as that provision or, as the case may be, the thing done under\n   its authority is shown not to be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1089\">                                                        295</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART H\n\n\nThe Judicial Committee did not interfere with the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nHowever, it noted an inconsistency in the Supreme Court’s order wherein it\n\nheld that the law providing for the storage and retention of fingerprints and\n\nother biometric data constitutes a permissible derogation under <a href=\"/doc/1767760/\" id=\"a_2002\">section 9(2)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, whilst simultaneously holding the same provisions to be\n\nunconstitutional.

In Acton, the court held that the action of the authorities\n\nconducting random drug testing of high school athletes was legal since the\n\nconditions of collection were nearly identical to those typically encountered in\n\npublic restrooms. As a result, it was found that, privacy interests of the\n\nstudents were negligibly affected. In Skinner, the court found the actions of\n\nthe Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) requiring mandatory blood and\n\nurine testing of employees involved in train accidents to be constitutional. The\n\ncourt observed that railroad accidents, if not prevented, could cause massive\n\nloss of life and property. Further, it was held that FRA’s regulations fulfilled a\n\n“special need” because of the interest of the government in ensuring safety of\n\nrailroads and were therefore, not “an undue infringement on the justifiable\n\nexpectations of privacy of covered employees”. In Whalen, the Court found\n\nthat retention of patients’ information such as their name, address and age,\n\nunder the New York State Controlled Substances Act, 1972, was not in\n\nviolation of the constitutional right to privacy as the Court was satisfied that the\n\nstatute provided for proper safeguards and redressal against theft and loss of\n\ninformation. In Dionisio, the Court found no constitutional infirmity with the\n\nissuance of a subpoena to procure voice recording exhibits by tapping\n\ntelephones in order to investigate crimes. The Court held that “neither the\n\nsummons to appear before the grand jury, nor its directive to make a voice\n\nrecording, infringed upon any interest protected by the Fourth Amendment”.\n411   476 U.S. 693 (1986)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1091\">                                        <a href=\"/doc/677785/\" id=\"a_2007\">297</a></span>\n\f                                                                              PART H\n\n\nThe Court observed that a compelled display of identifiable physical\n\ncharacteristics does not infringe upon an “interest protected by the privilege\n\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination”. In Bowen, the Court upheld the\n\nprovisions of a welfare scheme which required citizens to furnish their social\n\nsecurity number, rejecting the argument that the use of a social security\n\nnumber violated the Appellant’s Native American beliefs. The Court held that\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment could not be construed to\n\nplace a requirement on the government to conduct its internal affairs in\n\nconsonance with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1484\">In In re Crawford,412 the Ninth Circuit upheld provisions of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode which mandated public disclosure of a Bankruptcy Petition Preparers’\n\nSocial Security Number on documents submitted to the Court, noting that the\n\nprovision had been enacted to serve governmental interests of preventing\n\nfraud and providing public access to judicial proceedings.\n\n\n\n216     Some decisions of lower courts in the US which have considered the\n\nvalidity of laws or actions of the State deploying biometrics and which have\n\nbeen cited by the respondents are: Haskell v Harris (“Haskell”),413 Utility\n\nWorkers         Union       of     America   v     Nuclear   Regulatory   Commission\n\n(“UWUA”),414 Nicholas A Iacobucci v City of Newport (“Iacobucci”),415\n\n\n412 194 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 1999)\n413 669 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2012)\n414 664 F.

In Haskell, the Ninth Circuit found a Californian law\n\nwhich authorized law enforcement officers to collect DNA in the form of a\n\nsample from the buccal swab of the mouth of felony arrestees, who had not\n\nbeen convicted, to be constitutional. The Court noted that the arrestees had\n\nreduced privacy interests; the physical intrusion of collecting a buccal swab\n\nwas de minimis in nature; there were stringent limits on the manner in which\n\nthe information was to be used; and the interest of the State in deterring future\n\ncriminal acts to exculpate innocent arrestees aided in prison administration\n\nand law enforcement. For the above reasons, the Court found that the\n\ninfringement of privacy of the felony arrestees was justified. In UWUA, the\n\nNinth Circuit ruled that a law requiring individuals working in nuclear power\n\nfacilities to submit their fingerprints for identification and criminal history record\n\nchecks was not unconstitutional. In Iacobucci, an ordinance which required\n\nemployees of liquor selling establishments which permitted nude dancing, to\n\nbe fingerprinted and photographed by the police department, was held\n\n416 306 F.

The Court observed that fingerprinting and photographing of\n\nemployees of retail liquor establishments bore a rational relationship to the\n\nlegitimate aim of elimination of crime. In Thom, a New York statute, which as\n\na condition of employment, required all the employees of member firms of\n\nnational stock exchanges to be fingerprinted, was upheld. The Court ruled that\n\nfingerprinting was a necessary means of verifying the existence or non-\n\nexistence of a prior criminal record, in order to avert any threat posed by an\n\nemployee who was in a position to commit theft of securities. In Perkey, the\n\nCalifornian Supreme Court upheld the actions of the state mandating an\n\nindividual to provide a fingerprint in order to obtain a driver’s license. The\n\nCourt held that fingerprint technology was the only reliable means of ensuring\n\nthe integrity of the records of the department of motor vehicles as other\n\nmethods such as handwriting specimens and photographs were not reliable.\n\nThus, the submission of fingerprints as part of the license application process,\n\nbore a rational relationship to the State’s goal of promoting safe and lawful\n\nuse of highways. In Buchanan, the Court upheld the eligibility requirement for\n\na welfare aid scheme which mandated participation in an identity verification\n\nprocedure known as Automated Finger Imaging System (AFIS), rejecting the\n\nchallenge based on religious beliefs of the Petitioner. The Court held that the\n\nPetitioner had failed to prove that the AFIS involved any invasive procedures,\n\nnoting that she had acknowledged that she had never seen finger imaging\n\nperformed and had no idea whether a laser was involved. In Stuller, the\n\nconstitutionality of a law which required “temporary and itinerant classes of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1094\">                                      300</span>\n\f                                                                        PART H\n\n\nemployees” to undergo fingerprinting in order to protect “visitors and\n\nresidents” of a resort city from crime and loss, both against people and against\n\nproperty, was upheld. In Kelly, the Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a claim\n\nfor return of fingerprints of the defendant which had been obtained after he\n\nhad been arrested by prohibition agents, holding that there was no reason to\n\ninterfere with a method of identifying persons “charged with a crime”. In\n\nBrannon, the court held that a law requiring “massagists” to submit their\n\nfingerprints, photographs and reports of their medical examinations in order to\n\nobtain licenses was valid, noting that the fingerprints and photographs would\n\naid in their identification as well as in the enforcement of criminal statutes\n\nrelating to public morality and decency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1485\">\n\n217   The cases cited by the learned Attorney General would not be\n\napplicable in the context of the Aadhaar program. The cases cited dealt with\n\nnarrowly tailored legislations set out to achieve very specific objectives. For\n\ninstance, courts upheld statutes aimed at protecting a nuclear facility or to\n\nprevent theft of securities, where incidents of sabotage or breach of security\n\nwould have led to national disasters. These national disasters in turn would\n\nhave resulted in the immediate loss of human life or in a situation of financial\n\nemergency. Such laws, were therefore, enacted in order to assuage security\n\nconcerns which, if not implemented, could lead to incidents of massive losses\n\nof life and property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1486\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1095\">                                      301</span>\n\f                                                                         PART H\n\n\nSome of the statutes upheld, permitted collection of DNA samples, fingerprints\n\nand photographs for identification. The objective behind these laws was\n\nprevention of crime, albeit on a comparatively smaller scale. Moreover, the\n\ncourts in these cases were also satisfied that the procedures involved in\n\ncollecting biometrics were not invasive enough to strike them down as\n\nunconstitutional or that there were adequate safeguards to prevent misuse.\n\n\n\nThe aforementioned cases will not apply in the backdrop of the Aadhaar\n\nprogram because they were rendered broadly in the context of prevention of\n\ncrime. It needs no reiteration that an entire population cannot be presumed to\n\nbe siphoning huge sums of money in welfare schemes or viewed through the\n\nlens of criminality, and therefore, considered as having a diminished\n\nexpectation of privacy. The judgments cited by the respondents which were\n\ndecided in the context of crime, require the State to at least form a reasonable\n\nbelief about the criminal antecedents of individuals or their potential to commit\n\ncrimes. On the contrary, by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar\n\nprogram treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the\n\nState to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime\n\nor an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief\n\nand judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which\n\ninfringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the\n\nConstitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be\n\nachieved by the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1487\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1096\">                                      302</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n\n218   The fundamental precepts of proportionality, as they emerge from\n\ndecided cases can be formulated thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1602\">1.

Privacy,   also   construed   as\n\n“informational self-determination”, is a fundamental value. There is a\n\nconsistent emphasis on the impact on personal dignity if private information is\n\nwidely available and individuals are not able to decide upon its disclosure and\n\nuse. This right of controlling the extent of the availability and use of one’s\n\npersonal data is seen as a building block of data protection - especially in an\n\nenvironment where the state of technology facilitates ease of collection,\n\nanalysis and dissemination of information.\n\n\n\n220   The blanket and indiscriminate collection of information is seen as a\n\nviolation of privacy, which is a constituent of the right to liberty. An extensive\n\npower to retain collected data is also seen as a disproportionate interference\n\nwith the right to privacy and not necessary in a democratic society. The\n\njudgments hold that unlimited data retention and unrestricted state access\n\nboth constitute a disproportionate interference with privacy and data\n\nprotection. They also emphasize the need to clearly stipulate the nature of the\n\ndata being collected and ensure its confidentiality. Provisions where these\n\nprinciples are not respected cannot be regarded as valid. While courts do\n\nrecognize the need for public order and security, they emphasize the need to\n\nstrike a balance between safeguarding public order and the right to privacy.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1098\">                                       304</span>\n\f                                                                       PART H\n\n\n221   The principle of proportionality also recurs through these judgments,\n\nwhich note that the collection and use of information must be limited to the\n\npurpose specified by law and to the extent indispensable for the protection of\n\npublic interest. The striking of a balance between public and private interests\n\nis crucial to proportionality. The judgments hold that there must be a\n\nprotection against unauthorized use and clearly defined conditions for\n\nprocessing of data collected. Those conditions must not be excessive and\n\nmust be justified on grounds of public interest and implemented in a manner\n\nproportionate to the objective. Too broad a scope of data collected and\n\nretained, the lack of limits imposed on access to data by authorities and a\n\nfailure to distinguish between the treatment of data based on its usefulness\n\nand relevance are seen by Courts as constituting grounds for striking down\n\nthe measure. While the State&#x27;s imperatives are seen as relevant, emphasis is\n\nlaid on retention and access requirements being proportionate to those\n\nimperatives and the need to prevent against abuse. Courts have upheld\n\nregulations that are necessary to achieve the legitimate aims and not\n\nexcessive in their nature or impact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1490\">\n\nThe issue is whether the Aadhaar project and the Act, Rules and Regulations\n\nmeet the test of proportionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1491\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1099\">                                       305</span>\n\f                                                                          PART H\n\n\nH.4   Aadhaar: the proportionality analysis\n\n\n\n222   Under Aadhaar, the State has put forth an objective of transferring\n\nsubsidies and entitlements to its citizens.

However, the Act in the present form has surpassed a tailored\n\nobjective and has sought to administer every facet of the citizen-state\n\nengagement through mandatory biometric-enabled Aadhaar linking.

It is vital that\n\nadequate safeguards are set down for every step of the process from\n\ncollection to retention of biometric data. At the time of collection, individuals\n\nmust be informed about the collection procedure, the intended purpose of the\n\ncollection, the reason why the particular data set is requested and who will\n\nhave access to their data. Additionally, the retention period must be justified\n\nand individuals must be given the right to access, correct and delete their data\n\nat any point in time, a procedure familiar to an opt-out option.

The report dated 4 March\n\n2018 is titled as “Analysis of Major Concern about Aadhaar Privacy and\n\nSecurity” and has been authored by Professor Manindra Agrawal. Professor\n\nAgrawal is the N Ramarao Professor at IIT Kanpur and is a member of the\n\nTechnology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and of the Security\n\nReview Committee of UIDAI. Professor Agarwal’s Report deals with the notion\n\nof differential privacy. Differential privacy makes it possible for tech entities to\n\ncollect and share aggregate information about user habits, while maintaining\n\nthe privacy of individual users. The Report states that differential privacy of a\n\nprotocol is the change in the privacy of people when the protocol is introduced\n\nwithout altering any other protocol present. If the differential privacy of a\n\nprotocol is “non-negative”, the protocol does not compromise privacy in any\n\nway. There are four existing Aadhaar databases:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1627\">(i)   The ‘person database’ stores personal attributes of a person (name,\n\n      address, age, etc.) along with his/her Aadhaar number;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1628\">(ii) The reference database stores the Aadhaar number of a person along\n\n      with a unique reference number (which has no relationship with the\n\n      Aadhaar number of an individual);\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1629\">(iii) The biometric database stores biometric information of a person along\n\n      with the unique reference number; and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1113\">                                        318</span>\n\f                                                                                PART H\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1630\">(iv) The verification log records all ID verifications done in the past five years.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1505\">    For each verification, it stores the biometric data, Aadhaar number, and\n\n    ID of the device on which verification was done.\n\n\nThe report analyses the situation if any of the databases gets leaked. The\n\nreport remarks:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1631\">             “Finally, let us turn attention to Verification Log. Its leakage\n             may affect both the security and the privacy of an individual\n             as one can extract identities of several people (and hence\n             can keep changing forged identities) and also locate the\n             places of transactions done by an individual in the past five\n             years. Note that differential privacy of this becomes negative\n             since without access to this database it is not possible to\n             track locations of an individual in past five years (as opposed\n             to tracking current location which is possible). Therefore,\n             Verification Log must be kept secure.”\n\n\n\nThe Report underlines the importance of ensuring the security of verification\n\nlogs in the Aadhaar database. The leakage of verification logs is capable of\n\ndamaging the security and privacy of individuals since the report notes that\n\nfrom the verification log, it is possible to locate the places of transactions by\n\nan individual in the past five years. A breach in verification log would allow a\n\nthird party to access the location of the transactions of an individual over the\n\npast five years. The report indicates that it is possible through the Aadhaar\n\ndatabase to track the location of an individual. The Aadhaar database is\n\ndifferent from other databases such as PAN Card or driving license. The\n\nAadhaar database is universal and contains the biometrics of an individual.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1632\">The threshold to scrutinize the effects of this database is therefore much\n\nhigher as compared to that of other databases.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1114\">                                             319</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1633\">\f                                                                                   PART H\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1506\">229     In Puttaswamy, Justice Kaul (in his concurring judgment) emphasized\n\nupon the concerns regarding surveillance of individuals.

Surveillance is not new, but technology has\n                 permitted surveillance in ways that are unimaginable… One\n                 such technique being adopted by States is ‘profiling’. The\n                 European Union Regulation of 2016 on data privacy defines\n                 ‘Profiling’ as any form of automated processing of personal\n                 data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain\n                 personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to\n                 analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person&#x27;s\n                 performance at work, economic situation, health, personal\n                 preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or\n                 movements. Such profiling can result in discrimination based\n                 on religion, ethnicity and caste.”431\n\n\n\nJustice Kaul also dealt with the need to regulate the conduct of private entities\n\nvis-a-vis profiling of individuals:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1635\">                 “The capacity of non-State actors to invade the home and\n                 privacy has also been enhanced.

Through meta data and in the light of the observations made in\n\nthe Professor Manindra Agarwal Report, it can easily be concluded that it is\n\npossible through the UIDAI database to track the location of an individual.\n\nFurther, the verification logs reveal the details of transactions over the past\n\nfive years. The verification logs are capable of profiling an individual. Details\n\nof the transaction include what the transaction was (whether authentication\n\nrequest was accepted/rejected), where it was sent from, and how it was sent.\n\nThe only thing not stored in the transaction is its purpose.\n\n\n\n231     The threat to privacy arises not from the positive identification that\n\nbiometrics provide, but the ability of third parties to access this in an\n\nidentifiable form and link it to other information, resulting in secondary use of\n\nthat information without the consent of the data subject. This erodes the\n\npersonal control of an individual over the uses of his or her information. The\n\nunauthorised secondary use of biometric data is perhaps the greatest risk that\n\nbiometric technology poses to informational privacy.434 The Manindra Agarwal\n\nReport acknowledges that the biometric database in the CIDR is accessible\n\nby third-party vendors providing biometric search and de-duplication\n\nalgorithms.

The Aadhaar Act envisages UIDAI as the sole authority\n\nfor the purpose of the Act. It entrusts UIDAI with a wide canvass of functions,\n\nboth administrative and adjudicatory. It performs the functions of appointing\n\nenrolling agencies, registrars and requesting entities. Currently, there are 212\n\nRegistrars and 755 enrolling agencies in different states of the country. 440\n\nMonitoring the actions of so many entities is not a task easily done.\n\nResponsibility has also been placed on UIDAI to manage and secure the\n\ncentral database of identity information of individuals. UIDAI is also required\n\nto ensure that data stored in CIDR is kept secure and confidential.

It is also not clear how a person is supposed to know that the biometric\n\ninformation contained in the database has changed if he/she does not have\n\naccess to it. UIDAI is also empowered to investigate any breach under the\n\nAct, as a result of which any offence under the Act will be cognizable only if a\n\ncomplaint is filed by UIDAI. UIDAI is not an independent monitoring agency.\n\n\n\nUnder the Aadhaar architecture, UIDAI is the only authority which carries out\n\nall the functions, be it administrative, adjudicatory, investigative, or monitoring\n\nof the project. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2033\">While the Act</a> confers such major functions on UIDAI, it does\n\nnot place any institutional accountability upon UIDAI to protect the database\n\nof citizens’ personal information. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2034\">The Act</a> is silent on the liability of UIDAI and\n\nits personnel in case of non-compliance of the provisions of the Act or the\n\nregulations made under it.

Providing a\n\nregime under law for penalizing criminal wrongdoing is necessary. But,\n\ncriminal offences are not a panacea for a robust regulatory framework under\n\nthe auspices of an autonomous regulatory body. Violations in regard to the\n\nintegrity of data may be incremental. Millions of data transactions take place in\n\nthe daily lives of a community of individuals. Violations in regard to the\n\nintegrity of data are numerous. Some of them may appear to be trivial, if\n\nlooked at in isolation. However, cumulatively, these violations seriously\n\nencroach on the dignity and autonomy of the individual. A regime of criminal\n\nlaw may not in itself be adequate to deal with all these violations in terms of\n\ntheir volume and complexity. It is hence necessary that the criminal law must\n\nbe supplemented by an independent regulatory framework. In its absence,\n\nthere is a grave danger that the regime of data protection, as well as the\n\nadministration of criminal justice will be rendered dysfunctional. Unfortunately,\n\na regulatory framework of the nature <a href=\"/doc/4436830/\" id=\"a_2041\">referred to above</a> is completely absent.\n\nUIDAI which is established and controlled by the Union Government\n\npossesses neither the autonomy nor the regulatory authority to enforce the\n\nmandate of the law in regard to the protection of data. The absence of a\n\nregulatory framework renders the legislation largely ineffective in dealing with\n\ndata violations. Data protection cannot be left to an unregulated market place.\n\nNor can the law rest in the fond hope that organized structures within or\n\noutside government will be self-compliant.

Biometric data offers strong evidence of one’s\n\nidentity since it represents relatively unique biological characteristics which\n\ndistinguish one person from another. As biometric data can be usually linked\n\nto only one individual it acts as a powerful, unique identifier that brings\n\ntogether disparate pieces of personal information about an individual. As a\n\nrelatively unique identifier, biometric data not only allows individuals to be\n\ntracked, but it also creates the potential for the collection of an individual’s\n\ninformation and its incorporation into a comprehensive profile. Central\n\ndatabases, data matching/linking and profiling are technical factors that\n\nfacilitate ‘function creep’ (the slippery slope according to which information\n\ncan be used for functions other than that for which it was collected). Privacy\n\nadvocates believe that any identification scheme can be carried out with a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1129\">                                         331</span>\n\f                                                                          PART H\n\n\nhidden agenda and that the slippery slope effect can be relevant to several\n\nfactors such as motivations of governments and business, and on the\n\nexistence of safeguards. The special nature of biometric data makes function\n\ncreep more likely and even attractive. The legal measures possible to control\n\nfunction creep are still limited. However, there are several ways in which\n\nfunction creep can be curtailed. They include (i) limiting the amount of data\n\nthat is collected for any stated purpose; (ii) enabling regulation to limit\n\ntechnological access to the system; (iii) concerted debates with all\n\nstakeholders and public participation; (iv) dispersion of multiple enablers for a\n\nsystem; and (v) enabling choices for user participation.\n\n\n\n240   This Court held in Puttaswamy that a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy requires that data collection must not violate the autonomy of an\n\nindividual. The Court has held consent, transparency, and control over\n\ninformation as the cornerstones over which the fundamentals of informational\n\nprivacy stand. The Court had made it clear that an individual has the right to\n\nprevent others from using his or her image, name and other aspects of\n\npersonal life and identity for commercial purposes without consent. An\n\nAadhaar number is a unique attribute of an individual. It embodies unique\n\ninformation associated with an individual. The manner in which it is to be used\n\nhas to be dependent on the consent of the individual.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1130\">                                      332</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n\n241   Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act allows the use of an Aadhaar number for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual “for any purpose” by the state, private\n\nentities and persons. Allowing private entities to use Aadhaar numbers will\n\nlead to commercial exploitation of an individual’s personal data without his/her\n\nconsent and could lead to individual profiling. The contention is that <a href=\"/doc/174899/\" id=\"a_2043\">Section\n\n57</a> fails to meet the requirements set out in the Puttaswamy judgment.\n\n\n\nIn this regard, reference must be drawn to a 2010 policy paper. A group of\n\nofficers was created by the Government of India to develop a framework for a\n\nprivacy legislation that would balance the need for privacy protection with\n\nsecurity and sectoral interests, and respond to the need for domain legislation\n\non the subject.

The paper noted the repercussions of\n\nhaving a project based on a database of unique individual IDs:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1644\">             “Data privacy and the need to protect personal information is\n             almost never a concern when data is stored in a\n             decentralized manner. However, all this is likely to change\n             with the implementation of the UID Project. One of the\n             inevitable consequences of the UID Project will be that the\n             UID Number will unify multiple databases. As more and more\n             agencies of the government sign on to the UID Project, the\n             UID Number will become the common thread that links all\n             those databases together. Over time, private enterprise could\n             also adopt the UID Number as an identifier for the purposes\n             of the delivery of their services or even for enrolment as a\n             customer...Once this happens, the separation of data that\n             currently exists between multiple databases will vanish…\n\n             Such a vast interlinked public information database is\n             unprecedented in India.

Recall that the\n                Aadhaar number is a single unique identifier that must\n                function across multiple domains. Given that the Aadhaar\n                number must necessarily be disclosed for obtaining services,\n                it becomes publicly available, not only electronically but also\n                often in human readable forms as well, thereby increasing the\n                risk that service providers and other interested parties may be\n                able to profile users across multiple service domains. Once\n                the Aadhaar number of an individual is (inevitably) known,\n                that individual may be identified without consent across\n                domains, leading to multiple breaches in privacy.”\n\n\n244     The risks which the use of Aadhaar “for any purpose” carries is that\n\nwhen it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private\n\nentities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that\n\nconnects the cell phone with geo-location data, one’s presence and\n\nmovement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle\n\nconsumption with           medical records. This starts a “causal link” between\n\ninformation which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. 448\n\nThus, linking Aadhaar with different databases carries the potential of being\n\nprofiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also\n\ncarries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by\n\naffecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create\n\nco-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected.

In any of the programmes employed, it is\n\nimperative that the state takes strong data privacy measures to prevent theft\n\nand abuse. Moreover, it must be realized that an identification system like\n\nAadhaar, which is implemented nationwide, will always be more prone to\n\nexternal threats. The State is always open to threat from its adversaries, and\n\na national level identification system can become an easy target for anyone\n\nlooking to cause serious damage as individuals’ biometric credentials are at\n\nrisk in the process. Therefore, it is vital that state action ascertain security\n\nvulnerabilities while developing an identification system. These issues have\n\nnot been dealt with by the Aadhaar Act.

The Preamble of the Act explains that the architecture of the\n\nAct seeks to provide “efficient, transparent and targeted delivery of subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services” for which the expenditure is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund to resident individuals. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2050\">Section 7</a> of the Act makes the\n\nproof of possession of Aadhaar number or Aadhaar authentication as a\n\nmandatory condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service, which incurs\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. The scope of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2051\">Section 7</a> is\n\nvery wide. It leaves the door open for the government to route more benefits,\n\nsubsidies and services through the Consolidated Fund of India and expand\n\nthe scope of Aadhaar. Any activity of the government paid for from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India ranging from supply of subsidised grains and\n\nLPG, to use of roads and civic amenities, healthcare, and even rebates to tax\n\npayers could come under such an umbrella.

From delivery to deliverance, almost every aspect of the cycle of\n\nlife would be governed by the logic of Aadhaar.\n\n\n\n247   When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, it becomes a bridge\n\nacross discreet data silos, which allows anyone with access to this information\n\nto re-construct a profile of an individual’s life. It must be noted while Section\n\n2(k) of the Aadhaar Act excludes storage of individual information related to\n\nrace, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, income or medical history into\n\nCIDR, the mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various schemes allows the\n\nsame result in effect. For instance, when an individual from a particular caste\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1138\">                                       340</span>\n\f                                                                        PART H\n\n\nengaged in manual scavenging is rescued and in order to take benefit of\n\nrehabilitation schemes, she/he has to link the Aadhaar number with the\n\nscheme, the effect is that a profile as that of a person engaged in manual\n\nscavenging is created in the scheme database. The stigma of being a manual\n\nscavenger gets permanently fixed to her/his identity. What the Aadhaar Act\n\nseeks to exclude specifically is done in effect by the mandatory linking of\n\nAadhaar numbers with different databases, under cover of the delivery of\n\nbenefits and services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1518\">\n\nMoreover, the absence of proof of an Aadhaar number would render a\n\nresident non-existent in the eyes of the State, and would deny basic facilities\n\nto such residents. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2055\">Section 7</a> thus makes a direct impact on the lives of\n\ncitizens. If the requirement of Aadhaar is made mandatory for every benefit or\n\nservice which the government provides, it is impossible to live in\n\ncontemporary India without Aadhaar. It suffers from the vice of being\n\noverbroad. The scope of subsidies provided by the government (which incur\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund) is not the same as that of other\n\nbenefits and services which the government provides to its citizens.\n\nTherefore, benefits and services cannot be measured with the same yardstick\n\nas subsidies. The inclusion of services and benefits in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2056\">Section 7</a> is a pre-\n\ncursor to the kind of function creep which is inconsistent with privacy and\n\ninformational self-determination.

These are broad and\n\nunstructured terms under which the government can cover the entire gamut of\n\nits activities involving an interface with the citizen. The provision has made no\n\nrequirement to determine whether in the first place biometric identification is\n\nnecessary in each case and whether a less intrusive modality should suffice.\n\nBoth the definitions include such other services as may be notified by the\n\nCentral government. The residuary clause is vague and ambiguous and\n\nleaves it to the Central government at its uncharted discretion to expand on\n\nwhat benefits and services would be covered by the legislation. The manner\n\nin which these definitions have been expansively applied to cover a wide\n\nrange of activities is attributable to the vagueness implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2061\">Section 7</a>.\n\n\n\nCan the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2062\">Section 7</a> be applied with any justification to pensions\n\npayable on account of the past service rendered by a person to the state?\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1140\">                                        342</span>\n\f                                                                            PART H\n\n\nPension, it is well settled, is not a largesse or bounty conferred by the state.\n\nPension, as a condition of service, attaches as a recompense for the long\n\nyears of service rendered by an individual to the state and its instrumentalities.\n\nPensioners grow older with passing age.          Many of them suffer from the\n\ntribulations of old age including the loss of biometrics. It is unfair and arbitrary\n\non the part of the state to deny pension to a person entitled to it by linking\n\npensionary payments to the possession of an Aadhaar number or to its\n\nauthentication. A right cannot be denied on the anvil of requiring one and only\n\none means of identification. The pension disbursing authority is entitled to lay\n\ndown regulations (which are generally speaking, already in place) to ensure\n\nthe disbursal of pension to the person who is rightfully entitled. This aim of the\n\ngovernment can be fulfilled by other less intrusive measures. The requirement\n\nof insisting on an Aadhaar number for the payment of pensionary benefits\n\ninvolves a breach of the principle of proportionality. Such a requirement would\n\nclearly be contrary to the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2063\">Article 14.</a>\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the state as a part of its welfare obligations provides numerous\n\nbenefits to school going children, including mid-day meals or scholarships, to\n\nchildren belonging to the marginalised segments of the society. Should the\n\ndisbursal of these benefits be made to depend upon a young child obtaining\n\nan Aadhaar number or undergoing the process of authentication?

The\n\nConstitution has been adopted for a nation of plural cultures. It is accepting of\n\ndiversity in every walk of life. Diversity of identity is an expression of the\n\nplurality which constitutes the essence of our social culture. Amartya Sen in\n\n‘The Argumentative Indian’451 demonstrates the untenability of the notion\n\nthat identity is exclusive. He rejects the notion of an exclusive identity as\n\n“preposterous”, observing that in different settings, individuals rely upon and\n\nassert varying identities:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1651\">                    “Each of us invokes identities of various kinds in disparate\n                    contexts.

Undoubtedly, some identities are ‘given’. But even here, as\n\nSen explains, the issue is not whether an identity can be selected by an\n\nindividual in all cases but whether the individual has a choice over the relative\n\nweight to be ascribed to different identities:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1653\">                     “The point at issue is not whether any identity whatever can\n                     be chosen (that would be an absurd claim), but whether we\n                     have choices over alternative identities or combinations of\n                     identities, and perhaps more importantly, whether we have\n                     some freedom in deciding what priority to give to the various\n                     identities that we may simultaneously have.

Exclusion\n\nfrom these schemes defeats the rationale for the schemes which is to\n\novercome chronic hunger and malnutrition. Exclusion is violative of human\n\ndignity. As discussed previously in detail, the statistics recorded in\n\ngovernment records and the affidavits filed by the petitioners point out glaring\n\nexamples of exclusion due to technical errors in Aadhaar.

Dr Ambedkar conceptualized four basic premises on which a\n\npolitical democracy can rest:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1656\">             “Political Democracy rests on four premises which may be set\n             out in the following terms:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1157\">                                           353</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1657\">\f                                                                                                  PART H\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1658\">                (i)      The individual is an end in himself.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1659\">                (ii)     That the individual has certain inalienable rights which\n                         must be guaranteed to him by the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1660\">                (iii)    That the individual shall not be required to\n                         relinquish any of his constitutional rights as a\n                         condition precedent to the receipt of a privilege.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1661\">                (iv)     That the State shall not delegate powers to private\n                         persons to govern others.”466 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the words of Dr Ambedkar in a constitutional context, any action\n\non the part of the State which forces an individual to part with her or his dignity\n\nor any other right under Part III will not be permissible.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1528\">257     The experience of living with chronic hunger; recurring uncertainty\n\nabout the availability of food; debt bondage; low and highly underpaid work;\n\nself-denial; and sacrifice of other survival needs, being discriminated\n\nagainst467 are instances of the loss of dignity for the marginalized.

The digital\n                 poorhouse deters the poor from accessing public\n                 resources; polices their labor, spending, sexuality, and\n                 parenting; tries to predict their future behavior; and\n                 punishes and criminalizes those who do not comply with\n                 its dictates. In the process, it creates ever-finer moral\n                 distinctions between the &#x27;deserving&#x27; and &#x27;undeserving&#x27;\n                 poor, categorizations that rationalize our national failure\n                 to care for one another.”482 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nEubanks builds the argument that automated decision-making technology\n\ndoes not act as a facilitator for welfare schemes for the poor and only acts as\n\na gatekeeper:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1672\">                 “New high-tech tools allow for more precise measuring and\n                 tracking, better sharing of information, and increased visibility\n                 of targeted populations. In a system dedicated to supporting\n                 poor and working-class people&#x27;s self-determination, such\n                 diligence would guarantee that they attain all the benefits they\n                 are entitled to by law. In that context, integrated data and\n                 modernized administration would not necessarily result in bad\n                 outcomes for poor communities. But automated decision-\n                 making in our current welfare system acts a lot like older,\n                 atavistic forms of punishment and containment.

For persons, who are engaged\n\nin manual labour, and persons who are disabled or aged, fingerprints actually\n\ncannot be captured by biometric devices. The material which has been relied\n\nupon in this segment originates from government’s official documents as well\n\nas from distinguished academics and researchers from civil society. There\n\nexist serious issues of financial exclusion. Pensions for the aged particularly\n\nin cases where a pension is earned for past service – are not charity or doles.\n\nThey constitute legal entitlements. For an old age pensioner, vicissitudes of\n\ntime and age obliterate fingerprints. Hard manual labour severely impacts\n\nupon fingerprints. The elderly, the disabled and the young are the most\n\nvulnerable and a denial of social welfare entitlements verily results in a\n\ndeprivation of the right to life. Should the scholarship of a girl child or a mid-\n\nday meal for the young be made to depend on the uncertainties of biometric\n\nmatches? Our quest for technology should not be oblivious to the country’s\n\nreal problems: social exclusion, impoverishment and marginalisation. The\n\nAadhaar project suffers from crucial design flaws which impact upon its\n\nstructural probity. Structural design in delivering welfare entitlements must be\n\ncompliant with structural due process, to be in accord with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2084\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2085\">21.</a>\n\nThe Aadhaar project has failed to account for and remedy the flaws in its\n\nframework and design which lead to serious issues of exclusion.

Procedures for the disbursal of\n\nbenefits must not be oppressive. They must be capable of compliance both by\n\nthose who disburse and by those who receive the benefits.

The court held that the\n\npurpose of making it mandatory under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2123\">Income Tax Act</a> was to curb black\n\nmoney, money laundering and tax evasion. It was open to Parliament to do so\n\nand its legislative competence could not be questioned on that ground. The\n\ncourt held that the legislative purpose of unearthing black money and curbing\n\nmoney laundering furnished a valid nexus with the objective sought to be\n\nachieved by the law:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1709\">                     “105. Unearthing black money or checking money laundering\n                     is to be achieved to whatever extent possible. Various\n                     measures can be taken in this behalf. If one of the measures\n                     is introduction of Aadhaar into the tax regime, it cannot be\n                     denounced only because of the reason that the purpose\n                     would not be achieved fully. Such kind of menace, which is\n                     deep-rooted, needs to be tackled by taking multiple actions\n                     and those actions may be initiated at the same time. It is the\n                     combined effect of these actions which may yield results and\n\n\n530   Ibid, at page 496\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1197\">                                                    384</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART H\n\n\n                    each individual action considered in isolation may not be\n                    sufficient.

Of course, there is a definite\n                    objective. For this purpose alone, individual measure cannot\n                    be ridiculed. We have already taken note of the\n                    recommendations of SIT on black money headed by Justice\n                    M.B. Shah. We have also reproduced the measures\n                    suggested by the Committee headed by Chairman, CBDT on\n                    “Measures to Tackle Black Money in India and Abroad”. They\n                    have, in no uncertain terms, suggested that one singular\n                    proof of identity of a person for entering into finance/business\n                    transactions, etc. may go a long way in curbing this foul\n                    practice. That apart, even if solitary purpose of de-duplication\n                    of PAN cards is taken into consideration, that may be\n                    sufficient to meet the second test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2124\">Article 14.</a> It has come on\n                    record that 11.35 lakh cases of duplicate PAN or fraudulent\n                    PAN cards have already been detected and out of this 10.52\n                    lakh cases pertain to individual assessees. Seeding of\n                    Aadhaar with PAN has certain benefits which have already\n                    been enumerated. Furthermore, even when we address the\n                    issue of shell companies, fact remains that companies are\n                    after all floated by individuals and these individuals have to\n                    produce documents to show their identity. It was sought to be\n                    argued that persons found with duplicate/bogus PAN cards\n                    are hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to have\n                    such a provision. We cannot go by percentage figures. The\n                    absolute number of such cases is 10.52 lakhs, which figure,\n                    by no means, can be termed as miniscule, to harm the\n                    economy and create adverse effect on the nation. The\n                    respondents have argued that Aadhaar will ensure that there\n                    is no duplication of identity as biometrics will not allow that\n                    and, therefore, it may check the growth of shell companies as\n                    well.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1710\">                    106.

The\n\ncourt upheld the decision of Parliament as the legislating body of seeding\n\nPANs with Aadhaar as “the best method, and the only robust method of de-\n\nduplication of PAN database”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1573\">\n\n278        The edifice of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_2125\">Section 139AA</a> is based on the structure created by the\n\nAadhaar Act. <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_2126\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax Act 1962 is postulated on the\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar having been enacted under a valid piece of\n\nlegislation.

The relief which claimed was that\n\nthere should be a definite mobile phone subscriber verification to ensure a\n\nhundred per cent verification of subscribers. Responding to the petition, the\n\nUnion Government informed this Court that DoT had launched an Aadhaar\n\nbased e-KYC for issuing mobile connections on 16 August 2016, by which\n\ncustomers as well as point of sale agents of TSPs will be authenticated by\n\nUIDAI. A statement was made by the learned Attorney General that an\n\neffective programme for verification of prepaid connections would be devised\n\nwithin one year. In view of the statement of the AG, the petition was disposed\n\nof by a two judge Bench in terms of the following directions:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1715\">                   “5.

Since the Central Government has the exclusive privilege of\n\nestablishing, maintaining and working telegraphs, TSPs, it was urged, have to\n\noperate the telegraph under a license and the Central Government is entitled\n\nto impose conditions on the licensee. The instruction issued by DoT on 23\n\nMarch 2017 has, it is urged, the sanction of <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_2155\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Telegraph\n\nAct 1885.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1597\">\n\n282   We must at the outset note the ambit of the proceedings before this\n\nCourt in Lokniti Foundation. In response to the public interest litigation, it\n\nwas the Union Government which relied on its decision of 16 August 2016 to\n\nimplement e-KYC verification for mobile subscribers. The petition was\n\ndisposed of since the prayers were substantially dealt with and the court\n\nperceived that an effective process had been adopted to ensure identity\n\nverification together with verification of addresses. Existing subscribers were\n\ndirected to be verified in a similar manner within one year. The issue as to\n\nwhether the seeding of Aadhaar with mobile SIM cards was constitutionally\n\nvalid did not fall for consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1598\">\n\n283   The decision to link Aadhaar numbers with SIM cards and to require e-\n\nKYC authentication of mobile subscribers has been looked upon by the Union\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1207\">                                        392</span>\n\f                                                                         PART H\n\n\ngovernment purely as a matter of efficiency of identification. TRAI’s letter\n\ndated 6 January 2016 states that the new procedure for subscriber verification\n\nwhich it had adopted was “cumbersome and resource intensive”. The issue as\n\nto whether Aadhaar linked e-KYC authentication would seriously compromise\n\nthe privacy of mobile subscribers did not enter into the decision making\n\ncalculus. In applying the test of proportionality, the matter has to be addressed\n\nnot just by determining as to whether a measure is efficient but whether it\n\nmeets the test of not being disproportionate or excessive to the legitimate aim\n\nwhich the state seeks to pursue. TRAI and DoT do have a legitimate concern\n\nover the existence of SIM cards obtained against identities which are not\n\ngenuine. But the real issue is whether the linking of Aadhaar cards is the least\n\nintrusive method of obviating the problems associated with subscriber\n\nverification. The state cannot be oblivious to the need to protect privacy and of\n\nthe dangers inherent in the utilization of the Aadhaar platform by telecom\n\nservice providers. In the absence of adequate safeguards, the biometric data\n\nof mobile subscribers can be seriously compromised and exploited for\n\ncommercial gain. While asserting the need for proper verification, the state\n\ncannot disregard the countervailing requirements of preserving the integrity of\n\nbiometric data and the privacy of mobile phone subscribers. Nor can we\n\naccept the argument that cell phone data is so universal that one can become\n\nblasé about the dangers inherent in the revealing of biometric information.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1208\">                                      393</span>\n\f                                                                           PART H\n\n\n284   The submission that a direction of this nature could have been given to\n\nTSPs under <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_2156\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 does not answer the\n\nbasic issue of its constitutional validity, which turns upon the proportionality of\n\nthe measure. Having due regard to the test of proportionality which has been\n\npropounded in Puttaswamy and as elaborated in this judgment, we do not\n\nfind that the decision to link Aadhaar numbers with mobile SIM cards is valid\n\nor constitutional. The mere existence of a legitimate state aim will not justify\n\nthe means which are adopted. Ends do not justify means, at least as a matter\n\nof constitutional principle. For the means to be valid, they must be carefully\n\ntailored to achieve a legitimate state aim and should not be either\n\ndisproportionate or excessive in their encroachment on individual liberties.\n\n\n\n285   Mobile technology has become a ubiquitous feature of our age. Mobile\n\nphones are not just instruments to facilitate a telephone conversation. They\n\nare a storehouse of data reflecting upon personal preferences, lifestyles and\n\nindividual choices.

Instead of furnishing an option to submit one of six OVDs,\n\nsubmission of Aadhaar number alone is mandated.

If a client who is eligible to be enrolled for\n\nAadhaar and to obtain a PAN card does not submit its details while\n\ncommencing an account based relationship, there is a period of six months\n\nreserved for submission. Those who already have accounts are required to\n\nsubmit their Aadhaar numbers by a stipulated date. Failure to do so, renders\n\nthe account subject to the consequence that it shall cease to be operational\n\nuntil compliance is effected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1633\">\n\nFollowing the amendments to the rules, the Reserve Bank has updated its\n\nMaster Circular on 20 April 2018 to bring it into conformity with the amended\n\nrules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1634\">\n\n296      In deciding whether the amendment brought about in 2017 to the rules\n\nis valid, it is necessary to bear in mind what has already been set out earlier\n\non the aspect of proportionality. Does the requirement of the submission or\n\nlinking of an Aadhaar number to every account- based relationship satisfy the\n\ntest of proportionality?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1635\">\n\nThe state has a legitimate aim in preventing money-laundering. In fact, it is\n\nwith a view to curb and deal with money-laundering that the original version of\n\nthe Master Circular as well as its updated version impose conditions for initial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1225\">                                      408</span>\n\f                                                                         PART I\n\n\nand on-going due diligence. The Reserve Bank has introduced several\n\nreporting requirements including those required to comply with FATCA norms.\n\nThe existence of a legitimate state aim satisfies only one element of\n\nproportionality. In its submissions, the Union government has dealt only with\n\nlegitimate aim, leaving the other elements of proportionality unanswered.\n\nRequiring every client in an account based relationship to link the Aadhaar\n\nnumber with a bank account and to impose an authentication requirement, is\n\nexcessive to the aim and object of the state. There can be no presumption\n\nthat all existing account holders as well as every individual who seeks to open\n\nan account in future is a likely money-launderer. The type of client, the nature\n\nof the business relationship, the nature and value of the transactions and the\n\nterrorism and laundering risks involved may furnish a basis for distinguishing\n\nbetween cases and clients. The rules also fail to make a distinction between\n\nopening an account and operating an account. If an account has been opened\n\nin the past, it would be on the basis of an established identity. The\n\nconsequences of the non-submission of an Aadhaar number are draconian.\n\nNon-submission within the stipulated period will result in a consequence of the\n\naccount ceasing to be operational. A perfectly genuine customer who is\n\ninvolved in no wrongdoing would be deprived of the use of the moneys and\n\ninvestments reflected in the account, in violation of <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_2183\">Article 300A</a> of the\n\nConstitution purely on an assumption that he or she has indulged in money-\n\nlaundering. The classification is over-inclusive: a uniform requirement of such\n\na nature cannot be imposed on every account based relationship irrespective\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1226\">                                      409</span>\n\f                                                                          PART I\n\n\nof the risks involved to the financial system. The account of a pensioner or of\n\na salaried wage earner cannot be termed with the same brush as a high net-\n\nworth individual with cross-border inflows and outflows.         Treating every\n\naccount holder with a highly intrusive norm suffers from manifest arbitrariness.\n\nMoreover, there is no specific provision in the Act warranting a consequence\n\nof an account holder being deprived of the moneys standing in the account,\n\neven if for a temporary period. <a href=\"/doc/1843082/\" id=\"a_2184\">Section 12(1)(c)</a> empowers a reporting entity\n\nto verify the entity or its client in such a manner and “subject to such\n\nconditions” as may be prescribed. This does not envisage a consequence of\n\nan account ceasing to be operational. Blocking an account is a deprivation of\n\nproperty under <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_2185\">Article 300A.</a> The Union Government has been unable to\n\ndischarge the burden of establishing that this was the least intrusive means of\n\nachieving its aim to prevent money-laundering or that its object would have\n\nbeen defeated if it were not to impose the requirement of a compulsory linking\n\nof Aadhaar numbers with all account based relationships with the reporting\n\nentity. Money-laundering is indeed a serious matter and the Union\n\nGovernment is entitled to take necessary steps including by classifying\n\ntransactions and sources which give rise to reasonable grounds for suspecting\n\na violation of law. But, to impose a uniform requirement of linking Aadhaar\n\nnumbers with all account based relationships is clearly disproportionate and\n\nexcessive. It fails to meet the test of proportionality and suffers from manifest\n\narbitrariness. While we have come to the above conclusion, we clarify that this\n\nwould not preclude the Union Government in the exercise of its rule making\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1227\">                                      410</span>\n\f                                                                               PART J\n\n\npower and the Reserve Bank of India as the regulator to re-design the\n\nrequirements in a manner that would ensure due fulfillment of the object of\n\npreventing money-laundering, subject to compliance with the principles of\n\nproportionality as outlined in this judgment.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1636\">J     Savings in <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2186\">Section 59</a>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/677785/\" id=\"a_2187\">297</a>   Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act provides:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1637\">             “Anything done or any action taken by the Central\n             Government under the Resolution of the Government of India,\n             Planning Commission bearing notification number A-\n             43011/02/2009-Admin.

Significantly, the 2009\n\nnotification did not contain any reference to the use of biometrics for the\n\npurpose of the generation of Aadhaar numbers. The notification gave no\n\nauthority to collect biometrics. Biometrics, finger prints or iris scans were not\n\nwithin its purview.

Having failed to specify finger prints and iris\n\nscans in the notification, the validating provision does not extend to the\n\ncollection of biometric data before the Act. The 2009 notification did not\n\nprovide authority to any government department or to any entity to collect\n\nbiometrics. Since the collection of biometrics was not authorised by the 2009\n\nnotification, Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act does not validate these actions.\n\n\n\n304        The collection of the biometrics of individuals impacts their privacy and\n\ndignity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"766560\" id=\"span_1235\">Informed consent is crucial to the validity of a state mandated\n\nmeasure to collect biometric data.

An executive notification does\n\nnot satisfy the requirement of a valid law contemplated in Puttaswamy. A\n\nvalid law, in this case, would mean a law enacted by Parliament, which is just,\n\nfair and reasonable.

The\n\nformat of the first two enrolment forms used by UIDAI, under which around 90\n\ncrore enrolments were done, had no mention of informed consent or the use\n\nof biometrics. Hence, this submission is rejected.\n\n\n\nApart from the existence of a valid law which authorises an invasion of\n\nprivacy, Puttaswamy requires that the law must have adequate safeguards\n\nfor the collection and storage of personal data. Data protection, which is\n\nintrinsic to privacy, seeks to protect the autonomy of the individual. The\n\njudgment noted the centrality of consent in a data protection regime.

The collection of\n\nbiometrics after the 2009 notification and prior to the Aadhaar Act suffers from\n\nthe absence of adequate safeguards. While a legislature has the power to\n\nlegislate retrospectively, it cannot retrospectively create a deeming fiction\n\nabout the existence of safeguards in the past to justify an encroachment on a\n\nfundamental right. At the time when the enrolments took place prior to the\n\nenactment of the Aadhaar Act in September 2016, there was an absence of\n\nadequate safeguards. <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2220\">Section 59</a> cannot by a deeming fiction, as it were,\n\nextend the safeguards provided under the Act to the enrolments done earlier.\n\nThis will be impermissible simply because the informed consent of those\n\nindividuals, whose Aadhaar numbers were generated in that period cannot be\n\nretrospectively legislated by an assumption of law. Moreover, it is a principle\n\nof criminal law that it cannot be applied retrospectively to acts which were not\n\noffences at the time when they took place. <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_2221\">Article 20(1)</a> of the Constitution\n\nprovides that “No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation\n\nof the law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an\n\noffence”. The application of the criminal provisions of the Act, provided under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2222\">Chapter VII of the Act</a> which deals with “Offences and Penalties”, cannot be\n\nextended to the period prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act.\n\n\n\n305   The Respondents submit that the collection of biometrics prior to the\n\nAadhaar Act was adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the Information\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1238\">                                      418</span>\n\f                                                                               <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_2223\">PART J\n\n\nTechnology Act</a> 2000;

Indeed, it\n\nwas the absence of those safeguards in the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_2236\">Information Technology Act</a> which\n\nrequired their introduction in the Aadhaar Act. Hence, the Attorney General is\n\nnot correct in submitting that India operated under a regime of comprehensive\n\nsafeguards governing biometric data during the period when the Aadhaar\n\nproject was governed by an executive notification, in the absence of a\n\nlegislative framework. The absence of a legislative framework rendered the\n\ncollection of biometric data vulnerable to serious violations of privacy. There\n\nare two distinct facets here. First, the absence of a legislative framework for\n\nthe Aadhaar project between 2009 and 2016 left the biometric data of millions\n\nof Indian citizens bereft of the kind of protection which a law, as envisaged in\n\nPuttaswamy, must provide to comprehensively protect and enforce the right\n\nto privacy. Second, the notification of 2009 does not authorise the collection of\n\nbiometric data. Consequently, the validation of actions taken under the 2009\n\nnotification by <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2237\">Section 59</a> does not save the collection of biometric data prior\n\nto the enforcement of the Act. Privacy is of paramount importance. No\n\ninvasion of privacy can be allowed without proper, adequate and stringent\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1242\">                                      422</span>\n\f                                                                                PART J\n\n\nsafeguards providing not only penalties for misuse or loss of one’s personal\n\ninformation, but also for protection of that person.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1649\">307   The Respondents have relied upon several judgments where this Court\n\nhas upheld validating statutes, which, they contend, are similar to <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2238\">Section 59</a>.\n\nThe first decision which needs to be discussed is the judgment of the\n\nConstitution Bench in West Ramnad, which dealt with a validating statute of\n\nthe Madras Legislature.

In the meantime, the Constitution came into\n\nforce, and under the Seventh Schedule, the State acquired legislative\n\ncompetence.

The first part of the section deals, inter alia, with\n            notifications which have been validly issued under the\n            relevant provisions of the earlier Act and it means that if\n            the earlier Act had been valid at the relevant time, it ought to\n            appear that the notifications in question could have been and\n            had in fact been made properly under the said Act.

The second part of the section provides\n            that the notifications covered by the first part are declared by\n            this Act to have been validly issued; the expression “hereby\n            declared” clearly means “declared by this Act” and that shows\n            that the notifications covered by the first part would be treated\n            as issued under the relevant provisions of the Act and would\n            be treated as validly issued under the said provisions. The\n            third part of the section provides that the statutory declaration\n            about the validity of the issue of the notification would be\n            subject to this exception that the said notification should not\n            be inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of the Act.\n            In other words, the effect of this section is that if a\n            notification had been issued properly under the\n            provisions of the earlier Act and its validity could not\n            have been impeached if the said provisions were\n            themselves valid, it would be deemed to have been\n            validly issued under the provisions of the Act, provided,\n            of course, it is not inconsistent with the other provisions\n            of the Act. The section is not very happily worded, but on its\n            fair and reasonable construction, there can be no doubt about\n            its meaning or effect.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1650\">308   The second decision is a four judge Bench judgment in Chetty, which\n\ndealt with the competence of a legislature to remedy a discriminatory\n\nprocedure retrospectively.

The Validation Act was challenged\n\non the ground that it was discriminatory to provide two Acts which prescribed\n\ntwo different procedures under the acquisition laws in the same field. This\n\nCourt found that the legislature retrospectively made a single law for the\n\nacquisition of properties and upheld the validating Act. It was held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1795\">             “15. If two procedures exist and one is followed and the other\n             discarded, there may in a given case be found discrimination.\n             But the Legislature has still the competence to put out of\n             action retrospectively one of the procedures leaving one\n             procedure only available, namely, the one followed and thus\n             to make disappear the discrimination. In this way a Validating\n             Act can get over discrimination. Where, however, the\n             legislative competence is not available, the discrimination\n             must remain for ever, since that discrimination can only be\n             removed by a legislature having power to create a single\n             procedure out of two and not by a legislature which has not\n             that power.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1651\">309   In West Ramnad, the validation depended upon the condition that a\n\nnotification or act ought to have been validly issued or done under the earlier\n\nstatute, presuming that the earlier Act was itself valid at that time. In the\n\npresent case, there was no earlier law governing the actions of the\n\ngovernment for the collection of biometric data. The Aadhaar Act was notified\n\nin 2016. The Planning Commission’s notification of 2009 and the Ministry of\n\nInformation and Technology’s notification of 2015 were not issued under any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1246\">                                            426</span>\n\f                                                                         PART J\n\n\nstatute. Therefore, the validating law in West Ramnad was clearly of a\n\ndistinct genre. West Ramnad will be of no assistance to the Union of India.\n\n\n\n310   The decision in Chetty in fact brings out the essential attributes of a\n\nvalidating law. The existence of two legislations governing the field of land\n\nacquisition had been found to be discriminatory and hence violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2253\">Article\n\n14</a> by the High Court (on the basis of the position in law as it then stood).\n\nDuring the pendency of the appeal before this Court, the legislature enacted a\n\nvalidating law which removed the cause for invalidity. The reason the state\n\nlaw had been invalidated by the High Court was the existence of two laws\n\ngoverning the same field. This defect was removed. To use the words of this\n\nCourt, the legislature “put out of action retrospectively one of the procedures”\n\nas a result of which only one procedure was left in the field. The decision in\n\nChetty thus brings out the true nature of a validating law. A validating law\n\nessentially removes the deficiency which is found to exist in the earlier\n\nenactment. By curing the defect, it validates actions taken under a previous\n\nenactment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1652\">\n\n311   The third judgment of seven judges is in Hari Singh.

It was therefore said that the\n            1971 Act could not validate actions done under the 1958 Act.\n            The answer is for the reasons indicated above that the\n            Legislature was competent to enact this legislation in 1958\n            and the Legislature by the 1971 Act has given the legislation\n            full retrospective operation.

Parliament, which\n\nundoubtedly possessed legislative competence, could enact a fresh law with\n\nretrospective effect and protect actions taken under the state law.

The power is\n\nplenary because the legislature can legislate with prospective as well as with\n\nretrospective effect. Where a law suffers from a defect or has been\n\ninvalidated, it is open to the legislature to remove the defect. While doing that,\n\nthe legislature can validate administrative acts or decisions made under the\n\ninvalid law in the past. The true test of a validation is that it must remove the\n\ndefects in the earlier law. It is not enough for the validating law to state that\n\nthe grounds of invalidity of the earlier law are deemed to have been removed.\n\nThe validating law must remove the deficiencies. There were several\n\ndeficiencies in the collection of biometric data during the period between 2009\n\nand 2016, before the Aadhaar Act came into force. The first was the absence\n\nof enabling legislation. As a result, the collection of sensitive personal\n\ninformation took place without the authority of law. Second, the notification of\n\n2009 did not authorize the collection of biometric data. Third, the collection of\n\nbiometric data was without an enabling framework of the nature which the\n\nAadhaar Act put into place with effect from 2016. The Aadhaar Act introduced\n\na regime for obtaining informed consent, securing the confidentiality of\n\ninformation collected from citizens, penalties and offences for breach and\n\nregulated the uses to which the data which was collected could be put. In the\n\nabsence of safeguards, the collection of biometric data prior of the enactment\n\nof Aadhaar Act 2016 is ultra vires.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1658\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1254\">                                       433</span>\n\f                                                                          PART J\n\n\n318   <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2271\">Section 59</a> does not remove the cause for invalidity.

There can be no dispute about the\n\nprinciple that the legislature is entitled to cure the violation of a fundamental\n\nright. But in order to do so, it is necessary to cure the basis or the foundation\n\non which there was a violation of the fundamental right. The deficiency must\n\nbe demonstrated to be cured by the validating law. <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2276\">Section 59</a> evidently fails\n\nto do so.

While both these concepts have not\n\nbeen specified in as many words in the Constitution, they have received\n\nimmense attention from this Court in its judgments.                               Though the Indian\n\nConstitution does not follow the doctrine of separation of powers in a rigid\n\nsense, the following statement of the law by Chief Justice Mukherjea in <a href=\"/doc/1318432/\" id=\"a_2293\">Ram\n\nSahib Ram Jawaya Kapur v State of Punjab566</a> is widely regarded as\n\ndefining the core of its content:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1818\">                 “12…The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the\n                 doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the\n                 functions of the different parts or branches of the Government\n                 have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can\n                 very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate\n                 assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions\n                 that essentially belong to another...”\n\n\n\nSeparation of powers envisages a system of checks and balances, which\n\nensures governance by law and not by the caprice of those to whom\n\ngovernance is entrusted for the time being.

However, the structure\n                  provided in our Constitution leaves no manner of doubt that\n                  the doctrine of separation of powers runs through the Indian\n                  Constitution. It is for this reason that this Court has\n                  recognized separation of power as a basic feature of the\n                  Constitution and an essential constituent of the rule of law.\n                  The doctrine of separation of powers is, though, not expressly\n                  engrafted in the Constitution, its sweep, operation and\n                  visibility are apparent from the Constitution.

Was it then open to government to\n\nlaunch upon a virtual spree of administrative notifications making Aadhaar a\n\nmandatory requirement of virtually every aspect of human existence from birth\n\nuntil death?\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1678\">The position which the Union government has adopted before this court is\n\nsimply this: interim directions were issued by this court when the Aadhaar\n\nproject was governed by executive instructions. Once a law was enacted by\n\nParliament, a statutory authorisation was brought into existence to enable\n\ngovernment to issue administrative instructions. Hence, compliance with the\n\ninterim orders stands obviated upon the enactment of the law.\n\n\n\n334        This defence of government can be scrutinized at two levels – the first\n\nas a matter of statutory interpretation and the second, on a broader\n\nfoundation which engages the judicial power of this court. As a matter of\n599   Ibid at pages 83-84\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1299\">                                                  454</span>\n\f                                                                          PART K\n\n\nstatutory interpretation, the Aadhaar Act did not, as it could not have, merely\n\nnullified the interim orders of this court. <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2314\">Section 59</a> has no provision which\n\ngives it overriding effect notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of a\n\ncourt. The interim orders do not stand superseded. Apart from approaching\n\nthe issue purely as a matter of statutory interpretation, there are broader\n\nconcerns which arise from the manner in which the authorities proceeded,\n\noblivious to the interim directions. Interim directions were issued by this court\n\nin a situation where a constitutional challenge was addressed in a batch of\n\npetitions on the ground that the Aadhaar project was offensive to fundamental\n\nrights, including the right to privacy. So significant was the nature of the\n\nchallenge that it was referred initially to a Constitution Bench and thereafter,\n\nto a bench of nine-judges of this Court for resolving the question as to\n\nwhether privacy is a protected fundamental right. The collection and storage\n\nof biometric data and its use for the purpose of authentication is the subject of\n\na constitutional challenge. Noting the nature of the challenge and after\n\nconsidering the serious issues which have arisen in the case, successive\n\nbenches of this Court issued a series of interim directions. The purport of\n\nthose directions is that Aadhaar could not be made mandatory except for\n\nspecified schemes which were listed by the court. Moreover, in the context of\n\nthe serious grievance of financial exclusion, the court directed that no\n\nindividual should be excluded from the receipt of welfare entitlements, such as\n\nfood-grains, for want of an Aadhaar number. The constitutional challenge was\n\nnot obviated merely on the enactment of the Aadhaar Act. The law gave a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1300\">                                       455</span>\n\f                                                                         PART K\n\n\nstatutory character to a project which since 2009 was possessed of an\n\nadministrative or executive nature. The constitutional challenge to some of the\n\nbasic features underlying the collection of biometric data still remained to be\n\naddressed by the court. The proceedings before this Court are testimony to\n\nthe fact that the issue of constitutionality was indeed live. That being the\n\nposition, the issuance of a spate of administrative notifications is in defiance\n\nof the interim orders passed by this Court. Judicial orders, be they interim or\n\nfinal, cannot simply be wished away. If governments or citizens were allowed\n\nto ignore judicially enforceable directions, that would negate the basis of the\n\nrule of law. Both propriety and constitutional duty required Union government\n\nto move this Court after the enactment of the Aadhaar Act for variation of the\n\ninterim orders. Such an application would have required this Court to weigh\n\non the one hand the subsequent development of the law being passed\n\n(something which would be relied upon by government) with the constitutional\n\nconcerns over the entire biometric project. It is not as if that the mere\n\nenactment of the law put an end to the constitutional challenge. The existence\n\nof law (post 2016) is only one aspect to be considered in deciding the interim\n\narrangement which would hold the field when the constitutional challenge was\n\npending adjudication before this Court. Institutions of governance are bound\n\nby a sense of constitutional morality which requires them to abide by judicial\n\norders. What seems to emerge from the course of action which has been\n\nfollowed in the present case by government is a perception that judicial\n\ndirections can be ignored on a supposed construction of the statute. Besides\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1301\">                                      456</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART K\n\n\nthe fact that this construction is erroneous in law, it is above all, the\n\nfundamental duty of this Court to ensure that its orders are not treated with\n\ndisdain.

The decision of the Speaker of the\n\n      Lok Sabha to certify a Bill as a Money Bill has a direct impact on the\n\n      role of the Rajya Sabha, since the latter has a limited role in the passing\n\n      of a Money Bill. A decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to declare\n\n      an ordinary Bill to be a Money Bill limits the role of the Rajya Sabha.\n\n      The power of the Speaker cannot be exercised arbitrarily in violation of\n\n      constitutional norms and values, as it damages the essence of federal\n\n      bicameralism, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\n      Judicial review of the Speaker’s decision, on whether a Bill is a Money\n\n      Bill, is therefore necessary to protect the basic structure of the\n\n      Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1686\">\n(2) To be certified a Money Bill, a Bill must contain “only provisions” dealing\n\n   with every or any one of the matters set out in sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2331\">Article 110(1).</a> A Bill, which has both provisions which fall within sub-\n\n   clauses (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2332\">Article 110(1)</a> and provisions which fall outside their\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1311\">                                      463</span>\n\f                                                                        PART L\n\n\n   scope, will not qualify to be a Money Bill. Thus, when a Bill which has\n\n   been passed as a Money Bill has certain provisions which fall beyond the\n\n   scope of sub-clauses (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2333\">Article 110(1)</a>, these provisions cannot\n\n   be severed. If the bill was not a Money Bill, the role of the Rajya Sabha in\n\n   its legislative passage could not have been denuded. The debasement of\n\n   a constitutional institution cannot be countenanced by the Court.\n\n   Democracy survives when constitutional institutions are vibrant.\n\n\n\n(3) The Aadhaar Act creates a statutory framework for obtaining a unique\n\n   identity number, which is capable of being used for “any” purpose, among\n\n   which availing benefits, subsidies and services, for which expenses are\n\n   incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, is just one purpose provided\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2334\">Section 7</a>. Clause (e) of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2335\">Article 110(1)</a> requires that a Money Bill\n\n   must deal with the declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged\n\n   on the Consolidated Fund of India (or increasing the amount of the\n\n   expenditure). <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2336\">Section 7</a> fails to fulfil this requirement. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2337\">Section 7</a> does not\n\n   declare the expenditure incurred to be a charge on the Consolidated\n\n   Fund. It only provides that in the case of such services, benefits or\n\n   subsidies, Aadhaar can be made mandatory to avail of them. Moreover,\n\n   provisions other than <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2338\">Section 7</a> of the Act deal with several aspects\n\n   relating to the Aadhaar numbers: enrolment on the basis of demographic\n\n   and biometric information, generation of Aadhaar numbers, obtaining the\n\n   consent of individuals before collecting their individual information,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1312\">                                     464</span>\n\f                                                                        PART L\n\n\n   creation of a statutory authority to implement and supervise the process,\n\n   protection of information collected during the process, disclosure of\n\n   information in certain circumstances, creation of offences and penalties for\n\n   disclosure or loss of information, and the use of the Aadhaar number for\n\n   “any purpose”. All these provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not lie within the\n\n   scope of sub-clauses (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2339\">Article 110(1).</a> Hence, in the alternate,\n\n   even if it is held that <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2340\">Section 7</a> bears a nexus to the expenditure incurred\n\n   from the Consolidated Fund of India, the other provisions of the Act fail to\n\n   fall within the domain of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2341\">Article 110(1).</a> Thus, the Aadhaar Act is declared\n\n   unconstitutional for failing to meet the necessary requirements to have\n\n   been certified as a Money Bill under <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2342\">Article 110(1).</a>\n\n\n\n(4) The argument that the Aadhaar Act is in pith and substance a Money Bill,\n\n   with its main objective being the delivery of subsidies, benefits and\n\n   services flowing out of the Consolidated Fund of India and that the other\n\n   provisions are ancillary to the main purpose of the Act also holds no\n\n   ground, since the doctrine of pith and substance is used to examine\n\n   whether the legislature has the competence to enact a law with regard to\n\n   any of the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The\n\n   doctrine cannot be invoked to declare whether a Bill satisfies the\n\n   requirements set out in <a href=\"/doc/72095/\" id=\"a_2343\">Article 110</a> of the Constitution to be certified a\n\n   Money Bill. The argument of the Union of India misses the point that a Bill\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1313\">                                     465</span>\n\f                                                                           PART L\n\n\n   can be certified as a Money Bill “only” if it deals with all or any of the\n\n   matters contained in clauses (a) to (g) of <a href=\"/doc/1694744/\" id=\"a_2344\">Article 110(1).</a>\n\n\n(5) Having held that the Aadhaar Act is unconstitutional for having been\n\n   passed as a Money Bill this judgment has also analysed the merits of the\n\n   other constitutional challenges to the legislation as well as to the\n\n   framework of the project before the law was enacted.\n\n\n\n(6) The architecture of the Aadhaar Act seeks to create a unique identity for\n\n   residents on the basis of their demographic and biometric information. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_2345\">The\n\n   Act</a> sets up a process of identification by which the unique identity\n\n   assigned to each individual is verified with the demographic and biometric\n\n   information pertaining to that individual which is stored in a centralised\n\n   repository of data. Identification of beneficiaries is integral and essential to\n\n   the fulfilment of social welfare schemes and programmes, which are a part\n\n   of the State’s attempts to ensure that its citizens have access to basic\n\n   human facilities. This judgment accepts the contention of the Union of\n\n   India that there is a legitimate state aim in maintaining a system of\n\n   identification to ensure that the welfare benefits provided by the State\n\n   reach the beneficiaries who are entitled, without diversion.\n\n\n\n(7) The Aadhaar programme involves application of biometric technology,\n\n   which uses an individual’s biometric data as the basis of authentication or\n\n   identification and is therefore intimately connected to the individual. While\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1314\">                                       466</span>\n\f                                                                         PART L\n\n\n   citizens have privacy interests in personal or private information collected\n\n   about them, the unique nature of biometric data distinguishes it from other\n\n   personal data, compounding concerns regarding privacy protections\n\n   safeguarding    biometric   information.   Once   a   biometric   system   is\n\n   compromised, it is compromised forever. Therefore, it is imperative that\n\n   concerns about protecting privacy must be addressed while developing a\n\n   biometric system. Adequate norms must be laid down for each step from\n\n   the collection to retention of biometric data. At the time of collection,\n\n   individuals must be informed about the collection procedure, the intended\n\n   purpose of the collection, the reason why the particular data set is\n\n   requested and who will have access to their data. Additionally, the\n\n   retention period must be justified and individuals must be given the right to\n\n   access, correct and delete their data at any point in time, a procedure\n\n   familiar to an opt-out option.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1687\">\n\n(8) Prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, no mandatory obligation was\n\n   imposed upon the Registrars or the enrolling agencies, to obtain informed\n\n   consent from residents before recording their biometric data, to inform\n\n   them how the biometric data would be stored and used and about the\n\n   existence of adequate safeguards to secure the data. Moreover, prior to\n\n   the enactment of the Act, while UIDAI had itself contemplated that an\n\n   identity theft could occur at the time of enrollment for Aadhaar cards, it\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1315\">                                      467</span>\n\f                                                                           PART L\n\n\n    had no solution to the possible harms which could result after the identity\n\n    theft of a person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1688\">\n\n(9) The Regulations framed subsequently under the Aadhaar Act also do not\n\n    provide a robust mechanism on how informed consent is to be obtained\n\n    from residents before collecting their biometric data. The Aadhaar Act and\n\n    Regulations are bereft of the procedure through which an individual can\n\n    access information related to his or her authentication record. The\n\n    Aadhaar Act clearly has no defined options that should be made available\n\n    to the Aadhaar number holders in case they do not wish to submit identity\n\n    information during authentication, nor do the regulations specify the\n\n    procedure to be followed in case the Aadhaar number holder does not\n\n    provide consent for authentication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1689\">\n\n(10) <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_2346\">Sections 29(1)</a> and (2) of the Act create a distinction between two classes\n\n    of information (core biometric information and identity information), which\n\n    are integral to individual identity and require equal protection. <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_2347\">Section\n\n    29(4)</a> suffers from overbreadth as it gives wide discretionary power to\n\n    UIDAI to publish, display or post core biometric information of an individual\n\n    for purposes specified by the regulations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1690\">\n\n(11) <a href=\"/doc/137331837/\" id=\"a_2348\">Sections 2(g)</a>, (j), (k) and (t) suffer from overbreadth, as these can lead to\n\n    an invasive collection of biological attributes. These provisions give\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1316\">                                       468</span>\n\f                                                                           PART L\n\n\n   discretionary power to UIDAI to define the scope of biometric and\n\n   demographic information and empower it to expand on the nature of\n\n   information already collected at the time of enrollment, to the extent of\n\n   also collecting any “such other biological attributes” that it may deem fit.\n\n\n\n(12) There is no clarity on how an individual is supposed to update his/her\n\n   biometric information, in case the biometric information mismatches with\n\n   the data stored in CIDR. The proviso to Section 28(5) of the Aadhaar Act,\n\n   which disallows an individual access to the biometric information that\n\n   forms the core of his or her unique ID, is violative of a fundamental\n\n   principle that ownership of an individual’s data must at all times vest with\n\n   the individual. UIDAI is also provided wide powers in relation to removing\n\n   the biometric locking of residents. With this analysis of the measures\n\n   taken by the Government of India prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar\n\n   Act as well as a detailed analysis of the provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_2349\">Aadhaar Act,\n\n   2016</a> and supporting Regulations made under it, this judgment concludes\n\n   that the Aadhaar programme violates essential norms pertaining to\n\n   informational privacy, self-determination and data protection.\n\n\n\n(13) The State is under a constitutional obligation to safeguard the dignity of\n\n    its citizens. Biometric technology which is the core of the Aadhaar\n\n    programme is probabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures.\n\n    These authentication failures have led to the denial of rights and legal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1317\">                                      469</span>\n\f                                                                          PART L\n\n\n    entitlements. The Aadhaar project has failed to account for and remedy\n\n    the flaws in its framework and design which has led to serious instances\n\n    of exclusion of eligible beneficiaries as demonstrated by the official\n\n    figures from Government records including the Economic Survey of India\n\n    2016-17 and research studies. Dignity and the rights of individuals cannot\n\n    be made to depend on algorithms or probabilities. Constitutional\n\n    guarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes of technology. Denial of\n\n    benefits arising out of any social security scheme which promotes socio-\n\n    economic rights of citizens is violative of human dignity and impermissible\n\n    under our constitutional scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1691\">\n\n(14) The violations of fundamental rights resulting from the Aadhaar scheme\n\n    were tested on the touchstone of proportionality. The measures adopted\n\n    by the respondents fail to satisfy the test of necessity and proportionality\n\n    for the following reasons:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1692\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1861\">  (a) Under the Aadhaar project, requesting entities can hold the identity\n\n     information of individuals, for a temporary period.

ASAs have also been permitted to\n\n     store logs of authentication transactions for a specific time period. It has\n\n     been admitted by UIDAI that it gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique\n\n     device code and the registered device code used for authentication,\n\n     and that UIDAI would know from which device the authentication took\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1318\">                                       470</span>\n\f                                                                       PART L\n\n\n   place and through which AUA/ASA.

This is in violation of\n\n   widely recognized data minimisation principles which mandate that data\n\n   collectors and processors delete personal data records when the\n\n   purpose for which it has been collected is fulfilled. Moreover, using the\n\n   meta-data related to the transaction, the location of the authentication\n\n   can easily be traced using the IP address, which impacts upon the\n\n   privacy of the individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1862\">(b) From the verification log, it is possible to locate the places of\n\n   transactions by an individual in the past five years. It is also possible\n\n   through the Aadhaar database to track the current location of an\n\n   individual, even without the verification log. The architecture of Aadhaar\n\n   poses a risk of potential surveillance activities through the Aadhaar\n\n   database. Any leakage in the verification log poses an additional risk of\n\n   an individual’s biometric data being vulnerable to unauthorised\n\n   exploitation by third parties.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1863\">(c) The biometric database in the CIDR is accessible to third-party vendors\n\n   providing biometric search and de-duplication algorithms, since neither\n\n   the Central Government nor UIDAI have the source code for the de-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1693\">   duplication technology which is at the heart of the programme.

If the requirement of Aadhaar is made mandatory for every\n\n   benefit or service which the government provides, it is impossible to live\n\n   in contemporary India without Aadhaar. The inclusion of services and\n\n   benefits in <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2367\">Section 7</a> is a pre-cursor to the kind of function creep which\n\n   is inconsistent with the right to informational self-determination. <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_2368\">Section\n\n   7</a> is therefore arbitrary and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2369\">Article 14</a> in relation to the\n\n   inclusion of services and benefits as defined.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1708\">(l) The legitimate aim of the State can be fulfilled by adopting less intrusive\n\n   measures as opposed to the mandatory enforcement of the Aadhaar\n\n   scheme as the sole repository of identification.

Moreover, the notification of 2009 did not authorise the\n\n    collection of biometric data. Consequently, the validation of actions taken\n\n    under the 2009 notification by <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2372\">Section 59</a> does not save the collection of\n\n    biometric data prior to the enforcement of the Act. While Parliament\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1324\">                                     476</span>\n\f                                                                          PART L\n\n\n    possesses the competence to enact a validating law, it must cure the\n\n    cause of infirmity or invalidity. <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2373\">Section 59</a> fails to cure the cause of\n\n    invalidity prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act. The absence of a\n\n    legislative framework for the Aadhaar project between 2009 and 2016 left\n\n    the biometric data of millions of Indian citizens bereft of the kind of\n\n    protection which must be provided to comprehensively protect and\n\n    enforce the right to privacy. <a href=\"/doc/638929/\" id=\"a_2374\">Section 59</a> therefore fails to meet the test of\n\n    a validating law since the complete absence of a regulatory framework\n\n    and safeguards cannot be cured merely by validating what was done\n\n    under the notifications of 2009 and 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1713\">\n(16) The decision in Puttaswamy recognised that revenue constitutes a\n\n   legitimate state aim in the three-pronged test of proportionality. However,\n\n   the existence of a legitimate aim is insufficient to uphold the validity of the\n\n   law, which must also meet the other parameters of proportionality spelt out\n\n   in Puttaswamy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1714\">\n(17) The seeding of Aadhaar with PAN cards depends on the constitutional\n\n   validity of the Aadhaar legislation itself. <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_2375\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax\n\n   Act 1962 is based on the premise that the Aadhaar Act itself is a valid\n\n   legislation. Since the Aadhaar Act itself is now held to be unconstitutional\n\n   for having been enacted as a Money Bill and on the touchstone of\n\n   proportionality, the seeding of Aadhaar to PAN under Article 139AA does\n\n   not stand independently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1715\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1325\">                                      477</span>\n\f                                                                          PART L\n\n\n\n(18) The 2017 amendments to the PMLA Rules fail to satisfy the test of\n\n   proportionality. The imposition of a uniform requirement of linking Aadhaar\n\n   numbers with all account         based relationships proceeds on the\n\n   presumption that all existing account holders as well as every individual\n\n   who seeks to open an account in future is a potential money-launderer. No\n\n   distinction has been made in the degree of imposition based on the client,\n\n   the nature of the business relationship, the nature and value of the\n\n   transactions or the actual possibility of terrorism and money- laundering.\n\n   The rules also fail to make a distinction between opening an account and\n\n   operating an account. Moreover, the consequences of the failure to submit\n\n   an Aadhaar number are draconian. In their present form, the rules are\n\n   clearly disproportionate and excessive. We clarify that this holding would\n\n   not preclude the Union Government in the exercise of its rule making\n\n   power and the Reserve Bank of India as the regulator to re-design the\n\n   requirements in a manner that would ensure due fulfillment of the object of\n\n   preventing money-laundering, subject to compliance with the principles of\n\n   proportionality as outlined in this judgment.\n\n\n\n(19) Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous feature of the lives of people\n\n   and the linking of Aadhaar numbers with SIM cards and the requirement of\n\n   e-KYC authentication of mobile subscribers must necessarily be viewed in\n\n   this light. Applying the proportionality test, the legitimate aim of subscriber\n\n   verification, has to be balanced against the countervailing requirements of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1326\">                                      478</span>\n\f                                                                          PART L\n\n\n    preserving the integrity of biometric data and the privacy of mobile phone\n\n    subscribers. Mobile phones are a storehouse of personal data and reflect\n\n    upon individual preferences, lifestyle and choices.         The conflation of\n\n    biometric information with SIM cards poses grave threats to individual\n\n    privacy, liberty and autonomy. Having due regard to the test of\n\n    proportionality which has been propounded in Puttaswamy and as\n\n    elaborated in this judgment, the decision to link Aadhaar numbers with\n\n    mobile SIM cards is neither valid nor constitutional. The mere existence of\n\n    a legitimate state aim will not justify the disproportionate means which\n\n    have been adopted in the present case. The biometric information and\n\n    Aadhaar details collected by Telecom Service Providers shall be deleted\n\n    forthwith and no use of the said information or details shall be made by\n\n    TSPs or any agency or person or their behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1716\">\n\n(20) Defiance of judicial orders (both interim and final) be it by the government\n\n    or by citizens negates the basis of the rule of law. Both propriety and\n\n    constitutional duty required the Union government to move this Court after\n\n    the enactment of the Aadhaar Act for variation of this Court’s interim\n\n    orders. Institutions of governance are bound by a sense of constitutional\n\n    morality which requires them to abide by judicial orders.\n\n\n\n(21) Identity is necessarily a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes\n\n    a multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1327\">                                      479</span>\n\f                                                                        PART L\n\n\n   The technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different\n\n   constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and\n\n   infringes the right of an individual to identify herself/himself through a\n\n   chosen means.

It must not be allowed to obliterate\n\n   constitutional identity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1717\">\n(22) The entire Aadhaar programme, since 2009, suffers from constitutional\n\n   infirmities and violations of fundamental rights. The enactment of the\n\n   Aadhaar Act does not save the Aadhaar project. The Aadhaar Act, the\n\n   Rules and Regulations framed under it, and the framework prior to the\n\n   enactment of the Act are unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1718\">\n\n(23) To enable the government to initiate steps for ensuring conformity with\n\n   this judgment, it is directed under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_2376\">Article 142</a> that the existing data which\n\n   has been collected shall not be destroyed for a period of one year.

Privacy   postulates   the   reservation   of   a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1379\">\f                                                            28</span>\n\nprivate   space   for   the   individual,   described\nas the right to be let alone. The concept is\nfounded   on   the   autonomy   of   the   individual.\nThe ability of an individual to make choices\nlies   at   the   core   of   the   human   personality.\nThe notion of privacy enables the individual\nto assert and control the human element which\nis   inseparable   from   the   personality   of   the\nindividual.   The   inviolable   nature   of   the\nhuman   personality   is   manifested   in   the\nability to make decisions on matters intimate\nto human life. The autonomy of the individual\nis associated over matters which can be kept\nprivate. These are concerns over which there\nis   a   legitimate   expectation   of   privacy.   The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of\nthe   human   personality.   The   integrity   of   the\nbody  and   the  sanctity  of  the   mind  can  exist\non   the   foundation   that   each   individual\npossesses an inalienable ability and right to\npreserve   a   private   space   in   which   the   human\npersonality  can  develop.   Without   the   ability\nto   make   choices,   the   inviolability   of   the\npersonality would be in doubt. Recognising a\nzone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that\neach individual must be entitled to chart and\npursue   the   course   of   development   of\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of\nhuman   dignity   itself.   Thoughts   and\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an\nindividual are entitled to a zone of privacy\nwhere one is free of social expectations. In\nthat   zone   of   privacy,   an   individual   is   not\njudged   by   others.   Privacy   enables   each\nindividual   to   take   crucial   decisions   which\nfind expression in the human personality. It\nenables   individuals   to   preserve   their\nbeliefs,   thoughts,   expressions,   ideas,\nideologies,   preferences   and   choices   against\nsocietal   demands   of   homogeneity.   Privacy   is\nan intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of\nthe   right   of   the   individual   to   be   different\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1380\">\f                                                            29</span>\n\nand   to   stand   against   the   tide   of   conformity\nin   creating   a   zone   of   solitude.   Privacy\nprotects   the   individual   from   the   searching\nglare   of   publicity   in   matters   which   are\npersonal to his or her life. Privacy attaches\nto the person and not to the place where it\nis   associated.   Privacy   constitutes   the\nfoundation   of   all   liberty   because   it   is   in\nprivacy   that   the   individual   can   decide   how\nliberty is best exercised. Individual dignity\nand   privacy   are   inextricably   linked   in   a\npattern   woven   out   of   a   thread   of   diversity\ninto the fabric of a plural culture.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1883\">   298.  Privacy   of   the   individual   is   an\nessential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both\nan   intrinsic   and   instrumental   value.   As   an\nintrinsic   value,   human   dignity   is   an\nentitlement   or   a   constitutionally   protected\ninterest   in   itself.   In   its   instrumental\nfacet,   dignity   and   freedom   are   inseparably\nintertwined,   each   being   a   facilitative   tool\nto   achieve   the   other.   The   ability   of   the\nindividual   to   protect   a   zone   of   privacy\nenables the realisation of the full value of\nlife   and   liberty.   Liberty   has   a   broader\nmeaning   of   which   privacy   is   a   subset.   All\nliberties   may   not   be   exercised   in   privacy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1790\">Yet   others   can   be   fulfilled   only   within   a\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual\nto retain the autonomy of the body and mind.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1791\">The autonomy of the individual is the ability\nto make decisions on vital matters of concern\nto   life.   Privacy  has   not  been  couched  as   an\nindependent  fundamental  right.   But   that  does\nnot   detract   from   the   constitutional\nprotection   afforded   to   it,   once   the   true\nnature   of   privacy   and   its   relationship   with\nthose   fundamental   rights   which   are   expressly\nprotected   is   understood.   Privacy   lies   across\nthe   spectrum   of   protected   freedoms.   The\nguarantee of equality is a guarantee against\narbitrary State action. It prevents the State\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1381\">\f                                                            30</span>\n\nfrom   discriminating   between   individuals.   The\ndestruction   by   the   State   of   a   sanctified\npersonal space whether of the body or of the\nmind   is   violative   of   the   guarantee   against\narbitrary   State   action.   Privacy   of   the   body\nentitles   an   individual   to   the   integrity   of\nthe   physical   aspects   of   personhood.   The\nintersection   between   one’s   mental   integrity\nand   privacy   entitles   the   individual   to\nfreedom of thought, the freedom to believe in\nwhat   is   right,   and   the   freedom   of   self­\ndetermination.   When   these   guarantees\nintersect with gender, they create a private\nspace which protects all those elements which\nare   crucial   to   gender   identity.   The   family,\nmarriage,   procreation   and   sexual   orientation\nare   all   integral   to   the   dignity   of   the\nindividual.   Above   all,   the   privacy   of   the\nindividual   recognises   an   inviolable  right   to\ndetermine how freedom shall be exercised. An\nindividual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression   is   to   remain   silent.   Silence\npostulates   a   realm   of   privacy.   An   artist\nfinds   reflection   of   the   soul   in   a   creative\nendeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of\na process of thought. A musician contemplates\nupon   notes   which   musically   lead   to   silence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1792\">The   silence,   which   lies   within,   reflects   on\nthe ability to choose how to convey thoughts\nand ideas or interact with others. These are\ncrucial   aspects   of   personhood.   The   freedoms\nunder   <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2483\">Article   19</a>   can   be   fulfilled   where   the\nindividual is entitled to decide upon his or\nher   preferences.   Read   in   conjunction   with\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2484\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to\nhave   a   choice   of   preferences   on   various\nfacets   of   life   including   what   and   how   one\nwill  eat,  the  way  one  will  dress,  the  faith\none   will   espouse   and   a   myriad   other   matters\non   which   autonomy   and   self­determination\nrequire   a   choice   to   be   made   within   the\nprivacy of the mind. The constitutional right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1382\">\f                                                                 31</span>\n\n     to   the   freedom   of   religion   under   <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_2485\">Article   25</a>\n     has implicit within it the ability to choose\n     a   faith   and   the   freedom   to   express   or   not\n     express those choices to the world. These are\n     some   illustrations   of   the   manner   in   which\n     privacy  facilitates  freedom  and  is   intrinsic\n     to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution\n     does   not   contain   a   separate   article   telling\n     us   that   privacy   has   been   declared   to   be   a\n     fundamental   right.   Nor   have   we   tagged   the\n     provisions of Part III with an alpha­suffixed\n     right   to   privacy:   this   is   not   an   act   of\n     judicial   redrafting.   Dignity   cannot   exist\n     without   privacy.   Both   reside   within   the\n     inalienable   values   of   life,   liberty   and\n     freedom   which   the   Constitution   has\n     recognised.   Privacy   is   the   ultimate\n     expression of the sanctity of the individual.\n     It is a constitutional value which straddles\n     across the spectrum of fundamental rights and\n     protects for the individual a zone of choice\n     and self­determination.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1793\">28.

postulates   the   reservation   of   a\n    private space for the individual, described as\n    the   right   to   be   let   alone.   The   concept   is\n    founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\n    ability of an individual to make choices lies\n    at   the   core   of   the   human   personality.   The\n    notion   of   privacy   enables   the   individual   to\n    assert and control the human element which is\n    inseparable   from   the   personality   of   the\n    individual. The inviolable nature of the human\n    personality   is   manifested   in   the   ability   to\n    make   decisions   on   matters   intimate   to   human\n    life.   The   autonomy   of   the   individual   is\n    associated   over   matters   which   can   be   kept\n    private.   These   are   concerns   over   which   there\n    is   a   legitimate   expectation   of   privacy.   The\n    body and the mind are inseparable elements of\n    the   human   personality.   The   integrity   of   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1452\">\f                                                           92</span>\n\nbody and the sanctity of the mind can exist on\nthe foundation that each individual possesses\nan inalienable ability and right to preserve a\nprivate   space   in   which   the   human   personality\ncan   develop.   Without   the   ability   to   make\nchoices, the inviolability of the personality\nwould   be in   doubt.   Recognising   a   zone   of\nprivacy   is   but   an   acknowledgment   that   each\nindividual   must   be   entitled   to   chart   and\npursue   the   course   of   development   of\npersonality.   Hence   privacy   is   a   postulate   of\nhuman dignity itself....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1913\">298.  Privacy   of   the   individual   is   an\nessential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both\nan   intrinsic   and   instrumental   value.   As   an\nintrinsic   value,   human   dignity   is   an\nentitlement   or   a   constitutionally   protected\ninterest   in   itself.   In   its   instrumental\nfacet,   dignity   and   freedom   are   inseparably\nintertwined,   each   being   a   facilitative   tool\nto   achieve   the   other.   The   ability   of   the\nindividual   to   protect   a   zone   of   privacy\nenables the realisation of the full value of\nlife   and   liberty.   Liberty   has   a   broader\nmeaning   of   which   privacy   is   a   subset.   All\nliberties   may   not   be   exercised   in   privacy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1952\">Yet   others   can   be   fulfilled   only   within   a\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual\nto retain the autonomy of the body and mind.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1953\">The autonomy of the individual is the ability\nto make decisions on vital matters of concern\nto   life.   Privacy  has   not  been  couched  as   an\nindependent  fundamental  right.   But   that  does\nnot   detract   from   the   constitutional\nprotection   afforded   to   it,   once   the   true\nnature   of   privacy   and   its   relationship   with\nthose   fundamental   rights   which   are   expressly\nprotected   is   understood.   Privacy   lies   across\nthe   spectrum   of   protected   freedoms.   The\nguarantee of equality is a guarantee against\narbitrary State action. It prevents the State\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1453\">\f

mind   is   violative   of   the   guarantee   against\n     arbitrary   State   action.   Privacy   of   the   body\n     entitles   an   individual   to   the   integrity   of\n     the   physical   aspects   of   personhood.   The\n     intersection   between   one’s   mental   integrity\n     and   privacy   entitles   the   individual   to\n     freedom of thought, the freedom to believe in\n         what   is   right,   and   the   freedom   of   self­\n     determination.   When   these   guarantees\n     intersect with gender, they create a private\n     space which protects all those elements which\n     are   crucial   to   gender   identity.   The   family,\n     marriage,   procreation   and   sexual   orientation\n     are   all   integral   to   the   dignity   of   the\n     individual.   Above   all,   the   privacy   of   the\n     individual   recognises   an   inviolable  right   to\n     determine how freedom shall be exercised.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1954\">110.   This Court has further held that like the right\n\nto   life   and   liberty,   privacy   is   not   absolute.     Any\n\ncurtailment or deprivation of that right would have to\n\ntake   place   under   a   regime   of   law.   In   paragraph   313\n\nfollowing has been held:\n</p>\n<blockquote

just\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the\nprocedural   and   content­based   mandate   of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2712\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement that there\nmust   be   a   law   in   existence   to   justify   an\nencroachment   on   privacy   is   an   express\nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2713\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can\nbe   deprived   of   his   life   or   personal   liberty\nexcept   in   accordance   with   the   procedure\nestablished   by   law.   The   existence   of   law   is\nan   essential   requirement.   Second,   the\nrequirement   of   a   need,   in   terms   of   a\nlegitimate state aim, ensures that the nature\nand   content   of   the   law   which   imposes   the\nrestriction   falls   within

At   this   juncture,   we   may   also   notice   one\n\nsubmission raised by the petitioners that Aadhaar Act\n\ncould have devised a less intrusive measure/means.  It\n\nwas   suggested   that

    We   have   to   examine   the   Aadhaar   Act   as   it\n\nexists. It is not the Court&#x27;s arena to enter into the\n\nissue as to debate on any alternative mechanism, which\n\naccording   to   the   petitioners   would   have   been   better.\n\nFraming a legislative policy and providing a mechanism\n\nfor   implementing   the   legislative   policy   is

persuaded.  It   is  important  to\n     recall   that   the   question   of   whether   the\n     Parliament   could   have   used   a   less   intrusive\n     measure   does   not   involve   the

First,   the   requirement   to   provide\n     fingerprints   for   an   identity   card   does   not\n     give rise to any inference of criminality as\n     it   is   a   requirement   imposed   on   all   adult\n     citizens.   It   is   true   that,   if   circumstances\n     arose in which a police officer was empowered\n     to   require   the   appellant   to   produce   his\n     identity   card   and   the   government   had   issued\n     card   readers,   the   authorities   would   have\n     access to his fingerprint minutiae which they\n     could use for the purposes of identification\n     in   a   criminal   investigation.   But   that   does\n     not   alter   the   presumption   of   innocence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\"

State   must\n    nevertheless   put   into   place   a   robust   regime\n    that   ensures   the   fulfilment   of   a   threefold\n    requirement.   These   three   requirements   apply\n    to   all   restraints   on   privacy   (not   just\n    informational privacy). They emanate from the\n    procedural   and   content­based   mandate   of\n    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\"

legitimate State aim, ensures that the nature\n    and   content   of   the   law   which   imposes   the\n    restriction   falls   within   the   zone   of\n    reasonableness   mandated  by   <a

  Second\n\nAmendment Rules carry on the object of 2002, Act. The\n\nverification of bank account by way of Aadhaar is done\n\nfor the reason that often bank accounts are opened in\n\neither   fictitious   names   or   in   the   name   of   wrong\n\npersons on the basis of forged identity documents and\n\nfinancial   crimes   are   committed.   It   is   seen   that\n\naccommodation entries are mostly provided through the\n\nbanking   channels   by   bogus   companies   to   convert   black\n\nmoney   into   white.   Benami   transactions   routinely   take\n\nplace through banking channels. All of the above, can\n\nto a large extent be checked by verifying Aadhaar with\n\nbank   accounts   to   ensure   that   the   account   belongs   to\n\nthe   person   who   claims   to   be   the   account   holder   and\n\nthat   he   or   she   is   a   genuine   person.   Verification

  by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1734\">\f                                                                   315</span>\n\nAadhaar   mechanism   and   those   who   are   already   holding\n\naccount   in   the   reporting   entity   they   are   required   to\n\nsubmit   the   Aadhaar   number   or   proof   of   their   applied\n\nAadhaar   identity.   When   a   statute   puts   obligation   on\n\naccount   holder   to   get   identity   verification   in   a\n\nparticular manner a person chose not to obtain Aadhaar\n\nnumber   cannot   complain   his   dis­entitlement

the Government of India Act which says that a\n      Bill   or   amendment   providing   for   imposing   or\n      increasing   a   tax   or   borrowing   money,   etc.\n      shall   not   be

 No. 494 of\n\n2012.  The said argument was considered and in Para 99\n\nit was held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2262\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"94788795\" id=\"span_1861\">“99.  Main   emphasis,   however,   is   on   the   plea\n    that   Parliament   or   any   State   Legislature\n    cannot   pass   a   law   that   overrules   a   judgment\n    thereby   nullifying   <a href=\"/doc/94788795/\" id=\"a_3415\">the   said   decision</a>,   that\n    too   without   removing   the   basis   of   the\n    decision.   This   argument   appears   to   be\n    attractive inasmuch as few orders are passed\n    by this Court in pending writ petitions which\n    are   to   the   effect   that   the   enrolment   of\n    Aadhaar would be voluntary. However, it needs\n    to be kept in mind that the orders have been\n    passed in the petitions where Aadhaar Scheme\n    floated   as   an   executive/administrative\n    measure has been challenged. In those cases,\n    the   said   orders   are   not   passed   in   a   case\n    where   the   Court   was   dealing   with   a   statute\n    passed   by   Parliament.   Further,   these   are\n    interim   orders   as   the   Court   was   of   the\n    opinion   that   till   the   matter   is   decided\n    finally   in   the   context   of   right   to   privacy\n    issue, the implementation of the said Aadhaar\n    Scheme   would   remain   voluntary.   In   fact,   the\n    main issue as to whether Aadhaar card scheme\n    whereby   biometric   data   of   an   individual   is\n    collected   violates   right   to   privacy   and,\n    therefore, is offensive of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3416\">Article 21</a> of the\n    Constitution or not is yet to be decided. In\n    the   process,   the   Constitution   Bench   is   also\n    called upon to decide as to whether right to\n    privacy   is   a   part   of   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3417\">Article   21</a>   of   the\n    Constitution   at   all.   Therefore,   no   final\n    decision has been taken. In a situation like\n<span class=\"hidden_text\"

precluded from or it is rendered incompetent\n     to pass such a law. That apart, the argument\n     of the petitioners is that the basis on which\n     the   aforesaid   orders   are   passed   has   to   be\n     removed, which is not done. According to the\n     petitioners, it could be done only by making\n     the   Aadhaar   Act   compulsory.   It   is   difficult\n     to   accept   this   contention   for   two   reasons:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2263\">     first,   when   the   orders   passed   by   this   Court\n     which are relied upon by the petitioners were\n     passed   when   the   Aadhaar   Act   was not   even\n     enacted.   Secondly,   as   already   discussed   in\n     detail   above, the   Aadhaar   Act   and   the   law\n     contained in <a href=\"/doc/43144358/\" id=\"a_3418\">Section 139</a>­AA of the Income Tax\n     Act   deal   with   two   different   situations   and\n
