Shorn of unnecessary details, facts in brief germane are as\n\nfollows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      The petitioner, a doctor by profession, having taken voluntary\n\nretirement from service now runs a hospital in the name and style\n\nof &quot;Prashanthi Hospital&quot; at Laxmisha Nagara, Chikkamagaluru. The\n\nincident that triggers registration of crime is that on 17-12-2022\n\nbetween 13:00 to 14:00 hours, the 2nd respondent/victim comes to\n\nthe hospital owned by the petitioner, seeking treatment. The victim\n\nis said to have entered the hospital with severe bleeding with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                4</span>\n\n\n\ndecreased vitals and her condition was very serious due to such\n\nheavy bleeding. The companions along with the victim informed the\n\npetitioner that she had taken some tablets for abortion 2 to 3 days\n\nback and that has caused severe bleeding. The persons who\n\naccompanied the victim claimed to be her parents.        It is the\n\naverment of the petitioner in the petition that considering the\n\ncondition, the patient was immediately admitted to the hospital and\n\nwas put on oxygen, IV fluids etc. The conservative treatment\n\nimproved the vitals of the victim. She was still unstable and there\n\nwas no danger to her life. The petitioner is said to have performed\n\nmedical termination of pregnancy which was incomplete, leaving\n\nthe   placenta   behind. On   the   victim being unstable, further\n\nexamination was conducted and it was noticed that the bleeding\n\nwas also seen from outside and, therefore appropriate procedure\n\nwas performed to retain the placenta as further expulsion would\n\nhave created danger to the life of the victim.     After the victim\n\nbecame stable, which is after about 2 days of such admission, the\n\nvictim was discharged in the morning hours and was taken by the\n\npeople, said to be her relatives. After about one month of the said\n\nincident, the crime comes to be registered in Crime No.1 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   5</span>\n\n\n\nbefore the Belthangadi Police Station for the aforesaid offences.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The petitioner was not arrayed as accused at that point in time.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      3. Investigation is conducted by the jurisdictional Police and\n\nthe result of such investigation was issuance of a notice to the\n\npetitioner on 17-02-2023, two months after the aforesaid incident.\n\nThe allegation against the petitioner was that he has performed the\n\nact of medical termination of pregnancy on the victim who was then\n\n12 years and 11 months old and had been subjected to sexual\n\nactivity.   The offence against the petitioner, in particular was the\n\none punishable under <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 21</a> of the Act.          After issuance of\n\nnotice and recording of statement of the petitioner a charge sheet\n\ncomes to be filed on 26-02-2023 for the aforesaid offences against\n\nother accused and against the petitioner/accused No.8 for the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 21</a> of the Act. Filing of the charge sheet is\n\nwhat drives the petitioner to this Court in the subject petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      4. Heard Sri P.P.Hegde, learned senior counsel appearing for\n\nthe   petitioner   and   Sri   Mahesh   Shetty,   learned   High    Court\n\nGovernment Pleader appearing for respondent No.1.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       6</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">      5. The learned senior counsel would contend with vehemence\n\nthat the petitioner is a reputed doctor and had no intention to do\n\nanything that is alleged. Being a doctor, it was his bounden duty to\n\ntreat the patient who came with severe bleeding. The victim was\n\naccompanied       by    three    or   four   people,   who    had   introduced\n\nthemselves, as parents and husband of the victim and the age of\n\nthe victim was given as 18 years and 3 months.                       It is the\n\nsubmission of the learned senior counsel that physical appearance\n\nof the victim was such that, it could be believed that she was more\n\nthan 18 years old and, therefore, without going into further details\n\nthe   petitioner       performed      the    surgery    and   protected     the\n\npatient/victim.    It is his case that he had no knowledge of the\n\nvictim, being less than 18 years old, and he should not be penalized\n\nby forcing him to undergo trial, in which eventually he would get\n\nacquitted.   He    would        therefore,    seek     quashment    of    entire\n\nproceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">      6. Per-contra, the learned High Court Government Pleader\n\nwould refute the submissions to contend that the petitioner being a\n\ndoctor of sufficient standing, ought to have taken note of the fact\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   7</span>\n\n\n\nthat the victim was of a tender age and therefore all the\n\nsubmissions are a matter of trial for the petitioner to come out\n\nclean.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">         7. I have given my anxious consideration to the aforesaid\n\nsubmissions of the learned senior counsel and the learned High\n\nCourt Government Pleader and have perused the available material\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">         8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The petitioner,\n\ndoctor by profession - Gynaecologist, claims to have worked as\n\nTaluk Health Officer in Chikkamagalur Taluk for almost 20 years\n\nand starts his own hospital in the name and style of &quot;Prashanthi\n\nHospital&quot; after taking voluntary retirement from Government\n\nservice. It is his claim that he has put in 35 years of practice as a\n\nGynaecologist and still continues to practice the said discipline in his\n\nprofession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">         9. On 17-12-2022 the 2nd respondent/victim who was 12\n\nyears and 11 months old, as on the date on which she enters the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                8</span>\n\n\n\nhospital of the petitioner and was allegedly studying in the 7th\n\nstandard at the Taluk Higher Primary School, Belthangady is\n\nsubjected to physical relationship/sexual activity by accused No.1\n\nand on continuing the said act she becomes pregnant.            Accused\n\nNo.1 administers certain tablets to the child to get the pregnancy\n\naborted.   The tablets appear to have harmed, resulting in severe\n\nbleeding to the victim. It is the narration in the petition that the\n\nvictim when appeared before the petitioner, she was wearing a\n\nsaree and mangala sutra. She was accompanied by accused No.1, 2\n\nand other relatives. While filling up the application regarding the\n\ninformation of the patient it is recorded that the patient was 18\n\nyears and 3 months and wife of one Sudhir, C/o Vinoda. She was\n\nadmitted as an inpatient on 17-12-2022.

The defence of the petitioner is that he had no knowledge\n\nthat the victim was only 12 years and 11 months.                    I decline to\n\naccept the said defence. The petitioner claims to be Gynaecologist\n\nhaving 35 years of practice.              It is highly improbable that the\n\npetitioner at the very look of the patient did not get to know that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                   17</span>\n\n\n\nthe victim was of tender age of 12 years and 11 months and had\n\nbeen subjected to sexual intercourse as she had become pregnant.\n\nMere statement or wearing a saree at the time the victim entered\n\nthe hospital are all a matter of evidence and trial, which this Court\n\nat this stage in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 482</a> of the\n\nCrPC would not consider.

Though the offence under <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 21</a> of the Act attracts\n\nimprisonment for six months, the offence by the very nature is\n\nserious. Merely because it is six months, it cannot be said that the\n\npetitioner should be left off the hook at this stage.        Being a\n\nresponsible doctor having close two score years of service as a\n\nGynaecologist, who ought to have been cautious and informed the\n\nconcerned, as obtaining under <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 19</a> of the Act.

But, the fact is\n\nthat, the victims who are subjected to such assault, by the accused,\n\nexcept in justifiable cases, get away by lack of reporting.\n\nTherefore, non-reporting snowballs into a serious offence.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123985596\" id=\"span_18\">14.

Failure to report, as\n          mandated by <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 19</a>, is a punishable offence under\n          <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 21</a> of the POCSO Act. Neither the POCSO Act nor\n          the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Rules\n          2012 prescribe a template or a format for the report\n          mandated under <a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 19(1)</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">1</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">    2022 SCC OnLine SC 1321\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                            19</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      83. When a minor approaches an RMP for a medical\ntermination of pregnancy arising out of a consensual\nsexual activity, an RMP is obliged under <a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 19(1)</a> of\nthe POCSO Act to provide information pertaining to the\noffence committed, to the concerned authorities. An\nadolescent and her guardian may be wary of the\nmandatory reporting requirement as they may not want\nto entangle themselves with the legal process. Minors\nand their guardians are likely faced with two options -\none, approach an RMP and possibly be involved in\ncriminal proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_45\">POCSO Act</a>, or two,\napproach an unqualified doctor for a medical termination\nof the pregnancy. If there is an insistence on the\ndisclosure of the name of the minor in the report under\n<a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 19(1)</a> of POCSO, minors may be less likely to seek\nout RMPs for safe termination of their pregnancies under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_47\">MTP Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       84. To ensure that the benefit of Rule 3B(b) is\nextended to all women under 18 years of age who engage\nin consensual sexual activity, it is necessary to\nharmoniously read both the POCSO Act and the MTP Act.\nFor the limited purposes of providing medical termination\nof pregnancy in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_48\">MTP Act</a>, we clarify that the\nRMP, only on request of the minor and the guardian of\nthe minor, need not disclose the identity and other\npersonal details of the minor in the information provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 19(1)</a> of the POCSO Act.

Such an\ninterpretation would prevent any conflict between the statutory\nobligation of the RMP to mandatorily report the offence under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_53\">POCSO Act</a> and the rights of privacy and reproductive\nautonomy of the minor under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

It further observes that when a minor approaches a\n\nRegistered             Medical   Practitioner   for   medical   termination   of\n\npregnancy arising out of consensual sexual activity, the RMP is\n\nobliged under <a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Act to provide information\n\npertaining to the offence committed to the concerned authorities.\n\nAn adolescent and her guardian may be wary of the mandatory\n\nrequirement of reporting, as they may not want to entangle\n\nthemselves in a legal web.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"25258779\" id=\"span_22\">Later to the aforesaid judgment, the Apex Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/25258779/\" id=\"a_59\">STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER v.

To achieve the avowed purpose, a legal obligation\n     for reporting of offence under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_62\">POCSO Act</a> is cast upon on\n     a person to inform the relevant authorities specified\n     thereunder when he/she has knowledge that an offence\n     under the Act had been committed. Such obligation is also\n     bestowed on person who has apprehension that an offence\n     under this Act is likely to be committed. Besides casting\n     such a legal obligation under <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 19</a>, the legislature\n     thought it expedient to make failure to discharge the\n     obligation thereunder as punishable, under <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 21</a>\n     thereof. True that under <a href=\"/doc/150033914/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 21(1)</a>, failure to report the\n     commission of an offence under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_66\">Section\n     19</a> or <a href=\"/doc/68555635/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 20</a> or failure to report such offence under sub-\n     section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 19</a> has been made punishable with\n     imprisonment of either description which may extend to six\n     months or with fine or with both. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/3699126/\" id=\"a_69\">Section\n     21</a> provides that any person who being in-charge of any\n     company or an institution (by whatever name called) who\n     fails to report the commission of an offence under sub-\n     section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 19</a> in respect of a subordinate under\n     his control, shall be punishable with imprisonment with a\n     term which may extend to one year or with fine. Certainly,\n     such provisions are included in with a view to ensure strict\n     compliance of the provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_71\">POCSO Act</a> and\n     thereby to ensure that the tender age of children is not\n     being abused and their childhood and youth is protected\n     against exploitation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"25258779\" id=\"span_25\">13.

In this\ncontext, it is also relevant to note that the United Nations\nConvention on Rights of Children, which was ratified by India on\n11-12-1992, requires the State parties to undertake all appropriate\nnational, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the\ninducement or coercion of child to engage in any unlawful sexual\nactivity, the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 23</span>\n\n\n\n     unlawful sexual practices, etc. <a href=\"/doc/416232/\" id=\"a_78\">Articles 3(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_79\">34</a> of the\n     Convention have placed a specific duty on the State to protect the\n     child from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">           16. Prompt and proper reporting of the commission of\n     offence under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_80\">POCSO Act</a> is of utmost importance and we\n     have no hesitation to state that its failure on coming to\n     know about the commission of any offence thereunder\n     would defeat the very purpose and object of the Act. We say\n     so taking into account the various provisions thereunder.\n     Medical examination of the victim as also the accused would\n     give many important clues in a case that falls under\n     the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_81\">POCSO Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/60901823/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 27(1)</a> of the POCSO Act provides that\n     medical examination of a child in respect of whom any\n     offence has been committed under the said Act, shall,\n     notwithstanding that a first information report or complaint\n     has not been registered for the offence under the Act, be\n     conducted in accordance with Section 164-ACrPC, which\n     provides the procedures for medical examination of the\n     victim of rape.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">           ...                ...                ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79577238\" id=\"span_30\">30. True that the FIR and the charge-sheet still remain in\n     fact in respect of the other accused. But then, non-reporting of\n     sexual assault against a minor child despite knowledge is a serious\n     crime and more often than not, it is an attempt to shield the\n     offenders of the crime of sexual assault. Be that as it may in view\n     of the decision in Shankar Kisanrao Khade case [<a href=\"/doc/79577238/\" id=\"a_83\">Shankar Kisanrao\n     Khade v.

In this context, it is also\n     relevant to refer to an observation made by this Court in the said\n     case that this Court under parens patriae jurisdiction has a duty to\n     give directions for compliance of the provisions under\n     the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_86\">POCSO Act</a>.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">                                           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThe Apex Court was considering a case of non-reporting by a doctor\n\nand directed strict compliance of <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 19</a> of the Act.

Therefore, responsibility to report is cast\n\non all stake holders.   Wherefore, it is necessary for the State to\n\ndirect strict compliance with <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 19</a> and reporting of offences\n\nparticularly by doctors who indulge in medical termination of\n\npregnancy of minors in extenuating circumstances.
