The Petitioner-proprietor of M/s Shrimati Gems and Jewels has filed the\npresent writ petition impugning the search and seizure action carried out\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act (hereinafter „the Act‟) including\nthe order whereby his stock-in-trade (jewellery) was seized.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2. The facts in brief, as set out in the petition are that the Petitioner - is in the\nbusiness of trading in jewellery since 2010. He travelled from Delhi to\nGuwahati to attend a jewellery exhibition which was held from 07.09.2018\nto 09.09.2018. On his return, he was stopped by Respondent No. 2 at Indira\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">    W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                    Page 1 of 28</span>\n Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi and a search was conducted on\nhim. The jewellery found in his possession was valued by the Revenue\nthrough a Registered Government Valuer at Rs. 1,58,62,924/- and the same\nwas seized and panchnama dated 11.09.2018 was drawn in this behalf.\nSubsequently, Assistant Director of Income Tax (INV)-2 issued summons to\nthe Petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 131(1A)</a> of the Act, dated 10.09.2018 and\n11.09.2018, calling upon him to furnish details regarding the seized\njewellery. Later, on 13.09.2018, another summon was issued calling upon\nhim to give certain information and documents. In response to the above\nsummons, Petitioner filed a reply dated 17.09.2018, submitting details as\nrequired by ADIT, Investigation (AIU). He also made a request for the\nrelease of the jewellery, asserting that the same was his stock- in- trade and\nthe seizure has resulted in hampering his business. This was followed by a\nreminder dated 17.09.2018, submitted with the department on 20.09.2018.\nOn 09.10.2018, a similar request was made to the Pr.CIT-18 calling his\nattention to the fact that one month had expired since the seizure of stock-in-\ntrade. Petitioner protested against the seizure, pleaded for immediate release\nof the seized stock-in-trade as he had been deprived of his source of\nlivelihood.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">3. At a later date, when Petitioner made further requests to the Tax Officers,\nhe was informed that all the documents furnished by him had been submitted\nto the Investigation Officer of AIU Wing, who would examine the same and\nfurnish a report to the Assessing Officer, whereafter the stock-in-trade would\nbe released.     However, such representations did not have the desired\noutcome and the Petitioner continued to make representations to other Tax\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 2 of 28</span>\n Officers. On 18.10.2018, ACIT asked further information which was duly\nfurnished vide letter dated 27.12.2018. Since then, there has been no\nresponse from the Income Tax Department, constraining the Petitioner to file\nthe present writ petition, impugning the action of search, inter alia, on the\nground that it is contrary to the mandate of the Act as the pre-conditions laid\ndown in Clauses (a) to (c) of <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 132 (1)</a> have not been fulfilled.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has contended that to initiate a valid\nsearch, it is mandatory for the Respondents to form &quot;reason to believe&quot; and\none of the three conditions enumerated in Clauses (a) to (c) of <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 132\n(1)</a> of the Act must be satisfied to enable the authority to issue a valid search\nwarrant. Since, the Petitioner was in the possession of jewellery, the only\nClause, if any, that can be attracted is clause „(c)‟. In any event, the said\nClause is also not applicable since the Petitioner is carrying on the business\nof sale and purchase of jewellery, and he was legitimately carrying the same\nas his stock-in-trade, from Delhi to Guwahati for an exhibition. In such a\nsituation, no circumstance existed justifying the initiation of the action of\nsearch. Furthermore, evidence of participation in the exhibition at Guwahati\nis based on documents that had been furnished to the authorities. It\nconclusively establishes that the jewellery seized is Petitioner‟s stock-in-\ntrade. This is also corroborated by the books of account and the supporting\nvouchers, which were produced before the concerned authorities. Despite\njustifying the lawful possession of the jewellery, the unlawful seizure\ncontinues.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5. He further argued that once the Petitioner was able to demonstrate that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                   Page 3 of 28</span>\n jewellery in question was his stock-in-trade, the continuation of seizure is\nagainst the law viz. the proviso to Clause (iii) of <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 132 (1)</a> of the Act\nand the 3rd proviso to <a href=\"/doc/197782846/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 132(1)(v)</a> of the Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"22730295\" id=\"span_4\">In support of his\nsubmissions, learned Counsel for the Petitioner relied upon the decision of\n<a href=\"/doc/22730295/\" id=\"a_7\">Puspa Ranajan Sahoo vs Assistant Director of Income Tax (INV</a>), [2012]\n210 Taxman 217 (Orissa)(MAG).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">6. Ms. Vibhooti Malhotra, learned senior standing counsel for the Revenue,\nassisted by Mr. Shailendra Singh, on the other hand, opposed the petition by\narguing that the Investigation Wing of the Income Tax Department was in\npossession of credible information, on the basis whereof the AO formulated\n„reason to believe‟ that the Petitioner was in possession of jewellery,\nrepresenting its undisclosed income and, therefore, the search was a valid\nexercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/875752/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 132 (1)(c)</a> of the Act. It was further\nsubmitted that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/5385/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 132 (1)(b)(iii)</a>, Respondent No.2 was\ncompetent to seize the jewellery found as a consequence of search.\nPetitioner has erroneously sought to take refuge under the proviso to the said\nprovision which prohibits seizure of stock-in-trade of the business. He was\nafforded adequate opportunity to present evidence so as to demonstrate that\nthe jewellery found was part of his regular stock-in-trade, but he failed to do\nso. Respondent No.2 had conducted an on spot verification of Petitioner‟s\nbusiness premises wherein he had failed to produce the stock register and the\ndelivery challans. In fact, during the course of recording his statement under\n<a href=\"/doc/1006941/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 132(4)</a> of the Act, a specific query was raised seeking Petitioner‟s\nexplanation for non-availability of the stock register and the delivery\nchallans. The query remained unresolved, as the Petitioner cited his inability\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 4 of 28</span>\n to provide the said details. In absence of any material forthcoming from the\nPetitioner to suggest that the jewellery seized was indeed his stock-in-trade,\nthe benefit of the proviso relied upon cannot be availed by him. Petitioner\nhad the onus to produce adequate material so as to make evident that the\nitems seized were part of his regular stock-in-trade, and since he failed to do\nthe same, the seizure is valid and justified.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">7. Ms. Vibhooti Malhotra also referred to <a href=\"/doc/1230088/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 132B</a> of the Act to argue\nthat the said provision unequivocally provides that the items seized during\nthe course of search would be applied towards any pre-existing demand or\nliability determined as a consequence of post-search assessment. The said\nprovision provides for release of seized goods on satisfaction of two\nconditions, namely; (a) nature and source of acquisition has to be explained\nto the satisfaction of the AO, and; (b) the amount of existing liability may be\nrecovered from the seized item, and the remaining, if any, may be released.\nShe also argued that since, despite several opportunities, Petitioner failed to\nprove the nature and source of the seized jewellery, the release of the seized\narticles was not permitted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8. Ms. Malhotra next argued that AIU (Inv.), New Delhi acted on specific\ninformation in respect of Petitioner, gathered from the office of AIU,\nGuwahati. The statement of the Petitioner was recorded on oath under\n<a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 131(1A)</a> of the Act and the search and seizure action was well\nwithin the jurisdiction of competent authority conducting the proceedings,\nemanating from the statement recorded on oath under <a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 131 (1A)</a> of\nthe Act and by virtue of the incriminating documents found during the spot\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 5 of 28</span>\n verification conducted on Petitioner‟s business premises.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced\nby the learned counsels for the parties and have carefully evaluated the facts\nof the case and also the material placed on record. There cannot be any\ndispute that the Petitioner is in the business of sale and purchase of jewellery\nand is being assessed regularly for income tax. In support of this contention,\nthe returns of income from AY 2015-16 to AY 2018-19 have been filed\nalong with the petition. In the backdrop of the facts noted above, we have to\nexamine the validity of the search and seizure action by the Respondents\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 132</a> of the Act. At the outset, it would thus be apposite to refer\nto <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 132</a> of the Act, to the extent the same is relevant for the purpose\nof deciding the present petition.

The\nendeavour was to verify Petitioner‟s contention that each seized article had\nbeen accounted for and already included in the books. At the time of the\nhearing, Respondents also produced the satisfaction note for the perusal of\nthis Court, recording the reason, for authorizing the search. The original file\ncontaining the satisfaction note was tendered in a sealed cover. The same\nwas de-sealed and perused, and retained for perusal at the time of dictation\nof the order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">11. The satisfaction note is claimed to be privileged. We, however, do not\nfind anything confidential in the same, as virtually the entire content thereof\nhas been reproduced in the counter affidavit filed by the Respondents and,\ntherefore, we consider it appropriate to extract the facts alluded to in the\ncounter affidavit which forms the entire basis for authorizing the search.

On a plain reading of sub section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 132</a>, it emerges that for\ntaking action of search and seizure, the concerned authority must have\n„reason to believe‟ that any of the circumstances provided under Clauses (a)\nto (c) of sub section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 132</a> of the Act is fulfilled in consequence\nof information in his possession. In other words, it is an imperative and\nmandatory requirement of law that in order to authorize an action of search\nand seizure, at least one of the conditions precedent, as set out in the said\nprovision exist in fact, and such reasons have to be recorded in writing\nbefore authorization is issued to conduct search and seizure. The „reason to\nbelieve‟ as recorded should be on the basis of relevant materials which have\na bearing on formation of believe as search warrants cannot be issued for\nmaking a fishing and roving enquiry. Only if such conditions are fulfilled,\nthe action of authorization can be said to have been validly exercised.

On the basis of this information, Shri Khem\nChand Mukim was intercepted on 10.09.2018 and he admitted to be in\npossession of jewellery. He clarified that he was the proprietor of M/s\nShrimati Gems &amp; Jewels and had travelled on 06.09.2018 from Delhi to\nGuwahati for participating in an exhibition with the jewellery. Since copy of\nstock register was not submitted at that time, spot inquiry was conducted and\nsummons were issued to collect the copy of the stock register from M/s\nShrimati Gems &amp; Jewels. Shri. Vidit Jain was found at the showroom of\nM/s Shrimati Gems &amp; Jewels, but since he failed to produce any\ndocumentary evidence in support of the jewellery found in the\npossession of Shri Khem Chand Mukim, the ADIT (INV),(AIU, New\nDelhi) formulated the reason to believe, noting that Shri Khem Chand\nMukim was in possession of jewellery which is not related to M/s\nShrimati Gems &amp; Jewels and which is not disclosed and would not be\ndisclosed for the purpose of the Act and accordingly, invoked the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                Page 14 of 28</span>\n provision of <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 132 (1)</a> of the Act and sought warrants of\nauthorization.

The opinion which has\n      to be formed is subjective and, Therefore, the jurisdiction of the\n      Court to interfere is very limited. A Court will not act as an\n      Appellate Authority and examine, meticulously, the information\n      in order to decide, for itself, whether an action under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 132</a>\n      is called for.

The said sub-clause pertains only to\n     moveable and not Immovable assets. Secondly it pertains to those\n     assets which wholly or partly represent what should have been\n     income. The expression &quot;which has not been or would not be,\n     disclosed for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_40\">Income Tax Act</a>&quot; would mean that\n     income which is liable to tax, but which the assessed his not\n     returned in his Income Tax return or made known to the\n     Income Tax Department. The sub Clause itself refers to this as\n     &quot;undisclosed income or property&quot;. In our opinion the words\n     &quot;undisclosed&quot;, in that context, must mean income which is\n     hidden from the Department. Clause (c) would refer to cases\n     where the assessed knows that the moveable asset is or\n     represents income which is taxable but which asset is not\n     disclosed to the Department for the purpose of taxation. Those\n     assets must be or represent hidden or secreted funds or assets.\n     Where, however, existence of the money or asset is known to\n     the Income Tax Department and where the case of the assessed\n     is that the said money or the valuable asset is not liable to be\n     taxed, then, in our opinion, the provisions of sub-Clause (c) of\n     <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 132(1)</a> would not be attracted. An assessed is under no\n     obligation to disclose in his return of income all the moneys\n     which are received by him which do not partake of the character\n     of income or income liable to tax. If an assessed receives,\n     admittedly, a gift from a relation or earns agricultural income\n     which is not subject to tax, then he would not be liable to show\n     the receipt of that money in his Income Tax return. Non-\n     disclosure of the same would not attract the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n     132(c)</a>. It may be that the opinion of the assessed that the receipt\n     of such amount is not taxable, may be incorrect and, in law, the\n     same may be taxable but where, the Department is aware of the\n     existence of such an asset or the receipt of such an Income by the\n     assessed then the Department may be fully Justified in issuing a\n     notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 148</a> of the Act, but no action can be taken\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                 Page 16 of 28</span>\n       under <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 132(1)(C)</a>. Authorisation under <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 132(1)</a>\n      can be issued if there is a reasonable belief that the assessed\n      does not want the Income Tax Department to know about the\n      existence of such Income or asset in an effort to escape,\n      assessment. <a href=\"/doc/875752/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 132(1)(c)</a> has been incorporated in order to\n      enable the Department to take physical possession of those\n      moveable properties or articles which are or represent\n      undisclosed income or property. The words &quot;undisclosed\n      income&quot; must mean income which is liable to be taxed under\n      the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_47\">Income Tax Act</a> but which has not been\n      disclosed by an assessed in an effort to escape assessment. Not\n      disclosed must mean the intention of the assessed to hide the\n      existence of the income or the asset from the Income Tax\n      Department while being aware that the same is rightly taxable.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                                                    [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">17. One of the questions that arises for our consideration is whether in the\npresent case, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/875752/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 132(1)(c)</a> the Act were satisfied, or\nnot, before authorizing the search. On a perusal of the satisfaction note as\nwell as the counter affidavit on behalf of Respondent Nos. 3 and 4, it is\nevident that the sole ground for the action of search and seizure is that the\nInvestigation Wing of the Income Tax department was in possession of\ncredible information that Petitioner was in possession of jewellery which\nrepresents his undisclosed income or property. Apart from mere\nreproduction of the said words, no cogent basis for arriving at this\nconclusion is discernible from the satisfaction note. There is plethora of case\nlaw holding that the term &quot;reason to believe&quot; cannot be interpreted and\nconstrued as &quot;reason to suspect&quot;. The reason to suspect that the Petitioner\nhas undisclosed assets, and that there is likelihood that the same would not\nbe disclosed, does not amount to saying that there are reasons to believe that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 17 of 28</span>\n the Petitioner is in possession of undisclosed assets, and intends to evade\ntax. This is the fundamental flaw in the action initiated by the Respondent\nNo. 2and we have no hesitation to say that the entire exercise is vitiated and\nunlawful.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">18. The facts as they have transpired, show that the search party comprising\nADIT (INV), AIU and ITO (INV), (AIU), has executed the warrant to search\nat Terminal-1 (T-1) of Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. The\nwarrant of authorization is dated 11.09.2018 - issued under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 132</a> of\nthe Act. This was issued pursuant to the satisfaction note recorded on\n11.09.2018. The search commenced on 11.09.2018 at 08:40 p.m. and closed\non the same day at 10:20 p.m. The panchnama was also drawn on\n11.09.2018. At the same time, it is critical to note that the Petitioner was,\nadmittedly, intercepted on 10.09.2018. The government registered valuer for\njewellery, prepared the inventory and valued the same. The valuation note is\nalso dated 10.09.2018, and was served on the Petitioner on 11.09.2018 at\n02:00 A.M, prior to the commencement of search. The Assistant Director of\nIncome Tax also affixed his signatures on the same on 11.09.2018. The\nAssistant Director of Income Tax (INV), Air Intelligence Unit (Respondent\nNo.4), issued a summon dated 10.09.2018 under <a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 131(1A)</a> of the Act\nfor the appearance of the Petitioner and served on him at 11.30P.M on\n10.09.2018. Thus, concededly the Petitioner was intercepted on 10.09.2018\nat night, and the proceedings apparently continued during the night up to\n2:00 a.m. on 11.09.2018. For the Respondents to have intercepted and\nconducted the search on the person of the Petitioner on 10.09.2018, the\nreasons to believe were required to be formed prior to the action of search\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                 Page 18 of 28</span>\n and seizure. However, the mandatory reasons to believe and the search\nauthorization were obtained subsequent to the action of search. The\nsatisfaction note is dated 11.09.2018, and its contents clearly disclose that\nthe formulation of &quot;reason to believe&quot; is post the search and seizure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">19. Interestingly, the reasons, inter alia, record that &quot;Acting upon the\ninformation, Sh. Khem Chand Mukim was intercepted on 10.09.2018 and\npreliminary enquiry was made inside the terminal.&quot; and &quot;Shri Khem\nChand Mukim is in possession of jewellery which is not related to M/s\nShrimati Gems &amp; Jewels and which is not disclosed and would not be\ndisclosed for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_51\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a>&quot;. This purported\nreasoning recorded in the note reinforces the fact that the same was prepared\nafter the search was carried out, and Shri Khem Chand Mukim was found to\nbe in possession of jewellery and it was assumed that the same is not related\nto M/s Shrimati Gems &amp; Jewels and is an undisclosed asset. This is plainly\nex-post facto formation and recording of reason to believe, subsequent to the\nact of intercepting and conducting search and seizure on the Petitioner at the\nAirport. Further when the Petitioner explained that he was participating in an\nexhibition with his jewellery, summons were issued to collect the copy of\nthe stock register from M/s Shrimati Gems &amp; Jewels and, concurrently, a\nwarrant of authorization was sought by invoking <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 132 (1)</a> of the Act\non the premise that Mr. Khem Chand Mukim was in possession of jewellery\nwhich did not relate to M/s Shrimati Gems &amp; Jewels. The mere possession\nof jewellery ipso facto cannot be sufficient for the officer to form a belief\nthat the same had not been, or would not be disclosed for the purpose of this\nAct. The satisfaction as required under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 132</a>, must be formed on the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 19 of 28</span>\n basis of material on record and on the objective assessment of such material.\nUnder no circumstances, on the basis of the information that is seemingly\nrelied upon by the officer, can a reasonable person come to a conclusion that\ningredients contained in Clause (c) of sub Section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 132</a> were\nmet.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">20. If the search action was indeed subsequent to interception, as the\nRevenue wants us to believe, even then we would say - it is evident that the\nofficer in question has completely misdirected himself and acted in an\narbitrary manner. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/41766669/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 132(1)(iii)</a> and 3rd proviso of\n<a href=\"/doc/197782846/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 132 (1) (v)</a> of the Act deals with bullion, jewellery or other valuable\narticle or things being stock-in-trade of business found as a result of search\nshall not be seized. The words in the statute are precise and unambiguous,\nand we are bound to uphold and expound these words in the natural and\nordinary sense. The officer was already aware that the jewellery found in\nthe Petitioner‟s possession was his stock-in-trade and, consequently, he was\nentitled to the protection provided in the proviso appearing after sub clause -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">(iii) to sub Section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 132</a> of the Act. The officer failed to take\nthis provision into consideration. Further, sub Section (v) of sub Section (1)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 132</a> of the Act, additionally provides that the officer is only\nrequired to inventorize money, bullion, jewellery or other valuable article or\nthing which is found during the course of search and seizure. This was also\nignored. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/41766669/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 132(1)(iii)</a> has been added with effect from\n01.06.2003 with the obvious intent that the stock-in-trade ought not be\nseized but, instead, should be inventorized so that the same can be used at\nthe time of assessment and for other follow up actions. Further, proviso\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 20 of 28</span>\n appearing after sub clause (v) of sub Section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 132</a> also provides\nthat where it is not possible or practical to take physical possession of any\nvaluable article or thing, and removal of it to a safe place is not possible or\npractical due to its volume, weight or other physical characteristics, the\nauthorizing officer may serve an order on owner, or the person who is in\nthe immediate possession or control thereof that he shall not remove it, part\nwith or otherwise deal with it, except with the previous permission of such\nauthorized officer, and such action of the authorized officer shall be deemed\nto be seizure of such valuable article or thing under clause (iii).

The crux of the matter is that the reasons were, firstly, not recorded\nbefore undertaking the search and was, therefore, completely unauthorized\nand a high-handed action on the part of the Respondents. The Respondents\ndo not state that jewellery was concealed, or was kept by the Petitioner\nsurreptitiously. Merely because the assessee was in possession of the same,\nit cannot be said that the same represents income or property which has not\nbeen disclosed or will not be disclosed. <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 132(1)</a> as noted above is a\nserious invasion on the privacy of the citizens, and has to be resorted to\nwhen there are pre-existing and pre-recorded good reasons to believe that\nthe action under <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_67\">section 132(1)</a> is called for. While revenue can argue that\nelement of surprise is critical and essential for a successful operation of\nsearch and seizure, nevertheless, it has be cognizant that to balance the\nrights of the citizens, legislature has built in sufficient safeguards. This is to\nensure that undue hardship and harassment should not be caused by the\narbitrary and unfounded action of the raiding party. Moreover, as discussed\nabove it is not imperative that every article found as a result of search has to\nbe seized. For this purpose, the provision itself restrains and curbs the\nauthority to make seizure of stock-in-trade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">22. We have no hesitation to observe that the officer in this case has\ncompletely ignored the mandate of law. It is also to be mentioned that\ndespite the unlawful action, the Petitioner has been denied release of the\njewellery, regardless of his repeatedly representations made to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                     Page 22 of 28</span>\n department.

The second proviso provides a deadline of 120\ndays from the date of authorization for search under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 132</a> or\nrequisition under <a href=\"/doc/1323942/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 132A</a>, as the case may be, was executed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">24. Further, the Manual of Office Procedure Volume -II Chapter 3\nAssessment Procedure (Search and Seizure) provides under clause 3(ii), also\nmandates the release of assets within 120 days, which is reproduced\nhereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">     &quot;3.

After the seizure, Petitioner has been endlessly writing to the\nRespondents for the release of the seized articles. He had furnished all the\nnecessary documents to explain as to how the articles seized are indeed his\nstock-in-trade. In fact, as noted in the preceding paragraphs, we had called\nupon the Respondents to give a specific response by way of an affidavit to\nthe chart giving details of books of account provisioning for the articles\nseized. In response thereto, the Respondents have no plausible explanation\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 25 of 28</span>\n and with the intent to deny the relief to the Petitioner, they have contended\nthat the purchase invoices of the Petitioner are of bulk goods and cannot be\nidentified with the individual seized items.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">26. Obviously, when the Petitioner - who is in the business of making\njewellery, would necessarily have certain items as purchases in bulk for the\npurpose of molding them into specific jewellery articles such as ear rings,\near tops, sets etc. Petitioner had placed material on record to substantiate the\nfact that jewellery found in his possession at the time of search was his\nstock-in-trade. Since the Respondents did not raise any serious dispute in\ntheir counter affidavit or in the additional affidavit, therefore, in view of the\nmandate contained in the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/611645/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 132B(1)(i)</a>, the Respondents\nhave no authority to retain the seized jewellery beyond the said period. The\nouter limit of 120 days as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1230088/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 132B</a> has also expired in\nthe month of January 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">27. Before parting we may add that the opinion which has to be formed is\nsubjective, and though the jurisdiction of the Court to interfere is very\nlimited, and we are not to act as an Appellate Court and meticulously\nexamine the information in order to decide whether an action under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n132</a> is called for, yet at the same time we may emphasize that the power to\nsearch a person is a stringent power provided by law and this requires the\nofficers to scrupulously follow the mandate and the rigor of the law prior to\nauthorizing such an action, and unless the conditions to exercise such power\nare shown to exist, we would have no hesitation in striking down such\nan action. We are compelled to interfere as there was complete lack of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                    Page 26 of 28</span>\n information prior to the action of search, exhibiting gross non application of\nmind and arbitrariness by the appropriate authorities. The reason to believe\nin the present case was nonexistent prior to the search. Even after the search,\nthere was no material to conclude that no such disclosure had been made, or\nthat no disclosure would be made so as to satisfy the prerequisites of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_88\">Section\n132</a> of the Act. The Respondents have merely acted on the basis of surmises\nand conjectures, and without due authorization. Their actions are in\ncontravention of law, making the action of search and seizure bad in law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">28.   We may also record that a very feeble attempt was made by the\nRespondents during the course of arguments to contend that there was no\nsearch or seizure at the Airport and, after preparing an inventory, the\njewellery articles were given back to the Petitioner and continued to remain\nin his possession. It was also argued that mere suspicion that the income is\nconcealed, or is likely to be concealed, is sufficient to trigger the exercise of\npower under <a href=\"/doc/837597/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 131 (1)</a> of the Act for making an enquiry or\ninvestigation relating thereto, and that the action of interception was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\"><a href=\"/doc/837597/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 131 (1)</a> of the Act. Though the rigor of law under <a href=\"/doc/837597/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 131 (1)</a> of\nthe Act - which permits the officers to make enquiry or investigation, when\ncontrasted with the authorization for search and seizure under <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 132\n(1)</a> is different, however, in the present case, the verbal arguments advanced\nby the counsels are a desperate attempt to somehow sustain and justify the\naction. The record produced before us does not show that any action has\nbeen taken under <a href=\"/doc/837597/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 131 (1)</a> of the Act. The satisfaction note is for\nissuance of warrant of authorization under <a href=\"/doc/44634/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 132 (1)</a> of the Act, and\nthere cannot be any two views about the same. The Officer, present in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                    Page 27 of 28</span>\n Court, vaguely submitted that certain information was received prior to\ninterception. However, when confronted with the specific queries in this\nregard, he admitted that he cannot disclose - even to us in confidence, as to\nwhat was the information received, and by whom, and conceded that there is\nno recording of such information.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">29. For the foregoing reasons, the petition succeeds and is accordingly\nallowed. The impugned search and seizure and ex post facto warrant of\nauthorization dated 11.09.2018 issued by Respondent No.2 under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_95\">Section\n132</a> of the Act is hereby quashed. Consequently, all the actions taken\npursuant to such search and seizure are declared illegal. The Respondents\nshall forthwith return to the Petitioner, the jewellery seized. Since the action\nof the Respondent is found to be grossly arbitrary, and the entire action is\nvitiated, in order to discourage the Respondents from resorting to\nunwarranted action of search, we are inclined to saddle the Respondents with\ncosts which are quantified at Rs.50,000/-. The costs shall be payable to Delhi\nLegal Service Authority within four weeks of a copy of this decision being\nserved on them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">                                                    SANJEEV NARULA, J\n\n\n\n                                                           VIPIN SANGHI, J\n\nJANUARY 09, 2020\nPallavi\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">  W.P.(C) 5343/2019                                                  Page 28 of 28</span>\n </p>","numcites":30,"numcitedby":4,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":139049000,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"search and seizure","formInput":"search%20and%20seizure"},{"value":"search warrant","formInput":"search%20warrant"},{"value":"aiu","formInput":"aiu"},{"value":"proviso to section 132","formInput":"proviso%20to%20section%20132"},{"value":"physical possession","formInput":"physical%20possession"},{"value":"  valuable thing ","formInput":"%20%20valuable%20thing%20"},{"value":"stock-in-trade","formInput":"stock-in-trade"},{"value":"reasonable belief","formInput":"reasonable%20belief"},{"value":"valuer","formInput":"valuer"},{"value":"Airport","formInput":"Airport"},{"value":"sanjeev narula","formInput":"sanjeev%20narula"},{"value":"Investigation wing","formInput":"Investigation%20wing"},{"value":"GUWAHATI","formInput":"GUWAHATI"},{"value":"income tax returns ","formInput":"income%20tax%20returns%20"},{"value":"formulation","formInput":"formulation"},{"value":"additional directors","formInput":"additional%20directors"},{"value":"undisclosed income","formInput":"undisclosed%20income"},{"value":"prior approval","formInput":"prior%20approval"},{"value":"seized articles","formInput":"seized%20articles"},{"value":"books of accounts","formInput":"books%20of%20accounts"}],"cats":[{"value":"authorisation-for-search-and-seizure","formInput":"tag:authorisation-for-search-and-seizure"},{"value":"issue-notice-concealment-of-income","formInput":"tag:issue-notice-concealment-of-income"},{"value":"power-regarding-discovery-production-of-evidence","formInput":"tag:power-regarding-discovery-production-of-evidence"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
