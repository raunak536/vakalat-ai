She filed an application in I.A.NO.848 of 2004, in the above O.P., to restrain the respondents 2 to 5 in any manner, printing or publishing the proceedings relating to the institution of the petition filed by her before the Family Court or carry any other recital as news item in the telecast or their respective publication and to punish them for any such violation.  The trial Court dismissed the said I.A., on the ground that the respondents have not contravened the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 22</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act and that they are not liable for any punishment under the provisions of the said Act and if they contravene the said provision, action has to be taken before the appropriate forum.  Before this Court, the first respondent has agreed that the proceedings may be conducted &quot;in camera&quot; and that no publicity be given.  On the other hand, the press had contended that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1243269/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 11</a> of the Family Court will have an overriding effect on <a href=\"/doc/1548610/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 20</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">\t3.\tEven at the stage of interim application of stay, this Court after considering the scope and extent of <a href=\"/doc/676344/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 22(1)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act and the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_6\">Family Courts Act, 1984</a> at Paragraphs 12 to 16, has held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t&quot;12.\t<a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_7\">The Family Courts Act</a> is only a procedural law and the substantive law relating to family matters may vary from person to person depending on the religion and the respective personal laws.  When a Family Court deals with the matrimonial disputes of Hindu it has to only enforce the provisions of the  <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_8\">Hindu Marriage Act</a> and <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_9\">Sec.22</a> of the said Act in this regard is mandatory.  If other personal laws like Christian, Parsi or Mohamedan laws do not provide for in camera proceedings, whether there can be ban on publication or not will have to be decided on the basis of<a href=\"/doc/1243269/\" id=\"a_10\"> S.11</a>. The section confers a discretion on the Judge and also grants a right to the parties to have the proceedings held in camera.  In fact <a href=\"/doc/1243269/\" id=\"a_11\">Sec.11</a> confers a special right on the party to demand in camera proceedings and there is no discretion vested with the Court when such a request is made by either party to the dispute.  This only strengthens the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner that even under the <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_12\">Family Courts Act</a>, there is no scope for any publication or printing or the proceedings under the said Act on the violation of the Press and other electronic media.  Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents 2 to 5 that the <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_13\">Family Courts Act, 1984</a> has got overriding effect on the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_14\">Hindus Marriage Act, 1955</a> is not sustainable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t13. <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 22</a> of the Hindus Marriage Act,1955 recognizes the &quot;right to privacy between the parties in a proceedings conducted under the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_16\">Hindu Marriage Act</a>.  It has been clearly mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_17\">Sec.22</a> of the said Act that the proceedings under the Act should be conducted in camera and shall not be lawful for any person to print or publish any matter relates to such proceedings and if any one contravenes such bar he is liable for punishment with a fine which may extent to one thousand rupees.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t14. Right of Privacy has been recognized by Indian Courts.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_18\">Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh and another</a>, (1975) 2 S.C.C. 148, Their Lordships of the Supreme Court held as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t&quot;24. Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child rearing.  This catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as instructive as it does not give analytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle underlying the concept has been assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">\t15.\tAs far as this case is concerned, it is divorce proceedings between the petitioner and the first respondent and the petitioner is a cine actress and the first respondent is an employee in United States of America.  The first respondent is on leave to attend his case.   He is unable to leave for America without the case being heard.  Therefore, the interim stay of all further proceedings in the original petition ought to be vacated in the interest of justice.  At the same time the interest of the petitioner also has to be taken note of as publication or telecast of the proceedings conducted in Court will harm her reputation and cause injury.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\t16. In the above circumstances, C.M.P.No.16153 OF 2004, taken out by the first respondent is allowed in part and the interim stay already granted by this Court on 29.09.2004 in C.M.P.No.15875 of 2004 is vacated only with regard to conduct of further trial in the original petition.  However, the respondents 2 to 5 are restrained from publishing or telecasting the matrimonial proceedings relating to the revision petition in any way in view of <a href=\"/doc/50217/\" id=\"a_19\">Sec.22</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">\t4.\tThe order of this Court restraining them from publishing or telecasting the matrimonial proceedings relating to the revision petitioner has not been challenged on appeal.  In addition to what is stated above, I would like to add few paragraphs on the issue of right of privacy, in relation to matrimonial matters between the litigating parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t5.\tThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 12</a> states that,\n\t&quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.  Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\t6.\tFreedom of speech and expression, includes right not only to speak, but includes right to print, publish, distribute, receive information.   But whether this right is unrestricted, unlimited and the journalists and the media are given a total freehand to publish or telecast anything they desire? Whether right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India can simply be exercised to invade into the privacy of life, which is exclusively reserved to an individual?  Whatever transpires in between the litigants to a matrimonial dispute in a Court of law can it be made public?  The answer to all the queries would be that rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> are subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the Constitution of India and the laws framed thereunder.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">\t7.\tA reader of a newspaper, magazine or a person who watches the television or internet would be too curious to know what&#x27;s happening in other&#x27;s life, but would he expect something to be flashed about his own matrimonial life in press or other form of media?    Information can be collected by the press or any other media, like photographs, videotapes, printed matter etc., or it could be even information through interviews either from the parties to the marriage or from any body else.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_2\">8.\tFaced with a situation, whether the pressman/journalist would like to publish any matter pertaining his own matrimonial affair, without his consent  or matter relating to any matrimonial litigation, affecting his right of privacy?  The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_23\">Mr.X v. Hospital Z</a> reported in 1998 (8) SCC 296,  at Paragraph 15, explained what is meant by &#x27;right&#x27; in legal parlance and it is extracted:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t&quot;15. \u0013Right\u0014 is an interest recognised and protected by moral or legal rules. It is an interest the violation of which would be a legal wrong. Respect for such interest would be a legal duty. That is how Salmond has defined \u0013right\u0014. In order, therefore, that an interest becomes the subject of a legal right, it has to have not merely legal protection but also legal recognition. The elements of a \u0013legal right\u0014 are that the \u0013right\u0014 is vested in a person and is available against a person who is under a corresponding obligation and duty to respect that right and has to act or forbear from acting in a manner so as to prevent the violation of the right. If, therefore, there is a legal right vested in a person, the latter can seek its protection against a person who is bound by a corresponding duty not to violate that right.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_3\">9.\tWhile dealing with the right of privacy vis-a-vis the right of the press, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_24\">R.Rajagopal v. State of T.N.</a>, reported in 1994 (6) SCC 632 has held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t&quot;\u001326. (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21.</a> It is a \u0011right to be let alone\u0012. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent \u0017 whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\t10.\t&#x27;Privacy&#x27; has been defined as &quot;the rightful claim of an individual to determine to which he wishes to share himself with others and control over the time, place and circumstances to communicate with others&quot;.  It means the individuals right to control dissemination of information about himself.  It is his own personal possession.   It is well accepted that one person&#x27;s right to know and be informed may violate another&#x27;s right of privacy.  In other words, disclosure of certain facts, events, actions, photographs, videotapes, in any form of media, print or celluloid, internet would cause embarrassment, agony emotional stress, to a person of reasonable sensitiveness.  &#x27;Right of Privacy&#x27;  in otherwords can be said &quot;to be let alone&quot;.  What is an information to others according to a journalist, Could be a personal and sensitive information to an individual in a litigation relating to a matrimonial dispute.  The boundary between freedom of press and privacy of individual  is the &quot;Lakshman Rekha&quot; and if the media, crosses the line of boundary, the invasion starts.   To  Strike a balance between these two competing interests is difficult.  Right of privacy, vis-a-vis right of information to be furnished to the general public, in otherwords, the right of the media, should be with reference to the kind of information which the law permits.  We all know that Constitution does not guarantee absolute freedom or absolute protection to the media. Provisions of certain enactments would amply demonstrate the inherent restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, like the one prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.  Reasonable restrictions imposed in certain statutes as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\t11.\t<a href=\"/doc/366823/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 337</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with Court to be open and it reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t&quot;(1) The place in which any Criminal Court s held for the purpose of inquiring or trying any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court, to which the public generally may have access, so far as the same can conveniently contain them;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\tProvided that the Presiding Judge or Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, order at any stage of any inquiry into, or trial of, any particular case, that the public generally, or any particular person, shall not have access to, or be or remain in, the room or building used by the Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the inquiry into and trial of rape or an offence under Section 376, Section 376-A, Section 376-B, Section 376-C or <a href=\"/doc/9545/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 376-D</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall be conducted in camera. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\tProvided that the Presiding Judge may, if he things fit, or on an application made by either of the parties, allow any particular person to have access to, or be or remain in, the room or building used by the Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t(3) Where any proceedings are held under sub-Section (2), it shall not be lawful for any person to print or publish any matter in relation to any proceedings, except with the previous permission of the Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\t12.\t<a href=\"/doc/96293110/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/124708675/\" id=\"a_30\">4</a> of the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition Act), 1980, reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t&quot;3.

Reading of these provisions makes it clear that the intention of the legislation is to maintain secrecy in respect of certain proceedings or inquiry and protect women and children from invasion of their right of privacy.  These statutory restrictions are to protect their basic human right to lead life without hindrance from anyone in such of those enumerated matters and the media should not impinge upon the right of privacy, in otherwords, they should be allowed &quot;to be let alone&quot;.    &quot;Right of Privacy&quot; is now recognised as a right which flows from right to life and liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">\t18.\tMedia attention should be towards exposing corruption, nepotism, law breaking, abuse or arbitrary exercise of power, law and order, economy, health, science and technology etc., which are matters of public interest.

Right of information is a facet of freedom of speech and expression, enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.  Right of Information has been recognised as a Fundamental Right and the Right of Press to furnish the information or facts or opinion should be only to foster public interest and not to encroach upon the privacy of an individual.

Statutes empower the authorities to examine the parties,  under exceptional circumstances, contained therein.

Right of privacy in matrimonial matters between the parties in a litigation under Marriage Acts is personal to the litigating parties.   Thus it is manifestly clear that the legislature has intended to guard the right of privacy in relation to matrimonial matters and it is a settled legal position that the real meaning and effect should be given to the words employed in the Statute.   In the light of language employed  in the Statute, the right of privacy is so fundamental to the individual excepting to the extent provided under the Marriage Acts.   Of course, we should not forget the role of our independent press and media in coming out with revelations of public interest, resulting in societal changes.  As the freedom of the press is for the dissemination of information of public interest  and public affairs, those which are not related to the above, but involving the marital  relationships of the parties to a litigation should not be published or telecast, as it is prohibited under law.  Publication  of the proceedings meant to be in camera will affect the constitutional liberty guaranteed to the individual and it would be an invasion of his right of privacy.  When <a href=\"/doc/676344/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 22(1)</a> of the Act prohibits printing or publishing any matter in relation to any such proceeding arising under the Act, the Family Court or any other competent Court dealing with matrimonial matter, under the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_45\">Hindu Marriage Act</a>, has inherent jurisdiction  to issue an order of injunction or any such direction to give full effect to the statutory provision.
