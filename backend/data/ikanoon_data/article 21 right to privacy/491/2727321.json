Though, in the present case, the facts are entirely different inasmuch\n                             as the Petitioner in the present case is a married lady. Moreover, she has not\n                             filed any FIR against her husband complaining of physical abuse. She has\n                             not filed any petition for divorce or judicial separation from her husband.\n                             She has also not approached any Court under the <a href=\"/doc/542601/\" id=\"a_37\">Domestic Violence Act</a>.\n                             However, the ratio of the Apex Court is that it is the prerogative of each\n                             women to evaluate her life and arrive at the best course of action in view of\n                             the change in material circumstance. The Apex Court was of the opinion that\n                             change in material circumstance may result when a woman separates from\n                             her partner and she may no longer have the financial resources to raise the\n                             child. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_75\">The Apex Court has included the cases of domestic violence\n                             perpetrated on a woman under Rule 3B(c) of the MTP Rules wherein a\n                             woman is permitted to terminate her pregnancy up to 24 weeks on the\n                             ground of change of marital status during the ongoing pregnancy. The Apex\n                             Court has held that the right to reproductive autonomy is closely linked with\n                             the right to bodily autonomy.
