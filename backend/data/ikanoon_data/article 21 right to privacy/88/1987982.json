This  civil  revision  petition is filed  by sareetha, a well- known film   actress   of  the  south Indian  screeen  agianst  an  order passed by the learned   subordinate  Judge , cuddapah  ,overruling   her  objection raised to the  enter  taining  of an application  filed by one  venkata subbaiah, under  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_1\">section 9</a>  of the Hindu  Marriage  Act  (hereinafter  referred to as &#x27;the  Act)  for restitution of conjugal  rights  with her.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.  Sareetha   while   studying   in a highschool  and  then   hardly   aged  about   sixteen-years  and staying   with her   parents  at Madras   was  alleged  to have been  given  in marriage  to the said venkata  subbaiah, at  Tirupathi on  13-12-1975.  Almost   immediately   thereafter  they   were separated  from   each other and have been continuously  living   apart  fromeach  othe for  these five-years  and  more. Venkata   subbaish  had,  therefore,   filed  under   <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_2\">section 9</a> of the Act  O.P.  No. 1  of 1981  on  the file of  the  subcourt, cuddapah  for restitution of conjugal    rights    with   sareetha.  Sareetha    had  taken  a preliminary   objection  to the jurisdiction    of the cuddapah  sub-court   to the entertaining  of that application   the contention of sareetha   was that  the  petition  filed by  venkata   subbaiah itself   showed   lack  of jurisdiction  on the  part of cuddapah Court  to try the  petition  and that  the  sub-court  cuddapah  ought to have  declined  jurisdiction.  The   basis   for this    objection was an allegation   &quot;that the marriage took place at Tirupathi  and   that the    petitioner  and respondent   last   resided  together   at madras&quot;.  Sareetha   relied  upon  this  statement  of venkata   subbaiah  to say  that  the cuddapah  Court had no jurisdiction to entertain  the petition   of venkata  su bbaiah.  It was this   preliminary   objection   taken  by  sareetha  that had  been   overruled  by  the  cuddapah    sub-court,  leading  sareetha  to the  filing  of this  civil  Revision petition.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">3.  Venkata  subbaiah  hails  from cuddapah  where  he owns a house  and  agricultural  lands.  Venkata  subbaiah   stated   in his   petition for restitution of conjugal   rights   that after  his marriage  with  sareetha   at Tirupathi   in December 1975, he  and sareetha went  to cuddapah  and  lived   there  together  for six months    and  that thereafter  they went   to Madras   and  stayed   at Madras   with  the  parents    of  sareetha  for some  time.  According  to venkata  subbaiah,  their  stay  a cuddapah  for six   months  was immediately  after  their  marriage  at Tirupathi and  that was the  place where they last resided together   within the meaning   of the Act.  The  subsequent   stay  at madras   according  to venkata  subbaiah, should   not be regarded as the  place where  they last  resided together.  On the other   hand,  sareetha  contended that as  she  and  venkata subbaiah had  on the statement of venkata  subbaiah himself  last  lived to gether at madras  the cuddapah  Court   would have no  jurisdiction  to try  the  application  of venkata  subbaiah.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.   By  the  date of her marriage sareetha  was studying  in High school  and was  living  with her parents at  Madras. Venkata  subbaiah  hails   from cuddapah.   The petition  of venkata  subbaiah  disclosed  that after   their   marriage    at  Tirupathi  they lived  at cuddapah  for  six months  and that   thereafter   they   went  to the parents   of sareetha  at  madras  and lived  there for some time.   There can be no doubt   that  Madras  was  thier   last  place  of  living   together   because  thereafter   they  parted  company   with each other.  Those  were  the days   when    sareetha  was attempting   to gain access to the south  Indian  cinefield  of  which   she is  today  one of the  most   talented top  actresses.  According   to venkata  subbaiah&#x27;s  allegations,  these  attempts  of sareetha   led to  misunderstanding  between  him and  sareetha    on  the one hand    and  also between   him  and   the parents of sareetha on the other, and    forced  venkata  subbaiah  to return  to cuddapah  leaving   sareetha  at Madras.  Thereafter  venkata  subbaiah and sareetha  never  met  each  other.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.  Now  the  plea  of sareetha  objecting  tot he jurisdiction of cuddapah  Court   raised two  questions.  Firstly  did  the   parties  live at cuddapah   immediately after  their  marriage? Secondly, If  they did  the madras  residence supersede the cuddapah  residence?   Sareetha   in  her   petition did not  specifically  deny   the allegation   made by   venkata    subbaiah that   after  marriage   they had lived   at cuddapah.  All that  she had stated  in  her petition was:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  &quot;The  respondent admitted in para  3 of his  petition that the marriage  took  place at Tirupathi  and the   petitioner    and  respondent last resided  together at  Madras  Hence  the main   petition  does   not lie  in this   Court  for  the   reason  that the cause  of  action   is raising      outside  the  territorial   jurisdiction of this  Court.  As  per <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_3\">section 19</a> of the Hindu  Marriage  Act 1955 the Court  at  Tirupathi when  the  marriage took place or at madras  where  the   petitioner and respondent  last  resided   together   alone  have  jurisdiction to try  this petition.  Hence  the  petition  is liable to be  dismissed for  want  of jurisdiction&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">The learned subordinate  judge   construed  the   above   pleadings  of sareetha  as  not  amounting  to a specific   denial  of  venkata  subbaiah&#x27;s   allegation  that  the  husband  and wife   lived   at  cuddapah   for  six  months  immediately   after   thier marriage at Tirupathi and    before    going   to  Madras.  The learned  subordinate judge found  the pleadings of sareetha to mean to say that the  Madras residence amounted in  law  to have superseded the cuddapah residence.  The  learned  subordinate  Judge   found,as a  fact, that the cuddapah  residence  was not denied  by sareetha.  He  accordingly  examined  the  second    question  and found  that the Madras  stay  was not sufficient  to  displace  the cuddapah  residence.  In the result   he  found that the cuddapah  Court had jurisdiction to try the application filed by venkata  subbaiah.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.  In this  C.R.P.   these  findings are assailed by sareetha.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.  As   already  noted, venkata  subbaiah  had specifically   pleaded  that they had  lived  together  at cuddapah  immediately  after their marriage  sareetha  failed to  specifically  deny  this  averment    made by   Venkata  subbaiah.  I  therefore  think   that the   learned  subordinate   Judge   was right    in  holding  believing   venkata  subbaiah,  that the parties   lived    at the house  of venkata  subbaiah at cuddapah.  Even  otherwise  it would  not  be easy  to believe that a newly  married   couple    as the parties  are alleged    to be  first  went   to the parents   of the wife at Madras   without  going  to  the  husband&#x27;s place  at cuddapah  certainly    this is not  common  among  the agricultural  communities    who are  more firmly   bound  tied  to their  place of residence and agriculture.  Further   the very  plea  of sareetha   that madras  was the place   where  they last resided  together   amounts   to an admission  on her  part  that there was \n\n \n\nAt least one another   place  where they resided together   prior  to their  residing at madras.   That place of residence could  only be  cuddapah.  For all these  reasons  I  hold  that  venkata  subbaiah  and sareetha   lived  at cuddapah  for  some time  immediately  after  thier  marriage  as alleged by  venkata  subbaiah.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">8.  But the  next  question  whether cuddapah  or Madras  should be counted  as the place  where  the  parties   had last lived  together  for the purpose  of  <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_4\">section 19</a> of the Act  still requires  to be considered  and answered.  For  its  answer  this  question  depends  upon the  meaning   to be given  to the statutory   provision of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_5\">section 19</a>  of the Act,  we should  therefore read  <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_6\">section 19</a> of  the Act.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">9.  <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 19</a>: &quot;every  petition under this Act  shall  be  presented to the district   Court within  the local limits of whose ordinary   original  civil  jurisdiction-\n</p>\n   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)  the marriage  was solemnized  or\n\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii)   the respondent, at the  time of the presentation of the petition resides, or \n\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(iii)   the parties to  the  marriage last resided   together   or\n\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iv)  the petitioner is residing  at the time of  presentation of the petition in a case  where  the  respondent is, at  that time,   residing outside  the territories  to which the  Act extends or has not been heard  of as being   alive  for a  period  of  seven  years  or more  by those persons  who would  naturally  have heard  of him if he was alive&#x27;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">Of  its four  clauses of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_8\">section 19</a> of the Act, we are concerned  in this  case, with its  clause (iii)   which speaks   of a place where  the  parties   to the marriage last reised together the words  parties  to the marriage&quot; in that  clause   present   no difficulty   and  they obviously  refer  to  the wife and  husband.  It is   the use of the word &quot;resided&quot;  that causes  a degree  of uncertainly  in the ascertainment  of the meaning  of this clause.  The word   is  not defined  by the  Act.  In its  dictionary  sense of the word, &quot;to reside&quot;  means, &quot;to dwell  permanently  or for a length of  time&quot;.  (See webster&#x27;s  dictionary)  temporary  place of  residence or a casual   place of stay is thus   excluded  from being   called a residence.  Further  in the third   clause  of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_9\">section 19</a> of the Act,  the  &quot;residence&quot; spoken  of is the joint   residence.  Combinedly   read,  the third   clause of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_10\">section 19</a> refers  to a place  where the  husband   and wife   lived together  permanently  or at least  for sufficinetly   long   period  of time.   Such  a place  can only be  a place of permanent dwelling  taken up by the  husband  and wife   jointly  for their  matrimonial purposes.  That place  must  be one to which the parties   are bound  by  the solemn ties  of their  matrimony.  That can only be the  place chosen by them jointly  as suitable for  fulfilling  their  matrimonial  vous  of Dharma, Artha,  kama  and Moksha.  In  other   words  the third   clause of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_11\">section 19</a> of the Act refers to the matrimonial   home of the  parties to the  marriage.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">10.  The secular description given by Ridley J., to the  place  of residence of a person as &#x27;the  place where   he eats, drinks and sleeps  indicates the connection  of the place   to  the carrying  on  of the activities  by  the  resident.  (See  stoke-on-Trent  Borough  council  v. Cheshire  country  council    (1913)  3 KB  699, 704,  705).  In a  matrimonial  matter, Lord  Merriman  said (in Lowry  v. Lowry  (1952)  2 All ER  61).\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">  &quot;..........I  suppose the words &quot;last ordinarily   resided together  as man  and wife  in England&quot; could  be paraphrased by saying  that the matrimonial   home  at  which  the  parties  last   cohabited  was in england&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">These    ordinarily  accepted  descriptions   of the word  reside  in matrimonial   cases  would have the effect of excluding the places where the  husband  and the wife  stayed   temporarily   on shor t sojourns   pursuing temporary   purposes  such as seeking  pleasure  or  visiting    a friend  or  a  temple  or attending   a function  from the category  of residence.  The  places   where  the wife  and husband stop  to eat  or drink   or stay  for the  night   during  such short fojourns  could never  be taken  to have been intended by <a href=\"/doc/84470/\" id=\"a_12\">section 19 (iii)</a>   of  the  Act to be called &quot;the  place they last resided together  Such places do not  reverberate  with  the  sounds of marriage destiny.  Giving   such a meaning   to the words   &quot;last  resided  together   in <a href=\"/doc/84470/\" id=\"a_13\">section  19 (iii)</a>   of  the  Act would make that clause   disfunctional.  Stay  in Elliot&#x27;s   one-night   cheap   hotels    could  not  have been intended by  the  Act to be treated  as  the  place  of last   residence of the  husband   and wife.  In particular  in the case of those  who have a place of permanent  dwelling   a matrimonial   home can only refer  to their permanent dwelling  place.  But  where the   parties    to a marriage  have no permanent place of dwelling  to start  with and move  from place to place   like  the  wandering  Gypsies, it  would legally  be difficult to choose   one place    more  than another place  as  their place  of permanent  residence In such a case  acting out of  necessity created  by  the  statute  we may  have to ascribe     even to a temporary  place  of stay  the exalted   status  of the last  place of residence.  In such a case, we may have to call a stay  even  in a one-night  cheap  hotel  as the  last place of thier  residence, because  there are no competing claims  made by other place.  More  depends on the particular facts  of each case and  less on the  meaning of the  words.  Fixation of the  place where the parties last resided together  thus requires  the  courts  to take an over-all  view  of the particular  facts  in a  particular  case. But  venkata  subbaiah  had a permanent house at cuddapah  where he   eats, drinks  and sleeps  carrying   on his agricultural  operations  presumably  his ancestors  lived  there and worked   there with the mother-earth  ther he forged sacred  bonds   of intimacy.  It is  that place  to which venkata  subbaiah and sareetha went  immediately   after  their marriage  at Tirupathi  and  lived   for six months   that was the place chosen  by them  for fulfilling their   matrimonial  vows.  They  thus   made   cuddapah   their  matrimonial  home.  Thus,  within   the meaning   of clause (iii)   of <a href=\"/doc/371013/\" id=\"a_14\">section  19</a>  of the Act, it is  cuddapah  alone that can be called thier    matrimonial  home and  their  place  of residence in this   case.  Such a residence cannot be  displaced by their  Madras  residence.  The   nature  and duration  of their stay at  madras  was temporary  and casual and had  no  enduring   claims   to make  that place a place of residence.  There they  were   visiting  the father and mother of sareetha  but  without   breaking  their  bonds  of  association  with cuddapah.  Such a temporary  or  casual  residence  at madras  occasioned  by  the  customary  necessity   of visiting   relatives,  cannot  displace  the place of their   permanent  dwelling  at cuddapah.  It follows  that  resided together  at cuddapah  and cuddapah   Court has jurisdiction to entertain  the application filed by  venkata  subbaiah  for restitution of conjugal  rights  under   <a href=\"/doc/84470/\" id=\"a_15\">section 19 (iii)</a> of  the  Act.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">11.  The petitioner&#x27;s  learned counsel  cited several decisions of the  various   High Court  and also of the Supreme Court.  It does not appear to me  to be  necessary to refer  to htese cases in detail, because  I find  that in those cases  the Judgments merely  turned  upon  the   facts   of each  case.  The answer  to a question  where  the wife   and  husband  last  resided together  must, in the  nature  of  things, depend  upon on the particular  facts  of each case. \n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">12.   In R. Barnet  London  Borough  council (1981)  2 WLR  86,  the divisional   Court ruled  that the  expression &quot;ordinary   residence&quot;  embodied  a number  of  factors  such as  time, intention  and continuity each of  which might  carry a different  weight  according  to the  context    in  which and the  purpose for  which the expression was   used  in a particular  statute.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">13.  In the varying  circumstances of a concrete  case, no general  principle of law  can decide  what  relative  weight  should be given  to these  various  factors  of  time,  intention and continuity.  The question  therefore whether  the wife   and husband   last resided  together   in a particular  place,   can only  be decided   on the particular   evaluation of these   changing   and differing   factors   and not by folllowing  any mechanical   rule  of thumb.  The various   decisions cited  by  the learned  counsel cannot,  therefore be taken   as alying   down any  proposition of law.  They can only be taken at best as laying down propositions of good  sense.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">14.  In Qualcast   wolverhampton  Ltd.  V. Hayness (1959)  AC  743  Lord   Denning   chided the country Court for  treating  the decisions of th House of Lords  on hte question   whether  the  employer   was guilty  of negligence  or not in   particular   cases  as laying  down  any  proposition of law  binding upon a country  Court.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">15.  In that case, an experienced moulder who injured  himself  in the course  of  his  employment   sued  his   employer  for negligence.  Although the country Court found as a fact  that the moulder was not wearing  protective   spats  that were   made available   by the employer  and which would have prevented  the injury held  thinking   that it was bound by the  authoritative   decisions of the superior  courts  that  the  employer  was  guilty  of negligence, for   their failure  to administer   warning to the experienced moulder.  The    House  of lords  reversed  that judgment holding   that the  question  what did   reasonable    care   demand  of the employers  in that  particular  case was not a  question  of law  but a question  of fact on which no decision  of the   superior  courts   can Act as  a  precedential  authority  Lord  Denning  observed  in that case:\n</p>\n   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> &quot;The  question that did  arise  was this:  what did reasonable   care  demand  of the  employers in this    particulr  case?  That is  not a  question of law  at all but a question  of fact.  To  solve  it  the  Tribunal  of   fact - be it  Judge or jury - can take into  account  any proposition  of good  sense  that is relevant  in  the  circumstances, but  it must  beware  not to treat  it as a proposition  of law.  I may perhaps  draw  an analogy  from  the  Highway code.  It  contains  many   propositions   of  good   sense  which  may be  taken  into  account   in considering    whether   reasonable  care has been taken but it  would  be a mistake to elevate  them into propositions  of law....................................................\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">I  can well  see how  it came  about  that  they country  Court Judge   made  this  mistake.  He was  presented    with a number   of cases in which judges  of  the High Court had given  reasons  for  coming   to their conclusions   of fact.  And those   reasons seemed  to him  to be so expressed   as to be rulings in point   of  law;  whereas  they were   in truth  nothing   more than propositions of  good  sense.  This is not the first  time  this  sort  of thing  has happebed.  Take  accidents on the road, I remember  well  that in  several  cases   scrutton L.J.  said  that&quot;if a person  rides   in the dark   he must  ride  at such  a pace  that he can pull up within   the limits  of &quot;his  vision&quot;  (Baker  v. E. Longhurst  &amp;  sons  ltd.  (1933)  2 KB  461, 468.  That  was treated  as  aproposition  of law  until  the  Court of  appeal  firmly   ruled  that it was not (Tidy v. Battman  (1934) 1 KB   319).  Morris v. Luton corporation  - (1946)  KB  114).  So also  with accidents    in  factories.   I  myself   once   said that an employer  must, by his  foreman, &quot;do his  best  to &quot;keep  (the men)  up to the mark&quot;  (Clifford  v.  Charies  H. Challen &amp; son  Ltd)  (1951)  1 KB  495  Someone   shortly   afterwards  sought  to treat  me as having  laid down a new  proposition of law, but  the  Court of  Appeal I am glad  to say, corrected  the error  (Woods  v. Durable   suites  Ltd. (1953)  1 WLR   857).  Such   cases  all  serve   to bear   out  the  warning  which  has been given  in this  House  before ......&quot;We  sought  &quot;to beware  of allowing  tests   or  guides  which  have been  suggested&quot;  by the Court in one set   of circumstances, or in one class of &quot;cases, to be applied  to other   surroundings &quot;  and thus  by degrees  to turn   that which  is at bottom   a question   of fact  into a proposition  of law  that is  what happened  in the cases  under the workmen&#x27;s  compensation  Act,   and it led  to a wagon  load  of &quot;cases&quot;,  See  harris  v. Associated   portland  cement  Manufacturers  LTd.  (1939)  AC  71  by  Lord  Atkin.  Let  not the  same  thing  happen  to  the  common  law,  lest  we be  crushed  under  the  weight  of our  own  reports&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">The   question  which  is the place  where   the husband   and  wife   last  resided  together is, in my opinion   not being    capable  of being   treated  as a question of law, I  consider the matter from an overall view  of the facts.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">16.    In  this   case, the  finding of  fact is that the  parties  had lived  for six months at cuddapah  immediately  after  their  marriage  at Tirupathi.  The place of the permanent  residence  of venkata  subbaiah  is  cuddapah, Venkata  subbaiah  has agricultural   lands  there.  Presumably   he  conducts   agricultural  operations   from there which would  require   his constant  presence and attention  Unless  sareetha  suceeds in showing that she never lived with venkata  subbaiah at  cuddapah, the claim of cuddapah to be the  place of last residence in this case, cannot be rejected.  It is true  that sareetha say that she  never lived with venkata  subbaiah at cuddapah,  but this  point    was never  made  good  by her.  She never   argued  this  point  before  the Court below    nor is  that plea  proved  to its  satisfaction.  The  question  whether  she  lived   with venkata   subbaiah  at cuddapah or  not is a pure   question  of fact.  The finding   of the lower   Court on such a  question   of fact  cannot  be distribed  by  a  revisional Court. I am thus left with no option except  to accept  that finding Accepting the finding   of  the ocurt below  that sareetha and venkata  subbaiah  lived  together   at  cuddapah  for about a period   of six months after their  marriage  at Tirupathi  I hold  that cuddapah was the place where the parties had  last resided together    and the Madras   residence  is ineffectual  to displace  that cuddapah  residence and that accordingly the  Court of  the subordinate Judge.  Cuddapah, has  jurisdiction  to try the petition filed  by venkata  subbaiah  for   restitution of conjugal rights.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">PART  II.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">17.  This    leads me to the consideration of the other half of this case which raises an important  constitutional  question. Sareetha in her petition dated 31-8-1981  of which notice from this  Court had been duly   given  to and  served  upon  the Attorney   General  Of India,New Delhi raised for the  first  time a question of constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_16\">section 9</a> of  the Hindu Marriage   Act.  Through  that  petition, sareetha  claimed that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_17\">section 9</a> of the Act, &quot;is liable to be struck  down as violative of the fundamental  rights in part III  of  the Constitution of India, more  particularly  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_19\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">21</a> inasmuch as the  statutory  relief  under  the said provision, namely restitution of conjugal  rights  offends  the guarantee to life,  personal  liberty and human dignity and decency&#x27;.  As  the  above  contention of sareetha  involves the question of constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_21\">section 9</a> of the Act,  authorising  grant of curial relief  of  restitution of  conjugal rights to a Hindu suitor, I read <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_22\">section 9</a> of the Act in full and the  relevant  parts of its allied procedural provisions  contained in order 21 Rules 32 and 33 of the civil  procedure code.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\"><a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 9</a>: Restitution of conjugal rights:\n</p>\n   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"> &quot;When  either the husband or the wife  has without reasonable excuse withdrawn from the society of the  other, the aggrieved  party may apply by petition to the district Court for  restitution  of conjugal   rights and the Court,  on being satisfied  the truth of the statements  made in such petition  and  that   there is no legal  ground  why the application should not be granted, may  decree restitution of conjugal rights  accordingly. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">Explanation:  Where a question arises whether there has been reasonable excuse  for withdrawal from the society, the burden of proving  reasonable excuse shall be on the person who has withdrawn from the society&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">Order 21 Rule 32 of C.P.c.

Additionally  always  a Court can enforce  its decree  through its  contempt powers.  The  Judicial committee of the  privy council  in Moonshed  Buzloo Rhueem  v. Shumsoon  Nissa  Begum, (1867) 11 Moo  Ind  App 551, held  that a suit for restitution of conjugal   rights  filed by a Muslim  husband  was  rightly   filed  as a suit  for  specific  persormance  it is on  the same lines   that order 21 Rule  32  of the code of civil  procedure   speaks  of a decree granted   for  restriction     of conjugal   rights   as a  decree of  specific   performance  of restitution   of  conjugal   rights.  Conjugal   rights  connote  two  ideas.  (A)  &quot;the   right    which husband   and  wife  have  to each other&#x27;s  society   and   (b)   &quot;marital  intercourse&quot;.  (See the  dictionary  of English  Law  by Earl  Jowitt P. 453)  In  Wily  v. Wily  (1918)   P. 1   &quot;an   offer  by  the   husband   to live  under    the   same proof  with his  wife,  each   party  being  free from molestation by  the   other was held   not  an offer to matrimonial  cohabitation&quot;. (See   N. R.  Raghavachariar&#x27;s  Hindu Law, 7th  Edn. Vol II p.  980.  Gupt&#x27;s  Hindu  Law  of  Marriage P. 181  and derrett&#x27;s  Introduction  to Modern  Hindu  Law  para  308).  In other  words, sexual  cohabitation is an inseparable  ingredient of a decree for restitution  of  conjugal  rights.  It  follows, therefore  that a decree  for restitution  of conjugal    rights  passed   by a civil Court  extends  not only to the  grant    of relief    to the decree holder   to the company of the  other spouse, but  also  embraces the  right to have marital intercourse  of the  enforcement of such a decree  are  firstly   to  transfer the choice  to have  or not  to  have marital  intercourse  to the state  from  the  concerned  individual  and secondly   to  surrender  the choice  of the individual  to allow or not to allow  one&#x27;s  body  to be used   as a vehicle  for  another human  being&#x27;s   creation   to the  state.  Relief  of restitution    of conjugal  rights fraught  with such serious  consequences  to the concerned, individual  were  granted under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_25\">section 9</a> of the Act enables the decreeholder  through  application  of  financial  sanctions  provided  by  order  21 Rules  32  and 33  <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_26\">of C.P.C</a>.  to have  sexual  cohabitation  with an  unwilling   party  even   by imprisonment in a civil   prison.  Now  compliance   of the unwilling   party  to such a  decree  is sought to be procured, by  applying   financial  sanctions  by attachment   and sale of the  property   of  the   recalcitrant party.  But  the purpose  of a decree  for restitution   of conjugal   rights   in the  past as it is in the  present remains   the saem which is to  coerce  through  judicial  process the unwilling party to have sex  against that person&#x27;s  consent   and  freewill with  the  decree-holder.  There can be no doubt that  a  decree  of  restitution   of conjugal  rights  thus enforced offends the inviolability  of the body  and the mind   subjected to hte decree  and offends  the  integrity   of  such a  person and invades the marital  privacy and domestic intimacies  of  such a person  The  uninhibited  tragedy  involved   in granting  a decree  for  restitution  of conjugal    rights  is well illustrated by Anna  saheb  v. Tara  Bai . In that case,  Division  Bench of  the madhya  pradesh High Court decreed  the husband&#x27;s  suit  for restitution of conjugal  rights observing   &quot;:but if the husband is not guilty  of misconduct, a petition cannot  be dismissed merely  because    the wife   does   not like  her husband  or  does  not want  to  live  with him.............&quot;  What  could have happened to Tarabai  thereafter may well  be left  to the  eader&#x27;s  imagination .  According  to law,  anna  saheb  against her  will.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">18.    It  cannot be denied  that  among   the few   points    that  distinguish  human   existence from that of animals, sexual  autonomy an  individual  enjoys  to choose  his or  her partner to a sexual Act, is  of primary   importance.  Sexual   expression   is so integral to one&#x27;s  personality that it is impossible to conceive  of sexuality  on  any basis  except  on the basis   of   consensual  participation    of   the opposite  sexes.  No relationship between man and woman  is more  rested  on mutual  consent and  freewill  and is more intimately  and  personally   forged  than sexual  relationship.  The  famous   legal definition of marriage   given  by Lord    penzance   in Hyde v. Hyde  (1866)  LR IP  &amp; D  130 (Divorce  Court),  as a  voluntary   union   between   man  and   woman only highlights  this    aspect  of free association.  The  ennobling   quality  of  sex  of which havelock   ennobling  quality of  sex of  which havelock  Ellis  wrote  in his  studies    on  the   Psychology  of sex  ensues  out of  this freedom  of choice.  He  wrote  that &quot;the  man experiences  the   highest    unfolding   of his   creative   powers  not   through  ascertism  but  through   sexual   happiness&#x27;.  Bertrand  Russell  who ought   to know  declared  that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">  &quot;I  have sought  love,  first  because it brings   ecstasy-ecstasy so  great  that I   would often  have  sacrificied all the  rest  of life   for a few   hours  of this  Joy&#x27;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">Forced sex, like  all forced  things   is a  denial  of all  joy  yet  in  conceivable  cases   sex  and  statutorily  be denied  and even forbidden  by law   between  specified    groups   of persons.  But  no positive  Act of sex can  be forced   upon  the   unwilling  persons, because     nothing    can conceivably  be more  degrading  to   human  dignity  and monstrous  to human  spirit  than  to  subject a person   by  hte  long arm of hte law to a positive  sex Act.  The  restitution of  cnjugal   rights   by force  of arms  can be  more and can be no less than   what   late  sri Sri,  the greatest of  the Modern   Telugu  poets ,  described   in his poem  &quot;Kavitha  as  &quot;Rakshasa  Rathi&quot;.  <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_27\">The Act</a>  of sex  requires  primarily   the  participation of mind  the researches    of  the modern psychology  had put  to rest  the cartesian dischotomy  that   has   separated  body  and mind  since  the 17th  centurt.  The researches  of Dr. George  solomon  of Univerity of california   led  him to  conclude  that &quot;mind   and  body  are inseparable&quot;   and that &quot;the  brain  influences  all sorts   of physiological  processes that   were  once thought  not to be centrally  regulated&quot;.   And  that  &quot;the brain  influences  all sorts  of physiological  processes that  were  once thought   not to be centrally   regulated&quot;.  Sex  Act  therefore, can never  be treated as a mere  Act of  body  that can be ordered to obey  by  the state.  The   coercive  Act of the state  compelling   sexual  cohabitation therefore, must  be regarded  as a great  constraint and torture imposed  on the   mind  of the unwilling  party.  The life of a man or woman  which the sovereign  can commandeer through the coercive  power  of the state  for  performing  an unwilling   Act  of   sexual  cohabitation  cannot but  be regarded  as  that  of a human  beast drained  of all spirituality.  In  Russel  v. Russel  (1897)   AC  395  Lord  herschell  long-ago noted the  barbarity  of this judicial   remedy.  He  observed, I think  the law  of restitution of conjugal    rights  as administered in the courts   did sometimes  lead to results which I can only call bardarous&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">19.  There is even  graver implications for the wife.  <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_28\">An Act</a> of foerced sex is no less potent  than an Act of  consensual  sex  in producing  pregnancy  and procereating   offspring.  The only  difference lies  in the fact  that the  latter  is with  her  consent  while  the former  is without her consent.  In  the process of making   such  a fateful  choice  as to when   where  and how if at all she  should  beget,  bear  deliver  and rear  a child,  the wife  consistent with  her  human  dignity should  never be excluded, conception  and  delivery of a child  involves the   most   intimate  use of her body.  The marvel  of creation  takes   place inside her  body  and the child  that  would be born  is of her  own  flesh  and  blood.  In a  matter which is so  intimately concerns  her body  and which is so vital  for her  life, a decree  of restitution  of conjugal  rights  totally  excludes her.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">20.  The  origin  of this   remedy  for restitution of conjugal  rights  is not to be found  in the  British  common law   it  is the medieval  Ecclesiastical law  of  England  which knows no matrimonial remedy of   desertion  that   provided  for this  remedy   which  the   Ecclesiastical courts  and later ordinary  courts  enforced.  But   the British  Law  commission  presided   over by Mr. Justice    scarman, (as  he   then was)  recommended recently  on 9-7-1969  the abolition  of  this uncivilized   remedy  of  restitution   of conjugal   rights  accepting  that recommendation  of  the British  Law  commission  the British  parliament through   <a href=\"/doc/1548610/\" id=\"a_29\">section 20</a> of the Matrimonial  proceedings   and  property   Act, 1970   abolished   the right to claim  restitution of conjugal  rights  in the English   courts. <a href=\"/doc/1548610/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 20</a>  of  that Act reads  thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">  &quot;No  person  shall  after  the commencement of this Act  be entitled  to petition  the High Court or any  country  Court for  restitution of conjugal  rights&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">But our  ancient   Hindu   system of Matrimonial  law  never  recognised  this   institution   of conjugal   rights    althought  it  fully   upheld   the duty of the wife  to  surrender  to  her   husband.  In  other words, the ancient   Hindu   law  treated  the duty of the Hindu wife to abide  by her  husband   only  as  an imperfectobligation   incapable   of being    enforced  against   her will .  It  left  the  choice   entirely  to  the free will of the wife.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110688\" id=\"span_1\">In  <a href=\"/doc/110688/\" id=\"a_31\">Bai Jiva   v. Narsingh Lalbhai (ILR</a>  1927 Bom  264 at p.  268)  a division Bench  of the Bombay  High Court judicially noticed  this  fact in the following  words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">  &quot;Hindu  law  itself  even  while  it lays  down  the duty of the  wife  of  implicit  obedience  and return   to  her   husband, has laid  down   no such sanction  or procedure   as compulsion   by  the   courts  to  force   her to  return  against  her will&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">21.   This  could have been  only  because  of its    realisation    that  in a matter so intimately  concerned the wife or the  husband the  parties  are better left  alone   without   state interference.  What  could happen  to the fate  of a person in the position  of Tara  Bai (the  respondent  in  the  abovementioned  madhya  pradesh Appeal)  who was  forced to go   back  to  her  husband  even  after    declaration  of  dislike  and   abhorrence  towards  her husband  could have  been well  considered  by  the  ancient  Hindu   Law.  With  the Brithish occupation  of this country  the whole legal  position  was drastically   altered.  The British  indian  courts  wrongly  equating   the Ecclesiastical rule  of this  matrimonial  remedy  with equity  good   conscience  and justice,  thoughtlessly  imported  that  rule   into our country   and blindly  enforced it among   the Hindus  and the Muslims.  Thus,  the   origin  of this  uncivilised remedy   in our   ancient   country  is only recent and is wholly   illegitimate.  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 9</a> of the Act had  merely  aped  the british   and mechanically   reenacted  that legal  provision  of the British  Ecclesiastical origin.  The   plain   question  that arises  is whether  our  parliament now functioning under the constitutional  constraints  of the  fundamental rights  conceived  and enacted  for   the preservations  of  human    dignity and  promotion  of personal  liberty, can  legally   impose  sexual  cohabitation   between   unwilling    opposite   sexual  partners  even if it be during  the matrimony  of the parties.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">22.  The Hindu  marriage Act was enacted  by our   parliament  in the year  1955 and the  legislative   competence of the parliament  to enact   <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_33\">section   9</a> of  the  Act under  item 5 of  the  List  III  of  the VII  schedule   to the Constitution  is  undoubted.  But  the question  is whether    that provision  runs  foul  of part III  of    the  Constitution.  The   petitioner attacks  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_34\">section 9</a> of the Act on the  ground   that  granting of restitution  of conjugal   rights violates the petitioner&#x27;s  rights  guaranteed   under  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_35\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">, 19</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">21</a>  of  part III  of our   constitioner  attacks   <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_38\">section 9</a> of the Act  on hte ground  that  granting    of  restitution  of conjugal    rights violates the petitioner&#x27;s   rights guaranteed under  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_39\">articles  14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_40\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">21</a>  of part III of   our  Constitution.  Let us,  therefore, first   examine  the content  of   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution   guarantees  right   to life  and personal   liberty  against  the state action.  Formulated  in simple  negative  terms, its range   of operation   positively   any person   of his   life  or personal liberty except   according to  the   procedure  liberty  except   according   to the procedure   established  by  law  is  of far  reaching  dimensions  and  of overwhelming   constitutional  significance.  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article  21</a>  prevents   the   state  from treting  the human  life  as that of any other animal.  It is  now  well established  by   the decisions   of  the Supreme Court  that the  word &#x27;life&#x27;  occuring  in the above  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article  21</a>  has  spiritual  significance  as the word  life  occuring  in the famous   5th and 14th  Amendments   to the   American  Constitution  does.  In those constitutional  provisions  of the  American Constitution the life is interpreted by Mr. Justice  field  in this  dissenting  judgment  in Munn v.

Henry  wade, (1973)  35 L Ed  2d p. 147 ruled that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution  embraces  the right  to privacy  and human  dignity.</span></span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_7\">The  centrepiece of the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_56\">Govind</a>&#x27;s  case  is to hold  that  right  to privacy   is part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">art. 21</a> of our  Constitution and to stress  its constitutional   importance and to call for its  protection.   The   learned  Judge  then examined  the content  of the right to privacy  and  observed  that &quot;any  right   to privacy   must  encompass  and protect the personal intimacies of the home,  the  family, marriage  motherhood,  procreation and   child   rearing.&quot;  The  learned   Judge  stressed the   primordial importance of the right  to privacy for  human   happiness and directed  the ocurts  not to reject the privacy-dignity  claims  brought before  them  except  where  the countervailing  state interests  are shown to have overweighing   importance.  He  observed  that &quot;there can be no doubt that the  makers  of our  Constitution wanted to ensure conditions favourable to  the  pursuit    of  happiness.</span>  They certainly  realised as Brandies J.,  said in his   dissent in Olmstead  v. United states of  America, (1927-277 US  438, 471)  the  significance  of man&#x27;s  spiritual   nature  of his feelings  and of hisintellect and that only a part of the pain,  pleasure   satisfaction  of life  can be  found    in material  things  and  therefore they must   be  deemed to have conferred upon  the individual   as  against the Government a sphere  where  he should  be left  alone&quot;.  The learned Judge also  stated  &quot;there can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims  deserve to be examined with care and to be denied  only when  an important  countervailing  interest is shown to be  superior&quot;.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_8\"><a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_58\">Govind</a>&#x27;s  case  (Supra)  thus  firmly  laid  it  down that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article  21</a>  protects the right  to privacy  and  promotes  the individual  dignity  mentioned  in the preamble  to our  Constitution .</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_9\"><a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_60\">Govind</a>&#x27;s  case also  lays  it down  that the ocurts should   protect  and up-hold   those  important constitutional rights  except  where the claims of those   rights  for protection  are required  to be  subordinated  to superior  state interests.</span>\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">24.  However  it must be  admitted  that the concept  of right to privacy  does not lend itself  to easy logical  definition This is so partly because as Tom  Gaiety  said   in his  Article  &quot;Redefining    privacy&quot;  (12 Harv civ Rts. - Civ. Lib rev p. 233,)  the concept  was thrown  up in  great  haste from a miscellany  of  legal   rock  and staone  and partly  because of the inherent difficulties  in defining  such an elusive  concept.  The difficulty  arises   out of  the fact that  this  concept  is not  unitary  concept  but is  multidimensional   susceptiable more for  enumeration   than definition.  But it can be confidently  asserted  that any plausible  definition of right to privacy is boudn to take human  body as its  first and most basic  reference  for control over  personal  identity.  Such a definition  is bound  to include body&#x27;s inviolability  and integrity and  intimacy  of personal  identity  including marital privacy   A few  representative samples  would  bear  this  out.  Gaiety  defined   privacy  as &quot;an autonomy  or control   over the intimacies   of  personal  identity.&quot;  Richard B. Panker  in his &quot; A definition of privacy&quot;, quoted  in  &quot;philosophy  and public  Affairs&quot;  (1975 Vol 4 No. 4 p. 295-314 wrote:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">  &quot;...............Privacy  is control  over  when and by whom the various   parts   of us  can be  sensed by  tohers.  By &quot;sensed&quot;  is meant  simply  seen,  heard  touched  smelled or tasted&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">Gary L. Bostwick writing  in california  Law  review Vol. 64 P. 1447 suggests that  &quot;privacy is divisible  into three  components  (a)   repose (b)   sanctuary  and  (c)   intimate decisions of these three components  he holds, that  the last one is an eminently   more dynamic  privacy  concept   as compared to repose and sanctuary  (P. 1466)  prof.  Tribe in  his  American  constitutional  Law.  P. 921.  Stressed another  fundamental  facet  of  the right  to privacy problem.  He  wrote,  inter alia.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">  &quot;Of  all decisions a person makes  about   his or her  body the most profound  and intimate relates   to two sets  of questions   first, whether   when  and  how one&#x27;s body  is to  become  the vehicle    for  another   human  beings  cration&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">25.Applying   these definitional aids  to our discussion it cannot but be admitted that a decree  for restitution of conjugal  rights  constitutes  the grossest  from of violation  of an individual&#x27;s  right  to  privacy  applying  Prof.  Tribe&#x27;s  definition of right to privacy, it   must  be  said that the decree  for restitution of  conjugal  rights    denies  the woman her free  choice  whether   when and  how her  body is to become  the vehicle  for the  procreation  of another  human   being  applying  parker&#x27;s  defintion, it  must be said  that a decree for  restitution of conjugal  rights    deprives  a woman   of control  over  her choice as to when  and by whom the various  parts  of her body  should be allowed to be sensed.  Applying  the tests  of gaiety and Bostwick,  it  must  be said,  that the  woman loses   her control  over her most intimate decisions clearly, therefore, the right  to privacy  guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_61\">Art. 21</a>  of our  Constitution is flagrantly  violated  by  a decree of restitution of  conjugal  rights.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">26.  A  few   decided  American  cases  have also taken  the same view  of the constitutional right  to privacy  in that country.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">  27.  The observations of Justice Mc  reynolds in Meyer v. Nebraska,  (1923)  67 L Ed  1042 highlight   certain    facets  of  this  right  to privacy.  There the  learned  Judge  observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">  &quot;Without  doubt, it denotes  not merely  freedom  from   bodily   restraint  but  also  the right   of any individual  to contract, to engage  in any of the common  occupations of life, to acquire useful  knowledge to marry establish   a home and bring  up children to worship   God   according  to the dictates of  his own  conscience, and  generally  to enjoy  those privileges   long recognised at common  law  as   essential  to the orderly  pursuit of  happiness  by free  men.............  ..............  ..............   The established   doctrine   is  that  this  liberty  may not  be interfered  with   under   the guise   of protecting   the public  interest, by  legislative    action   which is  arbitrary or  without   reasonable  relation  to some  purpose  within the competency  of the  state to effect&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">In  Griswold v. Connecticut, (1965)  14  L Ed 2d  510  Mr.  Justice  Douglas, while   invalidating  a connecticut  statute  which made the use of contraceptives a criminal    offence, wrote  for  the Court that  &quot;this   law,  however   operates  directly   on an intimate relation  of husband  and  wife and  their  physician&#x27;s  role  in one aspect ot that relation......&quot;,  implying   that the right  to privacy   encompasses  within  itself    intimate relationships    such as those  between husband  and wife about  the use of  contraceptives.  Of   course, the question  from where  this  right  to privacy   should  be derived  gave  rise to different  answers  in that case.  Mr. Justice  Douglas in Griswold  v. Connecticut,   (1965-14 L ed  2d 510)  has found  penumbral  areas  of specific  guarantees  in the bill  of Rights  as  providing   the basis  for the  right   of  privacy  .  But  Mr.  Justice  Goldberg  wrote, in that case  highlighting in the process the theoretical  confusions in the stitution that the right  of marital privacy   falls   within the category  right  to privacy  Griswold&#x27;s   case is in   authority for  the   proposition     that the   reproductive choice  to beget  and bear  a child  does not  belong   to the state   and that belongs   to an individual.  In  jane  Roe.  V.  Henry   wade,  (1973)  35 L Ed  2d  147  Mr.  Justice   Blackmun  for hte Court   observed   that the earlier   decisions of the american  Supreme Court held that only  personal  rights   that can be  deemed  fundamental&quot;   or implicit  in the concept  of  ordered liberty&quot;......... are   included  in this guarantee of personal  privacy   they  also  make  it clear that  the right has some extension   to activities  relating to marriage.........procreation,  contraception,  family  relationships, and  child  rearing   and education.........&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">  &quot;Yet   the marital  couple  is not an independent  entity  with a mind    and heart   of its    own but an  association of two  inviduduals each with  a  separate intellectual  and emotional   make up.  If  the   right of privacy   means  anything, it is   the right  of the INDIVIDUAL , married    or single,  to be free  from unwanted   Government  intructing    a person as the  decision  whether   to bear  or beget  a  child&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">This is a clear recognition   of the legal  position that  right  to privacy  belongs  to a person   as an individual    and is not lost by marital  association.  In  planned   parenthood   of Missouri v. Danforth,   (1976-49  L ed 2d  788)  the Court reiterated  the position    taken   by  the  American   Supreme Court  in Eisenstadt v. Barid   (1972)  405 US   438)  (supra) that  the  right    to privacy   belongs to each one of the  married   couple    separately   and is not lost by reason of their    marriage.  The    Court   observed,  invalidating a statutory   condition, that the husband&#x27;s  consent is  necessary  for termination  of pregnancy,  &quot;We  cannot  hold  that  the  state   has  constitutional   authority to give   a spouse    unilaterally  the ability   to prohibit  a wife from   terminating her pregnancy&#x27;.  The Court  further   observed  that &quot;Inasmuch  as it is the woman  who physically  bears  the child   and   who is  the  more  directly  and immediately    affected  by the  pregnancy,  as between the two, the  balance weight in her  favour&quot;.  Earlier in skinner v. Oklahoma, (1941-86  L  Ed  1655)  the American Supreme Court characterised the right  to reproduce  as one of the  basic  civil   rights  of man.  In  the same  case Justice  Jakson  spoke  of the state interference with reproductive   decisions   as  involving  dignity  and personality.  See aslo  the decisions in Loving  v. Virginia, (1967-18 L Ed  2d 1010) and Zablocki v. Redhall, (1978) 54 L ed 2d  618).\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">28.  The above cases of the American Supreme Court clearly establish  the  proposition that  the reproductive  choice  is fundamental to an individual&#x27;s   right  to privacy.  They  uphold   the individual&#x27;s  reproductive    autonomy  against the state   intrusion  and forbid  the  state from   usurping  that right  without  overwhelming  social   justification.  That this   right belongs even to a married woman  is  clear from justice  Brennan&#x27;s  opinion  quoted  above.  A wife  who is  keeping  away  from her husband, because   of permanent or even temporary   estrangement   cannot be forced,  without  violating her right  to privacy to bear   a child  by her  husband.  During   a time  when she is probably   contemplating an action for divorce, the  use and enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_62\">section 9</a> of the Act against the estranged  wife can irretrievably  alter  her position   by  bringing about  forcible  conception   permanently  ruining   her mind   body  and life and everything   connected with it.  During  a moment&#x27;s  duration  the  entire  life-style   would be altered  and  would even  be destroyed  without  her    consent.  If that  situation made possible   by this    matrimonial remedy  is not to be a violation of individual   dignity and right to privacy guaranteed by our Constitution and more  particularly Art 21,  it is not conceivable  what else  could be a violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a> of our  Constitution.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">29.  Examining the validity of<a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_64\"> S. 9</a> of the Act in  the light  of the above  discussion, it should be held, that a Court decree  enforcing  restitution of conjugal  right  constitutes  the  starkest  form  of Government  invasion  of personal  identity  and individual&#x27;s  zone  of  intimate  decisions.  The  victim is stripped of its  control  over the various   parts of its  body    subjected  to the humiliating sexual   molestation accompanied by a  forcible loss of the precious  right  to decide    when if at all  her  body  should be allowed  to be used to give  birth  to another   human  being.  Clearly the victim  loses  its  autonomy  of control  over  intimacies  of personal  identity.  Above  all,  the  decree for restitution of conjugal   rights  makes  the unwilling victim&#x27;s  body a  soulless and a  joyless vehicle  for bringing into  existence another  human being.  In other  words,  pregnancy  would  be foisted on her   by  the  state and  against her will.  There can therefore  be little  doubt  that  such  a law  violates  the right to privacy  and human  dignity  guaranteed by and contained  in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article   21</a>  of our  Constitution.  It is of constitutional significance  to note  that the ancient Hindu  society  and its culture   never approved such a  forcible marital  intercourse.  Our  ancient law-givers refused  to recognize   any state interests  in forcing unwilling sexual   cohabitationbetween  the husband  and wife  although they  held   the duty of the  wife to  surrender to the  husband almost absolute.  Recently  the British  law commission  headed by Mr.  Justice  scarman also found  no superior state interests  implicated in retaining this  remedy   on the British   statute  Book.  It is  wholly  with out any  social  purpose.  State coercion  of  this   nature   can neither  prolong nor preserve the voluntary  union  of husband and wife  in matrimony.   Neither  state coercion cna soften  the  ruffled  fellings  nor clear the misunderstandings    between the  parties.   Force can only bebet  force as action  can only produce   counter-actions   the  only usefulness  in  obtaining a decree  for restitution  of conjugal  rights   consists   in providing  evidence for subsequent    action  for divorce. But   this  usefulness of the remedy  which can be  obtained only at enormous   expense to human   dignity cannot be  counted as outweighing the interests in upholding  the  right to privacy   It is  only after   considering   the various   factors   that hte  scarman  commission  recommended  for the  abolition   of this     matrimonial  remedy    in england   and the British  parliament  enacted a law  abolishing it.  It is  therefore legitimate  to conclude  that there are no  overwhelming   state  interests  that  would  justify  the sacrificing of the individual&#x27;s  precious  constitutional right  to privacy.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">30.  Duncan Derrett in his  &quot;modern  Hindu Law&quot;  para  306  however, while   approving the abolition of  this  remedy  in England  advocated for  somewhat  strange  reasons  the continuance  of this  remedy  in India.  He  wrote  that&quot;...............  The  practical   utility  of the remedy  is   little  in contemporary  England&quot;.  He  however says,  that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">  &quot;In  India, where spouses  separate  at times  due to misunderstandings,  failure   of mutual   communication, or the  intrigues  of relatives, the  remedy  of restitution is still  of of considerable value  especially  when coupled  with the right under section 491  of hte criminal  procedure  code  to  recover    (under certain circumstances0  custody  of  a  minor   bride,  and in the  light   of the rule  that where restitution  has been ordered a decree for separate maintenance cannot  without   proof  of new facts, issue  in favour of  the  respondent&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">With respect I am  unable  to agree with this recommendation  Firstly  Derrett  did not  examine  the matter  from the constitutional point  of view  of   right  to  privacy   guaranteed  by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Art.  21</a>  of  the  Constitution.  Restitution   of conjugal  rights  is  an  instance of punishing  a criminal without  a victim.  Secondly   his  remedy  of restitution  of conjugal    rights  is not  only   execussive  but is  also  inappropriate.  As  Telugu   proverb says, it is  like   setting   fire  to a house  to burn   it so  is not the appropriate   way to  bring  about  reconciliation  between the estranged wife and  husband .  the  observations   of Justice  Blackmun  in the  above  planned  parenthood&#x27;s   case, (1976-49  L Ed  2d  788)  are  worthy  of  note  in this  connection.  He  observed:\n</p>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">&quot;But  it is   difficult to   believe  that the goal  of  fostering mutuality  and trust  in a marriage  and of strengthening  the  marital  relationship  and the marriage    institution, will be acheived by giving  the husband a veto  power   exercisable  for  any reason   whatsoever or for no reason at all.  Even  if the  state had the  ability  to delegate to the husband  a power   it itself   could not exercise,  it is  not at all   likely   could not exercise, it is  not at all  likely    that such action   would  further as the district  Court majority   phrased  it the  interest of the state in  protecting   the mutuality   of decisions vital  to the   marriage  reltionship.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">I  therfore  hold  that  there are no  overwhelming   state  interests to justify  the  subordination  of the valuable  right  to privacy  to any  state interests. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">31.  On the  basis of my  findings  that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_67\">section 9</a> of the Hindu  Marriage  Act  providing for the  remedy   of  restitution  of conjugal   rights  violates   the right  to  privacy  guaranteed   by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">art. 21</a>  of the  Constitution, I wil   have  to hold  that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_69\">section 9</a> of the Hindu   Marriage Act is constitutionally  void.  Any  statutory  provision  that abridges  any  of the rights   guaranteed by part  III  of the contitution will  have  to  be dec;ared  void  in terms  of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 13</a>  of the  Constitution.   But the  earlier   decisions  of the Supreme Court,    particularly  the earliest in Gopalan&#x27;s  case  , had  narrowly  interpreted  the language  of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article  21</a>  of  the Constitution as merely  requiring a statutory  procedure  to be provided  or established  .  if  the validity  of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_72\">section 9</a> of the Act  were to be  considered on  that  basis, I would  have  been left   no  option   except  to   uphold    its  validity.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">32.    The  protection to life  and  personal liberty contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Art. 21</a> of our Constitution is confined  by Gopalan&#x27;s    interpretation  only to  the  executive  action   taken    without  the  backing  of  a supporting    statutory   law  providing   for   procedure.  In other   words    the  efficacy  of that Article  as a fundamental  right is    almost  denuded  becaus e  taking   of  life  or personal  liberty  according    to  the  procedure  established by a  legislative  enactment   is rendered by  that interpretation    constitutionally  unobjection-able under  that   Article.    Thus   interpreted, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21</a>  offers no protection against  legislative  action.   The  cook  of  Bishop  of Rochester could still  be boiled to death, because  the parliament  ordained  that Given  that meaning, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Article  21</a>  would have been left  with no  constitutional  mission  to subserve,  because    a constitutional limitation   imposed  in the  form of a fundamental is needed  not  against the  arbitrary   exercise   of  legislative   power.   Under  our  system of  jurisprudence, where   the executive   would   be ineffective to  deprive     any person    of  his life    or personal  liberty  except   under the authority   of legislative   sanction   even  in  the   absence   of a fundamental right.  A fundamental right which  mainly    operates  against  an executive  action  would be purposeless. Yet  this is clearly  the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">Art. 21</a>  that commended  itself   to Gopalan&#x27;s  case .  Added to  that is  the rule  laid  down   by Gopalan&#x27;s    case  to the effect    that  each  fundamental right  in Part  III of  the Constitution is a constitutional island  to itself.  According  to  this  interpretation,  the state action, in order to be  valid,  need  not  pass the test  of cumulative  prohibition  contained in the relevant  fundamental rights.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">33.  In both  these  aspects  the rule in Gopalan&#x27;s  case  was found  to be  unsatisfactory  almost  from its inception.  These  rules  are  therefore  considerably  modified  by  the  later   decisions of hte Supreme Court in  such as those rendered   in the Banks   Nationalisation case,    and maneka   Gandhi&#x27;s   case,  .  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_10\">In  sunil  <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_77\">Batra  v.

Following  the reasonaing adopted  in the above  mithu&#x27;s  case, <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_103\">section 9</a> of  the  Hindu  marriage Act,  should be declared as unconstitutional  for  the  reason that the  remedy  of  restitution of conjugal  rights  provided  for by  that section  is a savage   and  barbarous  remedy, violating  the  right  to  privacy   and human  dignity guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 21</a> of our  Constitution.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">37.   The constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_105\">section 9</a> of hte Act when examined on the touch-stone  of equal  protection of laws  also  leads to  a conclusion  of its invldity.  This is  so because  of two  reasons.   Firstly, <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_106\">section 9</a> of the Act does not  satisfy the traditional classification test.  Secondly  it fails    to pass the test  of minimum  rationality  required  of any  state  Law.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">38.   Of  course  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_107\">section 9</a> of  the  Act does not in form  offend  the classification  test.  It makes  no discrimination between a husband  and  wife.  On the  other hand,  by making  the remedy  of restitution of  conjugal  rights   equally  available both  to  wife and husband, it  apparently   satisfies the equality test.  But  th requirements of equal protection of laws  contained   in  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_108\">Article  14</a>  of  the  Constitution  are not met with that apparent though  majestic   equality  at which anatole France mocked.  Our  Supreme Court declared that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">  &quot;Bare equality of treatment regardless  of  the inequality of realities   is neither justice   nor homage  to the constitutional  principle&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">(See M. Match  works  v. Asst. Collector  ).\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">The  question  is  how  this remedy  works  in life  terms  In our   social reality,  this matrimonial remedy   is found  used  almost  exclusively by  the  husband   and  is rarely  resorted to by  the   wife.  A passage in Gupte&#x27;s  Hindu law  in Brilish India&#x27; page 929 (second edition)  attests to this   fact.  The  learned  author   recorded   that although  the rights  and duties  which marriage  creates  may be enforced by either spouse against  the other and not  exclusively  by  the   husband  agianst the  wife; a suit  for   restitution  by   the wife  is rare&quot;.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">The reason for  this  mainly lies in the fact of hte differences    beween  the man and the woman  .  by enforcing  a decree for restitution   of conjugal  rights   the life  pattern  of the wife is  likely  to be altered irretrievable   whereas the husband&#x27;s  can remain  almost as  it was  before  this is so because it is the wife  who  has to beget  and bear a child.  This  practical  but  the inevitable  consequence of the enforcement of this remedy  cripples  the wife&#x27;s   future   plans  of life  and prevents  her  from  using  that self-destructive   remedy.  Thus   the use  of remedy  of restitution   of conjugal   rights  in  reality  becomes   partial   and one-sided  and available  only to the husband.  The  pledge  of  equal  protection  of laws   is thus inherently  incapable   of being   fulfilled by this   matrimonial remedy  in our   Hindu  society.  As a result  this  remedy  words  in practice  only as an engine of oppression to be  operated by the husband for  the  benefit  of the husband against the wife.  By treating  the wife and the husband  who are  inherently  unequal  as equals, <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_109\">section 9</a> of  the Act offends the rule  of equal  protection of laws.  For  that  reason  the  formal  equality  that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_110\">section  9</a> of  the Act  ensures  cannot be   accepted  as constitutional.  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 9</a> of the Act should therefore  be struck  down  as violative  of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">39.  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_113\">Section  9</a> of the Act has also to be examined  fo rits  constitutional validity from the point  of view  of the test of  minimum   rationality.  The American constitutional writes  and Court  decisions on the equality clause  of  the  American 14th Amendment recognize  the inadequacies of the mere  classification theory  of minimum  rationality not merely as an additional test  to the above  theory  of classification but even as basic  to the whole  of the 14th  Amendment.  Writing for a division  Bench  of this   Court in A. Laxmana  Murthy v. State (aIR  1980 Andh pra 293 at 298) I  expressed  our  view  of inadequacies  of the theory  of classification in these words:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">  &#x27;Hitler&#x27;s  classification of all jews  into a separate  category  for purposes  of butchering  them and Nazalities&#x27; classification of all landlords  into a separate  category  for purpose of exterminating  them cannot, therefore be faulted  on this theory  of equal  protection clause&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327287\" id=\"span_20\">Our Supreme Court had accepted the theory  of minimum rationality in <a href=\"/doc/1327287/\" id=\"a_114\">E.P.
