State of Kerala1 is,\n\nthe jurisdictional limit of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">Right to Information Act</a> (&quot;the Act&quot;) vis-\n\na-vis a private entity has, yet again, fallen for consideration. Given\n\nthe Apex Court&#x27;s definitive pronouncement, the State Information\n\nCommission (`the Commission&#x27;), the respondent, seems to have\n\ngiven up its claim that a co-operative society is a public authority.\n\nInstead, it now claims that an applicant can have information from a\n\nco-operative society through a public authority who can access it\n\nunder any other law as has been defined under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">         2. In this rash of writ petitions, the party-respondents, in\n\none group, as applicants, have straightaway applied to the\n\n1(2013)16 SCC 82\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">conn.cases                      2</span>\n\nco-operative societies concerned seeking certain information; in the\n\nother group, the applicants have applied to the departmental\n\nauthorities; that is, the Co-operative Department, for information on\n\nthe premise that the said authorities could summon the records and\n\nprovide information to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">      3. Leaving aside the minor factual discrepancies, I reckon the\n\ncore issue in all the writ petitions is a pure question of law: do the\n\nco-operative societies fall within the jurisdictional limits of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">Right\n\nto Information Act</a> (&#x27;the Act&#x27;) directly or indirectly--that is, at least,\n\nthrough the process of an official gathering information and then\n\nproviding it to the applicants? So, I have decided to dispose of all the\n\nwrit petitions through a common judgment. For convenience sake, I\n\ntake the facts and documents in W.P.(C)No. 17553/2014 as the basis\n\nfor discussion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">         4. The second respondent, a person unconnected with the\n\nsociety, in May 2012, requested the petitioner society to provide to\n\nhim details about an account maintained by the society&#x27;s one of the\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">conn.cases                     3</span>\n\nmembers; he wanted the account details from 10.07.2008 to\n\n22.11.2010, and the information included details of the amounts\n\ndeposited and withdrawn by the account-holder during that period.\n\nThe society&#x27;s Information Officer declined to part with any\n\ninformation. The refusal was on two grounds: (i) that the petitioner\n\nsociety is not a public authority as has been defined under the Act;\n\nand (ii) that the information sought by the second respondent\n\npertains to an account-holder with whom the society has a fiduciary\n\nrelationship, an obligation not to divulge account information without\n\nhis consent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">         5. Aggrieved, the second respondent filed Exhibit P3 appeal\n\nbefore the State Information Commission, the first respondent. It\n\nseems, however, absent any appellate mechanism in the petitioner\n\nsociety, the second respondent filed the appeal directly before the\n\nCommission, which is otherwise the second appellate authority. After\n\nreceiving Exhibit P3 appeal, the Commission, through Exhibit P4\n\nproceedings, directed the society to provide the information sought\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">conn.cases                     4</span>\n\nby the second respondent. This time, it is the society&#x27;s turn to be\n\naggrieved. It has, therefore, filed this writ petition seeking a\n\ndeclaration that it does not come within the purview of the Act; that\n\nthe Commission has no power, authority, or jurisdiction to issue\n\nexhibit P4 directive. And Exhibit P4, so be quashed.\n\nSubmissions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Petitioners&#x27;:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">         6. Sri P. C. Sasidharan, the learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nSociety, has submitted that the Society has over seven thousand\n\nmembers with a paid-up share capital of about Rupees five crores.\n\nAccording to him, the B-Class shares owned by the Government in\n\nthe Society are very negligible to bracket the society as an entity\n\nowned or financed by the Government. Laying specific emphasis on\n\nthe definition of `public authority&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act, the\n\nlearned counsel would strenuously contend that the petitioner\n\nsociety does not even remotely answer the description. During his\n\nsubmissions, the learned counsel has laid specific emphasis on\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">conn.cases                      5</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">         7. After acknowledging that the society does grant loans in\n\ntune with the Government policies, the learned counsel would further\n\ncontend that the Society&#x27;s activities in compliance with the\n\nGovernment policies per se do not make the Society a government\n\nentity. Nor does the government have an all-pervasive control over\n\nthe society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">         8. In the alternative, the learned counsel has also submitted\n\nthat the information sought by the second respondent concerns the\n\nbanking transactions involving a third-party&#x27;s sensitive financial\n\ndealings. According to him, the Society has a fiduciary obligation to\n\nprotect the account holder&#x27;s interest, including the secrecy of his\n\nfinancial transactions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">         9.  In further elaboration of his submissions, the learned\n\ncounsel has submitted that a society is an association of persons and\n\nis thus accessible only to those members, but not to the public at\n\nlarge. Drawing my attention to <a href=\"/doc/163787556/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 243-ZO</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia (inserted through 97th amendment), Sri P.C.Sasidharan has\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">conn.cases                      6</span>\n\nasserted that the State Government can make a law to ensure\n\ntransparent administration, but it has so far not come out with any\n\nlegislation in that regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">         10. With specific reference to Exhibit P4 communication by\n\nthe first respondent, Sri Sasidharan has contended that it is entirely\n\nfallacious of the first respondent to assume that he could summon all\n\nand sundry information from the Society under the pretext that an\n\nofficial could access any information of the Society.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">         11. Sri Sasidharan&#x27;s primary contention is that the society is\n\nan autonomous entity administered by its managing committee and\n\nanswerable to its general-body. He has further submitted that the\n\ninformation that could be sought by the Co-operative Department, an\n\norgan of the Government, is very limited. In this regard, the learned\n\ncounsel has referred to <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">63</a>, <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">65</a>, <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">66</a> and <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_11\">66A</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">         12. Heavily relying on Thalappalam (supra), the learned\n\ncounsel has submitted that the Apex Court&#x27;s judgment is exhaustive\n\nand nothing further remains to be agitated or adjudicated upon. In\n\nessence, Sri Sasidharan has submitted that what cannot be accessed\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">conn.cases                      7</span>\n\ndirectly cannot be accessed indirectly, either.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">         13. Eventually, addressing the dichotomy of privacy and\n\ntransparency, Sri Sasidharan has drawn my attention to Rules 24 and\n\n25 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Rules: he contends that the\n\ninformation about an account maintained by a third party cannot be\n\ndivulged. It is also, according to him, evident from <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8(j)</a> of the\n\nAct, even if it were to be assumed that the Act had any remote\n\napplication to the Society. The learned counsel for the petitioners in\n\nthe other writ petitions have advanced arguments, more or less, on\n\nthe same lines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Information Commission:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         14. Sri M.Ajay, the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nCommission, on the other hand, to begin with, referred to <a href=\"/doc/277989/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2</a>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(h) of the Act to underline the expansive meaning of the expression\n\n&#x27;information&#x27;. According to him, because a citizen can access\n\ninformation either directly or indirectly, i.e. through a Government\n\nofficial statutorily empowered to access the society&#x27;s information, the\n\ndichotomy of private and public entities is redundant.\n\f\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">WPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">conn.cases                      8</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"408851\" id=\"span_8\">15. Laying a frontal stress on the fact that the right to\n\ninformation is a facet of fundamental rights enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_14\">Article\n\n19</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, Sri Ajay has\n\nsubmitted that transparency is the order of the day and the\n\nConstitutional Courts have time and time again emphasised the\n\ncitizen&#x27;s right to access information. To support his submissions, he\n\nhas placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/408851/\" id=\"a_16\">Daman Singh v. State of Punjab2</a> and\n\nWorkmen of FCI v. FCI3.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">         16. Trying to demonstrate the principle of privacy, Sri Ajay\n\nhas submitted that the Preamble to the Act is eloquent about the\n\nscope and ambit of the enactment. In this regard, he has submitted\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 4(b)</a> of the Act specifies that even the salary of an\n\nemployee cannot be regarded as any sensitive financial information\n\nvis-`-vis a third-party. According to him, had <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 4(b)</a> been\n\nbrought to the notice of the Apex Court, the judgment in\n\nThalappalam (supra) would have been different.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">         17. Sri Ajay has further drawn my attention to <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(f)</a> of\n\n2 AIR 1985 SC 973\n3 AIR 1985 SC 670\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">conn.cases                               9</span>\n\nthe Act to contend that information means any material in any form.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1309014\" id=\"span_10\">In this regard, he has placed reliance on Thalappalam Service Co-\n\noperative Bank Ltd. v. Union of India4and Mulloor Rural Co-operative\n\nSociety Ltd., <a href=\"/doc/1309014/\" id=\"a_20\">Trivandrum v. State of Kerala</a> &amp; others5.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1309014\" id=\"span_11\">18. The learned Standing Counsel has repeatedly stressed\n\nthat this Court may not arrogate to itself the powers of the first\n\nrespondent, who has eventually to decide the jurisdictional issues\n\ninvolving the petitioner society. According to him, in almost all the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1309014/\" id=\"a_21\">judgments <a href=\"/doc/1309014/\" id=\"a_22\">referred to above</a></a>, this Court has readily acknowledged\n\nthe power of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. Any decision by\n\nthis Court on jurisdiction would curtail the powers of not only the\n\nfirst respondent but also the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, who\n\nought to be allowed to exercise his powers as the situation demands.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">          19. As to the Government&#x27;s putative pervasive control,\n\nSri Ajay would contend that the Central Government Agencies like\n\nNABARD, Insurance Agents, and Income Tax authority have been\n\nstatutorily empowered to seek information from any Society. It is\n\n4 2009 (2) KLT 507 (para 10) = 2009(3) KHC 01 (DB)\n5 AIR 2012 Ker.124\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">conn.cases                     10</span>\n\nbesides the powers exercised by the Registrar of Co-operative\n\nSocieties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">         20. Eventually drawing my attention to the objects and\n\nreasons of the Act, Sri Ajay has stressed that the legislative purpose\n\nis noble and laudable. The very enactment is path-breaking, having\n\nthe   sole  objective   of   bringing   about   transparency     in  the\n\nadministration. According to him, any restrictive interpretation of the\n\nAct would stultify the statute and frustrate the legislative purpose.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">         21. When queried about the binding nature of Thalappalam,\n\nSri Ajay has submitted that the judgment has not particularly\n\naddressed the alternative aspect: the scope of departmental\n\nauthority or Governmental agency accessing information through a\n\nprovision of any other enactment and thereafter providing that\n\ninformation to the applicant. Finally, Sri Ajay urges this Court to\n\ndismiss the writ petitions, leaving it open for the first respondent to\n\ndecide whether the Society falls within the purview of the Act and\n\nwhether it must part with the information asked for.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">         22. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">conn.cases                    11</span>\n\nlearned Standing Counsel, apart from perusing the record.\n\nIssue:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">         23. The Co-operative societies, not supported by the\n\nGovernment, assert that they are not &quot;public authorities&quot; and, so,\n\nthey are beyond the jurisdictional limits of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_23\">Right to Information\n\nAct</a>; certain third parties, unconnected to the societies, seek\n\ninformation insisting that the societies are bound by the Act; the\n\nInformation Commission endorses the third-party view. The issue,\n\nbroadly having already been decided by the Supreme Court in\n\nThalappalam, the question is whether the cooperative societies are\n\nliable to provide information under either the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_24\">Right to Information\n\nAct</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_25\">Kerala Cooperative Societies Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">Discussion:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">         24. Given the fervent, insistent argument advanced by the\n\nlearned Standing Counsel for the respondent Commission, I may\n\naddress the propriety--or even the necessity--of interpreting a\n\nstatutory provision keeping in mind the statutory objective: its aims\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">conn.cases                     12</span>\n\nand objectives, so to say.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"847341\" id=\"span_15\">25.     Indeed, the expressions in a statute need to be\n\ninterpreted and understood ordinarily in a sense &quot;in which they best\n\nharmonize with the object of the statue,&quot; and which effectuate the\n\nobjective of the Legislature. This approach is more pronounced when\n\nthe legislative expressions yield more than one meaning or suggest\n\nambiguity, for as per the rule in Heydon&#x27;s case6, the court will prefer\n\nan interpretation that &quot;suppresses the mischief and advances the\n\nremedy.&quot; But in <a href=\"/doc/847341/\" id=\"a_26\">CIT v. Budhraja and Company7</a>, the Apex Court has\n\ncautioned that the object-oriented approach cannot be carried to the\n\nextent of its doing violence to the plain language used. It is nothing\n\nbut rewriting the section or substituting words used by the\n\nLegislature. In other words, the assumed spirit of the legislation or\n\nthe statute&#x27;s laudable objective cannot alter the letter of law; it only\n\nextricates statutory expressions stuck in the semantic crevices, not\n\nthe ones clearly on display.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">     26. Purposive construction follows literal construction, but not\n\n6 (1584)3 Co.Rep.7a\n7 AIR 1993 SC 2529\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">conn.cases                      13</span>\n\nthe other way round. Only when the literal construction leads to\n\nabsurdity or renders the statute unworkable, do we resort to\n\npurposive interpretation. Cardozo, J, in United States v. Great\n\nNorthern Rly8 pithily points out, &quot;We have not traveled, in our search\n\nfor the meaning of the lawmakers, beyond the borders of the\n\nstatute.&quot; According to Scalia &amp; Garner, words are given meaning by\n\ntheir context, and context includes the purpose of the text. They\n\nadvocate that &quot;the resolution of an ambiguity or vagueness that\n\nachieves a statute&#x27;s purpose should be favoured over the resolution\n\nthat frustrates its purpose.&quot; But, textualists as they are, the learned\n\nauthors insist on four limitations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        (1)The purpose must be derived from the text, not from\n            extrinsic sources such as the legislative history or an\n            assumption about the legal drafter&#x27;s desires;\n\n        (2)The purpose must be defined precisely, and not in a\n            fashion that smuggles in the answer to the question before\n            the decision-maker.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        (3) The purpose is to be described as concretely as possible,\n            not abstractly.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        (4) Except in the rare case of an obvious scrivener&#x27;s error,\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">8 287 U.S.144, 154 (1932)\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">conn.cases                       14</span>\n\n              purpose--even purpose as most narrowly defined--cannot\n              be used to contradict text or to supplement it.

If the provision is\n\nunambiguous and if from that provision, the legislative intent is clear,\n\nwe need not call into aid the other rules of construction of statutes.\n\nThe other rules of construction of statutes are called into aid only\n\nwhen the legislative intention is not clear.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"829090\" id=\"span_19\">This proposition, oft-\n\nrepeated, has been quoted with approval, for instance, in <a href=\"/doc/829090/\" id=\"a_28\">B.\n\nPremanand v.

Before we examine Thalappalam&#x27;s ratio, we may, in brief,\n\nrefer to the citations relied on by the learned Standing Counsel for\n\nthe Information Commission. To begin with, Daman Singh concerns\n\ncompulsory amalgamation of Co-operative Societies. It emphasizes\n\nthe corporate character of a cooperative society. It holds, among\n\nother things, that &quot;from the inception are governed by statute. They\n\nare created by statute, so there can be no objection to statutory\n\ninterference with their composition on the ground of contravention of\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">conn.cases                     18</span>\n\nthe individual right of freedom of association.&quot; In Food Corporation\n\nof India, the Supreme Court holds that workmen&#x27;s conditions of\n\nservice cannot be changed without notice to the workmen likely to\n\nbe affected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">      35. In Mulloor a Full Bench of this Court has held that even if a\n\nCo-operative Societies by itself does not answer the description of\n\n&quot;public authority&quot;, the statutory authorities under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_37\">Kerala\n\nCo-operative Societies Act</a>, being public authorities within meaning of\n\nClause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 2(h)</a>, are bound to furnish information. Since\n\nthe Apex Court overturned Mulloor in Thalappalam, the Commission&#x27;s\n\nreliance on it counts for nothing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">Thalappalam--The Ratio:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">      36. In Thalappalam the Apex Court posed unto itself this\n\nquestion: does the Co-operative Society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_39\">Kerala\n\nCo-operative Societies Act, 1969</a>, fall within the definition of &quot;public\n\nauthority&quot; under section (h) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_40\">Right to Information Act</a>?\n\nContingent on the answer to the above question is this supplemental\n\nquestion: is the co-operative society bound to provide information\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">conn.cases                     19</span>\n\nsought by a citizen under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_41\">Right to Information Act</a>?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"627585\" id=\"span_25\">37. On the issue whether a co-operative society is a `public\n\nauthority&#x27;, earlier co-ordinate Benches of this Court took conflicting\n\nviews. This decisional cleavage compelled the court to have the\n\nmatter referred to a Full Bench, which in Mulloor Rural Co-operative\n\nSociety Ltd. answered the question in the affirmative. The\n\neponymous bank took the matter to the Apex Court. Thalappalam of\n\nthe Apex Court acknowledges that the societies are subject to the\n\ncontrol of the statutory authorities like Registrar, Joint Registrar, the\n\nGovernment, and so forth. But it cannot be said that the State\n\nexercises any direct or indirect control over the affairs of the society\n\nin a deep and pervasive manner. Supervisory or general regulation\n\nof the co-operative societies--the body corporates--under the\n\nstatute does not render the society&#x27;s activities so regulated as to\n\nsubject themselves to the State&#x27;s control (see <a href=\"/doc/627585/\" id=\"a_42\">S.S.Rana v Registrar,\n\nCo-operative Societies</a> [(2006) 11 SCC 634]. It is nobody&#x27;s case, I\n\nmay state, that the society has been constituted under a <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_43\">Special Act</a>.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">      38.   As to the expression &quot;public authority&quot;, defined under\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">conn.cases                          20</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_44\">section 2(h)</a> of the Right to Information Act, we may revisit it for it is\n\nthe pivot of a provision. It reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     &quot;public authority&quot; means any authority or body or institution of self-\n     government established or constituted,--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      (a) by or under the Constitution;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     (b) by any other law made by Parliament;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     (c) by any other law made by State Legislature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     (d) by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government,\n     and includes any --\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     (i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     (ii) non-Government Organisation substantially financed, directly or\n     indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">     39.    As seen from the definition, an authority, or body, or\n\ninstitution of self-government established or constituted by any law\n\nmade by the State legislature can as well be treated as a &quot;public\n\nauthority&quot;. But the co-operative societies now before this Court do\n\nnot fit into any of the above definitional parameters.                In a\n\nconspectus, I may observe that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_45\">Right to Information Act</a>\n\nencompasses the legal entities owned, controlled, or substantially\n\nfinanced directly or indirectly, by the Government. It also applies to\n\na non-Governmental organization supported by the Government. The\n\nSocieties here are neither.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">WPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">conn.cases                      21</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">     40.  In paragraph-34 of the judgment, Thalappalam observes\n\nthat mere &quot;supervision&quot; or &quot;regulation&quot; as such by a statute or\n\notherwise of an entity would not make that entity a &quot;public\n\nauthority&quot;   within the meaning of 2(h)(d)(i) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_46\">RTI Act</a>.\n\nThalappalam in paragraph-38 of the judgment has also addressed\n\nthe issue whether Government subsidies, grants, exemptions,\n\nprivileges, and so forth have any impact in determining whether a\n\nsociety is a &quot;public authority&quot;. Their Lordships have held that any of\n\nthose financial measures cannot amount to funding by the\n\nGovernment to a substantial extent unless the record shows that the\n\nfunding was so substantial that the entity `practically&#x27; runs on such\n\nfunding. In other words, but for such funding, it would struggle or\n\neven cease to exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">     41. The State may also float, according to Thalappalam, many\n\nschemes for the betterment and welfare of the co-operative sector,\n\nbut those facilities or assistance cannot be termed as &quot;substantially\n\nfinanced&quot; by the State Government, to bring the entity into the fold\n\nof &quot;public authority&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act.\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">conn.cases                       22</span>\n\nAccessing Information Through Officials:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">      42.     In para 47 of the judgment, Thalappalam tellingly\n\nobserves that citizens&#x27; right to get information is statutorily\n\nrecognized by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_48\">RTI Act</a>. But, at the same time, limitations are also\n\nspelled out in the Act itself, as are discernible from the Preamble and\n\nother provisions of the Act. Citizens do have a right to get\n\ninformation, but they can have access only to the information &quot;held&quot;\n\nby or is under the &quot;control&quot; of public authorities. If the information is\n\nnot statutorily accessible by a public authority, as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n\n2(h)</a> of the Act, evidently, that information is not under the &quot;control\n\nof the public authority&quot;. Resultantly, it is impossible for the citizens to\n\naccess the information, not under the public authority&#x27;s control.\n\nCitizens, in that event, can always claim a right to privacy; a citizen&#x27;s\n\nright to access information should be respected, so also a citizen&#x27;s\n\nright to privacy. Thalappalam has also underlined the exceptions\n\ncarved out under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act to hammer home the\n\nprinciple that privacy has not been done away with by the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">      43. Granted that a cooperative society is not a public authority,\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">conn.cases                     23</span>\n\nthe next issue clamouring for an answer is whether a public authority\n\nhas the right of access to information about a particular third-party\n\nsociety in terms of any other law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">Co-operative Society - Governmental Interaction:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">      44. Foremost, a society is a corporate persona, having an\n\nindependent existence--it is autonomous. True, the statute compels\n\na co-operative society from its registration to its possible dissolution\n\nto interact with Government and be bound by its directives. A co-\n\noperative society needs to apply to the Registrar under <a href=\"/doc/161338265/\" id=\"a_51\">section 6</a> of\n\nthe Kerala Co-operative Society Act (&quot;the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_52\">Societies Act</a>&quot;) to have its\n\nregistration. <a href=\"/doc/39470973/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 63</a> of the Societies Act empowers the\n\nGovernment to audit the co-operative societies; Section 65\n\ndelineates the powers of the Registrar to enquire into the affairs of a\n\nsociety; Section 66 deals with supervision and inspection; and\n\nSection 66A, a residuary provision, deals with powers of the\n\nRegistrar to give direction. But under none of the above provisions\n\ncan we conclude that the Government has any control on the\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">conn.cases                      24</span>\n\nsociety&#x27;s internal administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">       Citizen&#x27;s Access to Information through, say, the\nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">       45. On the legal concept of `right to information&#x27; vis-`-vis a\n\n`third party&#x27; in the context of <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_54\">Cooperative Societies Act</a>, the erstwhile\n\nAndhra Pradesh High Court has dealt with elaborately in Sri Bhavana\n\nRishi Co-op. v. A.P. Information Commission, Hyderabad11. The Court\n\nhas held that, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 2 (j)</a> of the Act, the information\n\nheld by or under the `control&#x27; of any public authority is the one that\n\ncan be accessed by any citizen under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_56\">RTI Act</a>. As for the\n\nexpression &#x27;control,&#x27; Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary defines it: &quot;to exercise\n\nrestraining or directing influence over; to regulate; restrain;\n\ndominate; curb; to hold from action; overpower; counteract; govern;\n\npower or authority to manage, direct superintend, restrict, regulate,\n\ngovern. Administer or oversee. The ability to exercise a restraining or\n\ndirecting influence over something.&quot; The word &#x27;control,&#x27; as defined in\n\nSTROUD&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, means: &quot;to give\n\n\n11 AIR 2010 A.P. 127\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">conn.cases                      25</span>\n\nor refuse assent to a certain proposed course.&quot; Concise Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary defines it to mean &quot;the power to influence\n\npeople&#x27;s behaviour or the course of events; the restriction of an\n\nactivity, tendency, or phenomenon.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      46. The upshot of the above lexical exposition is that\n\ninformation must be the information which a public authority by\n\nexercising his &quot;restraining power or influence over the affairs of any\n\nother body&quot; can access. Therefore, even from the perspective of the\n\nexpression &quot;right to information,&quot; as defined by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_57\">RTI Act</a>, the\n\nRegistrar of Cooperative Societies who answers the definition of\n\n&#x27;public authority&#x27; (in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 2(h)(c)</a> of the RTI Act), all such\n\ninformation held by him under his control, can be accessed by any\n\ncitizen in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 3</a> of the RTI Act. When we look at <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_60\">Section\n\n2(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_61\">2(j)</a> together with <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 3</a>, it becomes imminently clear,\n\nSri Bhavana Rishi holds, that the information that can be accessed\n\nby the citizens is the one liable to be accessed by any public\n\nauthority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">      47. In para 51, Thalappalam focuses on the Commission&#x27;s\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">conn.cases                     26</span>\n\nalternative contention: Can a citizen access information of a society\n\nthrough the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, who is a public\n\nauthority within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">      48. Given the statutory control the Registrar of Co-operative\n\nSocieties exercises on the societies, Thalappalam holds that he is\n\nbound to comply with the obligations under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_64\">RTI Act</a> and furnish\n\ninformation to a citizen. The information he is expected to provide is\n\nthe information enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 2(f)</a> of the RTI Act; it is,\n\nhowever, subject to the limitations imposed by <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 8</a> of the Act.\n\nThe Registrar can also, to the extent law permits, gather information\n\nfrom a Society, on which he has supervisory or administrative control\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_67\">Cooperative Societies Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      49. Thalappalam eventually holds that the Registrar need not\n\ndisclose any information if that information falls within the sweep of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. Only the information a Registrar of\n\nCooperative Societies can legitimately have access to from a society\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_69\">Cooperative Societies Act</a> could be said to be the\n\ninformation &quot;held&quot; by or is under the &quot;control&quot; of public authorities.\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">conn.cases                        27</span>\n\nApart from the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, there may be\n\nother public authorities who can access information from a\n\nCooperative Bank under law. In a given situation, the society will\n\nhave to part with that information. But the demand should have\n\nstatutory backing, holds Thalappalam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">       50.      <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a> enumerates the instances of an authority\n\njustifiably refusing to disclose information. Of importance for our\n\ndiscussion is clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 8</a>, which reads:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      (j) information which relates to personal information the\n      disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or\n      interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the\n      privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information\n      Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate\n      authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public\n      interest justifies the disclosure of such information: Provided that\n      the information which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a\n      State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">       51. Indeed, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 8</a> begins with a non-obstante clause; the\n\nsection, therefore, overrides other provisions of the Act if there is\n\nany conflict. Thalappalam quotes with approval Girish Ramchandra\n\nDeshpande v. Central Information Commissioner12: if there is no\n\n\n12 (2013) 1 SCC 212\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">conn.cases                     28</span>\n\nbona fide public interest in a person&#x27;s seeking information, disclosing\n\nthat information will unwarrantedly invade the privacy of the person\n\nwhose information is sought. In that eventuality, the public authority\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">--here the Registrar--can refuse the person&#x27;s request, even withhold\n\nthe information. Further, if the authority finds that information\n\nsought can be provided in the larger public interest, then the officer\n\nshould record his reasons in writing before providing the information,\n\nbecause the person from whom information is sought also has a right\n\nto privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">      52. The conclusion in Thalappalam is unmistakable and\n\nunambiguous--the Cooperative Societies registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_74\">Kerala\n\nCo-operative Societies Act</a> will not fall within the definition of &quot;public\n\nauthority&quot; as defined Under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">      53. Bound and guided by Thalappalam, this Court holds--in\n\nfact, recapitulating Thalappalam--as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">1. That a cooperative society is not a public authority under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_76\">Section\n\n2 (h)</a> of the Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">2. The Registrar or any other public authority is statutorily enjoined\n\f\nWPC Nos.21542/2010 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">conn.cases                      29</span>\n\nto comply with &quot;the obligations under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_77\">RTI Act</a> and furnish\n\ninformation to a citizen under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_78\">RTI Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">3. The information the public authority can provide to an applicant\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_79\">RTI Act</a> is the information enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 2(f)</a> of the\n\nRTI Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">4. The public authority can gather the required information from a\n\nsociety on which he has &quot;supervisory or administrative control under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_81\">Cooperative Societies Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">5. The information to be provided by the public authority must be\n\nsubject to the limitations provided under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 8</a> of the Act.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">6. The account particulars, or the financial information of an account\n\nholder, or any other information divulging of which results in an\n\nunwarranted invasion of a member/account holder&#x27;s privacy cannot\n\nbe treated as information available for dissemination under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_83\">RTI\n\nAct</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">      In the manner indicated above, the Court disposes of the writ\n\npetitions.
