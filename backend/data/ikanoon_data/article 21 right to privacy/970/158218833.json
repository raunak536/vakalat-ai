INTRODUCTION</span></span></span>\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">2.        January 4, 2019 was chosen as the World Braille Day by the United Nations\n\nto commemorate the birthday of Louis Braille and to remember him as the man who\n\ninvented the system ‘Braille’ in 1829, which is used by the visually impaired for\n\nreading and writing, till date. Louis Braille who became completely blind in both\n\neyes by the age of five, had developed this system by himself at the age of 20 inspired\n\nby the communication system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French\n\nArmy, and offered professorship at the National Institute for Blind Youth, Paris,\n\nwhere he taught history, geometry and algebra while also having an ear for music.\n\nAlmost two centuries ago from now, Louis Braille had understood that what the\n\nvisually impaired needed was not pity or sympathy but accommodation and an\n\nenabling atmosphere in which communication played an important role. In his own\n\nwords, “access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and\n\nthat is vitally important for us if we (the Blind) are not to go on being despised or\n\npatronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need\n\nto be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals and communication\n\nis the way this can be brought about.” His words are a poignant and resounding\n\nreminder of the fervent appeal of Persons with Disabilities1 to be afforded equal\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1</span>\n    For short, “PwD”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                                      6</span>\n\n\nopportunities so as to enable them to enjoy a life of dignity and progress in all\n\nspheres on par with their able-bodied counterparts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">3.    “Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes\n\namong citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law.” This\n\nprophetic dissenting opinion of Justice John Marshall Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson\n\n(1896) can well be said to capture the spirit of what we are called upon to decide\n\ntoday. To draw a parallel, the Constitution of India is blind to the differences\n\nbetween able-bodied and differently abled citizens in matters of providing equal\n\nopportunity to all citizens in all spheres of life, including employment, and envisages\n\nequality and non-discrimination. This principle is to be enforced by the\n\nConstitutional Courts, by adopting a rights-based approach, providing an enabling\n\nenvironment and atmosphere, and ensuring that PwD are provided with equal\n\nopportunities, and accommodation that they need and deserve in order to make sure\n\nthat they can lead their lives with dignity, realising their fullest potential without\n\nfacing discrimination. Holding this concept of equality and non-discrimination as\n\nthe basic foundation on which all issues arising from the cases on hand are to be\n\ndecided, we proceed further to deal with them.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                                                                    7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">II.

According to the letter petitioner, Rule 12(1)(a) of the Madhya Pradesh Rights\n\nof Persons with Disabilities Rules, 2017 framed by the Madhya Pradesh Government\n\nin exercise of power conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1185201/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 101</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_13\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> provides\n\nfor reservation in favour of blind and low vision persons. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"37929955\" id=\"span_21\">In light of the judgment in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37929955/\" id=\"a_14\">Rashmi Thakur v. High</a> Court of Madhya Pradesh and others5 and the Madhya\n\nPradesh District Court Establishment (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules\n\n2016, reservation was given to visually impaired persons. Other States, such as\n\nHaryana, Delhi, etc., also provide reservation for the same category. Hence, the\n\namendment made in Rule 6A of Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and\n\nConditions of Service) Rules, 1994, is in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_16\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_17\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India. It was also stated in the said letter petition that the Madhya\n\nPradesh High Court granted reservation for blind and low vision candidates in the\n\nJudicial service vacancies of 2021 and therefore, removing such reservation for the\n\npresent would amount to unjust discrimination between those selected in the same\n\ncategory before 2023 and those after. Stating so, the letter petitioner requested this\n\nCourt to consider the issue and protect the interests of the visually impaired\n\ncandidates.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">5</span>\n    AIR ONLINE 2018 MP 551\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                                                                                     13</span>\n\n\nSubmissions on the side of High Court of Madhya Pradesh\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">12.       It was submitted that the impugned rule viz., clause 6A of the Madhya Pradesh\n\nJudicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 deals with\n\nreservation of posts for PwD in recruitment to the post of Civil Judge (Entry Level)\n\nand the same reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          “6A. 6% posts shall be horizontally reserved, only at the time of initial recruitment of\n          persons suffering from locomotor disability including leprosy cured, dwarfism,\n          muscular dystrophy and acid attack victims, excluding cerebral palsy, as specified\n          under<a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_19\"> S.34</a> of the Rights of Persons with <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_20\">Disabilities Act, 2016</a> (49 of 2016).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                 Provided that if such reserved posts or any of them are not filled in a given\n          recruitment year due to non-availability of suitable students, such vacancy shall be\n          carried forward into the succeeding recruitment year and if no suitable candidate is\n          available, then they shall be treated as unreserved posts.”\n\n\n\nWhen the Madhya Pradesh Higher Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of\n\nService) Rules, 20176 were being framed, an opinion was sought from the then Dean,\n\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College &amp; Hospital, Jabalpur, (An\n\nAutonomous Government Medical College) District Jabalpur (M.P.) on the\n\nsuitability of PwD as stipulated in the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_21\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> for the post of District Judge\n\n(Entry Level). The Dean, vide letter no. 6417 dated 04.10.2017 opined that a person\n\nsuffering from certain disabilities, such as, being blind or having low vision,\n\ndeafness or hard of hearing, cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, specific\n\nlearning disability and mental illness and multiple disabilities under clauses (a) to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">6</span>\n    For short, “the MPHJS Rules, 2017”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                                   14</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(d) of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_22\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> cannot perform the duties of a Judge in the Higher\n\nJudicial Service. In light of the opinion given by the Dean, the provision providing\n\nfor 2% reservation to persons suffering from disabilities mentioned in Cl (a), (b), (c\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">- cerebral palsy only), (d) and (e) of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_23\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> was proposed to be\n\nremoved from the MPHJS Rules, 2017. Thereafter, the matter was referred to the\n\nCommissioner, Disabilities in terms of the second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD\n\nAct, 2016 and as per the exemption given by the State Government, Department of\n\nSocial Justice and Disabilities Welfare Department, the MPHJS Rules, 2017 were\n\npublished and made applicable with effect from 13.03.2018. Thus, there is full\n\ncompliance with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">12.1. According to the learned counsel, the terminology used in second proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 34</a> is ‘regard to the type of work carried out in any Government\n\nEstablishment’. The type of work performed by a member of the Higher Judicial\n\nService (Entry Level) is identical to that carried out by a Civil Judge (Entry Level).\n\nTherefore, it was informed orally by the State authorities that there was no necessity\n\nto obtain separate permission seeking exemption for the establishment of High\n\nCourt/District Courts as mere change in nomenclature of the post does not require\n\nseparate notification, given that the nature of work and the establishment remain the\n\nsame. In view of the said fact that an exemption has already been granted in favour\n\nof the establishment of District Judiciary by the State Government of Madhya\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                                                                      15</span>\n\n\nPradesh in terms of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016,\n\nwithout challenging the vires of the Rules, the letter petition is thus not maintainable.\n\n\n12.2. The learned counsel further submitted that the High Court in its letter dated\n\n23.02.2023 had approved the amendment to increase the reservation for PwD from\n\n4% to 6% in light of Rule 12 of the Madhya Pradesh Rights of Persons with\n\nDisability Rules, 2017 and the said amendment as approved by the State of Madhya\n\nPradesh, was published in the Government gazette on 23.06.2023.\n\n\n12.3. Thus, according to the learned counsel, there is no restriction of any nature on\n\nvisually impaired persons to participate in the recruitment examinations for judicial\n\nservice. However, the opinion of the medical expert i.e., Dean of Netaji Subhash\n\nChandra Bose Medical College &amp; Hospital, Jabalpur District, reflects that a person\n\nsuffering from the disability stated in clause (a), (b), (c - cerebral palsy only), (d)\n\nand (e) of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_28\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>, would not be able to perform the duties expected of\n\na judge, viz., going through pleadings of parties, reading case documents, recording\n\noral evidence, assessing the demeanour of witnesses, facilitating compromise\n\nbetween parties, reading judicial pronouncements, conducting court proceedings,\n\ndelivering judgments, and handling administrative responsibilities. In view of the\n\nsame, it was felt that a person with blindness or low vision, deafness and hard of\n\nhearing, autism, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, specific learning disability,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                                                   16</span>\n\n\nmental illness, multiple disabilities would not be able to fulfil the duties and\n\nresponsibilities required of a judge. Therefore, the action of the High Court is\n\npursuant to the exemption granted by the State Government, in accordance with\n\nsecond proviso to <a href=\"/doc/113792269/\" id=\"a_29\">section 34(1)</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016; and the amendment in Rule\n\n6A has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved, and is neither\n\ndiscriminatory nor arbitrary in any manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n12.4. It was submitted by the learned counsel that pursuant to the interim order of\n\nthis Court dated 21.03.2024, all visually impaired candidates, who secured the\n\nminimum qualifying marks in their respective categories at the preliminary\n\nexamination, were permitted to participate in the main examinations conducted on\n\n30.03.2024 and 31.03.2024. That apart, this Court, in its order dated 07.11.2024 in\n\nS.M.W.(C)No.2 of 2024, issued guidelines to be followed by the High Courts for the\n\nselection of candidates belonging to PwD to the District Judiciary across the country.\n\nIn compliance with the same, a proposal was placed before the Rule Making\n\nCommittee to align the MPJS Rules, 1994.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n12.5. Stating so, the learned counsel submitted that this Court may consider issuing\n\nnecessary directions to the respondents permitting individuals with low vision or\n\nvisual impairment to avail the benefits of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_30\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>, provided that a\n\nmedical assessment confirms the fact that their condition is unlikely to lead to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                                                                               17</span>\n\n\nblindness or significant vision loss within a reasonable time frame - typically 25 to\n\n30 years from the time of recruitment - so as to ensure that they can work without\n\ndifficulty throughout their tenure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n\nA.1   SUBMISSIONS OF DR.

No.110 of 1998, made several observations relating to the PwD.\n\nThus, according to the learned counsel, while right to live with dignity has been\n\nrecognized as an integral facet of the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India, non-adherence to the commitment of the State to protect the dignity of PwD\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/158734236/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016 constitutes a serious violation of\n\nFundamental Rights.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                                                                 23</span><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_37\">13.4. The learned counsel submitted that the impugned Rule i.e., clause 6A of the\n\nMadhya Pradesh Judicial Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules,\n\n1994, creates a stereotype-based classification between persons with blindness and\n\nlow vision and “persons with locomotor disability including leprosy cured,\n\ndwarfism, muscular dystrophy and acid attack victims” entitling the latter to the\n\nbenefit of reservation and not the former. Similar to the provision at issue in <a href=\"/doc/845216/\" id=\"a_48\">Anuj\n\nGarg v. Hotel Association of India7</a> which created a classification between women\n\nand men, and this Court declared the same as unconstitutional, after having pointed\n\nout that ‘the impugned legislation suffers from incurable fixations of stereotype\n\nmorality and conception of sexual role; the perspective thus arrived at is outmoded\n\nin content and shifting in means.’ Thus, according to the learned counsel, Clause\n\n6A proceeds on the stereotypical assumption that the loss of sight cannot be offset\n\nby a PwD consequently perpetuating their oppression.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n13.5. It was further submitted that the impugned rule is indicative of the ignorance\n\nto what the disabled, when provided appropriate support, could accomplish. Such\n\nignorance cannot serve as a valid legal basis for sustaining the impugned rule.\n\nMoreover, even if the argument that a blind or low vision judicial officer in the\n\nMadhya Pradesh Judiciary would be unable to effectively discharge judicial\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">7</span>\n    (2008) 3 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                                                                        24</span>\n\n\nfunctions, is accepted, the responsibility for this lies with the High Court\n\nadministration itself. Rather than outrightly excluding an entire class of citizens from\n\nthe reservation to which they are statutorily entitled, the appropriate response should\n\nhave been to identify and address the specific challenges that hinder their full\n\nparticipation. Such an approach would encourage constructive solutions to remove\n\nor mitigate these barriers, paving the way for greater inclusivity in the future. In\n\nkeeping with the shift from the medical model of disability to the social model,\n\nwhich this Court has repeatedly recognized, the focus must not be on how the\n\ndisability itself creates obstacles but rather on how the societal / institutional barriers\n\nprevent full and equal participation of PwDs and how these barriers can be\n\neffectively dismantled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"110274896\" id=\"span_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"110274896\" id=\"span_41\">13.6. The learned counsel also contended that the very same argument which is now\n\nbeing advanced by the Madhya Pradesh High Court was accepted by a Division\n\nBench of the Madras High Court in <a href=\"/doc/110274896/\" id=\"a_49\">V.

When the matter was taken\n\nup by this Court, a two-judge bench affirmed the Madras High Court’s view by\n\nholding that a judicial officer in a State has to possess reasonable faculties of hearing,\n\nsight and speech in order to hear cases and write judgments and therefore, the\n\nimpugned ceiling created a legitimate restriction.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"157396742\" id=\"span_48\">However, in the later judgment in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/157396742/\" id=\"a_53\">Vikash Kumar</a> (supra), this Court held that the ratio in Surendra Mohan was flawed\n\nas <a href=\"/doc/157396742/\" id=\"a_54\">the said judgment</a> had been delivered after India became a party to the United\n\nNations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and\n\nenacted the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_55\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>, both of which recognize the principle of Reasonable\n\nAccommodation (“RA”).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110274896\" id=\"span_49\">This <a href=\"/doc/157396742/\" id=\"a_56\">Court further held</a> that the view in <a href=\"/doc/110274896/\" id=\"a_57\">Surendra Mohan</a>\n\n(supra) had failed to consider, whether the appellant would have been able to\n\ndischarge the duties of a Civil Judge (Junior Division), after being provided the\n\nreasonable accommodation necessitated by his disability. This <a href=\"/doc/110274896/\" id=\"a_58\">Court further held</a>\n\nthat RA, by definition, has an “exhortatory dimension” and requires going the extra\n\nmile to accommodate PwDs and an institution cannot refuse to provide RA on the\n\nground that providing the same would cause avoidable complications. This Court\n\nalso held that an RA analysis required “a consideration of the specific\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                                                                    26</span>\n\n\naccommodations needed, the cost of providing them, reference to the efficacy with\n\nwhich other Judges with more than 40- 50% visual/hearing impairment in India and\n\nabroad can discharge judicial duties after being provided the necessary\n\naccommodations, amongst other factors”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175579179\" id=\"span_51\">Furthermore, in <a href=\"/doc/175579179/\" id=\"a_59\">Jeeja Ghosh and Ors. v.\n\nUnion of India and Ors.11</a>, this Court recognized the principle of reasonable\n\naccommodation as being a component of the constitutional equality guarantee.\n\nThus, according to the learned counsel, the impugned rule is violative of the principle\n\nof RA.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">\n13.7. The learned counsel also pointed out that able-bodied judges routinely resort\n\nto the support of staff members to perform their obligations effectively. This\n\nincludes court masters/stenographers, to whom judges dictate their orders and\n\njudgments. It also includes secretarial staff and judicial law clerks, who are\n\nresponsible for assisting the judge with tasks such as management of files, making\n\nsynoptic notes of the cases in that judge’s court and research assistance. At the\n\nhighest, all that can be said is that a judge with a disability will need some extra\n\nhuman support. However, that does not, ipso facto, translate into greater loss of\n\nsecrecy. Judges with disabilities must be trusted with the ability to exercise their\n\ndiscretion, to determine how they can discharge their functions in a way that helps\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">11</span>\n     (2016) 7 SCC 761\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                                                                    27</span>\n\n\npreserve secrecy. Human support, coupled with technological solutions, can\n\nfacilitate the effective participation of blind and low vision judges in our judicial\n\nsystem. Therefore, the notion that these judges cannot be effectively accommodated\n\nstems more from the mental block that this is beyond the realm of possibility than\n\nfrom the logistical challenges in getting this done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">\n13.8. Furthermore, the learned counsel submitted an interview series titled ‘It Can\n\nBe Done’ featuring 21 interviews of legal professionals with disabilities from six\n\njurisdictions, published by Rahul Bajaj, Anusha Reddy and Madhavi Singh,\n\ndiscussing RA for PwDs. Additionally, he also cited real world examples of\n\nsuccessful judges with disabilities, few of whom are as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(i) T. Chakkaravarthy from Tamil Nadu, who was appointed as III Additional\n\nDistrict Munsif in Coimbatore in the year 2009, lost his eyesight due to smallpox at\n\nage 4.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(ii) Brahmananda Sharma, who in 2013 secured rank 83 in the Rajasthan Judicial\n\nService Examinations and is presently working as a Civil Judge and Judicial\n\nMagistrate of Sarwar in the city of Ajmer District, lost his eyesight due to glaucoma\n\nat the age of 22.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(iii) Ms. Helen Keller, the deaf-blind disability rights activist, was appointed for a\n\nnine-year term as a judge of the European Court of Human Rights in 2011. Since\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                                                                        28</span>\n\n\n2020, she has held the esteemed position of an international judge at the\n\nConstitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">Despite their respective disabilities, there was no evidence to suggest that they were\n\nunable to perform their judicial duties effectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">\n13.9. By way of reply to the submissions made on the side of the High Court of\n\nMadhya Pradesh, the learned counsel submitted that the approach of the High Court\n\nin seeking the opinion of the Dean Medical College, Jabalpur, reflects a closed-\n\nminded stance and an inherent bias against individuals who are blind or have low\n\nvision, are deaf or hard of hearing, or have cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual\n\ndisabilities, specific learning disabilities, mental illness, or multiple disabilities. The\n\nlearned counsel argued that the High Court, in effect, framed a leading question to\n\nelicit a predetermined response from the Dean. Consequently, the Dean rendered his\n\nopinion in a non-speaking order, devoid of any legally tenable rationale or\n\njustification. The assumption that blindness necessarily impairs the performance of\n\njudicial duties is rooted in the outdated Medical Model of disability, which conflates\n\nimpairment with disability. While impairment pertains to a bodily or mental\n\ncondition, disability arises from the interaction of impairment with external barriers,\n\nbe they physical, socio-economic, political, or cultural. The denial or failure to\n\nprovide reasonable accommodation effectively deprives individuals of an\n\nappropriate environment, amounting to a violation of <a href=\"/doc/8778784/\" id=\"a_60\">Sections 3(2)(3)</a>, and (5) of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                                                     29</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_61\">RPwD Act</a> 2016 read with <a href=\"/doc/507956/\" id=\"a_62\">Articles 5(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_63\">2</a> of UNCRPD. Exclusion of Blind\n\nPersons from Judiciary amounts to both de jure and de facto equality as the exclusion\n\nis not in furtherance of any legitimate State interest, rather it amounts to denial of\n\nrepresentation of Blind persons in the Judiciary without following due process of\n\nLaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">\n13.10.   The learned counsel further submitted that both Rule 6 A and the exemption\n\nsought by the High Court are unconstitutional as they violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_64\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_65\">16(1)</a>\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/158734236/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 3</a> of the RPwD Act 2016. Rule 6 A is unconstitutional as it is\n\ninnocent to the principle of RA and the exemption is vitiated as the State\n\nCommissioner for Disability has mechanically adopted the opinion of the Dean,\n\nMedical College Jabalpur, which did not account for and rather overlooks the\n\ndecision of the Union Government through notification dated 04.01.2021 which\n\nidentifies ‘Posts of judges, Magistrates subordinate judiciary’ as suitable for PwD\n\nincluding Blind Persons. This said classification is not based on intelligible\n\ndifferentia and does not have any nexus with the purpose sought to be achieved by\n\nthe High Court. Besides, Rule 6 A is also in violation of International Principles\n\nand Guidelines on Access to Justice for Persons with Disabilities 2019. Para 7.1 of\n\nthese guidelines reads, “The right to equal access to justice requires that persons with\n\ndisabilities have the opportunity to participate directly in adjudicative processes and\n\nbe involved in various roles in the administration of justice on an equal basis with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                                                                     30</span>\n\n\nothers. States should ensure that persons with disabilities are able to act as judges,\n\nlawyers, prosecutors, witnesses, jurors, experts and court officials in the justice\n\nsystem without discrimination.” In this connection, para 7.2(b) also reads, “Remove\n\nall disability-related barriers, including laws, that prevent persons with disabilities\n\nfrom being judges or jurors or serving in any other justice related positions”. The\n\nlearned counsel submitted that these guidelines are in direct response to and serve as\n\na catalyst for <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 13</a> of the UNCRPD, which guarantees the right of PwDs to\n\naccess justice. The learned counsel also invited the attention of this Court to the\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 (VCLT), which has assumed the\n\nstatus of customary law thereby, restraining the State from exercising power in\n\ncontravention of its treaty obligations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">\n13.11. Finally, the learned counsel submitted that in order to foster justice for\n\nPwDs, Society must abandon negative ontology of disability. The quest for\n\nepistemology to eliminate inequality and to ameliorate the overall state of PwDs\n\nmust be driven by the virtue of respect for difference. Besides, criteria for assessment\n\nof competence should not be influenced by Ableist and paternalistic considerations.\n\nTo combat injustice and to promote inclusivity for PwDs, the idea of ‘Nothing about\n\nus without us’ has to be countenanced by assigning appropriate value to lived\n\nexperiences of PwDs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                                                                      31</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_54\">B.

This suo motu writ petition arises from a letter sent by a visually challenged\n\nlaw student to the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, complaining about lack of\n\ntransparency in Judicial Service Examinations for PwD candidates in Rajasthan.\n\nAccording to him, while the Rajasthan Public Service Commission consistently\n\nmentions reserved posts for PwD in its examination notifications as mandated by\n\nRule 10 of the Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010, the final results published by\n\nthe High Court of Rajasthan fail to reflect any such reservations. It was further stated\n\nthat the High Court of Rajasthan justifies this practice by citing ‘horizontal’\n\nreservation for PwD candidates and claiming that separate cut-offs are unnecessary.\n\nHowever, it was submitted that reservations for women, widows, divorcees among\n\nothers, which are horizontal reservations, are provided with separate cut-off marks.\n\nTherefore, the letter petitioner has requested this court to intervene in this matter and\n\nuphold justice and equality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_57\">15.   The respondents are the High Court of Rajasthan and the Government\n\nauthorities. During the pendency of the aforesaid suo motu writ petition, one Rekha\n\nSharma filed an application seeking permission of this Court to intervene in this\n\nmatter. In her affidavit, she stated that on 09.04.2024 the High Court of Rajasthan at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                                                                 32</span>\n\n\nJodhpur issued an advertisement for Civil Judge Cadre, wherein out of the total 222\n\nvacancies, 9 posts were reserved for PwBD candidates. The applicant, who has a\n\n40% permanent physical disability in her eyes, appeared in the preliminary\n\nexamination and qualified for main examination under the category of PwBD. In the\n\nmain examination, the applicant secured 109 marks out of 300, which is about 36.3%\n\nof the total marks and 40.5 marks out of 100 in Law Paper-I and II, which is about\n\n40.5%.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_59\">16.

In the case of the applicant, she had secured more than 30% marks in\n\neach Law Paper and 35% marks in aggregate in the Main Examination, however,\n\nshe was not called for the interview.

According to the appellant, he is a person with Benchmark Disability and\n\nsuffers from Thalassemia, which results in physical weakness and fatigue and\n\nrequires regular blood transfusions among other challenges. He, along with other\n\ncandidates, challenged the amendment to the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service\n\n(Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 dated 23.06.2023 as well as\n\nthe consequential advertisement dated 17.11.2023 issued by the High Court of\n\nMadhya Pradesh. The amendment proposed to substitute Rule 7, which prescribes\n\nthe eligibility criteria to appear in the preliminary examination of the Madhya\n\nPradesh Judicial Service examination i.e., in addition to basic requirements, such as\n\ncitizenship of India, L.L.B. Degree etc., a candidate must also meet the requirement\n\nof 3 years of practice at the bar or pass in all examinations in the first attempt, with\n\nan aggregate score of at least 70% in case of general and other backward class\n\ncategories and 50% in case of SC/ ST categories. Further, the advertisement dated\n\n17.11.2023 clarified that to qualify for the exemption from the 3-year practice\n\nrequirement, a candidate must have passed all examinations without appearing in a\n\nsupplementary examination or availing of the Allowed to Keep Terms (ATKT)\n\nprovision.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">\f                                                                                    34</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_62\">18.   The appellant secured an aggregate of 67% in his L.L.B. degree, but was\n\nunable to clear his first semester on the first attempt due to his disability, and as a\n\nresult of the same, he had to appear for a supplementary examination under ATKT.\n\nConsequently, the amendment rendered him ineligible to participate in the judicial\n\nservice examination. Therefore, he filed W.P.No.30465 of 2023 to set aside the said\n\namendment and advertisement, insofar as it fails to provide any relaxation of the\n\nrules for PwD candidates. The High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the\n\nappellant as well as other writ petitions, by order dated 01.04.2024 which is\n\nimpugned herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">\n\nSubmissions of the learned counsel for the appellant\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">19.   The learned counsel submitted that in order to be eligible to write the exam, a\n\ncandidate must have either completed three years of practice or obtained more than\n\n70% marks in the first attempt while doing their law course, in which case, they are\n\nexempt from the three compulsory years of practice. While this rule has been relaxed\n\nfor candidates belonging to the SC and ST Category, no such relaxation has been\n\ngiven to the persons with disabilities. Resultantly, the appellant, who obtained an\n\naggregate of 67% and suffers from 40% disability, is no longer eligible to participate\n\nin the selection process. Hence, the appellant challenged the amended rule on the\n\nground that specially-abled candidates ought to have been given relaxation.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                                                                     35</span>\n\n\nHowever, the High Court upheld the amended rule and dismissed the batch of writ\n\npetitions. In doing so, it failed to examine the amendment in the context of persons\n\nwith disabilities and treated the appellant’s challenge on par with that of fully abled\n\ncandidates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">\n19.1. According to the learned counsel, the uniform application of a cut-off rule of\n\n70% marks in the first attempt to all candidates is arbitrary and irrational. Different\n\ncolleges and universities have different marking schemes. Even the highest scoring\n\ncandidates from top law schools, such as, Faculty of Law, Delhi University and\n\nNational School of India University, Bengaluru, might not be able to meet this\n\ncriterion. Applying this criterion to all candidates including persons with disabilities\n\nis unfair and arbitrary. As far as fully abled candidates are concerned, the\n\nconsequence of not meeting this eligibility criterion is that they can acquire\n\neligibility to participate in the selection process after completing three years of\n\npractice at the bar. However, this may not be a viable option for persons with\n\ndisabilities. Most public places, including Court rooms and Court complexes are not\n\ndisabled friendly, lacking infrastructural facilities making it difficult for persons\n\nwith disabilities, particularly those with visual impairments, mobility impairments\n\nor other benchmark disabilities, to practice.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                                                                      36</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n\n19.2. It was further submitted that for the appellant, who suffers from Thalassemia,\n\npracticing in Courts would be physically strenuous and extremely challenging and\n\ntherefore both limbs of the proviso to the eligibility criteria, i.e., passing all papers\n\non the first attempt or securing an aggregate score of 70%, should not be made\n\napplicable to persons with disabilities. A physically disabled candidate may not be\n\nable to cope up with the physical levels of activity required by an advocate, such as\n\nwalking, climbing stairs, carrying heavy files etc., but may still have the mental\n\nability to perform judicial duties, which do not require the same level of physical\n\nexertion. In the circumstances, the learned counsel submitted that insisting on 3-year\n\npractice is unfair in respect of candidates with benchmark disability, who may not\n\nhave secured 70% in aggregate, or had to take a supplementary examination,\n\nespecially if the latter resulted from their disability. The proviso is therefore\n\ndiscriminatory and arbitrary as it treats the unequals equally thereby violating <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_68\">Article\n\n14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">\n19.3.

While so, this court by order dated 21.05.2024\n\nin SMW(C) No.2 of 2024, directed that if any of these 31 candidates had secured the\n\nrequisite minimum marks prescribed for reserved (SC/ST) candidates, they shall be\n\ncalled for interview, subject to the outcome of the proceedings. Accordingly, only\n\none candidate, out of 31, became eligible for the interview, in terms of the order\n\ndated 21.05.2024. The appellant did not obtain the minimum benchmark for SC/ST\n\ncategory i.e., securing 45 marks in each paper, and thus was not called for interview.\n\nHowever, this court vide order dated 28.05.2024 in SLP(C) No.12179/2024, directed\n\nthe appellant to appear for the interview for selection of Civil Judge (Jr. Division).\n\nFollowing this, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh preferred an application being\n\nI.A.No.135745 of 2024 seeking clarification of the order dated 28.05.2024 stating\n\nthat the appellant could have been permitted to participate in the interview only if he\n\nhad secured the minimum qualifying marks for reserved (SC/ST) candidates in the\n\nmain examination i.e., 45% marks in each paper; there was no specific direction in\n\nthe order dated 28.05.2024 with respect to minimum qualifying marks, except\n\nreferring to its earlier order dated 21.05.2024 passed in S.M.W.(C).No.2 of 2024,\n\nand the application is pending consideration before this court.

According to the appellant, he is a person with disability having 40%\n\npermanent low vision. It is his grievance that despite securing higher aggregate\n\nmarks (written examination and interview) than two other selected candidates in the\n\nPhysically handicapped category, the appellant was not selected for recruitment to\n\nthe post of Civil Judge, Junior Division (Entry Level) in the 2021 Examination\n\nconducted by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, since in the interview he secured\n\nslightly lower qualifying marks. According to him, the requisite relaxations as\n\nmandated under the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_71\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> were not applied, leading to the carrying\n\nforward of vacant seats for the persons with disabilities year after year, denying the\n\nappellant his rightful selection and also defeating the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_72\">RPwD Act,\n\n2016</a>. Therefore, he preferred W.P.No.11175 of 2023 assailing the final result dated\n\n18.02.2023 of the Government of Madhya Pradesh insofar as it relates to his non-\n\nselection to the vacant post under the Unreserved Category of the Physically\n\nHandicapped Quota for the post of Civil Judge, Junior Division (Entry Level).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                                                                                   40</span>\n\n\nThe High Court dismissed the said writ petition, by judgment and order dated\n\n11.01.2024 impugned herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">\n\nSubmissions of the counsel for the appellant:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">23.   The learned counsel submitted that the advertisement issued by the High\n\nCourt of Madhya Pradesh for recruitment to the post of Civil Judge, Junior Division\n\n(Entry level) provided for a 4 percent quota for PwD under <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD\n\nAct, 2016. The appellant applied for the said post and having qualified in both the\n\npreliminary and main examinations, proceeded for the interview process. However,\n\nhis name did not find place in the final result of the Notification dated 18.02.2023,\n\ndespite the availability of vacant posts under the Physically Handicapped (PH)\n\nquota. According to the learned counsel, <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016\n\nstipulates that vacant posts reserved for PwDs can be carried forward or filled by\n\ncandidates from other categories in case of backlog only when no eligible PwD\n\ncandidate is available. In the present case, the appellant secured 18.1 marks out of\n\n50 in the interview – falling short by less than 2 marks from the minimum qualifying\n\nrequirement of 20 marks (i.e., 40% of 50 marks). Therefore, it was submitted that\n\nthe appellant should have been accommodated for appointment by respondent Nos.3\n\nand 4, rather than the post being left vacant and carried forward.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                                                                     41</span>\n\n\n23.1. The learned counsel further contended that in light of <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_75\">section 34</a> of the RPwD\n\nAct, 2016, the Central Government, vide its office memorandum dated 15.01.2018\n\nissued directions for relaxation of standards of suitability in the case of PwBD\n\ncandidates. Further, clause 11 of the said Office Memorandum reinforces this by\n\nstating that there should be relaxation of standards of suitability where sufficient\n\nnumber of candidates from benchmark disabilities are not available. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178530295\" id=\"span_70\">In <a href=\"/doc/178530295/\" id=\"a_76\">Union of\n\nIndia v.

Further, this Court directed the\n\nauthorities to issue orders modifying the Office Memorandum impugned therein and\n\nthe subsequent Memorandums to compute the number of vacancies available for the\n\ndisabled persons within a stipulated time and also directed implementation of the\n\ndirections issued therein. It was further observed that non-compliance with the\n\nreservation scheme for persons with disabilities should be treated as an act of non-</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\">obedience, and the Nodal Officer of the concerned Department, Public Sector\n\nUndertaking, or Government Company is responsible for its strict implementation.\n\nIn the present case, out of 7 seats, only 2 were filled.

It\n\nwas specifically submitted that even though the appellant secured 237.85 marks\n\neligible for selection, he was not selected, rather a candidate securing 218.78 marks\n\n(bearing Roll No.1028) was selected. If the appellant is not granted the benefit of\n\nrelaxed standard, it would only be a sheer violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_77\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_78\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and would also defeat the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_80\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> as the\n\noffice memorandum was drafted only to meet the ends of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_81\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>.\n\n\n23.2. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"157396742\" id=\"span_73\">The learned counsel submitted that the impugned High Court order dated\n\n11.01.2024 ought to have been set aside for failing to consider the entitlements under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_82\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>. It was contended that the 2021 recruitment process violated\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_83\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> and did not adequately provide for persons with disabilities.\n\nThe impugned order, at paragraph 8, states that the appellant cannot avail the benefit\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_84\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> as his disability—low vision—would have no bearing on the\n\ninterview, since he was merely required to answer questions. The learned counsel\n\nrefuted this reasoning, relying on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/157396742/\" id=\"a_85\">Vikash Kumar</a> (supra), wherein this\n\nCourt held that Persons with disabilities can effectively discharge their duties if\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                                                                    43</span>\n\n\nreasonable accommodations are made for them. The said judgment further\n\nemphasized the State’s obligation to ensure their full and effective participation in\n\nsociety.

It was ultimately submitted that presently, there are 6 seats from the PH\n\ncategory that have been carried forward from the 2021 recruitment and recruitment\n\nfor the 2022 year has not been completed. In the 2022 main examination declared\n\non 10.05.2024, no eligible candidate in PH category could secure qualifying marks\n\nto appear in the interview. Thus, the unfilled PH seats for the 2022 selection and\n\nthose carried forward, will again be carried forward to the next year. Therefore, the\n\nappellant being entitled to the relaxation and fully meritorious, ought to be\n\naccommodated against these available PH seats as a Civil Judge.\n\n\n\nSubmissions of the learned counsel for High Court of Madhya Pradesh</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">24.

It was further submitted that the contention of the appellant that he is entitled\n\nto the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016 and also for relaxation in standard\n\nof suitability in terms of Clause 11 of the office memorandum dated 15.01.2018\n\nissued by DoPT, was rejected by the High Court on the ground that the appellant\n\nfailed to achieve the minimum qualifying marks in the interview; and that, he was\n\nwell aware of the criteria for the process of selection before participation and hence,\n\ncannot be permitted to challenge the same, having remained unsuccessful. It was\n\nalso submitted that fixation of minimum marks in the interview for a judicial officer\n\nhas been upheld by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/18166204/\" id=\"a_89\">Kavita Kamboj</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/3881501/\" id=\"a_90\">Abhimeet Sinha</a> (supra)\n\nand therefore, the only issue to be decided in this matter is, whether the appellant is\n\nentitled for relaxation of standards in suitability and if so, to what extent.\n\n\n24.2. Referring to <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016 and Clause 11 of DoPT\n\nCircular dated 15.01.2018, the learned counsel submitted that firstly, the Office\n\nMemorandum is applicable only qua the posts and services of the Central\n\nGovernment and thus, not applicable in the present case and secondly, what is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">\f                                                                                     46</span>\n\n\nrequired to be borne in mind is that in any selection process there may be two\n\nbenchmarks, first to become eligible for selection, and second would be a cut off\n\narrived at based on the performance of the candidates. For selection, a candidate\n\nmust not only secure the minimum marks, making him eligible for selection, but\n\nshould also be above the cut off. In the case on hand, the appellant did not secure the\n\nrequired 20 marks in the interview for becoming eligible for selection and hence, his\n\ncandidature cannot be considered for selection although he may have secured more\n\nmarks than the selected candidates in the main examinations. The learned counsel\n\nalso submitted that 1 candidate with locomotor disability and 1 candidate with low\n\nvision disability, i.e., total 2 candidates with disabilities in the unreserved category\n\nsecured more than the minimum marks in the interview and were duly selected in\n\nthe 2021 examination. Hence, the reliance placed by the appellant on <a href=\"/doc/111062124/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 34 (2)</a>\n\nof the RPwD Act, 2016 is also misplaced, inasmuch as mere availability of the\n\nappellant was not sufficient, and he was not eligible for selection, since he had not\n\nsecured the minimum marks in the interview. Since other candidates with benchmark\n\ndisabilities (including a candidate with low vision) were duly selected in the\n\nselection process, the appellant cannot claim any violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_93\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_94\">, 16</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">&amp; 21.</a>\n\nThat apart, no separate cut-off/relaxation for PwBD candidates or any other class of\n\ncandidates has been provided in the original advertisement dated 21.12.2021 or any\n\nof the circulars issued by the High Court with regard to selection procedure for Civil\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">\f                                                                                  47</span>\n\n\nJudge, Junior Division (Entry Level).

Notably, even within these guidelines, this Court did not mandate the\n\nselection committee to lay down a separate benchmark or minimum cut-off for\n\npersons with disabilities’ candidates at the interview stage.

Further, persons with disabilities’ candidates needed to secure a minimum\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">\f                                                                                       48</span>\n\n\nof 40% marks in the Preliminary Examination to qualify for the Main Examination.\n\nClause 23(ii) of the notification stated that the number of candidates admitted to the\n\nMain Examination would be fifteen times the total vacancies (category-wise),\n\nensuring that all candidates securing the same percentage as the last cut-off would\n\nbe included. Therefore, applying the same, a total number of 135 PwD candidates\n\nacross all vertical classifications ought to have been selected for the main\n\nexamination. However, only 11 PwD candidates were selected for the main\n\nexaminations. Moreover, the Respondent No.1 at the time of declaring the result vide\n\nnotice dated 15.07.2024 for the preliminary examination, failed to identify any\n\nspecific cut-off for PwD candidates, thus making it unascertainable to determine the\n\nlowest score at which a PwD candidate was declared qualified for the main\n\nexamination. In contrast, cut-offs were clearly mentioned for other horizontal\n\nreservation categories such as women, divorced candidates, and widows. The\n\npetitioners assert that the omission by Respondent No.1 has left them and other PwD\n\ncandidates without clarity regarding their selection for the Main Examination.\n\nConsequently, they have filed the present writ petitions seeking appropriate\n\ndirections to Respondent No.1 to declare the results separately for PwD candidates\n\nand additionally specify the cut-off marks for their category. They contend that this\n\nfailure violates their constitutional and statutory rights to a fair selection process and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">\f                                                                                   49</span>\n\n\ndeprives them of a legitimate opportunity to be considered for the seats reserved for\n\ntheir category in the Rajasthan Judicial Service Examination, 2024.\n\n\n\nSubmissions on the side of the Petitioners:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"99477394\" id=\"span_88\">26.   It was submitted that instead of declaring a separate cut-off for PwD\n\ncandidates, the first respondent applied the cut-off for the respective vertical\n\ncategory of each PwD candidate, essentially making PwD candidates compete with\n\nthe candidates of their respective vertical categories, thereby defeating the very\n\npurpose of reservation. In fact, one of the candidates in the PwD category scored 72\n\nmarks in the Preliminary Examination but was not allowed to participate in the Main\n\nExamination as the cut-off for his vertical category, viz., General Category was 73\n\nmarks. Such an approach is in direct violation of Rule 11(4) of the Rights of Persons\n\nwith Disabilities Rules, 2017 and Rule 5 of the Rajasthan Rights of Persons with\n\nDisabilities Rules, 2018, which categorically states that vacancies for PwD\n\ncandidates would be maintained as a separate class. Therefore, the cut-off for PwD\n\ncandidates against such “separate class” of vacancies ought to have been declared\n\nseparately. In this regard, the learned counsel drew the attention of this Court to\n\nClause 15(iii) of the Notification dated 09.04.2024 which states that selected PwD\n\ncandidates would be adjusted to their respective categories.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">\f                                                                                   50</span>\n\n\n26.1. The learned counsel further submitted that in an identical case in Writ\n\nPetition(C)No.710 of 2024 titled <a href=\"/doc/99477394/\" id=\"a_97\">‘Siddharth Sharma v. High</a> Court of Rajasthan &amp;\n\nOrs.’ this Court vide order dated 24.10.2024, allowed the petitioner therein (a blind\n\nPwD candidate) to appear in the interview round of the Rajasthan Judicial Service\n\nExamination, 2024, considering the fact that the selection process had not been\n\nundertaken properly.</span> In view of the same, in another case in Writ Petition (C) Diary\n\nNo.49998 of 2024 titled ‘Tishan Jangid v. High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan &amp;\n\nAnr.’, this Court vide interim order dated 25.10.2024, allowed the petitioner therein\n\n(suffering from 60% locomotor disability) to participate in the interview round of\n\nthe Rajasthan Judicial Service Examination, 2024. Thus, only a total of 2 candidates\n\nwho obtained interim relief from this Court, got the opportunity to appear in the\n\ninterview round and finally secured the seats against the vacancies as per the result\n\ndated 27.10.2024; and the remaining reserved seats for PwD candidates were\n\nconverted to general category seats and were filled accordingly. The said\n\nappointment was also confirmed by this Court vide final order dated 07.11.2024.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">Due to the erroneous approach of the first respondent in the selection process from\n\nthe stage of Preliminary Examination itself, sufficient and correct number of PwD\n\ncandidates could not be selected in the subsequent rounds, thereby resulting in the\n\nnon-fulfilment of the vacancies reserved for them. Consequently, individuals with\n\nvastly different abilities were compelled to compete under a single category, causing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                                                                                    51</span>\n\n\na substantial number of eligible PwD candidates to be eliminated from the selection\n\nprocess and since they were required to compete with fully-abled candidates in their\n\nrespective vertical categories, the selection process was contrary to the spirit of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_98\">Constitution and the RPwD Act, 2016</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_83\">\n\nSubmissions made by the learned counsel for Rajasthan High Court:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">27.   According to the learned counsel, the petitioners participated in the Civil\n\nJudge Cadre Direct Recruitment Examination, 2024 in pursuance of the\n\nadvertisement dated 09.04.2024 and appeared in the Preliminary Examination\n\nconducted on 23.06.2024. Since the petitioners could not secure the qualifying marks\n\nfor the main examinations, they have preferred the present writ petitions.\n\n\n27.1. Adding further, the learned counsel submitted that during the pendency of the\n\nWrit Petitions, Main examinations for the Civil Judge Cadre were conducted on\n\n31.08.2024 and 01.09.2024 and the result of the same was declared on 01.10.2024.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">Thereafter, interview was conducted between 16.10.2024 and 26.10.2024 and the\n\nmerit-wise list of 222 selected candidates was declared on 27.10.2024 with\n\ncorrigendum on 07.11.2024.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_85\">\n27.2. Continuing further, it was submitted that the reservation for PwD candidates\n\nis provided in Rule 10 of the Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010, as per which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">\f                                                                                                52</span>\n\n\nreservation of vacancies for persons with benchmark disabilities in the recruitment\n\nto the judicial service shall be in accordance with the rules of the State as amended\n\nfrom time to time. Hence, it was pointed out that the Notification dated 16.03.2024\n\nintroduced an amendment to the Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010, providing\n\nrelaxation in age and a concession of 5% in marks in favour of persons with\n\nbenchmark disabilities’ candidates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">\n27.3. It was further submitted that the issue regarding declaring separate cut-off\n\nmarks for the persons with benchmark disabilities arose in the context of recruitment\n\nto Civil Judge Cadre in the State of Rajasthan in C.A.Nos.5051/2023 and 5052/2023\n\nand this Court, vide judgment dated 21.08.2024 observed as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      “15…. The respondents therefore in the notice declaring result of Preliminary\n      Examination had rightly shown the cut off marks for all the categories except for the\n      category of persons with benchmark disabilities. The Persons with benchmark\n      disabilities for being adjusted in the category for which he or she had applied, had\n      to secure the minimum cut off marks fixed for such category under which he or she\n      had applied. Such fixation of cut off marks for other categories and non-fixation of\n      cut off marks for the category of persons with benchmark disability could neither be\n      said to be arbitrary nor violative of any of the Fundamental Rights of the appellants.”\n\n\n\nTherefore, according to the learned counsel, no relief can be granted to the\n\npetitioners in the 2024 Civil Judge Cadre recruitment process.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                                                                                    53</span>\n\n\nReply of the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_87\">28.   The learned counsel submitted that in the judgment dated 21.08.2024 rendered\n\nby this Court in Civil Appeal Nos.5051 of 2023 and 5052 of 2023, which has been\n\nrelied upon by the first respondent, it was observed that non-fixation of cut off marks\n\nfor persons with benchmark disabilities’ candidates did not amount to a violation of\n\nfundamental rights. However, it is pertinent to note that the factual matrix in the\n\naforementioned Civil Appeals was distinct, as no separate minimum qualifying\n\nmarks had been allocated for persons with benchmark disabilities’ candidates in that\n\ncase. It was also submitted that subsequent to the aforesaid judgment, a three-judge\n\nbench of this Court has passed an order dated 07.11.2024 in S.M.W.(C)No.2 of 2024\n\nlaying down general guidelines for the governance of selection of candidates to the\n\ndistrict judiciary across the country. Therefore, the learned counsel prayed for\n\nappropriate orders to be passed in these writ petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\n\nIV.

The questions that need to be addressed have been outlined in the pleadings\n\nand submissions made by the learned counsel. While discussing and analysing them,\n\nthere may be overlapping or intersectional aspects, making it rather necessary to\n\naddress all the issues collectively. However, for clarity and a structured\n\nunderstanding, conclusions will be stated issue-wise.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                                                                     54</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">\n\n\n\n\n29.1. The following issues arise in the cases on hand:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">           i.   Whether visually impaired candidates can be said to be ‘not suitable’\n\n                for judicial service?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       ii.      Whether the amendment made in Rule 6A of Madhya Pradesh Judicial\n\n                Services (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 falls foul\n\n                of the constitution?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      iii.      Whether proviso to Rule 7 of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service\n\n                (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1994 violates the\n\n                equality doctrine and the principle of reasonable accommodation?\n\n       iv.      Whether relaxation can be done in assessing the suitability of\n\n                candidates when adequate PwD candidates are not available, after\n\n                selection in their respective category?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">       v.       Whether a separate cut-off is to be maintained and selection conducted\n\n                accordingly for visually impaired candidates?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">V.    DISCUSSION &amp; ANALYSIS\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">30.   Heard the learned counsel appearing for all the parties and perused the\n\nrecords.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">\f                                                                                      55</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">31.   The present set of cases raise important issues that touch upon the umbrella\n\nof rights in respect of the differently abled persons or PwD who have been afforded\n\nspecial protection under the law. More particularly, the main question that needs to\n\nbe addressed relates to the suitability of visually impaired persons qualified with a\n\ndegree in law to be appointed as judicial officers, apart from allied issues and\n\nancillary principles as to the application of the equality doctrine read with the\n\nprinciple of reasonable accommodation as has been recognised and specifically\n\nprovided for in the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_99\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>. This Court consciously uses the word\n\n“suitability” as against “eligibility” as it is a matter of fact that once a person\n\ncompletes a degree in law and acquires the other required educational qualifications\n\nas stipulated for appointment as a judicial officer, he/she is eligible for appointment\n\nto the said post. However, what has been raised here relates to the validity of the\n\nrules that touch upon the suitability of the candidates to the said post. This in our\n\nopinion, requires a detailed discussion and finding in order that such doubts relating\n\nto suitability may not be raised in the future and the statutory rules in this regard be\n\nframed and modulated accordingly.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">32.   The crux of the issue in the cases therefore is, on the one hand, the validity of\n\nthe Rules that bar visually impaired persons from participating in the selection of\n\njudicial service both directly and indirectly, and on the other hand, the non-selection\n\nof the candidates (where they were permitted to participate) to the vacant posts under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">\f                                                                                     56</span>\n\n\nthe Unreserved Category of the Physically Handicapped Quota for the post of Civil\n\nJudge, Junior Division (Entry Level).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">A.    EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK &amp; NEED FOR\nELEVATING RIGHT AGAINST DISABILITY BASED DISCRIMINATION\nTO A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">33.   If there is one principle that forms part of the bedrock of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, it is ‘inclusivity’ on which also rests the doctrine of equality, which, apart\n\nfrom being one of the ideals set out in the preamble to our Constitution, has been\n\nspecifically stated in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_100\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_101\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_102\">16</a> under the Fundamental Rights Chapter,\n\nand forms part of the basic structure of our Constitution. Furthermore, the other\n\nprovisions of the Constitution, more importantly the golden triangle of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_103\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_104\">,\n\n19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">21</a> would take within their sweep every right that forms part of the Right to\n\nlife which certainly and most importantly includes the right to live with dignity.\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">34.   While <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution specifically bars the State from\n\ndiscriminating against any citizen of India on grounds only of religion, race, caste,\n\nsex, place of birth, or any of them, the specific ground of ‘disability’ is conspicuous\n\nby its absence. Though the anti-discrimination and non-discrimination clauses under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 15</a> were discussed at length in the Constituent Assembly, ‘disability’ as a\n\nground for non-discrimination was not included in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 15.</a> A constitutional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                                                                                      57</span>\n\n\namendment of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 15</a> to address this glaring omission has been a long-standing\n\ndemand of the disability rights movement. This demand was also affirmed by the\n\nUnited Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in its\n\nconcluding observations in 2019 while reviewing India’s compliance with the\n\nUnited Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities15. Though\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 15</a> contains a strong anti-discrimination clause, the fact that it specifies other\n\ngrounds while not mentioning ‘disability’ as a ground has remained a stumbling\n\nblock for bringing in legislation, and the first legislation in this regard was the\n\nPersons with disabilities (Equal opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full\n\nParticipation) Act, 1995. The preamble to the Act would make it clear that this Act\n\nwas passed pursuant to the Proclamation on the Full Participation and Equality of\n\nthe People with Disabilities in the Asian and Pacific Region, adopted at the Meeting\n\nto Launch the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons 1993 - 2002 convened\n\nby the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific held at Beijing on 1st\n\nto 5th December, 1992.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">35.       Thereafter, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with\n\nDisabilities was adopted in 2006 to which India is a signatory. Pursuant thereto, the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_111\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> came to be passed.

The provisions under <a href=\"/doc/66528494/\" id=\"a_115\">section 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/63122301/\" id=\"a_116\">section\n\n34</a> of the RPwD Act, 2016 would also be a clear indication that similar to the State’s\n\nobligations to provide for special protection including in the form of reservation for\n\nsocially and educationally backward classes in educational institutions as well as in\n\nemployment as stated in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_117\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_118\">16</a> of the Constitution, the State has taken\n\nup the obligation of providing similar protection including reservation in respect of\n\nPwD. In view of the same, it can now be said that it is high time that an anti-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">discrimination clause be included in the Constitution with a specific provision that\n\nthe State shall not discriminate on the grounds of mental or physical disability in\n\nline with the principles as stated in the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_119\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>. At this juncture, it is\n\nrelevant to point out that as many as 70 countries out of 189 contain ‘disability’ as\n\none of the grounds mentioned specifically in the constitutional provisions containing\n\nthe anti-discrimination clause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">36.   In this context, it is also relevant to mention that the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_120\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> today\n\nhas acquired the status of a ‘super statute’. The term ‘super statute’ was first applied\n\nin 2001 by William N. Eskridge and John A.

As a\n\nresult, such statutes have a quasi-constitutional significance that exceed its former\n\nstatus as a statute. In the words of the authors, “these super-statutes penetrate the\n\npublic normative and institutional and institutional culture”.16 Applying this test, it\n\ncan safely be said that the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_121\">RPwD Act, 2016</a> has acquired the status equal to that of a\n\n‘super-statute’ and hence, contains the ingredients of a quasi-constitutional law.\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">B.        INTERNATIONAL DISABILITY JURISPRUDENCE, DOCUMENTS\n\nAND COMMITMENT\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">37.       In international human rights law, equality is founded upon two\n\ncomplementary principles: non-discrimination and reasonable differentiation. The\n\nprinciple of non-discrimination seeks to ensure that all persons can equally enjoy\n\nand exercise all their rights and freedoms. Discrimination occurs due to arbitrary\n\ndenial of opportunities for equal participation. For example, when public facilities\n\nand services are set on standards out of the reach of PwD, it leads to exclusion and\n\ndenial of rights. Equality not only implies preventing discrimination (example, the\n\nprotection of individuals against unfavourable treatment by introducing anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws), but goes beyond in remedying discrimination against groups\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">16</span>\n     William N.

The principle of non-\n      discrimination seeks to ensure that all persons can equally enjoy and exercise all\n      their rights and freedoms. Discrimination occurs due to arbitrary denial of\n      opportunities for equal participation. For example, when public facilities and\n      services are set on standards out of the reach of persons with disabilities, it leads to\n      exclusion and denial of rights. Equality not only implies preventing discrimination\n      (example, the protection of individuals against unfavourable treatment by\n      introducing anti-discrimination laws), but goes beyond in remedying\n      discrimination against groups suffering systematic discrimination in society. In\n      concrete terms, it means embracing the notion of positive rights, affirmative action\n      and reasonable accommodation.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"157396742\" id=\"span_116\">(iii) In <a href=\"/doc/157396742/\" id=\"a_142\">Vikash Kumar</a> (supra), it has been held as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">      “35. The principle of reasonable accommodation captures the positive obligation of\n      the State and private parties to provide additional support to persons with disabilities\n      to facilitate their full and effective participation in society. The concept of reasonable\n      accommodation is developed in section (H) below. For the present, suffice it to say\n      that, for a person with disability, the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights\n      to equality, the six freedoms and the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 21</a> will ring hollow if\n      they are not given this additional support that helps make these rights real and\n      meaningful for them.

It\ntravels beyond imposing restraints on discrimination against the disabled. The law\ndoes this by imposing a positive obligation on the State to secure the realization of\nrights. It does so by mandating that the State must create conditions in which the\nbarriers posed by disability can be overcome. The creation of an appropriate\nenvironment in which the disabled can pursue the full range of entitlements which\nare encompassed within human liberty is enforceable at law. In its emphasis on\nsubstantive equality, the enactment of the legislation is a watershed event in\nproviding a legal foundation for equality of opportunity to the disabled.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">45. The principle of reasonable accommodation acknowledges that if disability as a\nsocial construct has to be remedied, conditions have to be affirmatively created for\nfacilitating the development of the disabled. Reasonable accommodation is founded\nin the norm of inclusion. Exclusion results in the negation of individual dignity and\nworth or they can choose the route of reasonable accommodation, where each\nindividuals’ dignity and worth is respected.

In response to the judgement, the Department of Disability Affairs,\n\nGovernment of India has notified guidelines for availing of scribes by all persons\n\nwith specified disabilities to appear in written examinations thereby widening the\n\nambit of its earlier guidelines issued in 2018 confining this privilege only to persons\n\nwith benchmark disabilities.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110274896\" id=\"span_133\">Very importantly, while overruling the earlier decision\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/110274896/\" id=\"a_160\">Surendra Mohan</a> (supra), this Court has held that any decision which is innocent\n\nto the principle of reasonable accommodation would amount to disability-based\n\ndiscrimination and is also in deep tension with the ideal of inclusive equality. After\n\nthe judgement which has focused on a rights-based model and rejection of the\n\nmedicalisation of the disability in order to assess the suitability and capability of\n\nPwD, the “suspicion ridden medical expertise driven model”23, is directly opposed\n\nto the principle as <a href=\"/doc/110274896/\" id=\"a_161\">laid down by</a> this court and also the spirit of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_162\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>.</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">23</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">  Sandra Fredman, “substantive Equality Revisited” Vol.14(3)., International journal of constitutional law\n(2016) 712-738\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                                                                                     78</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">42.   In the present case also, the opinion of the medical expert is driven only by\n\nclinical assessment and suspicion.

The rights-based model of disability has now become part of the national\n\nand normative structure of anti-discrimination regime of this country. The impugned\n\nrule, which is based on the medical report of a doctor, in the light of the foregoing\n\nanalysis, cannot have any place in the disability jurisprudence that is ever evolving\n\nin a country like ours. Such conclusions based merely on a clinical assessment of\n\ndisability, innocent of the principle of reasonable accommodation, cannot be said to\n\nbe a fair and proper assessment of the capability of judicial officers with disabilities\n\nwhile participating in the selection to the post of judicial officers. It is relevant to\n\npoint out here that once a person has been permitted to the degree of law course, all\n\nother opportunities, whether in the form of practice as well as appointments,\n\nassignments whether public or private, would automatically make them eligible to\n\nparticipate for selection to the same.

Here it also relevant to mention that UNCRPD Committee in\n\nits General Comment No.6 on <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 5</a>, equality and non-discrimination, has\n\ndeveloped the idea of inclusive/transformative equality. The relevant portion of the\n\ncommittee’s observation reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">      ……. “Inclusive equality corresponds to a new model of disability, the human rights\n      model of disability, which leaves a charity, welfare, and medical approaches behind\n      and is based on the assumption that disability is not primarily a medical issue.

INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">43.   In the context of the Rule viz., Proviso to Rule 7 of the Madhya Pradesh\n\nJudicial Service Rules, though it was challenged by PwD as well as able-bodied\n\npersons, it has been placed on record that the order under appeal relates to scrutiny\n\nof the said Rule only vis-a-vis the general principles of law while not examining the\n\nsame in the context of the disability jurisprudence. In the present case, the said rule\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">\f                                                                                     80</span>\n\n\nis only being dealt with in the context of the challenge made to it by PwD more\n\nparticularly, visually impaired candidates, who have qualified themselves as lawyers\n\nand are aspiring for the post of judicial officers. Therefore, the principle of indirect\n\ndiscrimination assumes significance. Briefly put, the principle of indirect\n\ndiscrimination has its basis in the fundamental principle that unequals cannot be\n\ntreated equally, and sometimes equal treatment may lead to unequal results. The\n\ncounsel for the appellants pointed out the difficulties that are practically faced by\n\nPwD, which would go to prove that the three-year practice as well as the alternative\n\nrule of securing 70% in the first attempt of the examinations, though seems fair at\n\nthe first blush, and on the face of it, is truly discriminatory in operation. At this\n\njuncture, it is pertinent to point out that the relaxation was granted to SC/ST\n\ncandidates in relation to the aggregate marks required for obtaining a law degree.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">In Col.

The moral belief which underlies Section 377 is that sexual activities which do\n          not result in procreation are against the &#x27;order of nature&#x27; and ought to be criminalized\n          Under Section 377. The intervenors submit that Section 377, criminalizes anal and\n          oral sex by heterosexual couples as well.

A distinction must be made between what I would describe as direct\n         discrimination and the concept already referred to as adverse effect discrimination in\n         connection with employment. Direct discrimination occurs in this connection where\n         an employer adopts a practice or rule which on its face discriminates on a prohibited\n         ground. For example, “No Catholics or no women or no blacks employed here.” There\n         is, of course, no disagreement in the case at bar that direct discrimination of that\n         nature would contravene the Act. On the other hand, there is the concept of adverse\n         effect discrimination. It arises where an employer for genuine business reasons adopts\n         a rule or standard which is on its face neutral, and which will apply equally to all\n         employees, but which has a discriminatory effect upon a prohibited ground on one\n         employee or group of employees in that it imposes, because of some special\n         characteristic of the employee or group, obligations, penalties, or restrictive\n         conditions not imposed on other members of the work force. For essentially the same\n         reasons that led to the conclusion that an intent to discriminate was not required as\n         an element of discrimination contravening the Code I am of the opinion that this Court\n         may consider adverse effect discrimination as described in these reasons a\n         contradiction of the terms of the Code. An employment rule honestly made for sound\n         economic or business reasons, equally applicable to all to whom it is intended to apply,\n         may yet be discriminatory if it affects a person or group of persons differently from\n         others to whom it may apply.

Thus, the principle of indirect discrimination hereinbefore applied to counter\n\ngender-based discrimination, can also be applied to the facts of the present case,\n\nwhere disabled/visually impaired legal practitioners are sought to be equated with\n\ntheir able-bodied counterparts in the matter of application of certain conditions for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">38</span>\n     (2021) 1 Madras Law Journal 466\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">\f                                                                                       92</span>\n\n\nparticipation for selection to the post of judicial officers. Applying such a test of\n\nindirect discrimination, the ease of practice as well as the securing of marks cannot\n\nbe said to be an equal condition to both classes of citizens, viz., disabled and able-\n\nbodied lawyers, given that the atmosphere in which they operate cannot be said to\n\nbe the same. This is also a perfect example of how unequals are sought to be treated\n\nequally, and that itself would be a negation of the principle of substantive equality.\n\nTherefore, it can easily be inferred that the rule relating to practice or in the\n\nalternative, to secure 70% in the first attempt in the examinations, is a case of indirect\n\ndiscrimination as the provisions are facially neutral but discriminatory in operation.\n\nIn view of the same, Rule 7 of the Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service Rules, 1994, to\n\nthe extent it prescribes the additional requirement of either a three-year practice\n\nperiod or securing an aggregate score of 70% in the first attempt, is liable to be struck\n\ndown insofar as it applies to PwD candidates. Accordingly, the impugned Rule will\n\nbe applicable to PwD candidates insofar as it prescribes the educational and other\n\nqualifications as eligibility criteria including the minimum aggregate score of 70%\n\n(with relaxation as may be determined like in the case of SC/ST candidates) but\n\nwithout the requirement of either that it should be in the first attempt or that they\n\nshould have three years’ practice. This issue stands answered in the said terms.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">\f                                                                                    93</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">G.

We reiterate that while it may be\npermissible to prescribe a reasonably lesser qualifying marks or evaluation for the\nOBCs, SCs and STs — consistent with the efficiency of administration and the nature\nof duties attaching to the office concerned — in the matter of direct recruitment, such\na course would not be permissible in the matter of promotions for the reasons recorded\nhereinabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1466728\" id=\"span_192\">832. In Balaji [1963 Supp 1 SCR 439 : AIR 1963 SC 649] and other cases, it was\nassumed that reservations are necessarily anti-meritarian. For example, in Janki\nPrasad Parimoo [(1973) 1 SCC 420 : 1973 SCC (L&amp;S) 217 : (1973) 3 SCR 236, 252]\nit was observed, “it is implicit in the idea of reservation that a less meritorious person\nbe preferred to another who is more meritorious”. To the same effect is the opinion of\nKhanna, J in Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 380 : 1976 SCC (L&amp;S) 227 : (1976) 1 SCR\n906] , though it is a minority opinion. Even Subba Rao, J who did not agree with this\nview did recognize some force in it. In his dissenting opinion in <a href=\"/doc/1466728/\" id=\"a_188\">Devadasan [T.\nDevadasan v. Union of India</a>, (1964) 4 SCR 680 : AIR 1964 SC 179 : (1965) 2 LLJ\n560] while holding that there is no conflict between <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_189\">Article 16(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 335</a>, he\ndid say, “it is inevitable in the nature of reservation that there will be a lowering of\nstandards to some extent”, but, he said, on that account the provision cannot be said\nto be bad, inasmuch as <a href=\"/doc/1466728/\" id=\"a_191\">in that case</a>, the State had, as a matter of fact, prescribed\nminimum qualifications, and only those possessing such minimum qualifications were\nappointed. This view was, however, not accepted by Krishna Iyer, J in Thomas [(1976)\n2 SCC 310, 380 : 1976 SCC (L&amp;S) 227 : (1976) 1 SCR 906] . He said : (SCC p. 366,\npara 132)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">\f                                                                                            102</span>\n\n\n“[E]fficiency means, in terms of good government, not marks in examinations only,\nbut responsible and responsive service to the people.

A similar view was expressed in Vasanth Kumar [1985 Supp SCC 714 : 1985\nSupp 1 SCR 352] by Chinnappa Reddy, J. The learned Judge said (SCC p. 739, para\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">36)\n\n“[T]he mere securing of high marks at an examination may not necessarily mark out\na good administrator. An efficient administrator, one takes it, must be one who\npossesses among other qualities the capacity to understand with sympathy and,\ntherefore, to tackle bravely the problems of a large segment of population constituting\nthe weaker sections of the people. And, who better than the ones belonging to those\nvery sections? Why not ask ourselves why 35 years after Independence, the position of\nthe Scheduled Castes, etc. has not greatly improved? Is it not a legitimate question to\nask whether things might have been different, had the District Administrators and the\nState and Central Bureaucrats been drawn in larger numbers from these classes?\nCourts are not equipped to answer these questions, but the courts may not interfere\nwith the honest endeavours of the Government to find answers and solutions. We do\nnot mean to say that efficiency in the civil service is unnecessary or that it is a myth.\nAll that we mean to say is that one need not make a fastidious fetish of it.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_158\">834. It is submitted by the learned counsel for petitioners that reservation necessarily\nmeans appointment of less meritorious persons, which in turn leads to lowering of\nefficiency of administration. The submission, therefore, is that reservation should be\nconfined to a small minority of appointments/posts, — in any event, to not more than\n30%, the figure referred to in the speech of Dr Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly.\nThe mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 335</a>, it is argued, implies that reservations should be so\noperated as not to affect the efficiency of administration. Even <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 16</a> and the\ndirective of <a href=\"/doc/352126/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 46</a>, it is said, should be read subject to the aforesaid mandate of\n<a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 335.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">835. The respondents, on the other hand, contend that the marks obtained at the\nexamination/test/interview at the stage of entry into service is not an indicium of the\ninherent merit of a candidate. They rely upon the opinion of Douglas, J in DeFunis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">\f                                                                                            103</span>\n\n\n[40 L Ed 2d 164 : 416 US 312 (1974)] where the learned Judge illustrates the said\naspect by giving the example of a candidate coming from disadvantaged sections of\nsociety and yet obtaining reasonably good scores — thus manifesting his “promise and\npotential” — vis-a-vis a candidate from a higher strata obtaining higher scores. (His\nopinion is referred to in para 716.) On account of the disadvantages suffered by them\nand the lack of opportunities, — the respondents say — members of backward classes\nof citizens may not score equally with the members of socially advanced classes at the\ninception but in course of time, they would. It would be fallacious to presume that\nnature has endowed intelligence only to the members of the forward classes. It is to be\nfound everywhere. It only requires an opportunity to prove itself. The directive in\n<a href=\"/doc/352126/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 46</a> must be understood and implemented keeping in view these aspects, say the\nrespondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">836. We do not think it necessary to express ourselves at any length on the correctness\nor otherwise of the opposing points of view <a href=\"/doc/1466728/\" id=\"a_197\">referred to above</a>. (It is, however,\nnecessary to point out that the mandate — if it can be called that — of <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 335</a> is\nto take the claims of members of SC/ST into consideration, consistent with the\nmaintenance of efficiency of administration. It would be a misreading of the article to\nsay that the mandate is maintenance of efficiency of administration.) Maybe,\nefficiency, competence and merit are not synonymous concepts; maybe, it is wrong to\ntreat merit as synonymous with efficiency in administration and that merit is but a\ncomponent of the efficiency of an administrator. Even so, the relevance and\nsignificance of merit at the stage of initial recruitment cannot be ignored. It cannot\nalso be ignored that the very idea of reservation implies selection of a less meritorious\nperson. At the same time, we recognise that this much cost has to be paid, if the\nconstitutional promise of social justice is to be redeemed. We also firmly believe that\ngiven an opportunity, members of these classes are bound to overcome their initial\ndisadvantages and would compete with — and may, in some cases, excel — members\nof open competition. It is undeniable that nature has endowed merit upon members of\nbackward classes as much as it has endowed upon members of other classes and that\nwhat is required is an opportunity to prove it. It may not, therefore, be said that\nreservations are anti-meritarian. Merit there is even among the reserved candidates\nand the small difference, that may be allowed at the stage of initial recruitment is\nbound to disappear in course of time. These members too will compete with and\nimprove their efficiency along with others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"842859\" id=\"span_195\">837. Having said this, we must append a note of clarification. In some cases arising\nunder <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 15</a>, this Court has upheld the removal of minimum qualifying marks,\nin the case of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates, in the matter of\nadmission to medical courses. For example, in <a href=\"/doc/842859/\" id=\"a_200\">State of M.P. v. Nivedita Jain</a> [(1981)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">\f                                                                                               104</span>\n\n\n      4 SCC 296: (1982) 1 SCR 759] admission to medical course was regulated by an\n      entrance test (called Pre-Medical Test). For general candidates, the minimum\n      qualifying marks were 50% in the aggregate and 33% in each subject. For Scheduled\n      Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates, however, it was 40% and 30% respectively. On\n      finding that Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates equal to the number of the\n      seats reserved for them did not qualify on the above standard, the Government did\n      away with the said minimum standard altogether. The Government&#x27;s action was\n      challenged in this Court but was upheld. Since it was a case under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 15</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_202\">Article\n      335</a> had no relevance and was not applied. But in the case of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 16</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 335</a>\n      would be relevant and any order on the lines of the order of the Government of Madhya\n      Pradesh (in Nivedita Jain [(1981) 4 SCC 296: (1982) 1 SCR 759]) would not be\n      permissible, being inconsistent with the efficiency of administration. To wit, in the\n      matter of appointment of Medical Officers, the Government or the Public Service\n      Commission cannot say that there shall be no minimum qualifying marks for\n      Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates, while prescribing a minimum for others.\n      It may be permissible for the Government to prescribe a reasonably lower standard\n      for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Backward Classes — consistent with the\n      requirements of efficiency of administration — it would not be permissible not to\n      prescribe any such minimum standard at all. While prescribing the lower minimum\n      standard for reserved category, the nature of duties attached to the post and the\n      interest of the general public should also be kept in mind.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">59.   The above judgment therefore illustrates that relaxation in marks can be given\n\nto PwD candidates and this relaxation in minimum marks does not dilute the\n\nefficiency in administration as contended by the learned counsel for the respondent.\n\nThis, coupled with Madhya Pradesh Judicial Service Rules (Recruitment and\n\nConditions of Service) Rules, 1994) [As amended up to F. No. 3106/XXI-\n\nB(One)/2023, dated 22-6-2023] which empowers the High Court with the power to\n\nrelax, may be used to arrive at a conclusion that relaxation of marks in interview is\n\npossible for PwD candidates.

In the light of the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, we hold that\n\nrelaxation of cutoff marks is permissible in respect of persons with disabilities’\n\ncandidates appearing for the judicial service examinations.\n\n\n\n63.3.      Taking note of all these aspects, we are of the opinion that maintaining\n\nand operating a separate cut-off list is mandatory for each category, which\n\naxiomatically includes PwD category as well.

Such candidates are left uninformed about the last mark\n\nscored by the qualifying candidate belonging to the particular category, to be able to\n\nget through to the next stage of selection process. In effect, it compels PwD\n\ncandidates to compete with other category candidates on unequal terms. Further,\n\nwhen the Rules <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_207\">referred to above</a>, considered the PwD as a separate category and\n\nprovided them with reservations, it is indispensable on the part of the authorities\n\nconcerned to declare separate cut-off marks for PwD category at each stage to ensure\n\nthat those similarly placed candidates are adequately represented in the service\n\nfulfilling the very purpose of reservation. The non-disclosure of cut-off marks would\n\nlead to a situation, where such candidates may not be adequately represented in the\n\njudicial service, which is against the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_208\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>.

At this juncture, this Court reiterates that for the purpose of rights and\n\nentitlements of persons with disabilities, particularly in employment, and more\n\nspecifically in respect of the issues covered in this judgment, there can be no\n\ndistinction between Persons with Disabilities (PwD) and Persons with Benchmark\n\nDisabilities (PwBD).

In this regard, the\n\nlearned counsel for the intervenor drew our attention to several visually impaired\n\nlegal experts from various branches of the profession, featured in the IDAP interview\n\nseries, ‘It Can Be Done,’ conducted by Rahul Bajaj, Anusha Reddy, and Madhavi\n\nSingh. The series aims to provide actionable insights from lawyers and judges with\n\ndisabilities on the strategies they have used to succeed, while also promoting\n\nawareness and fostering meaningful dialogue on the necessity of reasonable\n\naccommodations for PwD.

While acknowledging that reading\n\ncase materials took longer, he firmly rejected the misconception that blind\n\nindividuals are incapable of assessing critical evidence, such as charts, maps, or\n\nwitness demeanour. He argued that the belief that one must “see” a witness to assess\n\ncredibility was unfounded. Throughout his tenure, Justice Yacoob strongly\n\nadvocated for the constitutional protection of the rights of differently-abled\n\nindividuals, emphasizing the need for accessibility and equality within the justice\n\nsystem.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">(ii) Justice David S.

Rejecting the imposition of low\n\nexpectations on blind professionals, he preferred to be recognized as a “judge who\n\nhappens to be blind” rather than a “blind judge” reinforcing the principle that\n\ncompetence in the legal profession is not diminished by disability.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">\f                                                                                     113</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">(iii) David Lepofsky, a distinguished Canadian lawyer, has argued over 30 cases\n\nbefore the Supreme Court of Canada and more than 200 before the Ontario Court of\n\nAppeal.

Previously\n\nreliant on volunteers to read trial transcripts, he now accesses case materials digitally\n\nthrough screen readers and cloud-based platforms, allowing him to work from\n\nanywhere.

CONCLUSION\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">67.    The overall analysis would demonstrate that a rights-based approach\n\nnecessitates that PwDs must not face any discrimination in their pursuit of judicial\n\nservice opportunities, and instead, there must be affirmative action on behalf of the\n\nState to provide an inclusive framework. Now, it is high time that we view the right\n\nagainst disability-based discrimination, as recognized in the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_212\">RPwD Act</a> 2016, of the\n\nsame stature as a fundamental right, thereby ensuring that no candidate is denied\n\nconsideration solely on account of their disability. Further, as extensively discussed,\n\nthe principle of reasonable accommodation, as enshrined in international\n\nconventions, established jurisprudence, and the <a href=\"/doc/97660308/\" id=\"a_213\">RPwD Act, 2016</a>, mandate that\n\naccommodations be provided to PwDs as a prerequisite to assessing their eligibility.\n\nIn the light of the above, any indirect discrimination that results in the exclusion of\n\nPwDs, whether through rigid cut-offs or procedural barriers, must be interfered with\n\nin order to uphold substantive equality. The commitment to ensuring equal\n\nopportunity necessitates a structured and inclusive approach, where merit is\n\nevaluated with due regard to the reasonable accommodations required, thereby\n\nfostering judicial appointments that truly reflects the principles of fairness and\n\njustice.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">\f                                                                                      119</span><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_190\">\n\n\n\n\n67.1.
