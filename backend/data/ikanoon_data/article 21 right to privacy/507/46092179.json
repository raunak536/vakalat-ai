This case unbundle the trauma of a couple in a\n\nlive-in        relationship,              isolation      of   a   single    mother,\n\nlove of mother for her child, rights of biological\n\nfather, entangled in legal vortex.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">        2.      The couple in this revision, John and Anitha\n\n(names changed to protect their privacy) met during the\n\ntragic floods in the year 2018 happened in Kerala. They\n\nare active in NGOs.                   John is a Christian          and Anitha is\n\nHindu by their faith. Anitha is from Thrissur.                                 Soon\n\nthe couple realised that their intimacy knew no bounds\n\nto chart a new path in their life.                            They start to live\n\ntogether at Ernakulam, 65 kms away from the parental\n\nhouse of Anitha.                  Opposition came from their own kith\n\nand kin.            They waited to officially marry once their\n\n1   Norman Cousins Author of Anotomy of illness\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> R.P.(JJ).No.2/2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      -:4:-</span>\n\nparents are convinced.         But the biological instincts of the\n\ncouple could not be arrested.                 Anitha became pregnant in\n\nthe month of May 2019.           She gave birth to a baby girl on\n\n3/2/2020    in     the   Government     Hospital,        Aluva.       The     birth\n\ncertificate indicates names of father and mother of the\n\nchild.       The    entire     case     perhaps     revolves         around    the\n\nimportance of the birth certificate, to decide the outcome\n\nof this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      3.    John is an artist. He seems to have travelled to\n\nKarnataka to act in a Malayalam Film.                    He appears to have\n\nbroke the relationship with Anitha for a while or remained\n\nelusive (as narrated in the revision memorandum).                          Anxious\n\nAnitha     made     attempts    to     contact      John;      but    in      vain.\n\nIsolated, desperate and repressed Anitha had no option but\n\nto approach the Child Welfare Committee, Ernakulam, and\n\nhanded over the child to the Committee on 8/5/2020.                            She\n\nexecuted a Deed of Surrender on 8/6/2020.                     Thereafter, she\n\nconstantly kept in touch with the Committee and the Child\n\nCare Institution where the child was put up, to keep a\n\ntrack of the wellbeing of the child.                      Chat messages of\n\nAnitha with the Social Worker depicts how vulnerable it is\n\nfor   a    woman    becoming    mother        not   in    a   legally       wedded\n\nrelation.     Desperation       and      plight      of       the     motherhood\n\nreflected through the chat messages that depicts the care\n\nfor the baby from the womb of the person, Anitha.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> R.P.(JJ).No.2/2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        -:5:-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">       4.   The Committee set the law into motion.                            Deed of\n\nsurrender executed by Anitha in no uncertain terms permits\n\nthe    Committee      to    give     the     child       in        adoption.        The\n\nCommittee,      noting      that    Anitha       is     an    unmarried        mother,\n\nfollowed the procedure that delineated for surrender of the\n\nchild by an unwed mother as referable under the Adoption\n\nRegulations, 2017.              On completion of the procedure, the\n\nCommittee      declared     that     the     child      is    legally        free    for\n\nadoption in the manner contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/63786373/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 38</a> of the\n\nJuvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act,\n\n2015    (hereinafter        referred        to     as    &quot;<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_2\">JJ        Act</a>&quot;).          This\n\ndeclaration was on 17/8/2020.                    The child thereafter was\n\ngiven in adoption to a couple by the order of the Family\n\nCourt, Ernakulam, on 2/2/2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">       5.   The    petitioners          claiming      themselves        as     live-in\n\nrelationship couple approached this Court with a writ of\n\nhabeas on 10/2/2021.              Notice was issued to the State and\n\nthe    Child      Welfare       Committee.         The       learned     Government\n\nPleader and counsel appearing for the Committee submitted\n\nbefore the Court that the child had already been given in\n\nadoption.         Based    on    this    submission,          on    11/2/2021,      the\n\nCourt was of the firm opinion that a writ of habeas as such\n\nwould not lie as the proceedings concluded under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_3\">JJ Act</a>\n\nhave legal colour.              However, the Court, noting <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 102</a>\n\nof the JJ Act, suo motu converted it to a revision petition\n\nas contemplated in the aforesaid provision.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> R.P.(JJ).No.2/2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         -:6:-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      6.    Legality and propriety of the declaration under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1204664/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 38</a> of JJ Act therefore, has to be tested invoking\n\nthe revisional power of this Court in this matter.                           If this\n\nCourt      finds       the     entire        proceedings       leading       to   the\n\ndeclaration under <a href=\"/doc/1204664/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 38</a>, is held as bad, necessarily,\n\nall consequential proceedings would                    fall into ground.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">      7.    The central issue in this context perhaps is more\n\nrelated to a perplexing mind; accepting and recognising\n\nlive-in relationships.                 Did the law differentiate between\n\nunwed and legally wed couple in matters or relationships\n\nnot connected with marriage, as a social institution?                              In\n\nother words, to put it in the context of juvenile justice\n\ndoes the law differentiate unwed couple and legally wed\n\ncouple     to        recognize    biological          parents.         The     issues\n\ninvolved        in     this    matter        cannot    be   resolved          without\n\nanswering these pointed questions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      8.    We shall answer these questions when we advert to\n\nthe     procedure       required        to    be   followed       regarding       the\n\ndeclaration that the child is legally free for adoption.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      9.    <a href=\"/doc/1204664/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 38</a> of JJ Act set out different procedures\n\nfor the declaration as above.

Abandonment refers to voluntary relinquishment of\n\na known right.               Parental right is a natural as well as\n\nuniversally         recognised         legal      right.          Child       also      has   a\n\nfundamental right to preserve his identity with biological\n\nparents.          It is a necessary concomitant with right to life\n\nas protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 8</a> of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child, clearly spell out the right of identity of the\n\nchild     with      the     family.          Unlawful        interference          of    such\n\nrights       would     deny      the     right      to     life     guaranteed          under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.                           Abandonment, therefore,\n\nhas to be understood as an involuntary relinquishment or\n\ntermination of parental right.                       This enables the State to\n\nprotect the welfare of the child through the procedure laid\n\ndown under law.

As seen from the\n\nabove   provision,     only   after    it    is    established    that   the\n\nchild is either an orphan having no one to take care of or\n\nabandoned, the committee is competent to declare that the\n\nchild is legally free for adoption.

Very often a dominant group loses its\n\nprimacy over other groups in view of ever changing socio-economic scenario\n\nand the consequential vicissitudes in human relationship. Law takes its own\n\ntime to articulate such social changes through a process of amendment. That\nis why in a changing society law cannot afford to remain static. If one looks\n\nat the history of development of Hindu Law it will be clear that it was never\n\nstatic and has changed from time to time to meet the challenges of the\n\nchanging social pattern in different time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">     26. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_34\">In       <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_52\">K.S.Puttaswamy       v.

Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity\n  has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human\n  dignity is an entitlement or a constitutionally protected interest in\n  itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably\n  inter-twined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The\n  ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the\n  realization of the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader\n  meaning of which privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised\n  in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a private space.\n  Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the body and\n  mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\"> R.P.(JJ).No.2/2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                -:19:-</span>\n vital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an\n independent fundamental right. But that does not detract from the\n constitutional protection afforded to it, once the true nature of privacy\n and its relationship with those fundamental rights which are expressly\n protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected\n freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary state\n action. It prevents the state from discriminating between individuals. The\n destruction by the state of a sanctified personal space whether of the\n body or of the mind is violative of the guarantee against arbitrary state\n action. Privacy of the body entitles an individual to the integrity of the\n physical aspects of personhood. The intersection between one&#x27;s mental\n integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought, the\n freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-\n determination. When these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a\n private space which protects all those elements which are crucial to\n gender identity. The family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation\n are all integral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the privacy\n of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how freedom\n shall be exercised. An individual may perceive that the best form of\n expression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An\n artist finds reflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer\n expresses the outcome of a process of thought. A musician contemplates\n upon notes which musically lead to silence. The silence, which lies\n within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas\n or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood. The\n freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is\n entitled to decide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with\n <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a choice of preferences\n on various facets of life including what and how one will eat, the way one\n will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other matters on which\n autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within the\n privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion\n under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and\n the freedom to express or not express those choices to the world. These\n are some illustrations of the manner in which privacy facilitates freedom\n and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not\n contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been declared to be\n a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with an\n alpha suffixed right of privacy: this is not an act of judicial\n redrafting. Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the\n inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has\n recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the\n individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the\n spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of\n choice and self-determination.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> R.P.(JJ).No.2/2021</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  -:20:-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">       27.   It is for the woman to recognize and decide on\n\nrecognition of fatherhood of child.               If she chooses the\n\npreference to acknowledge the biological father                    at the\n\ntime    of   conceiving,    the   father   has    every    right    to    be\n\nrecognized     as   a   biological   father.     Woman    alone   has    the\n\nright of choice on her body and motherhood. It is                 the time\n\nwhen she exercises the option on conception that reckons -\n\na child is born to a married couple or unmarried couple.\n\nIf at the time of conception, she has not recognized the\n\nright of fatherhood, in the context of <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_58\">JJ Act</a>, a man has no\n\nright to recognize himself as the biological father, except\n\nwith her consent and; she continues to be recognized as an\n\nunwed mother for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_59\">JJ Act</a>. Decisional autonomy\n\nis the key in privacy rights.Once a woman acknowledges the\n\nbiological father that cannot be questioned to deny the\n\nright of biological father on the ground of want of legal\nmarriage. Any such denial would amounts to encroaching up\n\non her decisional autonomy and freedom to choose. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_60\">JJ Act</a>\n\nintends to exclude only such biological father, who became\n\nfather without the consent of the woman. Thus in the light\n\nof scheme of law as above there is no difficulty in holding\n\nthat a child born in a live-in relationship also has to be\n\nconstrued as a child born to a married couple.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">       28. Now, we turn to the facts of the case. The child\n\nwas born in a Government Hospital, Aluva.

Name of the child was also given in the birth\n\ncertificate.      Birth     certificate      shows      the    name       of   the\n\nfather, mother and child.            Surname of the child reflects\n\nthe name of the father.            Birth certificate is a crucial\n\ndocument for public authority to verify that the child is\n\nborn to a married couple or not. It is not the duty of the\n\nCommittee to inquire about the legal status of the marriage\n\nas they are not the competent authority to decide on such\n\nstatus.      Once it is found that the child is born to a\n\ncouple, for all practical purposes of <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_61\">JJ Act</a>, inquiry must\n\nbe initiated as though the child belonged to a married\n\ncouple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">       29.
