Dignity as a constitutional value\n      finds expression in the Preamble. The constitutional vision\n      seeks the realization of justice (social, economic and political);\n      liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship);\n      equality (as a guarantee against arbitrary treatment of\n      individuals) and fraternity (which assures a life of dignity to\n      every individual). These constitutional precepts exist in unity to\n      facilitate a humane and compassionate society. The individual\n      is the focal point of the Constitution because it is in the\n      realization of individual rights that the collective well-being of\n      the community is determined. Human dignity is an integral part\n      of the Constitution. Reflections of dignity are found in the\n      guarantee against arbitrariness (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 14</a>), the lamps of\n      freedom (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19</a>) and in the right to life and personal liberty\n      (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a>).&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">                             (D.

Mr Suhail Rashid Bhat, the petitioner and a young lawyer who\n\nappears in person, has filed this writ petition in this Court laying the\n\nchallenge to the constitutional validity of the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_38\">Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention\n\nof Beggary Act, 1960</a>, as well as the Rules being the Jammu &amp; Kashmir\n\nPrevention of Beggary Rules, 1964 on multifold submissions. In order to\n\nexplain the rights impacted by the legislation, it is submitted by Mr Bhat,\n\nthat the Constitution of India was made applicable to the State of Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir by the Constitution (Application to Jammu &amp; Kashmir) Order of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 11 of 196</span>\n 1954. All Fundamental Rights as contained in Part-III of the Constitution of\n\nIndia stood extended to the State with certain exceptions in respect of\n\npreventive detention laws and land reform legislations. In this regard, Mr\n\nBhat has also placed reliance on Section 10 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir which guarantees all rights under the Constitution of India. It is the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s submission that, therefore, a conjoint reading of the Constitution\n\n(Application to Jammu &amp; Kashmir) Order of 1954 and Section 10 of the\n\nConstitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir give a twofold protection to the citizens\n\nof India, who are also permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">11.          So far as the challenge to the statutory provisions are\n\nconcerned, Mr Bhat has vehemently urged that the very preamble of the\n\nenactment which reads as &quot;an act for preventing beggary and making\n\nbeggars good citizens&quot; presumes every beggar not to be a good citizen. The\n\nsubmission is that the expression &quot;good citizen&quot; is not defined and that the\n\nobject of the Act is not simply to criminalize the act of begging but to target\n\ngroups and communities whose pattern of life do not fit with the perception\n\nof what constitutes &quot;good citizens&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">      Mr Bhat has also urged that prevention of begging necessarily and\n\nentwins the twin intentions that &quot;nobody should beg&quot; as well as &quot;nobody\n\nshould need to beg&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"591481\" id=\"span_14\">12.          Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in the judgment reported at <a href=\"/doc/591481/\" id=\"a_39\">AIR 1960 SC 554 Hamdard Dawakhana\n\nv.

A strong challenge has been laid to the definition of &quot;begging&quot;\n\nas contained in <a href=\"/doc/40266175/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2</a> of the Act contending that the same is so broad,\n\ncovering not just a specific act or activity but an entire way of life. Mr Bhat\n\nhas referred to this legislation as being of a classist character; which\n\nenvisions public places as exclusionary and closed to those who appear poor.\n\nMr Bhat has referred to the impact of the legislation as sensitizing from the\n\npublic sphere, those &quot;who are not like us&quot; as undesirable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">                The contention is that the legislation has reserved public places\n\nfor the use of what the preamble of the statute has labelled as &quot;good\n\ncitizens&quot;. Thus, persons who are perceived as poor, the legislation has\n\nrendered the constitutional guarantee of inclusiveness as not existing.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">14.             The petitioner challenges the definition of begging as contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act also on the ground that it is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 14</a>\n\nfor the reasons and grounds which are bunched together hereafter.\n\n Submission that classification not based on intelligible differentia nor has\n              rational relation to the object of the legislation\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184660633\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327287\" id=\"span_17\">(i)      It is urged that the definition clause makes no distinction between\n\n         &quot;voluntary&quot; and &quot;involuntary&quot; begging; that it also takes in\n\n         homelessness within its ambit; fails to distinguish between those who\n\n         solicit and those who simply receive alms thereby criminalizing the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">      PIL 24/2018                                               Page 13 of 196</span>\n         behaviour of those who simply receive a charitable donation without\n\n        actively seeking it as well as those giving alms and the submission is\n\n        that the classification in the enactment is not based on any intelligible\n\n        differentia nor does it have any rational/ reasonable relation to the\n\n        object sought to be achieved by the Act. Mr Bhat has contended that\n\n        for this reason the legislation must fail the arbitrariness test as <a href=\"/doc/591481/\" id=\"a_43\">laid\n\n        down by</a> the Supreme Court in its pronouncement reported at (<a href=\"/doc/1327287/\" id=\"a_44\">1974) 4\n\n        SCC 3 E.P.

Mr Bhat has\n\n        referred to the baggage handler, gate keepers, security guards and\n\n        waiters amongst others who, apart from their salary, survive with the\n\n        tips received from customers and guests. Tips, it is urged, are akin to\n\n        &quot;alms&quot;, yet receipt of tips is not criminalized.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">(iii)   Mr Bhat has also, in the passing, assailed the legality of the statute on\n\n        the ground that it fails to take into consideration the fact that several\n\n        religions encourage receiving of alms while at the same time promote\n\n        giving of alms. The submission is that the Act fails to treat equally\n\n        those with no such religious ideology and those with the religious\n\n        obligation who request for alms and render an act of charity as illegal.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">   PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 14 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\"> (iv)   The petitioner also challenges the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/32633094/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2(a)(iii)</a>\n\n       on the ground that it denies equal treatment between the disabled and\n\n       able bodied thereby preventing the society from seeing the real heart;\n\n       a matter of significant public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">(v)    On the same ground, the petitioner has assailed the vires of <a href=\"/doc/151855279/\" id=\"a_48\">Section\n\n       2(a)(iv)</a> on the ground that it denies equal treatment between those\n\n       who have &quot;having no visible means of subsistence&quot; and &quot;wandering\n\n       about or remaining in any public place&quot; &quot;in such condition or manner\n\n       as makes it like that the person does so exists by soliciting alms&quot; and\n\n       those who have &quot;no visible means of subsistence&quot;. The submission is\n\n       that this classification is not only arbitrary but also irrational. It is also\n\n       not based on characteristics which are to be found in all the persons\n\n       grouped together and not others who are left out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">(vi)   The submission is that the attempt of the legislation is to target\n\n       shifting populations in the State whose changing movements and\n\n       patterns render them &quot;invisible&quot; to the Administration/State.

The law allows the\n\n       private organizations who solicit alms but criminalizes private\n\n       individuals from doing so which is indicative of the suggestion that\n\n       the legislation is not concerned about the harms caused by begging\n\n       but is seeking to conceal a social problem from legitimate criticism of\n\n       the government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">                Challenge on ground of vagueness of legislation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">(x)    The petitioner submits that <a href=\"/doc/53937203/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 2(a)(i)</a> incorporates the expression\n\n       &quot;under any pretence&quot; which is extremely vague and does not permit\n\n       the police to determine whether a person accused under the enactment\n\n       may be actually providing a service or whether they are begging.\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/32633094/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 2(a)(iii)</a> denies equal treatment between the disabled and the\n\n       able bodied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">(xi)   Mr Bhat, the petitioner, has placed reliance on the principles <a href=\"/doc/184660633/\" id=\"a_53\">laid\n\n       down by</a> the Supreme Court of the United States in the judgment\n\n       reported at 408 US 104 (1972) Grayned v. City of Rockford, and\n\n       drawn our attention again to the definition of begging under <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n\n       2(a)</a> of the statute.

Mr Bhat submits that no\n\n      clear guidance is given to law abiding citizens or to the authorities and\n\n      the courts and, therefore, being vague, has to be voided as being\n\n      arbitrary and unreasonable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">(xii) An important vacuum in the legislation has been highlighted before\n\n      us. It has been pointed out that the statute is so vague that it\n\n      criminalizes the act of beggary even when compelled but does not\n\n      criminalize organized/ forced beggary. Mr Bhat would urge that as a\n\n      result, one could safely conclude that a person is a &quot;good citizen&quot; if he\n\n      compels a person to beg but the victim is rendered a criminal and not\n\n      a &quot;good citizen&quot; under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">(xiii) Additionally, it is urged that criminal law requires two basic elements\n\n      of a crime; one is the actus reus i.e. the act itself and, the other is\n\n      mens rea i.e. the guilty mind. Mr Bhat would urge that while &quot;to beg&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">      is an act, however, there is a complete absence of a &quot;guilty mind&quot; in\n\n      the act of begging. Mr Bhat would contend that no person begs out of\n\n      choice or takes a conscious decision to beg but is compelled to do so\n\n      on account of circumstances driven by necessity. The criminalization\n\n      of begging is assailed on the ground that it runs contrary to the basic\n\n      theory of criminal law i.e. &quot;Actus Reus Non Facit Reum Nisi Mens Sit\n\n      Rea&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">                Violation of rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">(xiv) An important challenge has been laid by Mr Bhat on the ground that\n\n      soliciting of alms is largely a verbal request or expression which is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">  PIL 24/2018                                                   Page 17 of 196</span>\n       essentially a form of speech.

The\n\n      submission is that curtailment of such freedom of expression by\n\n      criminalization of the act or omission and imprisonment for the same,\n\n      is not a reasonable restriction and in any case is highly\n\n      disproportionate. The contention is that such criminalization runs\n\n      contrary to the express protection of freedom of speech and\n\n      expression guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India and\n\n      has to be declared as unconstitutional and accordingly struck down.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">(xv) Mr Bhat would urge that the definition as contained in <a href=\"/doc/151855279/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\n\n      2(a)(iv)</a> of the Statute and its other provisions interdicts the freedom\n\n      of a person to move freely through the territory of India.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1741605\" id=\"span_23\">Violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21\n\n(xvi)</a> Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported\n\n      at (<a href=\"/doc/1741605/\" id=\"a_60\">1980) 2 SCC 360 Jolly George Verghese v.

If the State\n\n      fails to ensure these basic rights and people are existing in complete\n\n      penury and indigency, then in such an eventuality the legislation\n\n      which criminalizes an action of a citizen to ensure his or her survival,\n\n      which is begging, is rendered violation of the right to life of an\n\n      individual under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n\n(xviii) On the issue of the impact of the legislation, it is urged that the statute\n\n      compels a person to choose between committing a crime to be\n\n      rehabilitated under the legislation or not committing the crime and\n\n      starving. The law, therefore, puts an individual into a cruel\n\n      dichotomous situation where an individual has to choose between his\n\n      right to life or to be criminal, completely against the constitutional\n\n      spirit.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">  PIL 24/2018                                                    Page 19 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_30\">Violation of due process\n\n(xix) Placing reliance on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported\n\n      at <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_67\">AIR 1978 SC 597 Maneka Gandhi v.

Per contra, appearing for the respondents, Mr Sheikh Feroz\n\nAhmad, learned Dy.AG, has heavily relied on the counter affidavit which\n\nhas been filed by the respondents. Mr Sheikh has urged that the provisions\n\nof the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Rules are not punitive as\n\nthey enable beggars to undergo a training to earn livelihood in future. It is\n\nsubmitted that restrictions which are necessary to maintain law and order in\n\nthe groups of people who are lodged in the homes are imposed which are\n\nnot violative of any fundamental or constitutional rights of the individuals\n\nwho are so lodged. It has been further explained that the preamble of the\n\nenactment explains that the law has been made to prevent begging and to\n\nmake beggars good citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">16.

We also find reference in the counter affidavit to the statement\n\non behalf of the respondents that the object of the law is to undermine acts\n\nof begging as some organized gangs are exploiting children and force\n\nthem to go for begging. Some people kidnap children and force them to go\n\nfor begging and collect huge amount of money.

Mr Sheikh has placed heavy reliance on Rule 3 of SRO 12,\n\nwhereby a person desiring to solicit or receive money/ food or gift for any\n\npurpose can apply for permission to do so and grant of a permit to the\n\nDistrict Magistrate. Mr Sheikh submits that after making such enquiry as\n\ndeemed fit, the District Magistrate would issue the permit in Form &quot;A&quot;. It\n\nhas been submitted that the District Magistrate, in the enquiry, ascertains the\n\neconomic conditions of the person and other circumstances and then issues\n\nthe permit. He further submits that once a permit is issued in Form &quot;A&quot;\n\nsuch person may solicit or receive money, food or gifts.

Both Parliament and the State\n      Legislatures can enact laws providing for offences arising out\n      of legislation falling within their legislative domains. The\n      authority to enact law, however, is subject to the validity of the\n      law being scrutinised on the touchstone of constitutional\n      safeguards. A citizen, or, as in the present case, a community of\n      citizens, having addressed a challenge to the validity of a law\n      which creates an offence, the authority to determine that\n      question is entrusted to the judicial branch in the exercise of\n      the power of judicial review. The Court will not, as it does not,\n      in the exercise of judicial review, second guess a value\n      judgment made by the legislature on the need for or the\n      efficacy of legislation. But where a law creating an offence is\n      found to be offensive to fundamental rights, such a law is not\n      immune to challenge. The constitutional authority which is\n      entrusted to the legislatures to create offences is subject to the\n      mandate of a written Constitution. Where the validity of the\n      law is called into question, judicial review will extend to\n      scrutinising whether the law is manifestly arbitrary in its\n      encroachment on fundamental liberties. If a law discriminates\n      against a group or a community of citizens by denying them full\n      and equal participation as citizens, in the rights and liberties\n      granted by the Constitution, it would be for the Court to\n      adjudicate upon validity of such a law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 26 of 196</span>\n              Thus, the power of this Court to go into the issue of\n\nconstitutionality of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_85\">Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of\n\nBeggary Act, 1960</a>, and the Rules framed thereunder cannot be doubted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">      (VI) Historical analysis and the rationale behind the legislation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">35.          The practice of giving alms to others including beggars was and\n\nis still considered a virtuous act. Traditionally, giving of &quot;bhiksha&quot; (alms) is\n\npopular in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. Buddhists valorize begging by\n\nnoble persons for the reason that it enables them to imbibe humility and\n\nempowers them to break all forms of material bondage. The Muslim religion\n\nbelieves in &quot;Zakat&quot; which means charity. In the middle ages, even in Europe\n\nand Britain, beggary was an accepted practice of providing succor to the\n\nneedy, an act considered to be at par with prayer. The focus subsequently\n\nchanged to assessments of character and of the deservedness of a beggar.\n\nSlowly this further led to a consideration of whether those not working were\n\nfraudulent and immoral. During the Victorian era beggary was considered to\n\nembody laziness and moral degeneration. It is a fact that begging is not only\n\na universal issue but is an age-old social phenomenon. However,\n\ncriminalization of begging is a development of colonial construction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_93\">36.          Beggary came to be banned by enacting laws for &quot;maintaining\n\norder&quot; since the period of Athelstan and Canute to Henry the VIII. These\n\nprohibitory laws were enacted with the intent of providing the feudal lords\n\nwith agricultural labour and compelling able-bodied people to work.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">37.          Break up of feudal estates in England led to labour shortages\n\nwhich resulted in enactment of statutes of labourers designed to stabilize the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 27 of 196</span>\n labour migration by prohibiting increases in wages and prohibiting the\n\nmovement of workers from their home areas in search of improved\n\nconditions. Later vagrancy laws were enacted which treated beggars as\n\ncriminals. These laws were based on the perception and continued in the\n\nbelief that people without stable means of support may pose a threat to the\n\nstability of the society and are likely to get involved in criminal activities.\n\nThis legislation of the 14th and 15th centuries was based on the economic\n\npurpose of retention of labour by protecting the interests of the ruling class;\n\nensuring that only the disabled had the opportunity to beg and a perception\n\nthat the legislation would keep a check on public order and crime.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_95\">             These were the reasons for enactment of the Vagrancy Act,\n\n1824 which made begging a crime in England, which is still in force.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">38.          It was in the 1920&#x27;s that begging was for the first time\n\ncriminalized in British India. This was part of the ethos in which efforts\n\nwere made to subjugate certain communities imputing criminality to them.\n\n(as the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_86\">Criminal Tribes Act, 1871</a> notified in India).

The article notes that the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_87\">Criminal Tribes Act</a> was\n\nrepealed in the 1950&#x27;s but other similar laws as the <a href=\"/doc/53980582/\" id=\"a_88\">Habitual Offenders Act</a>,\n\nthe vagrancy statutes, the Anti-Beggary laws to various sections of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_89\">IPC</a>\n\nwhich continued to exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_98\">40.          By 1947, eighteen Indian states had laws criminalizing beggary.\n\nEven in the post-colonial era, this very law came to be updated as the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_90\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a> which was extended to all Indian\n\nstates including, in 1960, to the Union Territory of Delhi.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_99\">41.

Several terminologies have been used to describe persons who\n\nbeg which includes beggars; panhandlers; mendicancy; tramps; rough\n\nsleepers and cadgers (commonly called the homeless). Beggars have also\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">  PIL 24/2018                                                   Page 29 of 196</span>\n been found to be defined as street beggars which comprises individuals\n\nincluding children, the elderly, disabled and even families making a living\n\nby begging on streets and in public spaces. Public spaces include shopping\n\nand commercial areas, religious spaces as temples, churches and mosques.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">44.          At this stage it becomes necessary to understand why do people\n\nbeg? Several discourses and discussions on the subject would show that\n\nbeggars have been considered in three distinct categories; the first being\n\nthose for whom begging is a vocation; the second comprises of those who\n\nare forced into begging; while the third consists of those who beg due to\n\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_105\">45.          Those for whom begging is a vocation have been observed to\n\nbe connected with interested and influential groups who actively engage to\n\nobtain acquittal of beggars when arrested. People who are forced into\n\nbegging is a category which includes kidnapped children; victims of force,\n\noppression and exploitation. The third category is that of those who beg due\n\nto circumstances which includes people who are weak and vulnerable and\n\nlive life on the edge, struggling for a means of livelihood.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">46.          A Single Bench decision of the High Court of Delhi reported at\n\n(2007) 137 DLT 173 Ram Lakhan v. State, considered the reasons behind\n\nbegging. Amongst the reasons enlisted, the learned Judge had observed that\n\na person may beg &quot;because he is down-right lazy and doesn&#x27;t want to work&quot;;\n\nor &quot;he may be an alcoholic or a drug-addict in the hunt for financing his next\n\ndrink or dose&quot;; or &quot;he may be at the exploitative mercy of a ring leader of a\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 30 of 196</span>\n beggary gang&quot;. It was also observed that &quot;there is also the probability that he\n\nmay be starving, homeless and helpless&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">47.           Efforts to prepare data banks of beggars have received much\n\ncriticism. In an article captioned &quot;Ostensible Poverty, Beggary and the\n\nLaw&quot; (Economic and Political Weekly November 1, 2008), Dr. Usha\n\nRamanathan while commenting on the excesses of the law and the\n\ninadequacy of preparation of a personal data bank of beggars, has observed\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      &quot;In a system where people in conditions of poverty are\n      numerous; the state system offers no social security or\n      opportunity for overcoming economic redundancy, nor does it\n      desist from implementing policies that render many\n      unemployable; where rehabilitation and training have never\n      been pursued; where the state&#x27;s willingness and capacity to aid\n      the ostensibly poor stands seriously depleted - what would a\n      roster of the ostensibly poor do?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">48.           Several authors have considered begging and homelessness\n\nsynonymously. However, it is unanimously concluded that begging and\n\nhomelessness are indicators of abject, chronic poverty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">49.           We may briefly dwell on the causes of poverty and the\n\nconditions in which the poor are compelled to survive. There is never a\n\nsingle reason leading to creation of poverty but various interlocking factors.\n\nCauses of poverty may vary according to gender, age, culture and other\n\nsocial and economic contests. As per research by Swati Chauhan, a Senior\n\nFamily Court Judge in Maharashtra (published in https://tiss.edu/vievo/\n\n6/projects/koshish-projects/publications/) even the World Bank has noted\n\nthese causes. Poverty generally implies inadequate infrastructure and\n\ninability to access basic social services of education and health. It often\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 31 of 196</span>\n includes living in areas without hygienic facilities or potable water rendering\n\npoor people much more susceptible to illness and disease resulting in high\n\nmortality rates. According to Ms Chauhan, these elements as leading to\n\npoverty are the subject matter of reports of the United Nation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">             The various perspectives of poverty thus primarily include\n\nsocial exclusion, relative deprivation and lack of capability as well as\n\ncapacity or the poor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">50.          In a Joint Report on Social Inclusion 2004, the European\n\nCommission defined a person living in poverty thus &quot;people are said to be\n\nliving in poverty if their income and resources are so inadequate as to\n\npreclude them from having a standard of living considered acceptable in the\n\nsociety in which they live. Because of their poverty they may experience\n\nmultiple disadvantages through unemployment, low income, poor housing,\n\ninadequate health care and barriers to lifelong learning, culture, sport and\n\nrecreation. They are often excluded and marginalized from participating in\n\nactivities (economic, social and cultural) that are the norm for other people,\n\nand their access to fundamental rights may be restricted&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">51.          Poverty has been measured and construed on several parameters\n\nwhich have included ability to meet minimum number of calories; minimum\n\nlevel of income to satisfy needs; deprivation of different aspects of standards\n\nof living; material and social.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">52.          In India, the practice of begging is inextricably linked to\n\npoverty. Other reasons could be unemployment; illiteracy; ignorance or the\n\npressure on public resources on account of increasing population; unfair\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 32 of 196</span>\n distribution of wealth; homelessness; problem of social structures and\n\neconomic mismanagement; lack of work opportunities; decline in public\n\nassistance; the structure and administration of Government support; lack of\n\naffordable housing; addiction disorders and mental illness.

Unlike the common perception, or for that matter, the\n\nlegislative presumption, people thus beg on the street not because they desire\n\nto do so but because of the ultimate need. The presumptions against the\n\nbeggars (of laziness etc) necessarily overlooks the fact that it is impossible\n\nfor even educated and trained people to always find employment. Begging is\n\ntheir last resort to procure subsistence, as they have no other means to\n\nsurvive. Beggary is a manifestation of the fact that the person has fallen\n\nthrough the socially created net. It is evidence of the fact that the State has\n\nfailed to ensure that all citizens have even the basic essential facilities.\n\nJudicial notice can be taken of the hard reality that the State has not been\n\nable to ensure these bare necessities of the right to life to all its citizens.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_115\">54.           Swati Chauhan, in her aforesaid research, has extensively\n\ndeveloped the &#x27;broken window theory&#x27; relating to the linkage which is\n\npresumed between beggary, homelessness and crime.

It is a\n\nnotion that is used by the authorities to exercise power over the &quot;have nots&quot;.\n\nIt enables those in power to actually use the resourceless position of the poor\n\nto further deprive them.

Commonly, begging has been defined as conduct by which a\n\nperson seeks assistance, either by asking for food, clothing, money, or,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 36 of 196</span>\n expressing need through clear form of communication which may include a\n\nsign, a donation cup or utensil or even an outstretched hand. The beggar&#x27;s\n\nsolicitations may include out pouring of their pathetic condition, showering\n\nof blessings etc., sometimes it may include social or political solicitations or\n\nexhortations. Often, without any element of a spoken word, the very\n\npresence of an impoverished person, holding out his or her hand or a utensil\n\nto receive a donation, by itself conveys a message that he is in need of\n\nsupport and assistance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">      Begging, thus, undoubtedly involves communication of some kind\n\nconveying the plight of the beggar. Such communication could be verbal or\n\nby actions. It could be even by mere physical presence, when, by his very\n\npitiable appearance, the needs of a beggar are conveyed to the viewer.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">62.          The act of begging thus entails nothing more than peaceful\n\ncommunication with strangers, verbally or non-verbally, conveying a request\n\nfor assistance. Such communicative activity is necessarily part of the\n\nvaluable right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed to all under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">63.          As noted above, the definition of begging refers to &quot;soliciting\n\nalms&quot;, exposing wounds for extorting alms, having no visible means of\n\nsubsistence. It, therefore, implies persons of financial penury begging for\n\nsustenance. In other words, persons&#x27; who survive on alms. Criminalizing\n\ntheir act of begging would thus impact their basis of their very existence,\n\nthat is to say, their constitutionally protected right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_153\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">  PIL 24/2018                                                   Page 37 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_154\"> 64.           The legislation in question has grouped together all persons\n\nwho are found or perceived to be begging or soliciting alms, whether\n\nvoluntary or involuntarily, as one composite class. Thereby it has included\n\npersons who are compelled to beg on account of extreme need and\n\ndeprivation along with those who have been compelled by organized\n\nsyndicate into begging.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">              At the same time, the legislation has drawn a distinction and\n\ncarved out a group which is permitted to beg. The rationality of these\n\nclassifications has to be tested on the ground as to whether it meets the well\n\nsettled tests laid down under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. Thus,\n\nviolation of rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nwould also require to be considered in the present consideration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">              Therefore, we are required to examine the statute and the Rules\n\nthereunder from the perspective of ensuring the guarantees under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Articles\n\n14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_103\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_104\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_157\">      (IX) Inter-relationship of the fundamental rights guaranteed under\n                      Part-III of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_158\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_159\">65.

We have extracted heretofore <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India which is recognition of the power of the State to make\n\nany law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right\n\nconferred by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>.However, <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 19(2)</a> mandates that for such\n\nrestrictions to be reasonable, they must be necessary in the interests of the\n\nsovereignty and integrity of India; the security of the State; friendly relations\n\nwith foreign states; public order, decency or morality or in relation to\n\ncontempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. Thus, the offence\n\ncreated by a law, by operation of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 19(2)</a> has to have a proximate\n\nrelationship to any of these eight subject matters as are contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_256\">Article\n\n19(2).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">79.                The Constitutional scheme which enables curtailment of\n\nfreedom of speech has been the subject matter of several judicial precedents.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_107\">In the judgment of the Supreme Court reported at <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_257\">AIR 1962 SC 305 Sakal\n\nPapers (P) Ltd. v.

Freedom of speech can be restricted only in the\n      interests of the security of the State, friendly relations with\n      foreign State, public order, decency or morality or in relation\n      to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.\n      It cannot, like the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in\n      the interest of the general public. If a law directly affecting itis\n      challenged, it is no answer that the restrictions enacted by it\n      are justifiable under clauses (3) to (6).For, the scheme of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 19</a> is to enumerate different freedoms separately and\n      then to specify the extent of restrictions to which they may be\n      subjected and the objects for securing which this could be\n      done. A citizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the\n      freedoms together and clause (1) does not prefer one freedom\n      to another. That is the plain meaning of this clause. It follows\n      from this that the State cannot make a law which directly\n      restricts one freedom even for securing the better enjoyment\n      of another freedom. All the greater reason, therefore for\n      holding that the State cannot directly restrict one freedom by\n      placing an otherwise permissible restriction on another\n      freedom.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_193\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">80.             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1386353\" id=\"span_109\">In <a href=\"/doc/1386353/\" id=\"a_260\">AIR 1960 SC 633 Superintendent Central Prison v.\n\nRam Manohar Lohia</a>, the Supreme Court explained the expression &quot;in the\n\ninterest of&quot; as appears in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_261\">Article 19(2)</a> in the following terms;</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">      &quot;.........We do not understand the observations of the Chief\n      Justice to mean that any remote or fanciful connection between\n      the impugned Act and the public order would be sufficient to\n      sustain its validity.

In yet another decision of the constitutional bench of the\n\nSupreme Court reported at AIR 1962 SC 1166 Kameshwar Prasad v.

A demonstration such as is prohibited by, the rule may\n      be of the most innocent type- peaceful orderly such as the\n      mere wearing of a badge by a Government servant or even by a\n      silent assembly say outside office hours-demonstrations which\n      could in no sense be suggested to involve any breach of\n      tranquillity, or of a type involving incitement to or capable of\n      leading to disorder. If the rule had confined itself to\n      demonstrations of type which would lead to disorder then the\n      validity of that rule could have been sustained but what the\n      rule does is the imposition of a blanket-ban on all\n      demonstrations of whatever type-innocent as well as\n      otherwise-and in consequence its validity cannot be upheld.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_201\">                             (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\">84.

The provisions of the sections read as a\n      whole, along with the explanations, make it reasonably clear\n      that the sections aim at rendering penal only such activities as\n      would be intended, or have a tendency, to create disorder or\n      disturbance of public peace by resort to violence. As already\n      pointed out, the explanations appended to the main body of the\n      section make it clear that criticism of public measures or\n      comment on Government action, however strongly worded,\n      would be within reasonable limits and would be consistent with\n      the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression. It is\n      only when the words, written or spoken, etc. which have the\n      pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or\n      disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent\n      such activities in the interest of public order.

It was\n\nargued that this ordinance was facially unconstitutional as it violated the\n\nfreedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment.

When read in\n   parimateria with chapter 404, Ordinance 330.105 does not\n   prohibit the established first amendment right of individuals\n   or groups to solicit contributions for religious and charitable\n   purposes but merely validly limits that right by requiring\n   permits. Thus, the ordinance is not overbroad in that sense.\n   However, Ordinance 330.105 is unconstitutionally overbroad\n   by its abridgment in a more intrusive manner than necessary,\n   of the first amendment right of individuals to beg or solicit\n   alms for themselves. The City&#x27;s alleged legitimate and\n   compelling interest is its duty and responsibility under its\n   police power to control undue annoyance on the streets and\n   public places and prevent the blocking of vehicle and\n   pedestrian traffic. That lofty goal must be measured and\n   balanced against the rights of those who seek welfare and\n   sustenance for themselves, by their own hand and voice rather\n   than by means of the muscle and mouths of others.

The court\n   recognized that [HN1] the rights to the first amendment [*49]\n   freedoms are not absolute but are subject to the imposition of\n   reasonable and impartial regulations regarding the time,\n   place and manner f public expression.

The court declared that [HN3] the state may reasonably\n   regulate the time, place and manner of engaging in solicitation\n   in public places in order to prevent fraud or undue harassment\n   of passerby. But, in another footnote, the court pointed out that\n   the State must recognize that [HN4] individuals in public\n   places cannot expect the same degree of protection from\n   contact with others as they are entitled to in their own homes.\n   The court found the ordinance unconstitutional on the\n   ground that it contained no standards to guide licensing\n   officials in exercising their discretion to grant or deny\n   applications to solicit on city property.

The New York City Police\n\nDepartment. In this case, the court was confronted with a New York Penal\n\nLaw § 240.35(1) which prohibited loitering for the purposes of begging. It\n\nwas observed that the challenged statute proscribed speech and conduct of a\n\ncommunicative nature which prohibition violated the First Amendment of\n\nthe US Constitution. The court observed that the city, streets and parks were\n\nclassified as a traditional public forum which is a category of public property\n\nopen for expressive activity of the public, which may be of a limited or\n\nunlimited character. The regulation of expressive activity on public property\n\nmust be reasonable and not designed to prohibit the activity merely because\n\nof disagreement with the views expressed. It was held that a regulation that\n\nwas neither content neutral nor narrowly tailored was not justifiable as a\n\nproper time, place or manner restriction on protected speech.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 60 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\"> 93.          It was further held in Loper that the statute in no way advances\n\na substantial and important governmental interest so as to constitute a\n\nreasonable restriction on the freedom of speech. The legislation was found to\n\nsuffer from the vice of over breadth and vagueness and that it also enforced\n\na content-based exclusion. It was held that the regulation was not necessary\n\nto serve a compelling state interest. The regulation was also not content\n\nneutral nor narrowly tailored to serve significant government interest. It did\n\nnot leave open alternative channels of communication. It was observed that\n\n&quot;even if the State was considered to have a compelling interest in preventing\n\nthe evils sometimes associated with begging, a statute that totally prohibits\n\nbegging in all public places cannot be considered &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to\n\nachieve that end. A total prohibition raises a question whether a statute even\n\ncan be said to &quot;regulate&quot; the time, place, and manner of expression but even\n\nif it does, it is not content neutral when it prohibits all speech related to\n\nbegging; it certainly is not narrowly tailored to serve any significant\n\ngovernmental interest, as previously noted, because of the total prohibition\n\nit commands; it does not leave open alternative channels of communication\n\nby which beggars can convey their messages of indigency&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">94.

It was held that charitable appeals for funds, on\n\nthe street or door to door involve a variety of speech interests-\n\ncommunication of information, dissemination and propagation of views and\n\nideas and advocacy of causes- that are within the First Amendment&#x27;s\n\nprotection. It was held that while soliciting financial support is subject to\n\nreasonable restriction, such regulation must give due regard to the reality\n\nthat the solicitation is characteristically intertwined with informative and\n\nperhaps persuasive speech seeking support for particular causes or for\n\nparticular views on economic, political or social issues, and to the reality\n\nthat without solicitation the flow of such information and advocacy would\n\nlikely to cease. It was also observed that since the charitable solicitation is\n\nnot primarily concerned with providing information about the characteristics\n\nand cost of goods, it is not dealt with as a variety of purely speech.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">96.          It was held that the 75 per cent limitation was a direct and\n\nsubstantial limitation on protective activity which could not be sustained\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 62 of 196</span>\n unless it served a sufficiently strong, subordinating interest that the\n\npetitioner was entitled to protect. The U.S. Supreme Court found that\n\nprevention of fraud was the Village&#x27;s principal justification for prohibiting\n\nthe solicitation by the charities that spend more than one quarter of their\n\nreceipts on salaries and administrative expenses. The other reason projected\n\nby the Village was protecting public safety and residential privacy. The\n\nSupreme Court found these justifications as inadequate. It was observed that\n\nsuch interests could be better served by a measure less intrusive than a direct\n\nprohibition on solicitation. Fraudulent misrepresentations could be\n\nprohibited and penal laws used to punish such conduct directly. The\n\nSupreme Court failed to perceive any substantial relationship between the 75\n\npercent requirement and the protection of public safety or of residential\n\nprivacy. The court struck down the ordinance under challenge.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\">97.          The Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Craig Benefit v.

The Court finally struck down Section 66 of the General\n\nLaw stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">      &quot;2.

The Court held that &quot;charitable\n      appeals for funds, on the street or door to door, involve a\n      variety of speech interests - communication of information,\n      the dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the\n      advocacy of causes - that are within the protection of the First\n      Amendment...[S]olicitation is characteristically intertwined\n      with informative and perhaps persuasive speech seeking\n      support for particular causes or for particular views on\n      ....social issues, and ..... without solicitation the flow of such\n      information and advocacy would likely cease.&quot; Schaumburg,\n      supra at 632. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117218345\" id=\"span_128\">See United States v.

A constitutional challenge to beggary was also laid before the\n\nFederal Court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States (U.S.Court of\n\nAppeal, 6th Cir., 2013) in James Speet and Ernest Sims v. Bill Schuette\n\nNo.12-2213. The Federal Court held that begging or the soliciting of alms is\n\na form of solicitation and speech protected by the First Amendment to the\n\nConstitution. The Court struck down the law prohibiting panhandling as\n\nbeing overly broad and violative of free speech and equality.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">  PIL 24/2018                                                   Page 64 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\"> 99.          In Austria, begging was criminalized under Section 29 of the\n\nSalzburg Land Security enactment. The constitutionality of this provision\n\nwas challenged before the Constitutional Court of Austria in Case No.\n\nG155/10 in 2012. The enactment laid a complete ban on all forms of\n\nbegging in public places including a prohibition from invoking other\n\npeople&#x27;s plight in public places, say, for instance, the beggars standing or\n\nsitting in the street calling for help from passers by using a sign. It also\n\nbanned invoking other people in any unobtrusive and non-aggressive manner\n\nof verbally asking for help. It was held by the Constitutional Court of\n\nAustria that the Act forbids solicitation of financial benefits in public places\n\nof foreign persons and silent forms of begging and was thus violative of the\n\nfreedom of communications under <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_282\">Article 10</a> of the European Convention of\n\nHuman Rights. We may usefully extract the relevant observations of the\n\nCourt which read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">       &quot;The comprehensive prohibition of any kind of begging in\n       public places violates <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 10</a> of ECHR: According to the\n       settled case law of the Constitutional Court Art 10 ECHR\n       guarantees everyone freedom of communication. The scope of\n       this provision, which includes the right of freedom of opinion\n       and freedom to receive and communicate messages and ideas\n       without interference from public authorities, covers not only\n       pure publicity but also factual statements and advertising. The\n       communication of facts is therefore also subject to the scope of\n       Art 10 ECHR.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_240\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">100.         Several instances are available of countries where begging has\n\nbeen completely de-criminalized. In Finland, since 1987, the poor law was\n\ninvalidated. This was followed in 2003 when the Public Order Act of\n\nFinland replaced any local government rules and completely decriminalized\n\nbegging. In Greece as well, under the original Article 407 of the Greek Penal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 65 of 196</span>\n Code, begging was punishable by up to 6 months in jail and up to a 3000\n\nEuros&#x27; fine.

We have elaborately discussed the circumstances which compel\n\na person to beg. People have been compelled to beg on account of extreme\n\nfinancial penury, deprivation and lack of means for sustenance. The\n\nlegislation does not establish that the economic status of a beggar, who is\n\nordered by the court to be put in detention in terms of <a href=\"/doc/197200332/\" id=\"a_288\">Section 5</a>, improves\n\nby such detention. What would such a person do for sustenance when he is\n\nreleased from the detention centre?

We have noticed above that begging would be covered within\n\nthe exercise of the freedom of speech and expression of the beggar, a\n\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.

The phrase &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; connotes that the\n       limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right\n       should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what\n       is required in the interests of the public. The word\n       &quot;reasonable&quot; implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is,\n       the choice of a course which reason dictates.

Given the above discussion, it cannot be disputed that the\n\nimpugned legislation absolutely interdicts the right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression of beggars. The reasons expounded by the respondents in the\n\ncounter affidavit constituting the necessity for enacting the law do not\n\nspecifically advert to any of the circumstances detailed in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_305\">Article 19(2)</a>\n\nwhich could justify imposition of restrictions on the right conferred under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_306\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_256\">113.         The respondents have not asserted that the restrictions were\n\nnecessary in the interests of public order or decency or morality in the\n\ncommunity (as permitted by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_307\">Article 19(2).</a> Though neither pleaded nor urged\n\nbefore us, is it possible to contend that the stated object of the law as pleaded\n\nby respondents that the Act is intended to undermine the act of begging as\n\nsome organized gangs are exploiting children and forcing them to go for\n\nbegging, be held to be a permissible restriction in terms of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_308\">Article 19(2)?</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 69 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_257\"> 114.         In the present case, none of the reasons set out in the counter\n\naffidavit, as extracted above, make out even remotely that the necessity for\n\nthe restriction or the prohibition imposed by the legislation is to maintain\n\nlaw and order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_258\">115.         Begging may entail only passive and silent communication of\n\nthe condition of a beggar and his peaceful entreaty for assistance.\n\nFurthermore, the act of begging stands penalized in the legislation in public\n\nplaces which are open to all and are not exclusive. It is not explained by the\n\nrespondents as to how any of such activity adversely impacts the law and\n\norder situation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_259\">116.

The respondents have suggested also that beggary has become a\n\n&quot;nuisance&quot; and also adverted to beggary as a profession and exploitation of\n\nthe philanthropic instinct though capable of manual labour. None of these\n\nreasons can be covered amongst the conditions cited in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 19(2)</a> which\n\npermit curtailment of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">118.               Amongst the reasons cited by the respondents, it has been\n\nstated in the counter affidavit that the provisions of the law enable beggars to\n\nundergo a training to earn a livelihood in future; that the restrictions are\n\nnecessary to maintain law and order; that no fundamental or constitutional\n\nrights of the persons lodged in the homes are violated; that Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir receives a large number of tourists from outside the State/ country\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 70 of 196</span>\n and begging often causes annoyance to the visitors by such persons;\n\nundermine the act of begging as some organized gangs are exploiting\n\nchildren and force them to go for begging; the act of begging that actually\n\nhappens is so systemized and practiced as a profession. Nothing has been\n\nplaced before us to support any of these statements.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">119.         In the counter affidavit, the respondents have made a bald\n\nstatement that beggars undergo training to earn livelihood in future.

Other than a backhanded reference in the reply filed by the\n\nrespondents, to large number of tourists visiting the State and begging\n\n&quot;often&quot; causing annoyance to the visitors, the respondents have not made\n\nany reference to any specific instance when begging has actually caused\n\nannoyance to the visitors. No empirical study or examination of this issue is\n\navailable. The respondents also do not refer to any complaint having been\n\nmade by any person in this regard. It also appears that there was no material\n\nplaced before the authorities at the time legislation was enacted. These\n\nsubmissions in the counter affidavit, and as orally pressed before us, are\n\nfound to be baseless. Even otherwise &quot;annoyance&quot; to a visitor, or even a\n\nresident of the State, rests on individual sensitivities.

While it is true\n       that the principles evolved by the Supreme Court of the United\n       States of America in the application of the Fourteenth\n       Amendment were eschewed in our Constitution and instead the\n       limits of restrictions on each fundamental right were indicated\n       in the clauses that follow the first clause of the nineteenth\n       article, it cannot be said as an absolute principle that no law\n       will be considered bad for sheer vagueness. There is ample\n       authority for the proposition that a law affecting fundamental\n       rights may be so considered.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">       xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n       The real rule is that if a law is vague or appears to be so, the\n       court must try to construe it, as far as may be, and language\n       permitting, the construction sought to be placed on it, must be\n       in accordance with the intention of the legislature. Thus if the\n       law is open to diverse construction, that construction which\n       accords best with the intention of the legislature and advances\n       the purpose of legislation, is to be preferred. Where however\n       the law admits of no such construction and the persons\n       applying it are in a boundless sea of uncertainty and the law\n       prima facie takes away a guaranteed freedom, the law must be\n       held to offend the Constitution as was done in the case of the\n       <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_346\">Goonda Act</a>. This is not application of the doctrine of due\n       process. The invalidity arises from the probability of the\n       misuse of the law to the detriment of the individual. If\n       possible, the Court instead of striking down the law may itself\n       draw the line of demarcation where possible but this effort\n       should be sparingly made and only in the clearest of cases.&quot; (at\n       pages 470, 471)&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_280\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_281\">133.

Vague\n       laws offend several important values. First, because we assume\n       that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct,\n       we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a\n       reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he\n       may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not\n       providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory\n       enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit\n       standards for those who apply them. A vague law\n       impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen,\n       judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective\n       basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and\n       discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague\n       statute &#x27;abut(s) upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment\n       freedoms, it &#x27;operates to inhibit the exercise of (those)\n       freedoms.&#x27; Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to\n       &quot;steer far wider of the unlawful zone&#x27; . . . than if the\n       boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.&#x27;&quot;(at\n       page 227-228)&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_288\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n       The legislation in question before us must address these three\n\nconcerns.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">139.

As per clause (i)\n\nof sub-section (a) of <a href=\"/doc/40266175/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 2</a>, begging means &quot;soliciting alms&quot; in a &quot;public\n\nplace&quot;, or &quot;in or about a temple, mosque or other place of public worship&quot;,\n\n&quot;whether or not under any pretence&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_292\">142.         This definition of &#x27;begging&#x27; as contained in the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_361\">Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir Prevention of Beggary Act</a>, is at variance with the definition\n\ncontained in the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_362\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a>. <a href=\"/doc/8438375/\" id=\"a_363\">The Bombay Act</a>\n\ndoes not contain any reference to a temple, mosque or a place of public\n\nworship. Furthermore, under the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_364\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act</a>, the\n\nexpression &quot;pretence&quot; is qualified by use of the expression &quot;such as singing,\n\ndancing, fortune telling, performing or offering any article for sale&quot;. As a\n\nresult, several innocent activities (such as singing, dancing etc. in a public\n\nplace) for which one may receive money from the bystanders, may be\n\nconsidered permissible and legitimate activity to one person, while the same\n\nmay be covered under the description &quot;soliciting alms to another&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_293\">143.         The definition as contained in <a href=\"/doc/53937203/\" id=\"a_365\">Section 2 (a) (i)</a> of the Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir enactment also brings into its net, every possible vulnerable person\n\nespecially having failed to elaborate on the expression &quot;under any pretence&quot;.\n\nLegitimate activities in Jammu &amp; Kashmir (which stand specifically\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 81 of 196</span>\n criminalized under the Bombay enactment) inclusive of singing, dancing,\n\nfortune telling, any other performance as well as offering articles for sale are\n\nleft to the perception of the enforcing agency to construe as an act of\n\nsolicitation of alms, to apply the punitive provisions of the law. Thus, street\n\nperformers; traditional artistes as madaris, puppeteers; petty vendors and\n\npeople struggling to make ends meet by display of some art or skill in a\n\npublic space would be rendered susceptible to prosecution under this law as\n\nthey may be perceived to be &quot;soliciting alms&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_294\">144.         <a href=\"/doc/53937203/\" id=\"a_366\">Section 2(a)(i)</a> thus makes no distinction between persons who\n\nwere actually receiving money for authorized purposes as, say for instance,\n\nagainst sale of goods. It does not explain &quot;pretence&quot; which, perse is an\n\nextremely vague, indefinite, imprecise expression, to take action for\n\nbeggary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_295\">145.         In clause (iii) of <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_367\">Section 2(a)</a> of the enactment, the legislature\n\nhas used the expression &quot;exposing or exhibiting&quot; with the object of obtaining\n\nor extorting alms which would render a person liable for criminal\n\nprosecution under this law. While the presence in a public place of one who\n\nstands deprived of a limb, may be completely natural to one person, another\n\nmay perceive the same as an act of exposure or exhibition of the disability to\n\nbe covered under <a href=\"/doc/32633094/\" id=\"a_368\">Section 2(a)(iii)</a>. By such a widely worded definition, the\n\nlegislation has rendered vulnerable every person been born disabled or who\n\nmay have suffered a physical deformity in an accident or otherwise;\n\nsomebody suffering from disease say for instance leprosy even though they\n\nare not begging.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 82 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_297\"> 146.         The sweep of the legislation as to what is to constitute &quot;object\n\nof securing alms&quot; is also not stated. Thus, it is left to the absolute arbitrary\n\nperception and view of the law enforcing official to assess as to whether an\n\ninjury is being &quot;exposed&quot; or &quot;exhibited&quot; to obtain or extort alms.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_298\">147.         Clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_369\">Section 2(a)</a>, is even broader than the other\n\nclauses as it defines begging as meaning having &quot;no visible means of\n\nsubsistence&quot; and &quot;wandering about&quot; or &quot;remaining in any public place&quot; or\n\n&quot;in a temple, mosque or other place of public worship&quot; in such a condition\n\nor manner as &quot;makes it like&quot; that the person doing so exists by soliciting\n\nalms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_299\">148.         Clause (iv) goes way beyond the act of &quot;soliciting alms&quot;. It\n\ntakes into its sweep, entire way of life of entire communities when it\n\ncriminalizes &quot;wandering about&quot; or &quot;remaining in any public place&quot;. This\n\ndefinition overlooks the hard reality that there are large numbers of homeless\n\nin the community and even larger number without any fixed abode who live\n\nonly in public places. It also ignores the reality that in the mountainous\n\nregions of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, there are legally recognized nomadic\n\ncommunities which include the Gujjars and the Bakerwals. These\n\ncommunities do not remain in a single place and move from one place to\n\nanother. The community displays none of the conventional means of\n\nsubsistence or permanent residence. On application of the above statutory\n\ndefinition of begging the very presence and manner of existence of these\n\nnomads could be easily perceived as &quot;begging&quot; rendering them liable for\n\nprosecution under the legislation under question. Thus, the law as it exists in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/151855279/\" id=\"a_370\">Section 2(a)(iv)</a> would actually punish the way of life of the nomads which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 83 of 196</span>\n is a life style different from commonly perceived notions of what should be\n\nan &quot;acceptable&quot; life style.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_300\">149.

Clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_373\">Section 2(a)</a> lays down no parameters at all. On\n\nwhat would rest the presumption that a person exists only by soliciting alms?\n\nThese assessments are completely undefined and indeterminate. We have no\n\nmanner of doubt that the definition of begging in <a href=\"/doc/151855279/\" id=\"a_374\">Section 2(a)(iv)</a> leaves\n\nculpability completely to the imagination and opinion of the person who is\n\nenforcing the provisions of the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_309\">155.         For the same reasons Clause (v) of <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_375\">Section 2(a)</a> is completely\n\nunclear as to what is the action which could be penalized. The legislature has\n\nlosely used the expression &quot;allowing himself to be used as an exhibit&quot; for the\n\npurposes of soliciting alms. At the same time, the legislation has made an\n\nexception of actions for &quot;soliciting money or fee or gift for a purpose\n\nauthorized by any law or authorized in the prescribed manner by the District\n\nMagistrate.&quot; The legislation fails to define or describe what would be a\n\n&quot;purpose authorized by any law&quot;. Such purpose could very well include\n\nsoliciting money for dispensation in charity. Thus, the legislation makes a\n\ndifference between a person soliciting money or fee or gift for a purpose\n\nauthorized by the District Magistrate and a person seeking assistance for\n\nself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_310\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 85 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_311\"> 156.           Just as in <a href=\"/doc/170483278/\" id=\"a_376\">Section 66A</a> of the Information Technology Act, we\n\nfind that in <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_377\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary\n\nAct, 1960, there is complete absence of the requirement of any &quot;mens rea&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">for the conduct of the person to constitute a criminal offence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_312\">157.

The expressions used in <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_380\">Section 2(a)</a> are so broad that they do\n\nnot give any notice at all to anybody as to what is the conduct which has\n\nbeen legislatively forbidden.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_314\">159.           Every expression used in <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_381\">Section 2(a)</a> is inchoate and\n\nundefined. Borrowing the words used by the Supreme Court to describe\n\nlegislation in Shreya Singhal, we also find that the expressions used to\n\ndescribe &quot;begging&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_382\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of\n\nBeggary Act, 1960, are nebulous, to say the least.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_315\">160.           <a href=\"/doc/171559225/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 2(a)(v)</a> of the legislation contemplates protection of\n\npersons or organized groups seeking dispensation of charity for which the\n\nDistrict Magistrate may permit them. Thus, it can very well be urged that the\n\nstatute is &quot;view point&quot; based and the restrictions are premised on the\n\n&quot;content of the communication&quot; because it supports the view that poor\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 86 of 196</span>\n people should not be making public requests for their own needs but the\n\npoor people could be helped by such organized groups who have been\n\npermitted to help them. The statute thus discriminates between lawful and\n\nunlawful conduct based upon the content of the communication.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_316\">161.          It is also noteworthy that <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_384\">Section 2(a)</a> draws a distinction based\n\non the content of the message. Under this law only such communicative\n\nactivity that can be considered soliciting alms, i.e. direct charitable\n\nassistance for the beggar himself, constitutes a crime. Therefore, a person\n\ncan legitimately solicit money for other purposes, say, as donation for a\n\nschool function and school activities; or money for social or political causes;\n\nor a request for assistance when a bag is stolen or lost. Such conduct would\n\nalso be similar to &quot;wandering.............. in any public place&quot;. However,\n\nrequesting strangers for such assistance would not draw you within the net\n\nof definition of &quot;begging&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_385\">Section 2(a)</a> of the statute. There is also no\n\nprohibition under the impugned legislation to speaking at will to strangers or\n\nsoliciting information, say for instance, seeking the time of the day or\n\ndirection. It is only approaching any person and soliciting alms which is\n\nprohibited.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_317\">162.          The law, in terms, clearly draws a distinction based on the\n\ncontent of the message conveyed and only such communication that calls for\n\ndirect charitable assistance constitutes a crime. The statute imposes a total\n\nprohibition on peaceful requests by the poor for financial aid. It punishes\n\nsuch requests for help to meet their basic human needs while protecting\n\nsimilar requests by more affluent people in such precarious situations (say a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 87 of 196</span>\n lost bag) as cited above. Thus, it is the content of the persons&#x27; message\n\nwhich determines the culpability for criminal offence under the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_318\">163.         Is there any real distinction between an individual soliciting\n\nalms for himself or, on the other hand, soliciting as envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/171559225/\" id=\"a_386\">Section\n\n2(a)(v)</a> &quot;for a purpose authorized by any law&quot; or &quot;authorized.......... by the\n\nDistrict Magistrate&quot;?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_319\">164.         Is it possible to say that there is a difference between such a\n\nperson who is soliciting assistance for himself and those who solicit for\n\norganized charities, with regard to the message that they convey? While the\n\nformer is communicating a personal need, the later are communicating needs\n\nof others. Are not both soliciting charity, one for self and one for others? In\n\nour view, the distinction which the legislation has sought to draw is neither\n\nreal nor significant enough to justify the restriction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_320\">165.         We find that this very view stands taken in the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts in Craig Benefit v. City of Cambridge &amp;\n\nOthers 424 Mass. 918 (1997) whence it was stated thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">       &quot;Begging is generally defined as speech in which the person\n       seeking assistance either asks for money or expresses need\n       through some other clear form of communication such as a\n       sign, a donation cup, or an outstretched hand. Many times a\n       beggar&#x27;s solicitations will be accompanied, as were the\n       plaintiff&#x27;s, by communications that convey social or political\n       messages. &quot;Even without particularized speech, however, the\n       presence of an unkempt and disheveled person holding out his\n       or her hand or a cup to receive a donation itself conveys a\n       message of need for support and assistance. We see little\n       difference between those who solicit for organized charities\n       and those who solicit for themselves in regard to the message\n       conveyed. The former are communicating the needs of others\n       while the latter are communicating their personal needs. Both\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 88 of 196</span>\n        solicit the charity of others. The distinction is not a significant\n       one for First Amendment purposes. Loper, supra at 704.\n       Indeed, it would be illogical to restrict the right of the\n       individual beggar to seek assistance for himself while\n       protecting the right of a charitable organization to solicit funds\n       on his behalf.

The Supreme Court of the United States of America had an\n\noccasion to consider the constitutionality of the Florida Vagrancy Law in the\n\njudgment reported at 405 U.S. 156 (1972) Papachristou v. Jacksonville.\n\nThe Supreme Court had ruled that the law (which was similar to the Begging\n\nenactment being examined by us) was unconstitutional because it was too\n\nvague to be understood. The law was criticized for the reason that it\n\npunishes a person&#x27;s condition rather than his acts. This case involved eight\n\ndefendants who were convicted in a Florida Municipal Court of violating a\n\nJacksonville, Florida, vagrancy ordinance. Their convictions were affirmed\n\nby a Florida Circuit Court in a consolidated appeal and their petition for\n\ncertiorari was denied by the District Court of appeal. The US Supreme Court\n\ngranted the petition for certiorari. The opinion of the Court was delivered by\n\nDouglas, J., in which all members joined except Powell and Rehnquist, JJ.,\n\nwho did not take part in the consideration or decision. The court considered\n\nthe historical background in which the Vagrancy Ordinance was enacted.

So far as the question of vagueness of a legislation is concerned\n\nthere is one more angle which this issue has to be considered. It is well\n\nsettled penal statute must notify all persons as of the fact that what conduct\n\nwould be perceived as criminal. An illuminating discussion on this aspect is\n\nto be found in Shreya Singhal which illustrates that the same conduct\n\nevaluated in terms of an unclear statute, when placed even before two\n\njudicially trained minds could result in diametrically opposite conclusions.\n\nThis by itself established that the legislation in question did not lay down\n\nany clear standards and had to be voided on the ground of vagueness. In this\n\nregard we may usefully extract paras 83, 84 and 85 of the pronouncement in\n\nShreya Singhal which reads thus;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">       &quot;83. Similarly in Chambers v. Director of Public Prosecutions,\n       [2013] 1 W.L.R. 1833, the Queen&#x27;s Bench was faced with the\n       following facts: (WLR p.1833)\n\n             &quot;Following an alert on the Internet social network,\n             Twitter, the defendant became aware that, due to adverse\n             weather conditions, an airport from which he was due to\n             travel nine days later was closed. He responded by\n             posting several &quot;tweets&quot; on Twitter in his own name,\n             including the following: &quot;Crap1 Robin Hood Airport is\n             closed. You&#x27;ve got a week and a bit to get your shit\n             together otherwise I am blowing the airport sky high&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_328\">             None of the defendant&#x27;s &quot;followers&quot; who read the\n             posting was alarmed by it at the time. Some five days\n             after its posting the defendant&#x27;s tweet was read by the\n             duty manager responsible for security at the airport on a\n             general Internet search for tweets relating to the airport.\n             Though not believed to be a credible threat the matter\n             was reported to the police. In interview the defendant\n             asserted that the tweet was a joke and not intended to be\n             menacing. The defendant was charged with sending by a\n             public electronic communications network a message of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 91 of 196</span>\n           a menacing character contrary to section 127(1)(a) of\n          the Communications Act 2003. He was convicted in a\n          magistrates&#x27; court and, on appeal, the Crown Court\n          upheld the conviction, being satisfied that the message\n          was &quot;menacing per se&quot; and that the defendant was, at\n          the very least, aware that his message was of a menacing\n          character.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_329\">   84. The Crown Court was satisfied that the message in question\n   was &quot;menacing&quot; stating that an ordinary person seeing the\n   tweet would be alarmed and, therefore, such message would be\n   &quot;menacing&quot;. The Queen&#x27;s Bench Division reversed the Crown\n   Court stating: (Director of Public Prosecutions case, WLR\n   p.1842, para 31)\n\n          &quot;31. Before concluding that a message is criminal on the\n          basis that it represents a menace, its precise terms, and\n          any inferences to be drawn from its precise terms, need\n          to be examined in the context in and the means by which\n          the message was sent. The Crown Court was\n          understandably concerned that this message was sent at\n          a time when, as we all know, there is public concern\n          about acts of terrorism and the continuing threat to the\n          security of the country from possible further terrorist\n          attacks. That is plainly relevant to context, but the\n          offence is not directed to the inconvenience which may be\n          caused by the message. In any event, the more one\n          reflects on it, the clearer it becomes that this message did\n          not represent a terrorist threat, or indeed any other form\n          of threat. It was posted on &quot;Twitter&quot; for widespread\n          reading, a conversation piece for the defendant&#x27;s\n          followers, drawing attention to himself and his\n          predicament. Much more significantly, although it\n          purports to address &quot;you&quot;, meaning those responsible\n          for the airport, it was not sent to anyone at the airport or\n          anyone responsible for airport security, or indeed any\n          form of public security. The grievance addressed by the\n          message is that the airport is closed when the writer\n          wants it to be open. The language and punctuation are\n          inconsistent with the writer intending it to be or it to be\n          taken as a serious warning. Moreover, as Mr. Armson\n          noted, it is unusual for a threat of a terrorist nature to\n          invite the person making it to be readily identified, as this\n          message did. Finally, although we are accustomed to\n          very brief messages by terrorists to indicate that a bomb\n          or explosive device has been put in place and will\n          detonate shortly, it is difficult to imagine a serious threat\n          in which warning of it is given to a large number of tweet\n          &quot;followers&quot; in ample time for the threat to be reported\n          and extinguished.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 92 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">        85. These two cases illustrate how judicially trained minds\n       would find a person guilty or not guilty depending upon the\n       Judge&#x27;s notion of what is &quot;grossly offensive&quot; or &quot;menacing&quot;.\n       In Collins&#x27; case, both the Leicestershire Justices and two\n       Judges of the Queen&#x27;s Bench would have acquitted Collins\n       whereas the House of Lords convicted him. Similarly, in the\n       Chambers case, the Crown Court would have convicted\n       Chambers whereas the Queen&#x27;s Bench acquitted him. If\n       judicially trained minds can come to diametrically opposite\n       conclusions on the same set of facts it is obvious that\n       expressions such as &quot;grossly offensive&quot; or &quot;menacing&quot; are so\n       vague that there is no manageable standard by which a\n       person can be said to have committed an offence or not to\n       have committed an offence. Quite obviously, a prospective\n       offender of Section 66A and the authorities who are to enforce\n       Section 66A have absolutely no manageable standard by\n       which to book a person for an offence under Section 66A.\n       This being the case, having regard also to the two English\n       precedents cited by the learned Additional Solicitor General, it\n       is clear that Section 66A is unconstitutionally vague.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_332\">                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_333\">168.

We may usefully extract paras 130 and 131\n\n(also extracted in para 68 of Shreya Singhal), which read as follows:\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 93 of 196</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">        &quot;130. It is the basic principle of legal jurisprudence that an\n       enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not\n       clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. It\n       is insisted or emphasized that laws should give the person of\n       ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what\n       is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may\n       trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Such a law\n       impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen and\n       also judges for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,\n       with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory\n       application.

In the judgment reported at 408 US 104 (1972) Grayned v.

The\n\nconcern is that vague laws may result in entrapment of an innocent as they\n\ndo not provide fair warning. The second concern articulated in Grayned is\n\nthat laws must provide explicit standards for those who may apply them in\n\norder to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The Court\n\nobserved that a vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to\n\npolicemen, judges and juries for resolution on adhoc and subjective basis\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 94 of 196</span>\n which also has the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory\n\napplication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_337\">171.

As discussed above, the alms which are received by the individuals are\n\neither necessities in life or used to purchase basic essentials. Thus, statutory\n\nprovision, therefore, directly targets the content of the communications,\n\npunishing requests by the individual for help for essential basic human\n\nneeds.

The clause is undoubtedly irredeemably and extraordinarily\n\nover broad and over inclusive without criminalizing a particular act or\n\nomission, simply making a reference to the condition of a person and merely\n\nrequiring the law enforcer to draw an arbitrary perception from the bare\n\nappearance of a person, without anything more, for considering a person\n\nliable for action under the penal provisions of the law.

With regard to the distinction based on content of the message,\n\nin a judgment of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Craig Benefit v.\n\nCity of Cambridge &amp; Others 424 Mass. 918 (1997), the court ruled as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">       &quot;(b) General Laws c. 272, s. 66, states a broad ban on begging\n       that by its terms makes distinctions based on the content of the\n       message conveyed. Under the statute, only communicative\n       activity that asks for direct, charitable aid for the beggar\n       constitutes a crime. The statute permits speech by those who\n       ask in public places for money for other purposes, such as\n       money for parking meters, change for the bus, money to make\n       a telephone call, assistance where a wallet has been lost,\n       donations for school teams and activities, money for all kinds\n       of political and social causes, and money for newspapers and\n       articles sold on the street. The conduct by the solicitor in all of\n       these examples is the same: &quot;wandering about&quot; (in the\n       parlance of the statute) in a public place, communicating with\n       strangers, and requesting assistance of some kind. By\n       prohibiting peaceful requests by poor people for personal\n       financial aid, the statute directly targets the content of their\n       communications, punishing requests by an individual for help\n       with his or her basic human needs while shielding from\n       government chastisement requests for help made by better-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_341\">       dressed people for other, less critical needs.

It was again pointed\n\nout that what the statute attempts to prescribe is not the commission of some\n\nact or acts but seeks to punish a person because of his status, idleness and\n\npoverty.

In para 8 of AIR 1951 SC 118 Chintaman Rao v.

We also find that the vague definition in <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_393\">Section 2(a)</a> results in\n\nconferment of untrammeled and uncontrolled power on the police to\n\narbitrarily arrest citizens. As a result, persons remain confined in the homes\n\nduring the inquiry following a truncated summary procedure and, if found\n\nguilty, thereafter, further detained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_360\">186.          The U. S. Supreme Court in Papachristou v. City of\n\nJacksonville considered this aspect of the vague criminal statute and noted\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">       &quot;This aspect of the vagrancy ordinance before us is suggested\n       by what this Court said in 1876 about a broad criminal statute\n       enacted by Congress:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">       &quot;It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a\n       net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it\n       to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully\n       detained, and who should be set at large.&quot; (United States v.\n       Reese, 92 U.S. 214, 92 U.S. 221).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">       &quot;While that was a federal case, the due process implications\n       are equally applicable to the States and to this vagrancy\n       ordinance. Here, the net cast is large not to give the courts the\n       power to pick and choose, but to increase the arsenal of the\n       police. In Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, the Court struck\n       down a New York statute that made criminal the distribution of\n       a magazine made up principally of items of criminal deeds of\n       bloodshed or lust so massed as to become vehicles for inciting\n       violent and depraved crimes against the person. The infirmity\n       the Court found was vagueness--the absence of &quot;ascertainable\n       standards of guilt&quot; in the (page 165) sensitive First Amendment\n       area. Mr. Justice Frankfurter dissented. But concerned as he,\n       and many others, had been over the vagrancy laws, he added:\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 101 of 196</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">     &quot;Only a word needs to be said regarding Lanzetta v. New\n    Jersey, 306 U.S. 451. The case involved a New Jersey statute of\n    the type that seek to control &#x27;vagrancy&#x27;. These statutes are in a\n    class by themselves, in view of the familiar abuses to which they\n    are put......Definiteness is designedly avoided so as to allow\n    the net to be cast at large, to enable men to be caught who are\n    vaguely undesirable in the eyes of police and prosecution,\n    although not chargeable with any particular offense. In short,\n    these &#x27;vagrancy statutes&#x27; and laws against &#x27;gangs&#x27; are not\n    fenced in by the text of the statute or by the subject matter so\n    as to give notice of conduct to be avoided.&quot;(Id. At 333\n    U.S.540)\n    Where the list of crimes is so all-inclusive and generalized as\n    the one in this ordinance, those convicted (page 167) may be\n    punished for no more than vindicating affronts to police\n    authority:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">    &quot;The common ground which brings such a motley assortment of\n    human troubles before the magistrates in vagrancy-type\n    proceedings is the procedural laxity which permits\n    &#x27;conviction&#x27; for almost any kind of conduct and the existence\n    of the House of Correction as an easy and convenient\n    dumping-ground for problems (page 168) that appear to have\n    no other immediate solution.&quot; (Foote, Vagrancy-Type Law and\n    Its Administration, 104 U.Pa. L. Rev. 603, 631).\n    Another aspect of the ordinance&#x27;s vagueness appears when we\n    focus not on the lack of notice given a potential offender, but on\n    the effect of the unfettered discretion it places in the hands of\n    the Jacksonville police. Caleb Foote, an early student of this\n    subject, has called the vagrancy-type law as offering\n    &quot;punishment by analogy.&quot; Id. At 609 Such crimes, though long\n    common in Russia, are not compatible with our constitutional\n    (page 169) system. We allow our police to make arrests only\n    &quot;probable cause&quot;, at Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment\n    standard applicable to the State as well as to the Federal\n    Government. Arresting a person on suspicion, like arresting a\n    person for investigation, is foreign to our system, even when\n    the arrest is for past criminality. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186712882\" id=\"span_181\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"164002736\" id=\"span_182\">Future criminality, however,\n    is the common justification for the presence of vagrancy\n    statutes. (Foote, Vagrancy-Type Law and Its Administration).\n    Flordia has, indeed, construed her vagrancy statute &quot;as\n    necessary regulations,&quot; inter alia, &quot;to deter vagabondage and\n    prevent crimes.&quot; (<a href=\"/doc/164002736/\" id=\"a_394\">Johnson v.

Where, as here, there are no standards governing the\n    exercise of the discretion granted by the ordinance, the\n    scheme permits and encourages an arbitrary and\n    discriminatory enforcement of the law. It furnishes a\n    convenient tool for &quot;harsh and discriminatory enforcement by\n    local prosecuting officials, against particular groups deemed\n    to merit their displeasure.&quot; (Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88,\n    310 U.S. 97-98). It results in a regime in which the poor and\n    the unpopular are permitted to &quot;stand on a public sidewalk....\n    Only at the whim of any police officer.&quot; (Shuttlesworth v.\n    Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 382 U.S. 90). Under this ordinance,\n    &quot;If some carefree type of fellow is satisfied to work just so\n    much, and no more, as will pay for one square meal, some\n    wine, and a flophouse daily, but a court thinks this kind of\n    living subhuman, the fellow can be forced to raise his sights or\n    go to jail as a vagrant.&quot; (Amsterdam, Federal Constitutional\n    Restrictions on the Punishment of Crimes of Status, Crimes of\n    General Obnoxiousness, Crimes of Displeasing Police Officers,\n    and the Like, 3 Crim.

The implicit presumption in these generalized vagrancy\n    standards--that crime is being nipped in the bud--is too\n    extravagant to deserve extended treatment.

We may usefully advert to the pronouncement of the Canadian\n\nSupreme Court reported at [1995] 2 SCR 513 : James Egan and John\n\nNorris Nesbit v. Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada, wherein an\n\nilluminating discussion and elaboration has been made by L&#x27;Heureux-Dube,\n\nJ, on Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which\n\nensures equality before and under the law, equal protection and equal benefit\n\nof the law without any discrimination to every individual, observed as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_400\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">       &quot;To summarize, at the heart of s. 15 is the promotion of a\n       society in which all are secure in the knowledge that they are\n       recognized at law as equal human beings, equally capable,\n       and equally deserving. A person or group of persons has been\n       discriminated against within the meaning of s. 15 of\n       the Charter when members of that group have been made to\n       feel, by virtue of the impugned legislative distinction, that they\n       are less capable, or less worthy of recognition or value as\n       human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally\n       deserving of concern, respect, and consideration. These are\n       the core elements of a definition of &quot;discrimination&quot;-- a\n       definition that focuses on impact (i.e. discriminatory effect)\n       rather than on constituent elements (i.e. the grounds of the\n       distinction).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">       Three clarifications should be made at this juncture. First, I\n       acknowledge that the above definition essentially tries to put\n       into words the notion of fundamental human dignity. Dignity\n       being a notoriously elusive concept, however, it is clear that\n       this definition cannot, by itself, bear the weight of s. 15 &#x27;s task\n       on its shoulders. It needs precision and elaboration. I shall\n       attempt to demonstrate shortly how this approach to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 111 of 196</span>\n        discrimination can find more concrete and principled\n       expression using many of the criteria that have in the past\n       proven themselves to be highly apposite under the approach\n       taken by this Court in Andrews. As such, it will become evident\n       that the approach I suggest is far less a departure from that\n       developed in Andrews than may appear at first blush. I believe\n       many of those analytical tools to be valid. The problem, in my\n       mind, lies not with the tools but with the framework within\n       which they have in the past been employed. In short, if the\n       framework is not perfectly suited for the tools, then we do not\n       use the tools to their full potential.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">          Second, I note that although the utopian ideal would be a\n       society in which nobody is made to feel debased, devalued or\n       denigrated as a result of legislative distinctions, such an ideal\n       is clearly unrealistic. The guarantee against discrimination\n       cannot possibly hold the state to a standard of conduct\n       consistent with its most sensitive citizens. Clearly, a measure of\n       objectivity must be incorporated into this determination. This\n       being said, however, it would be ironic and, in large measure,\n       self-defeating to the purposes of s. 15 to assess the absence or\n       presence of discriminatory impact according to the standard\n       of the &quot;reasonable, secular, able-bodied, white male&quot;. A more\n       appropriate standard is subjective-objective -- the reasonably\n       held view of one who is possessed of similar characteristics,\n       under similar circumstances, and who is dispassionate and\n       fully apprised of the circumstances. The important principle,\n       however, which this Court has accepted, is that discriminatory\n       effects must be evaluated from the point of view of the victim,\n       rather than from the point of view of the state.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_401\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n             Thus, equality before the law and equal protection of law\n\nenvisages a guarantee against &quot;discrimination&quot; &amp; &quot;discriminatory&quot; impact of\n\nthe action/ legislation which must be assessed from the perspective of the\n\nvictim, and not the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_402\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_403\">206.

In the judgment by Bhagwati,\n\nJ., while considering the distinction between <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_426\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_427\">16</a>, it has been\n\nobserved as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">       &quot;85. ........The basic principle which, therefore, informs both\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_428\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_429\">16</a> is equality and inhibition against\n       discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this\n       great equalising principle? It is a founding faith, to use the\n       words of Bose. J., &quot;a way of life&quot;, and it must not be subjected\n       to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot\n       countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope\n       and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist\n       magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects\n       and dimensions and it cannot be &quot;cribbed, cabined and\n       confined&quot; within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a\n       positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness.\n       In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one\n       belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the\n       whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is\n       arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to\n       political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative\n       of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_430\">Article 14</a>, and if it effects any matter relating to public\n       employment, it is also violative of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_431\">Article 16.</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_432\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_433\">16</a>\n       strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure fairness and\n       equality of treatment. They require that State action must be\n       based on valid relevant principles applicable alike to all\n       similarly situate and it must not be guided by any extraneous or\n       irrelevant considerations because that would be denial of\n       equality. Where the operative reason for State action, as\n       distinguished from motive inducing from the antechamber of\n       the mind, is not legitimate and relevant but is extraneous and\n       outside the area of permissible considerations, it would\n       amount to mala fide exercise of power and that is hit by\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_434\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_435\">16.</a> Mala fide exercise of power and\n       arbitrariness are different lethal radiations emanating from the\n       same vice: in fact the latter comprehends the former.

Placing reliance on E. P.

The Supreme Court had also reiterated the position <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_463\">laid down in</a> E. P.\n\nRoyappa that arbitrariness in State action was violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_464\">Article 14</a> which\n\nensures fairness and equality of treatment and further that the principle of\n\nreasonableness was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness\n\npervaded <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_465\">Article 14.</a>       It was specifically laid down that &quot;procedure\n\ncontemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_466\">Article 21</a> must answer the test of reasonableness in order\n\nto be in conformity with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_467\">Article 14&quot;.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_418\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">  PIL 24/2018                                                   Page 116 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_419\"> 212.         Before us, a challenge has been made to the &quot;classification&quot;\n\neffected by the legislation. We find that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_468\">Article 14</a> requires an examination\n\nas to whether the legislation ensures &#x27;equality&#x27; which this Constitutional\n\nprovision guarantees. The Supreme Court had occasion in the judgment\n\nreported at (1979) 1 SCC 380 Special Courts Bill, 1978, In re, to examine\n\nthis aspect. While reiterating the permissibility of classification, the Supreme\n\nCourt had held that it was not open for the courts to insist on delusive\n\nexactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of\n\nclassification in any given case. However, at the same time, a classification\n\nwould be treated as justified only if it is not palpably arbitrary. The Supreme\n\nCourt had emphasized that the underlining principle in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_469\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution was to treat all persons similarly circumstanced alike, both in\n\nprivileges conferred and liabilities imposed. We may borrow the words of\n\nthe Supreme Court in para 72 in this regard as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">       &quot;72......(4)...It only means that all persons similarly\n       circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges\n       conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to be\n       applied to all in the same situation, and there should be no\n       discrimination between one person and another if as regards\n       the subject matter of the legislation their position is\n       substantially the same.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_420\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_421\">213.         It is noteworthy that in In Re: Special Courts Bill, the Supreme\n\nCourt had reiterated the principle that the classification must not be arbitrary\n\nbut must be rational; that it must not only be based on some qualities or\n\ncharacteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and\n\nnot in others who were left out but such qualities and characteristics must\n\nhave a reasonable relationship to the object of the legislation.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 117 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_422\"> 214.         The specific issue regarding permissibility of legislative\n\nclassification under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_470\">Article 14</a> is also not res-integra. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1186368\" id=\"span_214\">In the pronouncement\n\nof the Supreme Court reported at (<a href=\"/doc/1186368/\" id=\"a_471\">1981) 1 SCC 722 Ajay Hasia v.

The Supreme Court referred to the pronouncements in E.

Unfortunately, in the early stages\n       of the evolution of our constitutional law, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_475\">Article 14</a> came to\n       be identified with the doctrine of classification because the\n       view taken was that that article forbids discrimination and\n       there would be no discrimination where the classification\n       making the differentia fulfils two conditions, namely, (i) that\n       the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia\n       which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped\n       together from others left out of the group; and (ii) that that\n       differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be\n       achieved by the impugned legislative or executive action. It\n       was for the first time in <a href=\"/doc/1327287/\" id=\"a_476\">E.P.Royappa v. State of Tamil\n       Nadu</a> [(1974) 4 SCC 3, 38: 1974 SCC (L&amp;S) 165, 200:(1974) 2\n       SCR 348] that this Court laid bare a new dimension of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_477\">Article\n       14</a> and pointed out that that article has highly activist\n       magnitude and it embodies a guarantee against\n       arbitrariness.xxxxxx\n       This vital and dynamic aspect which was till then lying latent\n       and submerged in the few simple but pregnant words of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_478\">Article\n       14</a> was explored and brought to light in <a href=\"/doc/1327287/\" id=\"a_479\">Royappa</a> case [(1975)\n       1 SCC 485: 1975 SCC (L&amp;S) 99: (1975) 3 SCR 616] and it was\n       reaffirmed and elaborated by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_480\">Maneka Gandhi v.\n       Union of India</a> [(1978) 1 SCC 248] where this Court again\n       speaking through one of us (Bhagwati, J.)</span></span></span> observed: (SCC pp.\n       283-84, para 7)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 118 of 196</span>\n        xxxxxxxxx\n       This was again reiterated by this Court in International\n       Airport Authority case [(1979) 3 SCC 489] at p. 1042 (SCC p.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_219\">511) of the Report. It must therefore now be taken to be well\n       settled that what <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_481\">Article 14</a> strikes at is arbitrariness because\n       an action that is arbitrary, must necessarily involve negation\n       of equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by\n       the courts is not paraphrase of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_482\">Article 14</a> nor is it the objective\n       and end of that article. It is merely a judicial formula for\n       determining whether the legislative or executive action in\n       question is arbitrary and therefore constituting denial of\n       equality. If the classification is not reasonable and does not\n       satisfy the two conditions <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_483\">referred to above</a>, the impugned\n       legislative or executive action would plainly be arbitrary and\n       the guarantee of equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_484\">Article 14</a> would be breached.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_423\">       Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action\n       whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an\n       &#x27;authority&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_485\">Article 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_486\">Article 14</a> immediately springs\n       into action and strikes down such State action. In fact, the\n       concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the\n       entire constitutional scheme and is a golden thread which\n       runs through the whole of the fabric of the Constitution.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_424\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_425\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1416283\" id=\"span_220\">215.         On this aspect, we may also usefully advert to the judicial\n\npronouncement reported at (<a href=\"/doc/1416283/\" id=\"a_487\">1983) 1 SCC 305 D. S. Nakara v. Union of\n\nIndia</a>, wherein, after extracting the above observations of Bhagwati, J, in\n\nManeka Gandhi, the court observed thus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_221\">&quot;11. The decisions clearly lay down that though <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_488\">Article\n       14</a> forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable\n       classification for the purpose of legislation. In order, however,\n       to pass the test of permissible classification, two conditions\n       must be fulfilled, viz. (i) that the classification must be founded\n       on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or\n       things that are grouped together from those that are left out of\n       the group; and (ii) that that differentia must have a rational\n       relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the statute in\n       question [See <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_489\">Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S.R.\n       Tendolkar &amp; Ors.</a>[5]]. The classification may be founded on\n       differential basis according to objects sought to be achieved\n       but what is implicit in it is that there ought to be a nexus, i.e.\n       casual connection between the basis of classification and\n       object of the statute under consideration. It is equally well\n       settled by the decisions of this Court that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_490\">Article 14</a> condemns\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\"> PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 119 of 196</span>\n        discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law\n       of procedure.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_426\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n             Therefore, it is well settled that for a classification to be\n\npermissible under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_491\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, it must be founded\n\non an intelligible differentia which clearly distinguishes persons/ things\n\nwhich are grouped together from those left out from the group and secondly\n\nsuch differentia must have a relation to the object sought to be achieved in\n\nthe statute in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_427\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1416283\" id=\"span_223\">216.

That arbitrariness results in denial of equality and equal\n\nprotection of law, was also considered by the Supreme Court in (<a href=\"/doc/1606318/\" id=\"a_494\">1984) 3\n\nSCC 316 A. L. Kalra v.

It thus appears well-settled that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_495\">Article 14</a> strikes at\n       arbitrariness in executive/administrative action because any\n       action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve the negation\n       of equality. One need not confine the denial of equality to a\n       comparative evaluation between two persons to arrive at a\n       conclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per se\n       arbitrary itself denies equal of (sic) protection by law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_429\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_430\">218.         An argument has been pressed before us that both the\n\nsubstantive statute as well as the rules framed thereunder suffer from\n\narbitrariness and must be struck down for violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_496\">Article 14</a> of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 120 of 196</span>\n Constitution of India. The submission was that merely because a person\n\nappears to be poor or was perceived to be poor, he was presumed to be a\n\nbeggar and the stringent penal provisions of the anti-begging law kicked in\n\nexposing such person to the worst possible consequences including detention\n\nin the police station or prison.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_431\">                Therefore, a person, though actually poor, but did not appear to\n\nbe so, say for instance a taddily dressed beggar, can freely &quot;wander about&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">in public places without suffering any of the penal consequences. This\n\nwould be possible as he would not appear poor or be so perceived. Thus, the\n\nentire classification is premised on appearance of a person and the\n\nclassification rests on an arbitrary perception by the enforcing agency that\n\nthe person was begging for alms.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">219.            It is also necessary to note that the legislation itself recognizes\n\nthat all solicitation of alms is not illegal. <a href=\"/doc/171559225/\" id=\"a_497\">Section 2(a)(v)</a> of the Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, itself recognizes that &quot;soliciting money\n\nor fee or gift for a purpose authorized by any law.............by the District\n\nMagistrate&quot; is not covered under the definition of begging as contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_498\">Section 2(a)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_433\">220.            Thus, the legislation itself permits such begging as for which a\n\nlicence stands issued by the District Magistrate under Rule 3 of the Rules of\n\n1964. A person begging for alms for himself and someone begging for a\n\ncause for which he has a licence, are actually undertaking the same activity\n\ni.e., seeking alms for charity. There is no justification at all for the\n\ndistinction which has been drawn for this classification.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">  PIL 24/2018                                                    Page 121 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_434\"> 221.           In this regard, we may usefully advert to the remarks contained\n\nin the judgment reported at 617 NYS 2d 429 State of New York v. Eric\n\nSchrader that &quot;no rational distinction can be made between the message\n\ninvolved, whether the person standing in the corner says &#x27;Help me, I am\n\nhomeless&#x27; or &#x27;help the Homeless&#x27;&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_435\">222.           We have observed that the legislation in the instant case has\n\nalso drawn no distinction between voluntary and involuntary begging. Even\n\nthe classification between persons begging for themselves and those seeking\n\nalms for others with permission from the District Magistrate is neither based\n\non any intelligible differentia nor does it have any relationship to the object\n\nsought to be achieved under the statute in question.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_436\">223.           In (2001) 2 SCC 386 (at page 400-401) Om Kumar v.

So far as <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_499\">Article 14</a> is concerned, the courts in India\n         examined whether the classification was based on intelligible\n         differentia and whether the differentia had a reasonable nexus\n         with the object of the legislation. Obviously, when the courts\n         considered the question whether the classification was based on\n         intelligible differentia, the courts were examining the validity of\n         the differences and the adequacy of the differences. This is\n         again nothing but the principle of proportionality. There are\n         also cases where legislation or rules have been struck down as\n         being arbitrary in the sense of being unreasonable [see <a href=\"/doc/1903603/\" id=\"a_500\">Air\n         India v.

The thread of reasonableness runs through the entire\n       fundamental rights Chapter. What is manifestly arbitrary is\n       obviously unreasonable and being contrary to the rule of law,\n       would violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_503\">Article 14.</a> Further, there is an apparent\n       contradiction in the three Judges&#x27; Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1732220/\" id=\"a_504\">McDowell</a>\n       (supra) when it is said that a constitutional challenge can\n       succeed on the ground that a law is &quot;disproportionate,\n       excessive or unreasonable&quot;, yet such challenge would fail on\n       the very ground of the law being &quot;unreasonable, unnecessary\n       or unwarranted&quot;. The arbitrariness doctrine when applied to\n       legislation obviously would not involve the latter challenge\n       but would only involve a law being disproportionate, excessive\n       or otherwise being manifestly unreasonable. All the aforesaid\n       grounds, therefore, do not seek to differentiate between State\n       action in its various forms, all of which are interdicted if they\n       fall foul of the fundamental rights guaranteed to persons and\n       citizens in Part III of the Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_440\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_441\">225.         In the light of the detailed discussion above, we have no\n\nmanner of doubt that the classification made by <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_505\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960, is arbitrary, irrational and\n\ndiscriminatory.

We may briefly conduct an examination of another very\n\nimportant constitutional protection to all persons. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_507\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India guarantees as a fundamental right that &quot;no person shall\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 123 of 196</span>\n be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure\n\nestablished by law&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_443\">227.         <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_508\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India ensures that no person\n\nshall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by procedure\n\nestablished by law. In this case, the impugned law enables detention of a\n\nperson perceived to be a beggar for the purposes of conducting the inquiry\n\ninto the allegations, resulting in deprivation of his liberty. The present\n\nconsideration therefore necessarily entails an inquiry into the question as to\n\nwhether the legislation results in violation of or impact on the right to life\n\nguaranteed to all person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_509\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India as well.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_444\">228.

N. Bhagwati, J, in the pronouncement of the\n\nSupreme Court reported at (<a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_534\">1978) 1 SCC 248 Maneka Gandhi v.

It is obvious that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_535\">Article 21</a>, though couched in negative\n       language, confers the fundamental right to life and personal\n       liberty. So far as the right to personal liberty is concerned, it is\n       ensured by providing that no one shall be deprived of personal\n       liberty except according to procedure prescribed by law. The\n       first question that arises for consideration on the language\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_536\">Article 21</a> is : what is the meaning and content of the words\n       &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as used in this article ? This question\n       incidently came up for discussion in some of the judgments\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_537\">A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</a> (AIR 1950 SC 27) and the\n       observations made by Patanjali Sastri, J., Mukherjee, J., and S.\n       R. Das, J., seemed to place a narrow interpretation on the\n       words &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; so as to confine the protection\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_538\">Article 21</a> to freedom of the person against unlawful\n       detention. But there was no definite pronouncement made on\n       this point since the question before the Court was not so much\n       the interpretation of the words &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as the inter-\n       relation between <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_539\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_540\">21.</a></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_246\">It was in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_541\">Kharak Singh v.\n       State of U.P. &amp; Ors.</a> (AIR 1963 SC 1295) that the question as\n       to the, proper scope and meaning of the expression personal\n       liberty&#x27; came up pointedly for consideration for the first time\n       before this Court. The majority of the Judges took the view\n       &quot;that personal liberty&#x27; is used in the article as a compendious\n       term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go\n       to make up the personal liberties&#x27; of man other than those dealt\n       with in the several clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_542\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words,\n       while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_543\">Article 19(1)</a> deals with particular species or attributes of\n       that freedom, &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_544\">Article 21</a> takes in and\n       comprises the residue&quot;. The Minority judges, however,\n       disagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained\n       their position in the following words: &quot;No doubt the\n       expression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; is a comprehensive one and the\n       right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It is\n       said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal\n       liberty and, therefore, the expression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27;\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_545\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a\n       correct approach. Both are independent fundamental rights,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 129 of 196</span>\n        though there is overlapping. There is no question of one being\n       carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and\n       personal liberty has many attributes and some of them are\n       found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_546\">Article 19.</a> If a person&#x27;s fundamental right\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_547\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to\n       sustain the action, but that cannot be a complete answer\n       unless the said law satisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_548\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_549\">Article\n       19(2)</a> so far as the attributes covered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_550\">Article 19(1)</a> are\n       concerned&quot;.</span> There can be no doubt that in view of the decision\n       of this Court in R. C. Cooper v. Union of India [(1970) 2 SCC\n       298] the minority view must be regarded as correct and the\n       majority view must be held to have been overruled.xxxxxxxxx&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_465\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_466\">241.         <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_551\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\n(1948) refers to privacy stating thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_467\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">       &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his\n       privacy, family, home or correspondence nor to attacks upon\n       his honour and reputation.

So far as the development of the law of privacy in India is\n\nconcerned, we find the same considered in judgments on legislation\n\npermitting domiciliary visits by authorities.

The Court held that Clause 236 of the U.P.

In this judgment Mathew, J. held that privacy and dignity\n\nclaims had to be examined with care and were to be denied only when an\n\nimportant countervailing interest was shown to be superior or where a\n\ncompelling state interest was shown. If the Court finds that the claimed right\n\nis entitled to protection as a fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it\n\nmust necessarily satisfy the compelling state interest test. The question\n\nwhich would require to be answered is as to whether the state interest is of\n\nsuch paramount importance as would justify an infringement of the right.\n\nTherefore, the right was not absolute and also that the same had to be\n\nexamined on case to case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_476\">247.

Most of the judgments on the subject in India have again\n\nreferred to some important judgments of the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.

United States, however, in the dissent authored\n\nby Justice Brandeis, the learned Judge had opined that the Fourth\n\namendment protected the right to privacy which meant &quot;the right to be left\n\nalone&quot;, and its purpose was &quot;to secure conditions favourable to the pursuit\n\nof happiness&quot;. While recognizing &quot;the significance of man&#x27;s spiritual nature,\n\nof his feelings and intellect&quot;; the right sought &quot;to protect Americans in their\n\nbeliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations&quot;,\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_479\">250.

On the one hand, liberty\n       does not mean unconstrained freedom; see Re B.C. Motor\n       Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486 (per Wilson J., at p.524); R. V.\n       Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713 (per Dickson\n       C.J., at pp.785-86). Freedom of the individual to do what he or\n       she wishes must, in any organized society, be subjected to\n       numerous constraints for the common good. The state\n       undoubtedly has the right to impose many types of restraints on\n       individual behavior, and not all limitations will attract Charter\n       scrutiny. On the other hand, liberty does not mean mere\n       freedom from physical restraint. In a free and democratic\n       society, the individual must be left room for personal\n       autonomy to live his or her own life and to make decisions\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 134 of 196</span>\n        that are of fundamental personal importance. In R. V.\n       Morgentaler [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, Wilson J. noted that the\n       liberty interest was rooted in the fundamental concepts of\n       human dignity, personal autonomy, privacy and choice in\n       decisions going to the individuals fundamental being.

The right to privacy is intrinsic to liberty, central to\n       human dignity and the core of autonomy. These values are\n       integral to the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_565\">Article 21</a> of the\n       Constitution. A meaningful life is a life of freedom and self-\n       respect and nurtured in the ability to decide the course of\n       living. In the nine judge Bench decision in Puttaswamy, this\n       Court conceived of the right to privacy as natural and\n       inalienable. The judgment delivered on behalf of four judges\n       holds: (SCC p.365, para 42)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 135 of 196</span>\n            &quot;42. Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the\n          individual to exercise control over his or her\n          personality. It finds an origin in the notion that\n          there are certain rights which are natural to or\n          inherent in a human being. Natural rights are\n          inalienable because they are inseparable from the\n          human personality. The human element in life is\n          impossible to conceive without the existence of\n          natural rights.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_485\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_258\">Bobde, J., in his exposition on the form of the &quot;right to\n    privacy&quot; held thus: (<a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_566\">K.S.

Begging is also in fact evidence of the failure of the\n\nGovernment as well as the society at large to protect its citizens from\n\ndebilitating effects of extreme poverty and to ensure to them basics of food,\n\nclothing, shelter, health, education, essential concomitants of the right to life\n\nensured under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_589\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_519\">273.            Legislations which clothe and empower authorities and\n\nagencies with drastic powers, have been found generally to contain &quot;good\n\nfaith&quot; clauses which are intended to insulate bonafide actions of these\n\nauthorities/ officers working the enactment from prosecution of the same.\n\nFor instance, Section 18 of the Lepers Act, 1898, contains the protection to\n\npersons acting bona fide under Act- It states that no suit, prosecution or\n\nother legal proceeding shall lie against any officer or person in respect of\n\nanything done in good faith or intended to be done under, or in pursuance of,\n\nthe provisions of this Act. Similar protection is found in <a href=\"/doc/354849/\" id=\"a_590\">Section 18</a> of the\n\nUnlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967; <a href=\"/doc/1805470/\" id=\"a_591\">Section 16</a> of the National\n\nSecurity Act, 1980; <a href=\"/doc/95922498/\" id=\"a_592\">Section 428</a> of the Companies Act, 2013, amongst other\n\nlegislations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_520\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 143 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_521\">               <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_593\">The Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act</a>, does not\n\ncontain any such protection suggesting legislative arrogance in that it does\n\nnot expect any complaint against the authorities working this law in view of\n\nthe powerless status of the targeted population.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_522\">274.          It is obvious that the legislation is steeped in prejudice against\n\npoverty and premised on an absolute presumption of potential criminality of\n\nthose faced with choicelessness, necessity and undeserved want of those\n\nwho have no support at all, institutional or otherwise and are bereft of\n\nresources of any kind. The legislation in fact manifests the complete apathy\n\nof the State and abdication of the Constitutional functions and public law\n\nobligations, when instead of providing support, it has criminalized poverty\n\nand exposed the extreme poor and marginalized to penal prosecutions and\n\npunishment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_523\">275.          The criminalization of begging, undeniably adversely impacts\n\nthe most vulnerable people in the society i.e., that group of people who do\n\nnot have access to basic essentialities as food, shelter, health and\n\ncriminalization of begging ignores the reality that persons who are begging\n\nare the poorest of the poor and the most marginalized in the society.\n\nCriminalization of poverty results in further deprivation and social\n\nexclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_524\">276.          Denial of the right to beg i.e. to ask for alms will push this\n\ngroup of extreme poor to further deprivation, let alone upholding or enabling\n\ntheir right to entitlement and right to decent living conditions.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 144 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_525\"> 277.         Poverty, and the consequential begging, is not out of choice but\n\ncompelled out of the circumstances. The impugned legislation treats the\n\ntargeted population, that is beggars, as having no personal autonomy or\n\nentitlement to the freedom to make a choice so far as their life and conduct is\n\nconcerned. The dignity of the targeted individuals is irreparably harmed by\n\nthe unfair treatment wielded out to them which is directly based on their\n\ncircumstances. The treatment is completely insensitive to the individual\n\nneeds and fails to take into account the fact that these are persons who are\n\nalready marginalized in life, living on the fringes of the communities\n\nwithout the bare essentials for mere existence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_526\">278.         The United Nations Special Rapporteur in a report on &quot;Extreme\n\nPoverty and Human Rights Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona, 32, U.N.\n\nDoc. A/66/265 (Aug. 4, 2011)&quot; has conducted an in-depth analysis on\n\nextreme poverty and human rights as well as several laws, regulations and\n\npractices that punish, segregate, control and undermine the autonomy of a\n\nperson&#x27;s living in poverty. It has been found in this report that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">        &quot;5. States have long recognized that poverty is a complex\n       human condition characterized by sustained or chronic\n       deprivation of the resources, capabilities, choices, security and\n       power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of\n       living and other economic, civil, cultural, political and social\n       rights. Poverty is not an autonomous choice, but rather a\n       multifaceted situation from which it may be difficult, if not\n       impossible, to escape without assistance. Persons living in\n       poverty are not to blame for their situation; accordingly,\n       States must not punish or penalize them for it. Rather, States\n       must adopt wide-reaching measures and policies designed to\n       eliminate the conditions that cause, exacerbate or perpetuate\n       poverty, and ensure the realization of all economic, social,\n       cultural, civil and political rights of those living in poverty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">       6. Penalization policies reflect a serious misunderstanding of\n       the realities of the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">  PIL 24/2018                                                  Page 145 of 196</span>\n        and ignorance of the pervasive discrimination and mutually\n       reinforcing disadvantages that suffer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">       7. Penalization measures respond to discriminatory\n       stereotypes that assume that persons living in poverty are lazy,\n       irresponsible, indifferent to their children&#x27;s health and\n       education, dishonest, undeserving and even criminal.xxxxxxx&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_527\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_528\">279.         The report also notes the disproportionate impact of poverty on\n\nwomen and that they are particularly vulnerable to penalization measures. It\n\nalso records that &quot;Bans on begging and vagrancy represent serious\n\nviolations of the principles of equality and non-discrimination. Such\n\nmeasures give law enforcement officials wide discretion in their application\n\nand increase the vulnerability of persons living in poverty to harassment and\n\nviolence. They serve only to contribute to the perpetuation of discriminatory\n\nsocietal attitudes towards the poorest and most vulnerable.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_529\">280.         It is not justifiable to imprison a person who has been\n\ncompelled to resort to begging as a means of subsistence especially when the\n\nState is itself responsible on account of economic or other factors to\n\nimplement the constitutional guarantee of a society which is free from all\n\nforums and deprivation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_530\">281.         We find that even liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_594\">Article 21</a> has been\n\nsubjected to principles of proportionality. In (2001) 2 SCC 386 (400) Om\n\nKumar v.

Rule 6(a)(ii) mandates every person is detained to submit\n\n&quot;trimming or shaving of the hair on any part of the person&quot; as may &quot;in the\n\nopinion of the medical officer&quot; be necessary. The detenue has no option\n\nwhatsoever in the matter. Similarly, under sub-rule (iii) of Rule 6(a), it is\n\nmandated that every person detained in the home shall submit to &quot;cleansing\n\nand washing of the body with such materials as may be provided and the\n\ncomplete removal of clothing in order to secure this object&quot;. The detenue\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">  PIL 24/2018                                              Page 147 of 196</span>\n has no volition either as to the cleansing or washing or to the materials with\n\nwhich he is required to do so. The delegated legislation requires &quot;complete\n\nremoval of clothing&quot; to secure the object of the rule. Under clause (b) of\n\nRule 6(1), the detenue is mandated to &quot;wear such clothes as the Officer-in-\n\nCharge of the Home may from time to time direct&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_536\">285.

The proviso to sub-rule (2) of Rule 8, however, enables the\n\nOfficer-in-Charge of the Home to destroy clothing, bedding or articles as are\n\nconsidered on hygienic grounds or if the same is &quot;ragged&quot; or suffering from\n\nany contagious disease. Again, as to whether an article is ragged or not is\n\nleft to the absolute discretion of the Officer-in-Charge of the Home while the\n\nowner thereof i.e. the person detained has no say or option in the matter at\n\nall.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_539\">288.

Rule 9 vests absolute power over the detained person in the\n\nauthorities at the Sick Home/ Beggar&#x27;s Home/ Children Home and gives\n\nunchecked power to the authorities manning these facilities over the person\n\ndetained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_541\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">  PIL 24/2018                                               Page 148 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_542\"> 290.         The deprivations and compulsions imposed under Rules 6, 8,\n\nand 9 as stand envisaged and permitted under the Rules of 1964 in the\n\ndetention centers are also an extreme intrusion on the privacy of the detained\n\nperson and tantamounts to infringement of his right to privacy assured under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_606\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

We thus hold that the mandate under the Jammu &amp; Kashmir\n\nPrevention of Beggary Rules, 1964, violates the privacy and dignity of the\n\nperson detained in the most intrusive manner possible infringing all the\n\nrights of the person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_608\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_544\">                  (XV) Directive Principles of State Policy\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_545\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"35553460\" id=\"span_279\">292.

So far as the enforceability of these principles is concerned, the\n\njurisprudence with regard to the Constitution of India would squarely apply\n\nto these Directive Principles as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_574\">300.         It is trite that the values underlying the Directive Principles\n\nmust necessarily creep into interpretation of economic and social welfare\n\nlegislation. We find that the prescription under <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_622\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India and Part IV of Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has been\n\ncompletely overlooked while enacting and implementing the provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_623\">Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960</a>, and the Rules\n\nframed thereunder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_575\">            (XVI) Obligations under International Instruments\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_576\">301.

These\n\ninstruments impose obligations on the States to protect all individuals from\n\nviolations of the stated rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_577\">302.         The legislation which we are examining results in violation of\n\nthe rights of the most marginalized in the community. We have found that\n\nthe working of the law in question impacts the right to life, which includes\n\ntheir right to the privacy and dignity of the individuals and violates their\n\nright to freedom from discrimination. The implementation of the law results\n\nin denial of equal protection of the law to the persons who are prosecuted\n\nunder this law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_578\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_296\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 154 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_579\"> 303.         Penal provisions must conform to the principles of the\n\nInternational Law and instruments that India has ratified while guaranteeing\n\nthe rights guaranteed to all individuals under the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_580\">304.         The above discussion manifests that the criminal law provisions\n\nthat, so far as beggars are concerned, fail to even recognize the rights\n\nensured to all individuals under the afore stated international instruments.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_581\">                (XVII) Working of Anti Begging Legislations\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_582\">305.         In order to ensure that justice results from the outcome of our\n\nconsideration, it is necessary to consider the working of the existing laws\n\nwhich have criminalized begging and the outcome of their implementation.\n\nWe do not have any empirical study on this subject or statistical data nor do\n\nwe have the benefit of jurisprudential developments within the country.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_583\">306.         What further can this court examine for completing meaningful\n\nexamination of the Challenge? Reference may usefully be made to the\n\nprinciples <a href=\"/doc/570453/\" id=\"a_627\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court in the pronouncement reported at\n\nAIR 1960 SC 554 Hamdard Dawakhana and anr. v. Union of India and\n\nothers, wherein authoritative delineation of the matters which are required to\n\nbe taken into consideration while examining a challenge to the\n\nconstitutionality of an enactment have been laid down. The Supreme Court\n\nhas laid down the principles thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_584\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">       &quot;8. Therefore, when the constitutionality of an enactment is\n       challenged on the ground of violation of any of the articles in\n       Part III of the Constitution, the ascertainment of its true nature\n       and character becomes necessary, i.e., its subject matter, the\n       area in which it is intended to operate, its purport and intent\n       have to be determined. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"725224\" id=\"span_297\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"608874\" id=\"span_298\">In order to do so it is legitimate to take\n       into consideration all the factors such as history of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 155 of 196</span>\n     legislation, the purpose thereof, the surrounding\n    circumstances and conditions, the mischief which it intended\n    to suppress, the remedy for the disease which the legislature\n    resolved to cure and the true reason for the remedy; <a href=\"/doc/608874/\" id=\"a_628\">Bengal\n    Immunity Company Ltd. v.

Another principle which has to borne in mind in examining\n    the constitutionality of a statute is that it must be assumed that\n    the legislature understands and appreciates the need of the\n    people and the laws it enacts are directed to problems which\n    are made manifest by experience and that the elected\n    representatives assembled in a legislature enact laws which\n    they consider to be reasonable for the purpose for which they\n    are enacted. Presumption is, therefore, in favour of the\n    constitutionality of an enactment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">    12. In England as far back as 1889, an Act called the Indecent\n    Advertisements Act (52 and 53 Viet. Ch. 18) was passed to\n    suppress indecent advertisements in which advertisements\n    relating to syphilis, gonorrhoea, nervous debility or other\n    complaints or infirmity arising from intercourse was\n    prohibited. In 1917 the Venereal Diseases Act (7 and 8 Geo. V\n    Ch. 21) was passed in England. This placed restrictions\n    on advertisements relating to treatment for venereal diseases.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_585\">    In 1941, <a href=\"/doc/549550/\" id=\"a_631\">The Pharmacy and Medicine Act, 1941</a> (4 and 5 Geo.\n    VI Ch. 42) was passed which corresponds in material\n    particulars to the impugned Act. It cannot be said that there\n    was no material before Parliament on the basis of which it\n    proceeded to enact the impugned legislation. This material\n    shows the history of the legislation, the ascertained evil\n    intended to be cured and the circumstances in which the\n    enactment was passed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_301\">In <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_632\">Ram Krishna Dalmia v.

J., observed:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_247\">    &quot;that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the\n    court may take into consideration matters of common\n    knowledge, the history of the times and may assume every\n    state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of\n    legislation;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_586\">    Thus it is open to the court for the purpose of determining the\n    constitutionality of the Act to take all these facts into\n    consideration and in the present case we find that there was the\n    evil of self-medication, which both in this country and in other\n    countries, the medical profession and those, who were\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_302\">PIL 24/2018                                               Page 156 of 196</span>\n        conversant with its dangers, had brought to the notice of the\n       people at large and the Government in particular. They had\n       also warned against the dangers of self-medication and of the\n       consequences of unethical advertisement relating to proprietary\n       medicines particularising those diseases which were more\n       likely to be affected by the evil. There is reason, therefore, for\n       us to assume that the state of facts existed at the time of the\n       legislation which necessitated the Act. These facts we have\n       already set out and it is not necessary to reiterate them.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_587\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_588\">307.         Guided by the above authoritative principles, we have therefore\n\nundertaken a search for any studies on similar existing legislations. Some\n\nlight is shed on this aspect in writings by different authors on the subject. In\n\nan article published in: 43/44 Economic and Political Weekly 33(2008) titled\n\n&quot;Ostensible Poverty, Beggary and the Law&quot;, Dr. Usha Ramanathan has\n\nassimilated episodical evidence about the impunity that has developed\n\nthrough the apathy and casual disregard of law in dealing with ostensible\n\npoverty. Dr Ramanathan examined available material regarding the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_633\">Bombay\n\nPrevention of Begging Act, 1959</a>, in Delhi and Mumbai and has specifically\n\ncommented that the anti-beggary legislation bears &quot;bold signatures of\n\nunconstitutionality which, if it had affected classes more proximate to\n\npower, would assuredly have faced severe tests in court, legislatures and on\n\nthe streets of democratic protest.&quot; The article critiques the legislation for the\n\npowers vested on the authorities on which we have also commented herein.\n\nDr Ramanathan concludes:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">       &quot;The logic of the law relating to beggar would be elusive unless\n       the route to understanding it meanders through the perception\n       of the poor as potential criminals rendered so by their poverty;\n       as irritants to the forces of law and urban order; as nuisances\n       to those to whom they appeal for alms.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">       Xxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_303\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 157 of 196</span>\n        Beggary laws have begun to demonstrate how the law may be\n       made, continued, expanded and practised when the\n       constituency affected by the laws are powerless-so rendered by\n       the illegality that the law visits on them, the prejudice that\n       poverty provokes, the distance between privilege and poverty,\n       and the vanishing obligations of the state. Appraising the law,\n       and the practices that have developed in its shadow, will reveal\n       the patterns of impunity, callousness and despair that ow\n       constitute this law. This is a law whose logic is long deceased,\n       if such ever existed. Yet, it persists on the law books despite\n       mounting evidence of abuse and malpractice and the incapacity\n       that the law has demonstrated for doing any good It is, by any\n       reckoning, a ruthless assertion of untrammeled power over\n       classes of people who do not possess the capacity to resist, who\n       have been rendered choiceless, and whom prejudice and\n       callousness have consigned to the margins of human existence\n       and beyond the bounds of citizenship.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_589\">                               (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_590\">308.         We are informed in this writing about the documentation by a\n\nstudent investigation into the administration of the Beggary Law in Delhi\n\nconducted between 1976 and 1979, which documents the experience of one\n\nChottan Choudhary, a man in frail health who had lost his right arm below\n\nthe elbow and which natural disability exposed him to a very high degree of\n\nrisk of arrest under this law. (Ref: Vagrants, Beggars and Status Offenders\n\nin Law and Poverty: Critical Essays, P 248 at pp 251 et Seq. (Upendra Baxi\n\n(ed) 1988). He had been so arrested several times, although the students\n\nwere able to track his livelihood to a small grocery store that he ran.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_591\">309.         The second instance documented by Dr. Ramanathan is that of\n\na Public Interest Litigation being Writ Petition no.1639/1990, which was\n\nfiled before the Bombay High Court by Manjula Sen, challenging the\n\nconstitutionality of the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_634\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a> and the\n\ntyranny under the law that had become standard practice.

Although he was a child under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_635\">Juvenile Justice\n\nAct</a> 1986, his age was deliberately entered as 19. Manjula Sen commented\n\nthat the interesting thing was that Rajguru was handicapped. He had only\n\none hand. Because of this fact he was presumed to be a beggar and arrested\n\nunder the Anti Beggary law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_592\">310.         We also find in the documentation, an assessment of two\n\nBeggars&#x27; Homes in Delhi done by a senior civil servant of the Delhi\n\ngovernment following reports of inhuman conditions in the institutions. The\n\ncivil servant Gyanendra Dhar Badgaiyan wrote, in March 2001, as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">       &quot;Wrong people are being arrested by the anti-beggary squad.\n       One reason for this possibly is that the squads are venal. This\n       was established beyond doubt by an internal inquiry\n       [conducted by Mr A. K. Sinha, District Officer, Social Welfare\n       Department]. It confirmed that in the case of one Mr Gyan\n       Chand Gupta, a retired clerk, the squad released him after\n       snatching Rs.9,000 of the pension money that he was carrying.\n       His only crime was that he was dressed shabbily.

Dr Ramanathan&#x27;s observations on the presumption of potential\n\ncriminality of the poor is a telling commentary on the prejudice of the State\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 161 of 196</span>\n and society against poverty. So far as the working of the anti-begging\n\nlegislations is concerned, she summed up thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">       &quot;Beggary laws have begun to demonstrate how the law may be\n       made, continued, expanded and practised when the\n       constituency affected by the laws are powerless--so rendered\n       by the illegality that the law visits on them, the prejudice that\n       poverty provokes, the distance between privilege and poverty,\n       and the vanishing obligations of the State.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_603\">316.         Gautam Bhatia, in the above noted post dated 10th August,\n\n2018, has referred to his experience while inspecting a court file in the\n\nPatiala House (New Delhi District Courts), where he came across a charge\n\nsheet where in the requirement of individual&#x27;s particulars, it was listed thus\n\n&quot;Residence; Vagabond&quot;. This incident is cited to illustrate the incapability\n\nof linguistics to deal with the range of issues which could arise in society in\n\nthe context of dealing with poverty, let alone addressing them in any\n\nmeaningful way. This instance manifests&#x27; the inherent arbitrariness in the\n\ndescription of the conduct which has been rendered penal under the Anti-\n\nBeggary enactment and the width of behavior, circumstances and condition\n\nof a person which would render him culpable for penal action.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_604\">317.         Several experts have commented on the fact that despite the\n\nexcesses which have resulted on account of enforcement of beggary\n\nenactments, there has been no prosecution or punishment of those abusing\n\nthe power or exploiting the marginalized and vulnerable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_605\">318.         The above real time accounts establish beyond doubt that\n\ncriminalization of begging does not withstand constitutional scrutiny.

It is evident that the law under examination does not require\n\nany specific act or behavior or omission on the part of a person to acquire\n\nattributes of criminality. Abject poverty visible in the public domain attracts\n\nthe penalty of the law. The legislation enables such detention of persons who\n\nmay not be begging but are perceived by the enforcing authority to be\n\nbeggars or begging. In order to avoid the operation of the penal provisions of\n\nthe beggary law, a poverty-stricken person is thus required to make his\n\npoverty invisible or to obtain gainful employment or acquire a façade of\n\naffluence as socially perceived.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_607\">320.

It is noteworthy that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_674\">Bombay Prevention\n\nof Begging Act, 1959</a>, and the Delhi Prevention of Begging Rules, 1960,\n\nmandate that in passing any order under the Act, including the order under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/33487775/\" id=\"a_675\">Section 5(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/157841373/\" id=\"a_676\">5(5)</a>, the court is required to have regard to all the\n\ncircumstances mentioned therein including the consideration of the age and\n\ncharacter of the beggar which encompasses all antecedents of the person. It\n\nhas been held that the court was required to consider the circumstances and\n\nconditions in which the beggar was living; a report from the Probation\n\nOfficer was required to be called and a wide latitude stands given to the\n\ncourts in passing orders under the statute. <a href=\"/doc/98539574/\" id=\"a_677\">Section 5(7)</a> of the Bombay Act\n\nrequires communication of the report of the Probationary Officer to the\n\nbeggar concerned who has to be given an opportunity of producing evidence\n\nrelevant to the matter stated in the report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_631\">             Unfortunately, no such requirement is prescribed under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_678\">Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960</a> or the\n\nRules framed thereunder. Rule 5 of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of\n\nBeggary Rules, 1964, simply prescribes that so far as the inquiry under sub-\n\nsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/197200332/\" id=\"a_679\">Section 5</a> is concerned, the procedure prescribed in the Code\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 169 of 196</span>\n of Criminal Procedure, for the trial of summons cases, and for recording\n\nevidence therein, shall be followed under Rule 5(1).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_632\">338.         The procedure which is prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/197200332/\" id=\"a_680\">Section 5</a> of the Act\n\nunder challenge would show that even in order to undertake the summary\n\ninquiry, the person is mandatorily required to be detained, first arrested\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/103645597/\" id=\"a_681\">Section 4</a>; then, while undergoing the summary inquiry, &quot;remanded to\n\nsuch place and custody as may be convenient&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/76785901/\" id=\"a_682\">Section 5(2)</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_633\">339.         Implicit in this requirement is that, if, on making the inquiry as\n\nreferred to under <a href=\"/doc/119612320/\" id=\"a_683\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act, the court is not satisfied that the\n\nperson was found begging, it shall order such person be released forthwith.\n\nTherefore, as per the scheme of the enactment, in order to ascertain the\n\ninnocence of a person, the law mandates his arrest first, and, thereafter his\n\nremand till completion of the inquiry, in order to enable determination of his\n\ninnocence. Thus, innocent persons are required to be deprived of their liberty\n\nwithout following any process of law. Clearly there is a serious infraction of\n\nthe rights of the persons detained guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_684\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_634\">340.         In the aforenoticed report submitted by the United Nations\n\nSpecial Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, a critical\n\nconsequence of poverty is reported as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_267\">       &quot;12. A significant obstacle in breaking this cycle of\n       penalizationand poverty is the inability of persons living in\n       poverty to access legal assistance, as they are unable to afford\n       private legal representation and legal aid is often unavailable\n       or inadequate. Without access to competent, comprehensive\n       legal assistance, the poorest and most excluded are further\n       disadvantaged in their dealings with authorities not only when\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 170 of 196</span>\n        they are facing criminal charges, but also with respect to\n       administrative procedures such as child protection cases,\n       benefit fraud matters or eviction and immigration proceedings.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_268\">       13. When persons living in poverty do not have access to\n       legal representation or advice, particularly in circumstances\n       where they are unfamiliar with complex legal language, they\n       are more likely to receive and accept unfair or unequal\n       treatment. There is a higher likelihood that they will be\n       detrimentally affected by corruption or asked to pay bribes, will\n       be detained for longer periods of time and, if facing trial, will\n       be convicted. Even when legal assistance is available,\n       discrimination and linguistic barriers are powerful obstacles\n       in the way of those seeking access to justice and redress.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_635\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_636\">341.         Beggars don&#x27;t have a voice in society. They are definitely least\n\nequipped to have a voice in any informal inquiry conducted against them.\n\nWe have no manner of doubt that they cannot effectively represent\n\nthemselves in the summary inquiry contemplated under the Act and the\n\nRules. The lack of effective legal representation is yet another access barrier\n\nwhich works against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_637\">342.

The presumption in the minds of the authorities and the\n\nequation of a state of poverty with criminality as well as the extreme\n\ninequality of power in activating the law and seeking judicial remedies so far\n\nas beggars is concerned, is writ large on the operationalisation of the anti-\n\nbegging enactments. The legislation as well as its working is entrenched in a\n\ndeep prejudice without any consideration of the rights of the people who are\n\nimpacted thereby. The enactment and its working highlights the\n\nunsurmountable gap between the privileged and the extreme poor.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 171 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_639\"> 344.

We also find substance in the submission made by Mr Suhail\n\nRashid Bhat on the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/74726442/\" id=\"a_688\">Section 6(2)</a> for the reason that\n\nthough the Section purports to provide for repeat conviction, however, the\n\nsame tantamounts to actually penalization of a person for second time for\n\nwhat is really a continuation of his previous act. <a href=\"/doc/197200332/\" id=\"a_689\">Section 5</a> enables arresting\n\nanybody who looks poor and appears to be soliciting alms. There is nothing\n\nlaced before us which shows that the person who is so detained is either\n\nempowered or economically uplifted when he is released even after his\n\ndetention. We are unable to fathom as to how the appearance of a beggar\n\nwould change merely because of his detention in a detention centre.\n\nTherefore, even after his release after undergoing the detention, the beggar\n\nwould continue to look the same, inviting action under <a href=\"/doc/119110632/\" id=\"a_690\">Section 6</a> again and\n\nagain premised on the same presumptions and conjectures. The detention as\n\nprescribed under Section 6 results in the worst kind of deprivation of\n\nconstitutional rights that a poor person could be subjected to.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 172 of 196</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_642\"> 346.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"602075\" id=\"span_326\">In <a href=\"/doc/602075/\" id=\"a_691\">Ram Lakhan v.

What would be the utility or\n\nefficacy of releasing such person under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/74726442/\" id=\"a_694\">Section 6(2)</a> after an\n\nadmonition or after procuring a bond for his abstaining from begging and\n\nbeing of good behavior?</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_643\">347.

We find that while prescribing punishments\n\nunder the Ranbir Penal Code, even for serious offences such as voluntarily\n\ncausing hurt (Section 323); voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons\n\n(Section 324); grievous hurt (Section 325); voluntarily causing grievous hurt\n\nto extort property or to constrain to an illegal act (Section 329); causing\n\ngrievous hurt to extort confession or to compel restoration of property\n\n(Section 331) amongst others, no minimum sentences have been prescribed\n\namongst other.

The court held that Section 303\n\ncreated a particular class of persons who are deprived of the opportunity\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/729076/\" id=\"a_702\">Section 235(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. to show cause as to why they should not\n\nbe sentenced to death and it also relieved the court of its obligation under\n\nSection 354(3) of the Code to state special reasons for imposing the sentence\n\nof death. In para-18, the Supreme Court held that the deprivation of these\n\nrights and safeguards which were bound to result in injustice is &quot;harsh,\n\narbitrary and unjust&quot;. In para 19, the Supreme <a href=\"/doc/590378/\" id=\"a_703\">Court further held</a> that\n\nprescription of the mandatory sentence of death for the second of such\n\noffences for the reason that the offender was under the sentence of life\n\nimprisonment for the first of such offences, is arbitrary and beyond the\n\nbounds of all reason.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_646\">349.

The tests of arbitrary action which apply to\n        executive actions do not necessarily apply to delegated\n        legislation. In order that delegated legislation can be struck\n        down, such legislation must be manifestly arbitrary; a law\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 178 of 196</span>\n        which could not be reasonably expected to emanate from an\n       authority delegated with the law-making power.

A subordinate\n       legislation may be questioned under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_736\">Article 14</a> on the ground\n       that it is unreasonable; &#x27;unreasonable not in the sense of not\n       being reasonable, but in the sense that it is manifestly\n       arbitrary&#x27;. Drawing a comparison between the law in England\n       and in India, the Court further observed that in England the\n       Judges would say, &#x27;Parliament never intended the authority to\n       make such Rules; they are unreasonable and ultra vires&#x27;. In\n       India, arbitrariness is not a separate ground since it will come\n       within the embargo of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_737\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. But\n       subordinate legislation must be so arbitrary that it could not\n       be said to be in conformity with the statute or that it\n       offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_738\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_664\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139299795\" id=\"span_341\">44.

We have held above the procedure provided in the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_742\">Jammu &amp;\n\nKashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960</a> and Rules thereunder thus treats a\n\nbeggar with utmost indignity, impact his personal autonomy, liberty and\n\nprivacy, impinging on matters most personal to him or her, without giving\n\nany option in these matters. We have held the law therefore, adversely\n\nimpact the constitutionally ensured as right to life (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_743\">Article 21</a>) of the\n\nbeggars.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_669\">359.         We further find that for impacting the valuable rights as well as\n\nthe guarantees under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_744\">Articles 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_745\">&amp; 19</a>, the procedure prescribed by the law\n\nimpugned is a summary truncated procedure which does not ensure a level\n\nplaying field to the person affected. Even to establish his innocence, the\n\ndetenu is detained in the police station. Even if the beggar could procure\n\neffective legal representation, he is deprived of the opportunity to do so by\n\nhis confinement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_670\">360.         Therefore, even if it could be held that the restrictions imposed\n\nby the substantive law were Constitutional and had to be sustained, we have\n\nno hesitation in holding that the procedure prescribed for imposing these\n\nrestrictions is arbitrary and unreasonable and so liable to be struck down.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_671\">361.

In the case\n       of self-defence and duress, it is the intentional threats of\n       another person that are the source of the danger, while in the\n       case of necessity the danger is due to causes, such as forces of\n       nature, human conduct and other than intentional threats of\n       bodily harm, etc. Although this distinction may have important\n       practical consequences, it is hard to see how it could act as the\n       source of significant juristic differences between the three\n       defences.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_678\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_679\">366.

This, however, is, in my view, a distinction without\n       a relevant difference, since on this view duress is only that\n       species of the genus of necessity which is caused by wrongful\n       threats. I cannot see that there is any way in which a person of\n       ordinary fortitude can be excused from the one type of pressure\n       on his will rather than the other.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_680\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_681\">367.         We have discussed above four reasons why a person may solicit\n\nalms. So far as the beggar falling in the third category i.e. the beggar who is\n\nbeing exploited and compelled to beg by a begging racket is concerned, he\n\nwould be begging under the compulsion of fear of harm from those\n\nexploiting him. Such beggar would have available the defence of &#x27;duress&#x27;.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 182 of 196</span>\n On the other hand in a criminal prosecution, under the Anti begging\n\nlegislation, a beggar who begs on account of homelessness, poverty and\n\nextreme need, would have available the defence of &#x27;necessity&#x27; to him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_682\">368.         In Ram Lakhan, it is noted that in both kinds of begging and\n\ndefences, there is no element of volition of the beggar in the act of begging.\n\nThe person lacks legitimate alternatives and hence an element of\n\ninvoluntariness is attached to his conduct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_683\">369.         Such conduct has been considered in the majority opinion of\n\nthe Supreme Court of Canada in the judgment reported at [1984] 2 SCR 232\n\nPerka v. The Queen, and it is observed that &quot;given that the accused had to\n\nact, could he nevertheless realistically have acted to avoid the peril or\n\npresent the harm, without breaking the law? Was there a legal way out? I\n\nthink this is what Bracton means when he lists &quot;necessity&quot; as a defence,\n\nproviding the wrongful act was not &quot;avoidable&quot;. The question to be asked\n\nis whether the agent had any real choice: could he have done otherwise?\n\nIf there is a reasonable legal alternative to disobeying the law, then the\n\ndecision to disobey becomes a voluntary one, impelled by some\n\nconsideration beyond the dictates of &quot;necessity&quot; and human instincts.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_684\">                              (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_685\">370.

As stated in the order, it was intended as a measure to &quot;make\n\nSrinagar District more citizen friendly and to prevent public nuisance at all\n\ncosts&quot;. The order observes that there was proliferation of beggars on the\n\nstreets of Srinagar. The District Magistrate has presumed that such\n\nproliferation ipso facto &quot;creates massive nuisance for the general public&quot;.\n\nThis order extracts the definition of begging under <a href=\"/doc/140142547/\" id=\"a_761\">Section 2(a)</a> of the\n\nJammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act and in exercise of the powers\n\nvested under <a href=\"/doc/103645597/\" id=\"a_762\">Section 4</a> thereof, the District Magistrate has notified the public\n\nthat any person found indulging in the stated acts shall be immediately\n\narrested.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_691\">373.         At the face of it, the order is premised on no specific material. It\n\npresumes that beggars render the District unfriendly for citizens without any\n\nbasis, it assumes also that begging is a massive nuisance for the general\n\npublic. We have found these presumptions, assumptions and prohibitions\n\nimposed in the order dated 23rd May, 2018, violative of the rights guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_763\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_764\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_765\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.

The order dated 23rd May,\n\n2018 which is based on prejudice that beggars are per se nuisance is,\n\ntherefore, unsustainable for the detailed reasons which we have recorded\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_349\">  PIL 24/2018                                                 Page 185 of 196</span>\n above with regard to the constitutionality legislation and has to be struck\n\ndown and quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_692\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_693\">          (XXI) Impact of notification dated 5th August, 2019\n                        (Re-organization Act)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_694\">374.         Post reservation of this judgment, the Government of India has\n\nproposed to reorganize the State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir in terms of the\n\nJammu &amp; Kashmir Re-organization Act, 2019. This enactment was\n\nintroduced before the Rajya Sabha on 5th August, 2019 and passed on the\n\nsame date. Thereafter, on 6th August, 2019, the Lok Sabha granted its assent\n\nto this law.

The respondents have also adverted to the objects of the law as\n\nintended to underline acts of begging &quot;some organized gangs are exploiting\n\nchildren&quot; and forcing them to go for begging; that children are kidnapped\n\nand forced to beg and a huge amount of money is collected. In this regard,\n\nwe may advert to the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_770\">Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of\n\nBeggary Act</a> 1960. <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_771\">The Act</a> does not criminalize kidnapping or exploitation\n\nof any children or person and their being compelled to beg. Instead, under\n\nclause (v) of sub-section (a) of <a href=\"/doc/40266175/\" id=\"a_772\">Section 2</a> of the Act &quot;allowing himself to be\n\nused as an exhibit for the purpose of soliciting alms&quot; has been made an\n\noffence. Therefore, the victim who has been compelled to beg has been\n\nmade an offender under the statutory scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_704\">380.         Similar legislations in other States in India penalize not only\n\nbegging, but also compelling others to beg. In this regard, we may usefully\n\nrefer to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/121407020/\" id=\"a_773\">Section 11</a> of the Bombay Prevention of Begging\n\nAct, 1959, which reads thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_705\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_351\">  PIL 24/2018                                                Page 187 of 196</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_301\">        &quot;S.11 Penalty for employing or causing persons to beg or\n       using them for purposes of begging: Whoever employs or\n       causes any person to solicit or receive alms, or whoever having\n       the custody, charge or care of a child, continues at or\n       encourages the employment or the causing of a child to splice,\n       or receive alms or whoever poses another person as an exhibit\n       for the purpose of begging shall on conviction be punished with\n       imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but\n       which shall not be less than one year.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_706\">381.         By this provision, anybody who employs any person to solicit\n\nor receive alms is liable on conviction to be punished with imprisonment for\n\na term which may extend to three years but it shall not be less than one year.\n\nThus, a minimum sentence of imprisonment stands prescribed for employing\n\nor causing any person to beg.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_707\">382.         <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_774\">The Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act</a>, thus does\n\nnot penalize the person who is compelling or exploiting another person for\n\nbegging. It thus draws no distinction between voluntary and involuntary\n\nbegging. The legislation does not penalize the person who compels another\n\nto beg or is running a racket or controlling a syndicate of begging.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_708\">383.         Criminal law is founded on &quot;Actus Reus Non Facit Reum Nisi\n\nMens Sit Rea&quot;.
