He further submits that the 2021 Policy also falls\n                          within the purview of the information technology law framework and that a\n                          reading of the letter dated 18.05.2021 issued by the MeiTY also\n                          demonstrates that the issues are overlapping.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_24\">5.     Mr. Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel, relies on the judgment of\n                          the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_9\">Competition Commission of India v. Bharti Airtel</a>,\n                          (2019) 2 SCC 521, to submit that in the said case, the Supreme Court had\n                          rejected the Respondent No.1&#x27;s attempt to exercise jurisdiction over matters\n                          that were being considered by the sectoral regulator, i.e. TRAI, despite the\n                          matter involving competition related issues. He submits that the learned\n                          Single Judge has come to the conclusion that there is an overlap of\n                          jurisdiction in paragraph 33 of the impugned Judgment and, after arriving at\n                          the said conclusion, the learned Single Judge has observed that it would be\n                          prudent for the Commission to keep its hands off till the issues pending\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Digitally Signed          LPA 163/2021&amp;LPA 164/2021                                          Page 6 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">By:RAHUL SINGH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Signing Date:26.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">09:30:24</span>\n                           before the Supreme Court are decided. He states that a perusal of the\n                          additional affidavit demonstrates that the questions that have been posed by\n                          MeiTY in its letter dated 18.05.2021 with regard to the 2021 Policy to the\n                          Appellant are the same as the questions that have been referred by\n                          Respondent No.1 to the Appellant. Therefore, the learned Senior Counsel\n                          argues that if the same issue is decided by different authorities, then it might\n                          lead to conflicting opinions being rendered.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">                          6.     Mr. Salve contends that the challenge is not to any inquiry under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 26</a> of the Act, but the challenge is jurisdictional in nature. He states\n                          that currently the challenge to the policy itself is pending, and if the\n                          Appellant&#x27;s right to continue a particular action is in itself in question, then\n                          the question of CCI inquiry does not arise. He further brings to the notice of\n                          this Court <a href=\"/doc/1537115/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 57</a> of the Act and <a href=\"/doc/1753275/\" id=\"a_12\">Regulation 35</a> of the Competition\n                          Commission of India (General) Regulations, 2009, and states that these\n                          provisions do not ensure that the confidentiality of the matter is maintained\n                          as the same is only dependent on the discretion of the CCI at the end of the\n                          day. Further, there is no guarantee regarding the maintenance of\n                          confidentiality as is evident by the fact that other entities such as the Internet\n                          Freedom Foundation (IFF) and one Prachi Kohli have filed intervention\n                          applications on being made aware of the issue. He states that, therefore, an\n                          intrusive and unnecessary investigation by the DG would have the potential\n                          of revealing the internal workings of the Appellant to the public, thereby\n                          hampering its business.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">                          7.

He submits that there is no material that would lead\n                          to a prima facie opinion being formed that there exists abuse of dominance\n                          as per <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 4</a> of the Act by the Appellant, and that, therefore, it does not\n                          satisfy the requirements of the Act to establish a prima facie case of abuse of\n                          dominance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1748256\" id=\"span_35\">8.     Mr. Rohatgi submits that <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act prohibits\n                          Respondent No.1 from exercising jurisdiction over and initiating an\n                          investigation into the Appellant, unless it first establishes a prima facie case\n                          of abuse of dominance.

He states that the Appellant has a right to\n                          carry on his business in accordance with law and relies upon <a href=\"/doc/1748256/\" id=\"a_16\">Barium\n                          Chemicals v.

He states\n                          that the subject of investigation is WhatsApp, i.e. Appellant in LPA\n                          163/2021, and that just because the Appellant in LPA 164/2021 is a common\n                          owner, it would not mean that they are required to share the burden. He\n                          further states that it is the 2016 Policy and the 2021 Policy which are under\n                          challenge, and that these updates are not the policies of the Appellant in LPA\n                          164/2021. He, therefore, states that just because information can be shared\n                          by virtue of those policies, it is not a ground to investigate into the affairs of\n                          Facebook.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_36\">9.

The learned Senior Counsel relies on the Judgement of the Supreme\n                          Court in <a href=\"/doc/864375/\" id=\"a_25\">Competition Commission of India v. Steel Authority of India\n                          Limited</a>, (2010) 10 SCC 744, to submit that there has to be an element of\n                          reasoning at the stage of forming a prima facie view by the CCI. He states\n                          that CCI does not need detailed reasoning, but must express in no uncertain\n                          terms that it is of the view that there exists a prima facie case, requiring\n                          issuance of a direction for investigation to the Director General. As per Mr.\n                          Tripathi, CCI&#x27;s Order lacks the reasoning required to embark upon the\n                          journey of investigating into the anti-competitive concerns that have been\n                          raised.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">                          13.    Mr. Tripathi contends that unless there is some kind of finding that the\n                          Applicant has violated any of the conditions under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 4</a> of the Act, he\n                          cannot be subjected to any scrutiny under the Act. He states that without\n                          there being a modicum of allegation under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 4</a> of the Act, there is no\n                          jurisdiction of the CCI to conduct a roving inquiry. He further states that\n                          since the learned Single Judge had already upheld the Order passed by the\n                          CCI, no useful purpose would have been served by approaching the Single\n                          Judge.

Per contra, Mr. N.

He states that the Order of the CCI\n                          indicates that a careful and thoughtful consideration of the matter was done\n                          before arriving at the conclusion that there were concerns regarding violation\n                          of the provisions of the Act. He states that the CCI is examining the 2021\n                          Policy through the prism of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_32\">Competition Act, 2002</a>, in a bid to discharge\n                          its statutory functions as a competition law regulator and is, therefore, not\n                          concerned with the possible violation of fundamental rights that is being\n                          delved into by the Supreme Court. Mr. Venkataraman, therefore, argues that\n                          the scope of jurisdiction of the CCI lies on a different plane than that of a\n                          Constitutional Court, and the fact that the latter is seized of the matter has no\n                          bearing on the investigation that is being conducted by the DG, CCI.\n                          Furthermore, attention has been drawn to <a href=\"/doc/264874/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 60</a> and <a href=\"/doc/352776/\" id=\"a_34\">62</a> of the Act to\n                          state that the Act shall have an overriding effect, and that the application of\n                          other laws would not be barred.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_59\">16.    The learned ASG submits that the reliance of the Appellants on\n                          Paragraph 23 of the impugned Judgement is misplaced on the ground that\n                          the learned Single Judge had merely implied that though the underlying\n                          transactions were the same, however, plural examination was required.

The learned ASG further submits\n                          that the case needs to be read factually as the Supreme Court had therein\n                          found that it was primarily a telecom issue, not a competition issue.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"80513238\" id=\"span_65\">17.

I have not been able to come across any provisions\n                                        under the SEBI act in which any corporate fraud can be\n                                        investigated by the SEBI.

I am of the opinion that every\n                                        authority is entitled to investigate even may be in\n                                        respect of the same material as well as from the angle\n                                        and facet in which they have been asked to carry out\n                                        investigation.

Unless TRAI finds\n                                        fault with the IDOs on the aforesaid aspects, the matter\n                                        cannot be taken further even if we proceed on the\n                                        assumption that CCI has the jurisdiction to deal with\n                                        the complaints/information filed before it. It needs to\n                                        be reiterated that RJIL has approached the DoT in\n                                        relation to its alleged grievance of augmentation of\n                                        POIs which in turn had informed RJIL vide letter dated\n                                        6-9-2016 that the matter related to interconnectivity\n                                        between service providers is within the purview of\n                                        TRAI. RJIL thereafter approached TRAI; TRAI\n                                        intervened and issued show-cause notice dated 27-9-\n                                        2016; and post issuance of show-cause notice and\n                                        directions, TRAI issued recommendations dated 21-10-\n                                        2016 on the issue of interconnection and provisioning\n                                        of POIs to RJIL. The sectoral authorities are,\n                                        therefore, seized of the matter. TRAI, being a\n                                        specialised sectoral regulator and also armed with\n                                        sufficient power to ensure fair, non-discriminatory and\n                                        competitive market in the telecom sector, is better\n                                        suited to decide the aforesaid issues. After all, RJIL&#x27;s\n                                        grievance is that interconnectivity is not provided by\n                                        the IDOs in terms of the licences granted to them. <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_68\">The\n                                        TRAI Act</a> and Regulations framed thereunder make\n                                        detailed provisions dealing with intense obligations of\n                                        the service providers for providing POIs.

Comparison of the regimes and purpose behind\n                                        the two Acts becomes essential to find an answer to this\n                                        issue.

No doubt, we have accepted that insofar as the\n                                        telecom sector is concerned, the issues which arise and\n                                        are to be examined in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_78\">TRAI Act</a> and\n                                        related regime need to be examined by TRAI. At the\n                                        same time, it is also imperative that specific purpose\n                                        behind the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_79\">Competition Act</a> is kept in mind. This has\n                                        been taken note of and discussed in the earlier part of\n                                        the judgment. As pointed out above, the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_80\">Competition Act</a>\n                                        frowns at the anti-competitive agreements.

The purpose is to eliminate such practices\n                                        which are having adverse effect on the competition, to\n                                        promote and sustain competition and to protect the\n                                        interest of the consumers and ensure freedom of trade,\n                                        carried on by other participants, in India. To this\n                                        extent, the function that is assigned to CCI is distinct\n                                        from the function of TRAI under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_81\">TRAI Act</a>. The\n                                        learned counsel for the appellants are right in their\n                                        submission that CCI is supposed to find out as to\n                                        whether the IDOs were acting in concert and\n                                        colluding, thereby forming a cartel, with the intention\n                                        to block or hinder entry of RJIL in the market in\n                                        violation of <a href=\"/doc/615592/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 3(3)(b)</a> of the Competition Act.\n                                        Also, whether there was an anti-competitive agreement\n                                        between the IDOs, using the platform of COAI. CCI,\n                                        therefore, is to determine whether the conduct of the\n                                        parties was unilateral or it was a collective action\n                                        based on an agreement. Agreement between the\n                                        parties, if it was there, is pivotal to the issue.

We also do\n                                        not agree with the respondents that insofar as the\n                                        telecom sector is concerned, jurisdiction of CCI under\n                                        the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_95\">Competition Act</a> is totally ousted. In a nutshell, that\n                                        leads to the conclusion that the view taken by the High\n                                        Court is perfectly justified. Even the argument of the\n                                        learned ASG is that the exercise of jurisdiction by CCI\n                                        to investigate an alleged cartel does not impinge upon\n                                        TRAI&#x27;s jurisdiction to regulate the industry in any way.\n                                        It was submitted that the promotion of competition and\n                                        prevention of competitive behaviour may not be high\n                                        on the change of sectoral regulator which makes it\n                                        prone to &quot;regulatory capture&quot; and, therefore, CCI is\n                                        competent to exercise its jurisdiction from the\n                                        standpoint of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_96\">Competition Act</a>. However, having\n                                        taken note of the skilful exercise which TRAI is\n                                        supposed to carry out, such a comment vis-à-vis TRAI\n                                        may not be appropriate. No doubt, as commented by\n                                        the Planning Commission in its report of February\n                                        2007, a sectoral regulator, may not have an overall\n                                        view of the economy as a whole, which CCI is able to\n                                        fathom. Therefore, our analysis does not bar the\n                                        jurisdiction of CCI altogether but only pushes it to a\n                                        later stage, after TRAI has undertaken necessary\n                                        exercise in the first place, which it is more suitable to\n                                        carry out.&quot;                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                          30.    A reading of the aforesaid paragraphs of the Judgement indicates that\n                          the sole issue therein was a conflict between the jurisdiction of a sectoral\n                          regulator and the market regulator. The Supreme Court came to a finding\n                          that the matter pertained to the telecom sector, which was specifically\n                          regulated by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_97\">TRAI Act</a>. However, it noted that the jurisdiction of TRAI\n                          would not oust that of CCI to deal with violations of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_98\">Competition Act</a> and\n                          violations thereunder.

(RJIL) had specifically\n                          approached TRAI for the settlement of this dispute. TRAI, being the\n                          authority that would mandate the adherence to licensing conditions, was,\n                          therefore, deemed fit to be seized of the matter before the charge of\n                          investigation could be given to the CCI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                          31.    It is the contention of the Appellants that since the underlying issues\n                          arising before the Apex Court and this Court, and the investigation that is\n                          sought to be conducted by the CCI are common, this can potentially lead to\n                          conflicting opinions. This contention of the Appellants is not acceptable. It is\n                          the case of the Appellants that while the Apex Court is looking into whether\n                          the 2021 Policy is violative of the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India or not, the investigation by CCI is confined to whether\n                          the 2021 Policy is in furtherance of the dominant position occupied by\n                          WhatsApp and institutes anti-competitive practices. The sphere of operation\n                          of both are vastly different. Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court are\n                          analysing the 2021 Policy through the prism of competition law. The Order\n                          dated 24.03.2021 rendered by the CCI also notes the same:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_151\">&quot;13. In relation to the above mentioned contentions of\n                                        WhatsApp, the Commission is of the view that the\n                                        judgments relied by WhatsApp have no relevance to the\n                                        issues arising in the present proceedings and its plea is\n                                        misplaced and erroneous. The judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n                                        Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_100\">Bharti Airtel</a> Case has no\n                                        application to the facts of the present case as the thrust\n                                        of <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_101\">the said decision</a> was to maintain &#x27;comity&#x27; between\n                                        the sectoral regulator (i.e. TRAI, in the said case) and\n                                        the market regulator (i.e. the CCI).

Needless\n                                        to add, the Commission is examining the policy update\n                                        from the perspective of competition lens in\n                                        ascertaining as to whether such policy updates have\n                                        any competition concerns which are in violation of the\n                                        provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 4</a> of the Act. Further, the\n                                        Commission is of the considered view that in a data\n                                        driven ecosystem, the competition law needs to\n                                        examine whether the excessive data collection and the\n                                        extent to which such collected data is subsequently put\n                                        to use or otherwise shared, have anti-competitive\n                                        implications, which require anti-trust scrutiny. The\n                                        reliance of WhatsApp on Vinod Kumar Gupta and\n                                        other cases is also misplaced as the Commission has\n                                        only observed that breach of the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_103\">Information\n                                        Technology Act</a> does not fall within its purview.\n                                        However, in digital markets, unreasonable data\n                                        collection and sharing thereof, may grant competitive\n                                        advantage to the dominant players and may result in\n                                        exploitative as well as exclusionary effects, which is a\n                                        subject matter of examination under competition law.

In the event that the 2021 Policy is set aside by the\n                          Supreme Court, the CCI will still possess the jurisdiction to investigate the\n                          violation of the Act, if any, during the pendency of the matter before the\n                          Supreme Court when the 2021 Policy was in operation.

A reading of the above Judgement indicates that the jurisdiction of the\n                          CCI under Section 26(1) does not contemplate an adjudicatory function, but\n                          is merely a function of an administrative nature. Accordingly, there is no\n                          right of notice or hearing contemplated under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 26(1)</a>\n                          of the Act. It is in nature of preparatory measures in contrast to the decision-\n                          making process, and this nature is evident from the usage of the term\n                          &quot;direction&quot; that is issued to the Director General for investigation in that\n                          provision. In light of this, it becomes clear as day that the function that is\n                          performed by the CCI under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act would not be affected\n                          by the adjudication by the Supreme Court or this Court while analysing the\n                          potential violation of fundamental rights instigated by the 2021 Policy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_173\">36.

It is the &quot;opt-out&quot; option that primarily led\n                          to CCI rendering its conclusion that the 2016 Policy did not violate the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_118\">Competition Act, 2002</a>. However, in the face of changed circumstances,\n                          considering the dominant position occupied by WhatsApp, the investigation\n                          proposed to be conducted by CCI does not warrant interference, and res\n                          judicata would, thus, not be applicable in the instant case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_179\">In view of this,\n                          the fact that the Order of the CCI in <a href=\"/doc/47700095/\" id=\"a_119\">Vinod Kumar Gupta</a> (supra) has been\n                          upheld by the NCLAT vide Order dated 02.08.2022 is of no relevance and\n                          does not sway the opinion of this Court. Similarly, the emphasis placed by\n                          the Appellants on the letter dated 18.05.2021 is wholly irrelevant as the mere\n                          mentioning of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_120\">Competition Act</a> does not denote that MeiTY is seized of\n                          the violations that may be incited by the 2021 Policy. The sphere of\n                          jurisdiction occupied by MeiTY is different from that of the CCI, and solely\n                          because the said letter alludes to possible violations of the Act does not oust\n                          the jurisdiction of the CCI. Per contra, the letter only strengthens the\n                          contention of Respondent No.1 that there does exist a prima facie violation\n                          of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_121\">Competition Act, 2002</a>.

Moreover, WhatsApp Messenger\n                                        works on direct network effects where an increase in\n                                        usage of a particular platform leads to a direct\n                                        increase in the value for other users--and the value of\n                                        a platform to a new user will depend on the number of\n                                        existing users on that platform. Thus, given its\n                                        popularity and wide usage, for one-to-one as well as\n                                        group communications and its distinct and unique\n                                        features, WhatsApp seems to be dominant.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                                        85.

Network effect in\n                                        turn ensures that customers do not switch to other\n                                        platforms easily unless there is a new competitor\n                                        entering the market with an altogether disruptive\n                                        technology.

WhatsApp is the most widely used app for instant\n                                        messaging       in     India.     A      communication\n                                        network/platform gets more valuable as more users\n                                        join it, thereby benefiting from network effects. The\n                                        OTT messaging platforms not being interoperable,\n                                        communication between two users is enabled only\n                                        when both are registered on the same network. Thus,\n                                        the value of a messaging apps platform increases for\n                                        users with an increasing number of their friends and\n                                        acquaintances joining the network. In India, the\n                                        network effects have indubitably set in for WhatsApp,\n                                        which undergird its position of strength and limit its\n                                        substitutability with other functionally similar\n                                        apps/platforms. This, in turn, causes a strong lock-in\n                                        effect for users, switching to another platform for\n                                        whom gets difficult and meaningless until all or most of\n                                        their social contacts also switch to the same other\n                                        platform. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74961196\" id=\"span_235\">Users wishing to switch would have to\n                                        convince their contacts to switch and these contacts\n                                        would have to persuade their other contacts to switch.\n                                        Thus, while it may be technically feasible to switch, the\n                                        pronounced network effects of&quot; WhatsApp significantly\n                                        circumscribe the usefulness of the same.

For instance,\n                                        information on how users &quot;interact with others\n                                        (including businesses)&quot; is not clearly defined, what\n                                        would constitute &quot;service-related information&quot;,\n                                        &quot;mobile device information&quot;, &quot;payments or business\n                                        features&quot;, etc. are also undefined. It is also pertinent to\n                                        note that at numerous places in the policy while\n                                        illustrating the data to be collected, the list is\n                                        indicative and not exhaustive due to usage of words\n                                        like &#x27;includes&#x27;, &#x27;such as&#x27;, &#x27;For example&#x27;, etc., which\n                                        suggests that the scope of sharing may extend beyond\n                                        the information categories that have been expressly\n                                        mentioned in the policy.

The 2021 Policy, however, places its users in\n                          a &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; situation, virtually forcing its users into agreement by\n                          providing a mirage of choice, and then sharing their sensitive data with\n                          Facebook Companies envisaged in the policy.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47700095\" id=\"span_267\">Therefore, it cannot be said\n                          that the CCI is bound by its own findings in <a href=\"/doc/47700095/\" id=\"a_147\">Vinod Kumar Gupta</a> (supra)\n                          when the issue at hand as well as the circumstances are different.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                          47.    Apart from the aforesaid two issues, it is also the contention of the\n                          Appellant in LPA 164/2021 that it is a separate and distinct legal entity from\n                          WhatsApp, and therefore, it should not be subjected to an intensive and\n                          intrusive investigation by the DG in pursuance of the findings of the CCI\n                          under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act. In this regard, the Court finds merit in the\n                          submission of the learned ASGs that one of the key issues with the 2021\n                          Policy is its propensity to share the data of its users with Facebook Inc., the\n                          parent company of WhatsApp. Solely for the reason that the policies itself\n                          do not emanate out of Facebook Inc., the Appellant cannot hide behind the\n                          fact that it is the direct and immediate beneficiary of the data sharing\n                          mechanism envisaged by the policies. These circumstances necessitate the\n                          presence of the Appellant in LPA 164/2021 as a proper party in the\n                          investigation pertaining to the 2021 Policy and the alleged anti-competitive\n                          practices they trigger.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_268\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">Digitally Signed          LPA 163/2021&amp;LPA 164/2021                                               Page 47 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">By:RAHUL SINGH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">Signing Date:26.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">09:30:24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                           48.    With regard to the submissions on behalf of Facebook India Online\n                          Services Pvt. Ltd., this Court does not find any merit on the aspect of\n                          impleading the said party on account of the fact that the decision of the DG\n                          to issue notice to the Applicant, designating it as an &quot;Opposite Party&quot;, stems\n                          from the information it has secured from Internet Freedom Foundation in\n                          Case No. 30 of 2021 regarding its relevance in the investigation. The\n                          decision taken by the DG lies in the fact that a thorough investigation can\n                          only be conducted if the Applicant cooperates in the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">                          49.    Furthermore, it is not contemplated in law that a party should be\n                          impleaded at the stage of an appeal when it has not been a party to the matter\n                          at the stage when the decision from which the appeal arises has been given,\n                          and the remedy of the Applicant only lies by way of a writ against the Order\n                          by which it is aggrieved. The contention of Mr. Tripathi that the Applicant\n                          has chosen to implead itself in the appeal filed by Facebook cannot be\n                          accepted by this Court. The Applicant will have to first make out a prima\n                          facie case before the learned Single Judge that there is no allegation against\n                          it in the Order of the CCI. The case of the Applicant would involve\n                          independent application of mind by the learned Single Judge. The instant\n                          appeals are primarily on the issue as to whether the CCI ought to wait till\n                          final adjudication of the issues which are pending before the Apex Court.\n                          The Impleadment Application cannot be entertained in the instant appeals\n                          which have been filed by Facebook Inc. and WhatsApp. This Court,\n                          therefore, does not deem it fit to scuttle the investigation at a nascent stage\n                          and defers to the wisdom of the DG and the CCI, and rejects the\n                          Impleadment Application. However, the Applicant is granted the liberty to\n                          take all such steps as required by it, in accordance with law, to impugn the\n                          CCI Order.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">Digitally Signed          LPA 163/2021&amp;LPA 164/2021                                           Page 48 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">By:RAHUL SINGH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">Signing Date:26.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">09:30:24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">                           50.
