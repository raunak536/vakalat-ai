However,\n\n      that would not mean that the CCI would not have the jurisdiction\n\n      to investigate sham marketing agreements entered by the SIPL\n\n      with the KCCL in abuse of the dominant market position, which\n\n      has the consequence of denial of market access to the ADNPL. The\n\n      decision in the AIDCF&#x27;s case is that TRAI does not exercise\n\n      forbearance    over   marketing     agreements,    as   marketing\n\n      agreements would not fall within TRAI&#x27;s regulatory regime, and\n\n      the regulatory regime of TRAI is limited to interconnection. The\n\n      issue before the CCI is whether the petitioner/SIPL is indulging in\n\n      unfair/discriminatory conduct by entering into sham marketing\n\n      agreements with KCCL in abuse of its dominant position in\n\n      violation of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 4</a> of the Competition Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_28\">12.5 The learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the\n\n      judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_30\">Bharti Airtel</a> (supra) is not\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">and 29768 OF 2022                          31</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2025:KER:36755\n\n           applicable to the facts of the present case.

It is true that the jurisdictional fact\n             is a fact which must exist before a Court, Tribunal or an Authority\n             assumes jurisdiction to decide a particular matter.\n             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80300707\" id=\"span_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1839804\" id=\"span_68\">In <a href=\"/doc/1839804/\" id=\"a_102\">Chaube Jagdish Prasad v.

It may in effect say that,\n                  if a certain state of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it\n                  proceeds to do certain things, it shall have jurisdiction to do such things, but\n                  not otherwise. There it is not for them conclusively to decide whether that state\n                  of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what\n                  they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without\n                  jurisdiction. But there is another state of things which may exist. The\n                  legislature may intrust the tribunal or body with a jurisdiction, which includes\n                  the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists as\n                  well as the jurisdiction on finding that it does exist, to proceed further or do\n                  something more.

In the second of\n                  two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say\n                  that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding\n                  certain facts to exist, because the legislature gave them jurisdiction to\n                  determine all the facts, including the existence of the preliminary facts on\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">and 29768 OF 2022                                  59</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               2025:KER:36755\n\n                     which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given\n                     jurisdiction so to decide, without any appeal being given, there is no appeal\n                     from such exercise of their jurisdiction.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">               The Apex Court then stated as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                     &quot;These observations which relate to inferior Courts or tribunals with limited\n                     jurisdiction show that there are two classes of cases dealing with the power of\n                     such a tribunal (1) where the legislature entrusts a tribunal with the\n                     jurisdiction including the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary\n                     state of facts on which the exercise of its jurisdiction depends exists and (2)\n                     where the legislature confers jurisdiction on such tribunals to proceed in a case\n                     where a certain state of facts exists or is shown to exist. The difference is that\n                     in the former case the tribunal has power to determine the facts giving it\n                     jurisdiction and in the latter case it has only to see that a certain state of facts\n                     exists.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">        Whatever may be the debate about the scope of review by the Writ Court\n        of the decision of a Tribunal on a jurisdictional fact, every Tribunal has\n        the jurisdiction to determine the existence or otherwise of the\n        jurisdictional fact, unless the statute establishing the Tribunal provides\n        otherwise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">        On a bare reading of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_104\">Competition Act, 2002</a>, it is\n        clear that the Competition Commission has the jurisdiction to determine\n        whether the preliminary state of facts (on which the further exercise of\n        its jurisdiction depends) exists.

The contention that the Competition Commission has already pre-\n           judged the issue also cannot be accepted. Under sub- section (1) of\n           Section 26, the Commission directed an investigation by Director\n           General into the complaint of FICCI-Multiplex Owners&#x27; Association.\n           Under sub-section (3) thereof, the Director General submitted a\n           report of his findings that there is contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1885813/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 3(3)</a> of the\n           Act and under sub-section (4), the Commission forwarded a copy of\n           the report to the petitioners.

Hence all\n           that the Commission is doing is to hold an inquiry into such\n           contravention as reported by the Director General.

Hence, mere issuance of a show cause notice\n           under Section 26(8)/ <a href=\"/doc/585688/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 27</a>, like issuance of a charge-sheet in a\n           departmental inquiry, cannot be treated as pre-judging the issue,\n           merely because the petitioners had raised some of the legal\n           contentions in the replies to the notice issued by the Director General\n           of Investigation and thereafter also the Commission has issued show\n           cause notices.

Issuance of such a\n                 direction, at the face of it, is an administrative direction to one\n                 of its own wings departmentally and is without entering upon\n                 any adjudicatory process. It does not effectively determine any\n                 right or obligation of the parties to the lis. Closure of the case\n                 causes determination of rights and affects a party i.e. the\n                 informant; resultantly, the said party has a right to appeal\n                 against such closure of case under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 26(2)</a> of the Act.

Paragraph 28 of the Delhi High Court, the Division Bench\n\n      outlined the issue, which is the overlapping jurisdiction of the CCI\n\n      and the Constitutional Courts and whether CCI should abstain\n\n      from exercising its jurisdiction to maintain comity between\n\n      decisions of different authorities on the same issue. It was held\n\n      that even if the issues considered by the CCI and TRAI are the\n\n      same, the approach of the authorities was vastly dissimilar, and\n\n      there exists no inviolable rule that the CCI would completely lack\n\n      jurisdiction in such a case. Parallel enquiries by two different\n\n      authorities in their respective spheres of adjudication are not\n\n      uncommon, and a slight overlap between the enquiries does not\n\n      mean that one must lead to ouster of the other.\n\n          37.1 Paragraphs 30 to 32 of <a href=\"/doc/181982263/\" id=\"a_142\">the said judgment</a> are extracted\n\n      hereunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">            &quot;30. A reading of the aforesaid paragraphs of the Judgment indicates\n            that the sole issue therein was a conflict between the jurisdiction of\n            a sectoral regulator and the market regulator. The Supreme Court\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">and 29768 OF 2022                        71</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                               2025:KER:36755\n\n            came to a finding that the matter pertained to the telecom sector,\n            which was specifically regulated by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_143\">TRAI Act</a>. However, it noted\n            that the jurisdiction of TRAI would not oust that of CCI to deal with\n            violations of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_144\">Competition Act</a> and violations thereunder. Moreover,\n            Paragraph 100 of the Judgment states that in the case therein, the\n            dispute pertained to how Incumbent Dominant Operators (IDOs) had\n            not given Points of Interconnect (POIs) as per the license conditions,\n            and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. (RJIL) had specifically approached\n            TRAI for the settlement of this dispute. TRAI, being the authority\n            that would mandate the adherence to licensing conditions, was,\n            therefore, deemed fit to be seized of the matter before the charge of\n            investigation could be given to the CCI.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">            31. It is the contention of the Appellants that since the underlying\n            issues arising before the Apex Court and this Court, and the\n            investigation that is sought to be conducted by the CCI are common,\n            this can potentially lead to conflicting opinions. This contention of\n            the Appellants is not acceptable. It is the case of the Appellants that\n            while the Apex Court is looking into whether the 2021 Policy is\n            violative of the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n            of India or not, the investigation by CCI is confined to whether the\n            2021 Policy is in furtherance of the dominant position occupied by\n            WhatsApp and institutes anti-competitive practices. The sphere of\n            operation of both are vastly different. Neither this Court nor the\n            Supreme Court are analysing the 2021 Policy through the prism of\n            competition law.

In relation to the above mentioned contentions of WhatsApp, the\n                  Commission is of the view that the judgments relied by WhatsApp have no\n                  relevance to the issues arising in the present proceedings and its plea is\n                  misplaced and erroneous. The judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n                  <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_146\">Bharti Airtel</a> Case has no application to the facts of the present case as the\n                  thrust of <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_147\">the said decision</a> was to maintain &#x27;comity&#x27; between the sectoral\n                  regulator (i.e. TRAI, in the said case) and the market regulator (i.e. the CCI).\n                  WhatsApp has failed to point out any proceedings on the subject matter which\n                  a sectoral regulator is seized of. Needless to add, the Commission is examining\n                  the policy update from the perspective of competition lens in ascertaining as\n                  to whether such policy updates have any competition concerns which are in\n                  violation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 4</a> of the Act. Further, the Commission is\n                  of the considered view that in a data driven ecosystem, the competition law\n                  needs to examine whether the excessive data collection and the extent to which\n                  such collected data is subsequently put to use or otherwise shared, have anti-\n                  competitive implications, which require anti-trust scrutiny. The reliance of\n                  WhatsApp on Vinod Kumar Gupta and other cases is also misplaced as the\n                  Commission has only observed that breach of the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_149\">Information Technology Act</a>\n                  does not fall within its purview. However, in digital markets, unreasonable data\n                  collection and sharing thereof, may grant competitive advantage to the\n                  dominant players and may result in exploitative as well as exclusionary effects,\n                  which is a subject matter of examination under competition law. It is trite to\n                  mention that the provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation\n                  of the provisions of any other law, as declared under <a href=\"/doc/352776/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 62</a> of the Act.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130504148\" id=\"span_95\">32. The observation of the learned Single Judge that certain issues that\n          the CCI is seized of &quot;may substantially be in issue before the Supreme\n          Court and this Court&quot; does not lead to a conclusion that the Supreme\n          Court or this Court are adjudicating upon the same issue.

Even if the issues are the same, the approach\n                   of the authorities is vastly dissimilar, and there exists no inviolable\n                   rule that the CCI would completely lack jurisdiction in the instant\n                   matter. Parallel inquiries by two different authorities in their\n                   respective spheres of adjudication is not uncommon and a slight\n                   overlap between the inquiries does not mean that one must lead to the\n                   ouster of the other.

It needs to be reiterated\n                that RJIL has approached the DoT in relation to its alleged\n                grievance of augmentation of POIs which in turn had informed\n                RJIL vide letter dated 6-9-2016 that the matter related to\n                interconnectivity between service providers is within the\n                purview of TRAI. RJIL thereafter approached TRAI; TRAI\n                intervened and issued show- cause notice dated 27-9-2016; and\n                post issuance of show-cause notice and directions, TRAI issued\n                recommendations       dated   21-10-2016      on     the   issue     of\n                interconnection and provisioning of POIs to RJIL. The sectoral\n                authorities are, therefore, seized of the matter. TRAI, being a\n                specialised sectoral regulator and also armed with sufficient\n                power to ensure fair, non-discriminatory and competitive\n                market in the telecom sector, is better suited to decide the\n                aforesaid   issues.

Having regard to the aforesaid nature of jurisdiction\n                conferred upon an expert regulator pertaining to this specific\n                sector, the High Court is right in concluding that the concepts of\n                &quot;subscriber&quot;, &quot;test period&quot;, &quot;reasonable demand&quot;, &quot;test phase\n                and commercial phase rights and obligations&quot;, &quot;reciprocal\n                obligations of service providers&quot; or &quot;breaches of any contract\n                and/or practice&quot;, arising out of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_158\">TRAI Act</a> and the policy so\n                declared, are the matters within the jurisdiction of the\n                Authority/TDSAT under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_159\">TRAI Act</a> only.

Not only\n                TRAI is better equipped as a sectoral regulator to deal with these\n                jurisdictional aspects, there may be a possibility that the two\n                authorities, namely, TRAI on the one hand and CCI on the other,\n                arrive at conflicting views. Such a situation needs to be avoided.\n                This analysis also leads to the same conclusion, namely, in the\n                first instance it is TRAI which should decide these jurisdictional\n                issues, which come within the domain of the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_163\">TRAI Act</a> as they\n                not only arise out of the telecom licences granted to the service\n                providers, the service providers are governed by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_164\">TRAI Act</a>\n                and are supposed to follow various regulations and directions\n                issued by TRAI itself.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">          38.5 The Supreme Court thus held that only when the TRAI\n\n      determined the jurisdictional facts against IDOs would the\n\n      question arise as to whether it was a result of any concerted\n\n      agreement with them.

Obviously, all the aforesaid functions not only come within the\n            domain of CCI, TRAI is not at all equipped to deal with the same. Even\n            if TRAI also returns a finding that a particular activity was anti-\n            competitive, its powers would be limited to the action that can be\n            taken under the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_187\">TRAI Act</a> alone. It is only CCI which is empowered\n            to deal with the same anti-competitive act from the lens of the\n            <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_188\">Competition Act</a>. If such activities offend the provisions of the\n            <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_189\">Competition Act</a> as well, the consequences under that Act would also\n            follow. Therefore, the contention of the IDOs that the jurisdiction of\n            CCI stands totally ousted cannot be accepted. Insofar as the nuanced\n            exercise from the standpoint of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_190\">Competition Act</a> is concerned,\n            CCI is the experienced body in conducting competition analysis.\n            Further, CCI is more likely to opt for structural remedies which\n            would lead the sector to evolve a point where sufficient new entry\n            is induced thereby promoting genuine competition. This specific\n            and important role assigned to CCI cannot be completely wished\n            away and the &quot;comity&quot; between the sectoral regulator (i.e. TRAI) and\n            the market regulator (i.e. CCI) is to be maintained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">             113. The conclusion of the aforesaid discussion is to give primacy\n             to the respective objections (sic objectives) of the two regulators\n             under the two Acts. At the same time, since the matter pertains to\n             the telecom sector which is specifically regulated by the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_191\">TRAI Act</a>,\n             balance is maintained by permitting TRAI in the first instance to\n             deal with and decide the jurisdictional aspects which can be more\n             competently handled by it. Once that exercise is done and there are\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">and 29768 OF 2022                                  87</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        2025:KER:36755\n\n                        findings returned by TRAI which lead to the prima facie conclusion\n                        that the IDOs have indulged in anti-competitive practices, CCI can\n                        be activated to investigate the matter going by the criteria <a href=\"/doc/130504148/\" id=\"a_192\">laid\n                        down in</a> the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_193\">Competition Act</a> and take it\n                        to its logical conclusion.

Whereas, a\n               complaint could be filed only from a person who was aggrieved by\n               a particular action, information may be received from any person,\n               obviously whether such person is or is not personally affected.\n               This is for the reason that the proceedings under the Act are\n               proceedings in rem which affect the public interest. That CCI may\n               inquire into any alleged contravention of the provisions of the Act\n               on its own motion, is also laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1081742/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 19(1)</a> of the Act.\n               Further, even while exercising suo motu powers, CCI may receive\n               information from any person and not merely from a person who\n               is aggrieved by the conduct that is alleged to have occurred. This\n               also follows from a reading of <a href=\"/doc/1753275/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 35</a> of the Act, in which the\n               earlier expression &quot;complainant or defendant has been\n               substituted by the expression, &quot;person or an enterprise&quot;, setting\n               out that the informant may appear either in person, or through\n               one or more agents, before CCI to present the information that he\n               has gathered.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">               16. <a href=\"/doc/242839/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 45</a> of the Act is a deterrent against persons who\n               provide information to CCI, mala fide or recklessly, inasmuch as\n               false statements and omissions of material facts are punishable\n               with a penalty which may extend to the hefty amount of rupees\n               one crore, with CCI being empowered to pass other such orders as\n               it deems fit. This, and the judicious use of heavy costs being\n               imposed when the information supplied is either frivolous or\n               mala fide, can keep in check what is described as the growing\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">and 29768 OF 2022                                   93</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         2025:KER:36755\n\n                         tendency of persons being &quot;set up&quot; by rivals in the trade.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">                          17.

Also, <a href=\"/doc/1199955/\" id=\"a_211\">Regulation 25</a> shows that\n                          public interest must be foremost in the consideration of CCI\n                          when an application is made to it in writing that a person or\n                          enterprise has substantial interest in the outcome of the\n                          proceedings, and such person may therefore be allowed to take\n                          part in the proceedings. What is also extremely important is\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1753275/\" id=\"a_212\">Regulation 35</a>, by which CCI must maintain confidentiality of the\n                          identity of an informant on a request made to it in writing, so\n                          that such informant be free from harassment by persons\n                          involved in contravening the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                          18.

Paragraphs 54 to 58 are\n\n      extracted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">            &quot;54. It is admitted that the placement of the channels in the\n            Electronic Program Guide is now fully regulated and channels are to\n            be placed genre wise and language wise as provided by the TRAI.\n            Therefore, even if it is admitted that a discount given by a\n            broadcaster to the distributor for placement of a channel would\n            have a bearing on the rate at which a particular channel is carried\n            in the network, the requirement by the impugned Regulations that\n            all placement and marketing agreements also have to be reported to\n            the regulator is not a decision which could have been taken quite so\n            lightly without considering and addressing the objections of the\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">and 29768 OF 2022                        97</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                               2025:KER:36755\n\n            MSOs on the point. Apart from relying on the access to Information\n            Regulations 2005 which empowers the TRAI to decide on the nature\n            of the information that is to be disclosed to the public, no\n            satisfactory answer is forthcoming with regard to the contention of\n            the petitioners of the confidentiality of their commercial\n            information. On the other hand, it is contended that all\n            placements/marketing/promotional activities and incentive and\n            claims for placing a channel in a particular slab forms part of the\n            Reference Interconnect Offer and are therefore not confidential\n            information. It is stated that the RIO being non-confidential in\n            nature, all agreements entered into with reference to the said RIO\n            are also non-confidential as they are based on the RIO published by\n            the broadcaster/distributor on their website and is available in their\n            portal. This, to my mind, is an apparent contradiction which vitiates\n            the decision of the authority.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">            55. Further, though it is contended that all trade and commercial\n            secrets and information protected by law and commercially and\n            financially sensitive information, the disclosure of which is likely to\n            cause unfair gain or unfair loss to the service provider or to\n            compromise his competitive position is exempt from disclosure, it is\n            not clear as to what the criteria are to decide what information that\n            is so exempt from disclosure. Further, the power of the TRAI under\n            the Access to Information Regulations also seems to be an absolute\n            power, in as much as, once the TRAI forms an opinion that it is\n            necessary or expedient to disclose the information in public\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">and 29768 OF 2022                         98</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                2025:KER:36755\n\n            interest, then, the order passed on the representation filed by the\n            service provider would be final. What, therefore, follows is that the\n            protection given by the Regulations from disclosure of commercially\n            and financially sensitive information is clearly at the total discretion\n            of the authority and the pleadings placed on record would show that\n            such discretion is not guided by any specific criteria or guidelines.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">            56. I also find that the authority has proceeded on the specific\n            premise that placement agreements are a part of interconnection\n            and are entered into under the RIO and therefore no further\n            consideration is required for bringing such placement agreements\n            within the scope of the Regulations with regard to maintenance of\n            Registers. This reasoning, according to me, is completely untenable\n            in view of the fact that specific issue is still pending consideration.\n            Therefore, even if it is accepted that the power of the TRAI to issue\n            Regulations is not limited to regulating inter-connection, the\n            exercise of the power should be strictly in accordance with the\n            statute. When the statute specifically provides for transparency in\n            the framing of the Regulations, the specific issues were required to\n            be put to consultation and the objections raised require a proper\n            consideration before any Regulations can be effected.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">            57. Having considered the consultation process supporting the\n            impugned regulations at considerable depth. I am of the considered\n            view that apart from stating that certain broadcasters contended\n            that DPOs are arm-twisting them to enter into exploitative\n            contracts, no proper consideration of the contention of the different\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">and 29768 OF 2022                                           99</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        2025:KER:36755\n\n                      stake holders has been undertaken by the authority. The very\n                      question whether placement agreements are part of inter-\n                      connection being still at large, the reasoning of the respondent that\n                      placement agreements being agreements subject to the RIO are\n                      automatically required to be registered cannot be accepted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">                      58. In the above view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the\n                      impugned Regulations, in so far as they require a disclosure of the\n                      placement agreements bilaterally entered into between the\n                      broadcasters and the distributors are unsustainable. The challenge,\n                      therefore, must succeed to that extent. The impugned regulations,\n                      to the extent that they require registration of placement\n                      agreements/Marketing are, therefore, set aside.

In reconciling the two statutes, the subject matter that is in focus\n            is not merely anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant\n            position, which both the <a href=\"/doc/1937976/\" id=\"a_233\">Patents Act</a> (in Chapter XVI) and the\n            Competition Act (in <a href=\"/doc/1153878/\" id=\"a_234\">Sections 3</a> and 4) deal with. The subject matter\n            that is relevant for this assessment is anti-competitive agreements\n            and abuse of dominant position by a patentee in exercise of their\n            rights under the <a href=\"/doc/1937976/\" id=\"a_235\">Patents Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">            54.

The Supreme\n\n            Court held that there is a well-known rule that the subsequent\n\n            general Act does not affect a prior special Act by implication. The\n\n            maxim &quot;Generalia specialibus non derogant&quot;, i.e., general provisions\n\n            will not abrogate the special provisions, is a well-known rule of\n\n            interpretation of the Statute. In order to determine whether a\n\n            statute is special or general one, the court has to take into\n\n            consideration the principal subject matter of the statute and the\n\n            particular perspective for the reason that for certain purposes an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">16</span>\n     (2021) 10 SCC 657\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">and 29768 OF 2022                        103</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                               2025:KER:36755\n\n      Act may be general and for certain other purposes it may be\n\n      special and such a distinction cannot be blurred.

At his stage, it is\n            required to be noted that as such in the <a href=\"/doc/30550664/\" id=\"a_254\">AICTE Act</a> there is no specific\n            repeal of the <a href=\"/doc/549550/\" id=\"a_255\">Pharmacy Act</a>, more particularly when, as observed\n            hereinabove, the <a href=\"/doc/549550/\" id=\"a_256\">Pharmacy Act</a> is a special Act and the subsequent\n            enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/30550664/\" id=\"a_257\">AICTE Act</a> is general and therefore the Pharmacy\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">and 29768 OF 2022                              104</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            2025:KER:36755\n\n            Act being a special Act must prevail. Apart from that, with regard to\n            several aspects, there is no provision made in the <a href=\"/doc/30550664/\" id=\"a_258\">AICTE Act</a> which\n            are exclusively within the domain of PCI.

On the other hand, so far as AICTE is concerned, only one\n            member would be from the field of pharmacy and that too\n            representative of PCI. Under the circumstances, PCI is the body of\n            experts connected with the subject of pharmacy and related subjects\n            and therefore it will be in the larger interest and more particularly\n            in the interest of education of pharmacy that PCI shall alone have\n            the jurisdiction in the field of pharmacy, rather than AICTE.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">            16. The aforesaid question is also required to be viewed from\n            another angle. Both, PCI and AICTE are the creature of the statute.\n            Therefore, it is not at all healthy that the two regulators, both being\n            Central authorities, can be permitted to fight for supremacy. The\n            fight of supremacy between both the regulators is unhealthy for the\n            education sector as well as the institutions to permit two regulators\n            to function in the same field. Therefore, also and more particularly\n            when PCI consists of the experts in the field of pharmacy and other\n            related subjects, it is in the larger interest of the field of pharmacy\n            that PCI must be given the power to regulate in the field of\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">and 29768 OF 2022                        106</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                              2025:KER:36755\n\n            pharmacy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">            ***                   ***                      ***\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">            20.

In the instant case, we are concerned with the first type of\n                       practices, namely, anti-competitive agreements. <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_282\">The Act</a>, , which\n                       prohibits anti-competitive agreements, has a laudable purpose\n                       behind it. It is to ensure that there is a healthy competition in the\n                       market, as it brings about various benefits for the public at large as\n                       well as economy of the nation.

Another purpose\n            in curbing anti-competitive agreements is to ensure &quot;level playing\n            field&quot; for all market players that helps markets to be competitive. It\n            sets &quot;rules of the game&quot; that protect the competition process itself,\n            rather than competitors in the market. In this way, the pursuit of\n            fair and effective competition can contribute to improvements in\n            economic efficiency, economic growth and development of\n            consumer welfare.

Main Objectives and Benefits of Competition Policy 2.2.1.1.\n            Economic efficiency: Economic efficiency refers to the effective use\n            and allocation of the economy&#x27;s resources. Competition tends to\n            bring about enhanced efficiency, in both a static and a dynamic\n            sense, by disciplining firms to produce at the 16 (2017) 8 SCC\n            47 lowest possible cost and pass these cost savings on to consumers,\n            and motivating firms to undertake research and development to\n            meet customer needs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">            2.2.1.2. Economic growth and development:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">            Economic growth--the increase in the value of goods and services\n            produced by an economy--is a key indicator of economic\n            development.

The\n            market is therefore able to more rapidly reallocate resources,\n            improve productivity and attain a higher level of economic growth.\n            Over time, sustained economic growth tends to lead to an enhanced\n            quality of life and greater economic development.\n            2.2.1.3. Consumer Welfare: Competition policy contributes to\n            economic growth to the ultimate benefit of consumers, in terms of\n            better choice (new products), better quality and lower prices.\n            Consumer welfare protection may be required in order to redress a\n            perceived imbalance between the market power of consumers and\n            producers. The imbalance between consumers and producers may\n            stem from market failures such as information asymmetries, the\n            lack of bargaining position towards producers and high transaction\n            costs. Competition policy may serve as a complement to consumer\n            protection policies to address such market failures.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">          49.   The CCI is entrusted with duties, powers and functions\n\n      to deal with three kinds of anti-competitive practices and to\n\n      eliminate such practices which are having adverse effect on the\n\n      competition, for which the CCI has been given ample power in this\n WP(C) NOs. 29766, 29767\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">and 29768 OF 2022                       121</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2025:KER:36755\n\n      regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">          50.

The\n\n      relevant market has been defined in both its product and\n\n      geographic dimensions.         The objective is to identify the\n\n      competitors that can constrain those undertakings&#x27; behaviour\n\n      and prevent them from behaving independently of effective\n\n      competitive pressure. Thus, it would not be proper to say that the\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_283\">Competition Act</a> is general, but it is a special Act which deals with\n\n      anti-competitive practices as defined under the Act itself.
