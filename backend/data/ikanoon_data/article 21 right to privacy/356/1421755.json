It was contended that\n\nNarco Analysis Test being a health hazard cannot be allowed\n\nto be conducted on the petitioners against their wishes and\n\nit is    violative of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nas it infringes the freedom of their religion.\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 3\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      4.

Learned senior counsel appearing for petitioner\n\nargued that though a learned single Judge of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1326456/\" id=\"a_11\">Rojo George v. Deputy Superintendent of Police</a> (2006 (2)\n\nKLT 197)held that Narco Analysis Test is not violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">21</a> of Constitution of India, the earlier\n\nDivision Bench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/523959/\" id=\"a_14\">Sekharan &amp; Others\n\nv. State of Kerala</a> (1979 KLT 337) was not considered in the\n\ndecision of the single Judge and therefore it is not a\n\nbinding        law.    Learned senior counsel also argued that\n\nlearned single Judge did not properly consider the various\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court on these aspects and so it\n\nis not binding and therefore this court has to reconsider\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 4\n\nthe decision and if necessary it is to be referred to the\n\nDivision Bench.       Learned senior counsel argued that in any\n\ncase the question whether Narco Analysis Test is violative\n\nof   <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_15\">Article     19</a>   of   the    Constitution  of  India  was  not\n\nconsidered <a href=\"/doc/523959/\" id=\"a_16\">in that case</a> and if            Narco analysis is to be\n\nconducted petitioners are           to be taken to Ahammedabad as\n\nagainst their wishes and it is violative of their freedom\n\nof movement and in any such test is not permissible under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_17\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> and therefore the order\n\npassed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate is to be quashed.\n\nLearned     senior     counsel      also  argued  that   when   the\n\nInvestigating       Agency      approached   the   Chief   Judicial\n\nMagistrate for permission to conduct the test stating that\n\nthey sought        consent of the petitioners to undergo the\n\ntest,    fact that      petitioners     refused to give consent was\n\nsuppressed     from   the    court   and  the  impugned  order  was\n\nobtained from the court            playing fraud and therefore the\n\norder is vitiated.</span></span>        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1151521\" id=\"span_3\">Reliance was placed on the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1151521/\" id=\"a_18\">S.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath</a> (AIR\n\n1994 SC 853) and it was argued that when such material\n\naspect was withheld from the court and the impugned order\n\nwas obtained by playing fraud, the order is to be set\n\naside.     It was also argued that in W.P(C) 35392/2008 the\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 5\n\nInvestigating Agency had undertaken that they will follow\n\nthe mandate of <a href=\"/doc/210253/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 160(1)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nwhile questioning the three witnesses against their wishes\n\nand the fact that if petitioners are to be taken outside\n\nthe State to conduct the Narco Analysis Test, it would be\n\nviolative of the undertaking given to this court was also\n\nsuppressed from the Chief Judicial Magistrate and therefore\n\non that ground also the order is to be set aside.</span>          Learned\n\nsenior counsel then          argued that the question whether a\n\nperson could be subjected to Narco Analysis Test without\n\nconsent came up for decision before the Supreme Court in\n\nVenkateswara Rao v State of A.P. (Special Leave to Appeal\n\n5846/2006) and finding that the question whether an accused\n\ncan be compelled to undergo Narco Analysis test is of some\n\nimportance, the matter was referred to the larger Bench\n\nafter recording the submission of the counsel appearing for\n\nthe CBI that until further orders ,Narco Analysis Test\n\nshall not be conducted,           hence  the petition filed before\n\nthe    Chief     Judicial     Magistrate   is  against  the   said\n\nundertaking.      It was submitted that the question was later\n\nheard by the Supreme Court and a decision is awaited and in\n\nsuch    circumstance,      the    Investigating Agency  cannot  be\n\npermitted to conduct a Narco Analysis Test.         Learned senior\n\ncounsel also pointed out that              the Law Commission has\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 6\n\nrecommended to ban Narco Analysis Test finding that it is\n\nviolative of the fundamental rights and is not followed by\n\ncivilized countries and in such circumstance the impugned\n\norder is to be quashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">      6.The learned counsel appearing for the CBI and the\n\nlearned     counsel      appearing    for  the   third  respondent\n\nsupported the impugned order contradicting the submissions.\n\nIt was pointed out that the undertaking given to the Apex\n\nCourt in Special Leave to Appeal 5846/2006 relied on by the\n\npetitioners is only in respect of the said case and there\n\nis no order baning the Narco Analysis Test or prohibiting\n\nthe CBI from seeking permission to conduct Narco Analysis\n\nTest.     It was also submitted that even after the order\n\npassed     in    Special     Leave   to  Appeal   5846/2006 dated\n\n20.11.2006        Supreme    Court   in  Special Leave  to  Appeal\n\n1535/2006 and Crl.Misc. Petition 3381/2006 permitted the\n\nCBI to complete         renarco analysis test on the suspect on\n\nthe dates indicated and therefore the submission that Narco\n\nAnalysis Test was not permitted by the Supreme Court is not\n\ncorrect.       They   also    pointed   out  that apart  from  the\n\ndecision of the learned single Judge of this court, Narco\n\nAnalysis test was approved by the High Courts of Madras,\n\nBombay and Delhi finding that they are not violative of the\n\nfundamental rights enshrined the Constitution and therefore\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 7\n\nthere is no substance in the challenge.            Learned counsel\n\nalso pointed out that the question              considered by the\n\nDivision Bench in Sekharan&#x27;s case (supra)(1979 KLT 337)\n\nwhether    Narco Analysis Test is violative of the provisions\n\nof Constitution of India or is legal was not considered and\n\nthe   passing of reference about         Narco Analysis Test in the\n\nsaid decision,         did not arise for decision in that case\n\nand therefore that reference          is not the law and Justice K.\n\nPadmanabhan Nair in Rojo George&#x27;s case (supra) (2006(2) KLT\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">197) considered all the relevant aspect           upheld the Narco\n\nAnalysis Test and therefore the petitions are           only to be\n\ndismissed.       Learned counsel appearing for the CBI also\n\npointed out that no fraud was played on the court and the\n\nreply refusing the consent by the petitioners were received\n\nsubsequent to the filing of the petition before the learned\n\nMagistrate and therefore there is no suppression which\n\ncould be termed as playing            fraud.   It was also pointed\n\nout that the application filed before the CBI is not in\n\nviolation of any         undertaking given to the Division Bench\n\nas canvassed       and   as   held   by  the  various  High  Courts\n\nconducting Narco Analysis test would come within the ambit\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 53</a> of             Code of Criminal Procedure and is\n\nperfectly legal and therefore the petitions are only to be\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">Crl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 8\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">      7. The dead body of deceased Abhaya who was then a\n\nstudent of pre-degree at B.C.M. College, Kottayam was found\n\nin a well in the Convent premises on 27.3.1992.           The case\n\nwas   originally      investigated     by  the  local  police  and\n\nthereafter by the Crime Branch.         Finally investigation   was\n\nentrusted to the C.B.I who took over the investigation on\n\n29.3.1993.     The   C.B.I    submitted     a  final  report  under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_21\">section 173(2)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure which was not\n\naccepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate who             directed\n\nwhich was also not accepted and further investigation was\n\nordered.      Another final report, the third       was filed   on\n\n30.8.2005 where the Investigating Agency concluded that\n\ndeath of     sister Abhaya was not a suicide but      homicide and\n\ninspite of best efforts the culprits could not be traced.\n\nChief     Judicial       Magistrate     again   directed   further\n\ninvestigation       holding    that   by    employment  of  latest\n\nscientific methods like           narco analysis test (truth serum\n\ntest) the culprits could be found out.          Subsequently narco\n\nanalysis     test   was    conducted   on  two  suspected  persons.\n\nWhile granting bail to those accused, after          verifying the\n\nCase Diary a learned single Judge of this court remind the\n\nInvestigating Agency         the importance of    scientific tests\n\nto find out the real culprits.              C.B.I thereafter sent\n\ncommunications to the petitioners requesting them to give\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 9\n\nwritten consent for narco analysis          or any other scientific\n\ntest,     on    or   before      9.3.2009.   Crl.M.P.2696/2009  was\n\nthereafter     filed     by   C.B.I,   before  the  Chief  Judicial\n\nMagistrate requesting permission to conduct narco analysis\n\ntest on the petitioners and two others stating that their\n\nconsent was sought for and out of the four Sri.Samuel is\n\nill and is on continuous            Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis.\n\nStating that        Forensic Science Laboratory, Ahammedabad is\n\nwell equipped to conduct the scientific test,            permission\n\nwas sought for to conduct           narco analysis test at Forensic\n\nScience    Laboratory,      Ahammadabad   on  the  petitioners  and\n\nSri.K.T.     Maichel,     who    is  a  retired  Superintendent  of\n\nPolice. The application was allowed under Annexure V order.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      8.    Narco analysis test is conducted at the Forensic\n\nScience Laboratory          following the procedure provided in\n\nForensic Narco Analysis            Laboratory Procedure prescribed\n\npublished     by   the   Directorate    of  Forensic  Science,  New\n\nDelhi.         Crime    investigators    are  utilising  the  narco\n\nanalysis test, being a scientific procedure, to obtain\n\nrelevant     and   necessary     informations  from  an  individual\n\nbeing    a   suspect     or   a   witness  or  an  accused  or  the\n\ncomplainant which will not otherwise be available.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      9.   Before    considering     the  argument  raised  by  the\n\ncounsel for the petitioners and respondents it is to be\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 10\n\nborn in mind that in this petitions it is not necessary to\n\ndecide     the evidentiary value of the result/report of the\n\nnarco analysis test and              whether it is admissible in\n\nevidence or not. Those are            matters to be decided at the\n\ntime of trial and            not at the stage of investigation.\n\nTherefore the argument raised against the admissibility of\n\nthe report/result of the narco analysis test is not a\n\nrelevant aspect to be considered in these petitions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1326456\" id=\"span_4\">10.

Holding that\n\nscientific tests like polygraph, brain mapping and           narco\n\nanalysis are to be used by the investigating agency as they\n\nare not violative of the fundamental rights enshrined the\n\nConstitution, C.B.I was permitted to conduct the narco\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 11\n\nanalysis test on the suspect.</span>           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"523959\" id=\"span_5\">The argument of the learned\n\nsenior counsel is that the learned Judge omitted to take\n\nnote of the Division Bench decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/523959/\" id=\"a_27\">Sekharan</a>&#x27;s case (1979 KLT 337) and therefore <a href=\"/doc/523959/\" id=\"a_28\">the said\n\ndecision</a> cannot be followed.           The argument was built up on\n\nparagraph 31 of the Division Bench decision.              True, in\n\nParagraph 31        while discussing about the advancement of\n\nscience    and    technology      vis-a-vis  use  of  third  degree\n\nmethods for investigation it was observed that use of Narco\n\nanalysis,      Hypnosis     and    Lie-detector   apparatus  called\n\nPolygraph     and   administration      of truth  drugs  and  truth\n\nserums to get at the truth from the accused are inhuman and\n\nunethical and these methods adversely affect the health of\n\nthe accused on whom they are            employed and often produce\n\ndiseases.      It was also       observed that all these tests may\n\nserve truth but they are against the fundamental human\n\nrights of an accused and            Amercican courts do not permit\n\nadmission of such evidence with the result that an accused\n\nwho is really guilty is allowed to go scot-free on account\n\nof the conduct of the police and this is a classic example\n\nof the prevalence of value of justice over value of truth.\n\nAs rightly pointed out by the learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe C.B.I, the question considered by the Division Bench\n\ntherein was neither the legality nor the           admissibility of\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 12\n\na   narco     analysis     test.

The argument is\n\nthat narco analysis test is conducted by mixing 3 grams of\n\nSodium Pentothal or Sodium Amytal dissolved in 3000 ml. of\n\ndistilled water and due to the effect of bio-molecules on\n\nthe bio activity of an individual, as the drug depresses\n\nthe central nervous system, lowers blood pressure and slows\n\nthe heart rate, putting the subject into hypnotic trance\n\nresulting in a lack of inhibition. Relying on the opinion\n\nof Dr.     B.   Umadathan,      Professor  and Forensic Medicine,\n\nAmritha Institute of Medical Science, it was held that it\n\nmay even cause cardiac arrest,          as the expert stated that\n\nhe is aware of cases where the person subjected to narco\n\nanalysis test       lived like vegetable subsequent to the test.\n\nIt is therefore argued that conducting such a test against\n\nthe wishes of the petitioners is illegal and may not be\n\npermitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      21.

Though learned senior counsel relied on the\n\nopinion of Dr.Umadathan and in general submitted that narco\n\nanalysis       is a health hazard, no material based on proper\n\nscientific study was placed to hold that            narco analysis\n\nis a health hazard.         The opinion of the expert could have\n\nbeen accepted, if it is            based on a scientific study on\n\nseveral persons who were subject to the narco analysis test\n\nand that too considering their           health condition prior to\n\nand subsequent to the test.             Even if a cardiac arrest\n\nresulted subsequent to a narco analysis test,unless it is\n\nestablished there is direct nexus           for the cardiac arrest\n\nand    the    test    conducted,     for  the   sole  reason   that\n\nsubsequently the person subject to narco analysis had a\n\ncardiac arrest it cannot be concluded that it is because of\n\nthe narco analysis test.          Learned counsel appearing for the\n\nC.B.I also pointed out that              narco analysis test was\n\nconducted on the three accused in this case           and they did\n\nnot experience any health hazard.          It was also pointed out\n\nthat eventhough narco analysis test was proposed to be\n\nconducted to one Augustine           due to his health conditions,\n\nhe was not subjected to narco analysis          and therefore there\n\nis no reason to presume that             narco analysis   would be\n\nconducted on the petitioners, if their health condition do\n\nnot permit it.      Therefore on that ground also I do not find\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 30\n\nany   reason      to  interfere     with  the  order.     Justice\n\nPadmanabhan Nair in <a href=\"/doc/1326456/\" id=\"a_102\">Rojo George</a>&#x27;s case (supra)         considered\n\nthe plea that narco analysis is a health hazard        and found\n\nthat an expert in the field only        after taking all possible\n\nprecautions would conduct the test and therefore on the\n\nhealth grounds          permission granted to C.B.I cannot be\n\ninterfered.</span>        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1326456\" id=\"span_20\">I agree with the view expressed in <a href=\"/doc/1326456/\" id=\"a_103\">Rojo\n\nGeorge</a>&#x27;s case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      23. Though the order was challenged on the ground that\n\nthe application was filed in violation of the order passed\n\nby the Division Bench in W.P.(C) 35392/2008 filed by the\n\npetitioners, as rightly pointed out by the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the C.B.I the undertaking given by the C.B.I\n\nwas to the effect           that they will follow the mandate of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 161</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure while questioning\n\nthe lady witnesses.          As I have already found that taking\n\nwitnesses to Ahammedabad for conducting narco analysis is\n\nnot violative of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 161</a> of Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure,        permission sought for by the C.B.I and\n\ngranted by the court cannot be challenged on the ground\n\nthat it is violative of the undertaking given.          Moreover,\n\nthe C.B.I has only proposed to conduct the test         with the\n\npermission of the Chief Judicial Magistrate and          for the\n\nreason that the undertaking given to the Division Bench was\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 31\n\nnot mentioned in the application filed before the Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate, it           cannot be said that   fraud was\n\nplayed on the court.            As stated earlier, the C.B.I has\n\nalready explained           that the non-mentioning of letters\n\nreceived from the petitioners, refusing to give consent for\n\nthe narco analysis test is because they were received only\n\nsubsequent to the filing of the application.              In such\n\ncircumstance, it cannot be said that the order was obtained\n\nby the C.B.I playing fraud on the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">      24. The narco analysis test permitted to be conducted\n\non the petitioners is only as a step in aid for the\n\ninvestigation.        The Investigating Agency is to be allowed\n\nto explore all avenues permissible under law to arrive at\n\nthe truth. It is to be borne in mind that this is a case\n\nwhich is being investigated by different Investigating\n\nAgencies for the last several years and is keenly watched\n\nby the public in their anxiety to see that truth is\n\nunveiled and justice is done.              If the narco analysis\n\nyields     some     positive     results   which would   aid   the\n\nInvestigating Agency to arrive at the truth, it is to be\n\npermitted. When it is found that narco analysis is not a\n\nhealth     hazard,    the     stiff   resistance offered  by   the\n\npetitioners cannot be appreciated.         It is for their benefit\n\nalso to disclose all the relevant informations and facts\n\f\nCrl.M.C.1218/2009 &amp; W.P.(C)8273/2009 32\n\nknown to them.        If they have nothing to hide, I find no\n\nreason why they are hesitant to undergo the narco analysis.\n\nWhen    the   rights     of   the   petitioners  pressed in  these\n\npetitions is balanced with the benefit derived by the\n\nInvestigating Agency and the administration of criminal\n\njustice, I find no reason to accept the objections raised\n\nby the petitioners. When the objection raised by the\n\npetitioners is appreciated vis-a-vis the necessity for\n\narriving      at    the    truth     after  proper   investigation,\n\npermission      granted     by   the   Chief  Judicial  Magistrate,\n\nErnakulam to the Investigating Agency to conduct             narco\n\nanalysis     test   on     the   petitioners    does  not  warrant\n\ninterference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">      Petitions are dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">                                            M.SASIDHARAN NAMBIAR\n                                                      JUDGE\ntpl/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">      After     the   order     was   pronounced,  learned  counsel\n\nappearing     for   petitioners      orally  applied  to   issue  a\n\ncertificate as provided under <a href=\"/doc/952725/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 134-A</a> that the case\n\ninvolves     a    substantial      question  of   law  of   general\n\nimportance as provided under <a href=\"/doc/34776269/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 132(1)</a> of Constitution\n\nof India.
