We are, in these appeals, concerned with the question  whether  a  co-\noperative society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_1\">Kerala  Co-operative  Societies  Act,\n1969</a> (for short “the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_2\">Societies Act</a>”) will  fall  within  the  definition  of\n“public authority” under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Right to Information Act,  2005\n(for short “the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">RTI Act</a>”)  and  be  bound  by  the  obligations  to  provide\ninformation sought for by a citizen under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"322018\" id=\"span_1\">3.    A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court, in  its  judgment  reported  in\nAIR 2012 Ker 124, answered the question in the affirmative  and  upheld  the\nCircular No.23 of 2006 dated 01.06.2006, issued by the Registrar of the  Co-\noperative Societies, Kerala stating that all the  co-operative  institutions\ncoming under the  administrative  control  of  the  Registrar,  are  “public\nauthorities” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act  and  obliged\nto provide information as sought for.  The  question  was  answered  by  the\nFull Bench in view of the conflicting views expressed by  a  Division  Bench\nof the Kerala High Court in Writ Appeal No.1688 of  2009,  with  an  earlier\njudgment of the Division Bench reported in <a href=\"/doc/322018/\" id=\"a_7\">Thalapalam  Service  Co-operative\nBank Ltd. v.  Union of India</a> AIR 2010 Ker 6,  wherein  the  Bench  took  the\nview that the question as to whether a co-operative society will fall  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act is a question of fact, which  will  depend  upon\nthe question whether it is substantially financed, directly  or  indirectly,\nby the funds provided by the State Government which, the Court held, has  to\nbe decided depending upon the facts situation of each case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"322018\" id=\"span_2\">4.    Mr. K. Padmanabhan Nair, learned senior counsel appearing for some  of\nthe societies submitted that the views expressed by the  Division  Bench  in\n<a href=\"/doc/322018/\" id=\"a_9\">Thalapalam Service Co-operative Bank  Ltd.</a>  (supra)  is  the  correct  view,\nwhich calls for our approval.  Learned senior counsel took  us  through  the\nvarious provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_10\">Societies Act</a> as  well  as  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_11\">RTI  Act</a>  and\nsubmitted that the societies are autonomous bodies and  merely  because  the\nofficers functioning under the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_12\">Societies Act</a> have  got  supervisory  control\nover the societies will not make the  societies  public  authorities  within\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act.   Learned  senior  counsel  also\nsubmitted that these societies are not owned,  controlled  or  substantially\nfinanced, directly or indirectly, by the State Government.   Learned  senior\ncounsel also submitted that the societies are not statutory bodies  and  are\nnot performing any public functions and will not come within the  expression\n“state” within the meaning under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.     Mr.  Ramesh  Babu  MR,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  State,\nsupported the reasoning of the impugned judgment and submitted that  such  a\ncircular was issued by the Registrar taking into  consideration  the  larger\npublic interest so as to promote  transparency  and  accountability  in  the\nworking of every co-operative society in the  State  of  Kerala.   Reference\nwas also made to various provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_15\">Societies Act</a> and submitted  that\nthose provisions would indicate that the Registrar  has  got  all  pervading\ncontrol over the societies, including audit, enquiry and inspection and  the\npower to initiate surcharge  proceedings.   Power  is  also  vested  on  the\nRegistrar under <a href=\"/doc/107225144/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 32</a> of the Societies Act to supersede the  management\nof the society and to appoint an administrator.  This  would  indicate  that\nthough societies are body corporates, they are under the  statutory  control\nof the Registrar of Co-operative Societies.  Learned counsel submitted  that\nin such a situation they fall under  the  definition  of  “pubic  authority”\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 2(h)</a> of the  RTI  Act.    Shri  Ajay,  learned\ncounsel appearing for the State  Information  Commission,  stated  that  the\napplicability of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a> cannot  be  excluded  in  terms  of  the  clear\nprovision of the Act and they are to be interpreted to  achieve  the  object\nand purpose of the Act.  Learned counsel submitted that at any  rate  having\nregard to the definition of “information” in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(f)</a> of  the  Act,  the\naccess to information in  relation  to  Societies  cannot  be  denied  to  a\ncitizen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Facts:\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">6.    We may, for  the  disposal  of  these  appeals,  refer  to  the  facts\npertaining to Mulloor Rural Co-operative Society Ltd.   In  that  case,  one\nSunil Kumar stated to have filed an application  dated  8.5.2007  under  the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_20\">RTI Act</a> seeking  particulars  relating  to  the  bank  accounts  of  certain\nmembers of the society, which the society did  not  provide.    Sunil  Kumar\nthen filed a complaint dated 6.8.2007  to  the  State  Information  Officer,\nKerala who, in turn, addressed a letter  dated  14.11.2007  to  the  Society\nstating  that  application  filed  by  Sunil  Kumar  was  left   unattended.\nSociety, then, vide letter dated 24.11.2007 informed the applicant that  the\ninformation sought for  is  “confidential  in  nature”  and  one  warranting\n“commercial confidence”.    Further,  it  was  also  pointed  out  that  the\ndisclosure of the information has no relationship to any  “public  activity”\nand held by the society in a “fiduciary capacity”.   Society  was,  however,\nserved with an order dated 16.1.2008 by the  State  Information  Commission,\nKerala, stating that the Society has violated the  mandatory  provisions  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1581683/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 7(1)</a> of the RTI Act  rendering  themselves  liable  to  be  punished\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 20</a> of the Act.   State Information  Officer  is  purported  to\nhave relied upon a  circular  No.23/2006  dated  01.06.2006  issued  by  the\nRegistrar, Co-operative  Societies  bringing  in  all  societies  under  the\nadministrative control  of  the  Registrar  of  Co-operative  Societies,  as\n“public authorities” under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">7.    Mulloor Co-operative Society then filed Writ Petition No.3351 of  2008\nchallenging the order dated 16.1.2008, which was heard by a  learned  Single\nJudge of the High Court along with other writ petitions.  All the  petitions\nwere disposed of by a common judgment dated 03.04.2009 holding that all  co-\noperative  societies  registered  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_24\">Societies   Act</a>   are   public\nauthorities for the purpose  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">RTI  Act</a>  and  are  bound  to  act  in\nconformity with the obligations in Chapter 11 of the  Act  and  amenable  to\nthe jurisdiction of the  State  Information  Commission.  The  Society  then\npreferred Writ Appeal No.1688 of 2009.  While that appeal was  pending,  few\nother appeals including  WA  No.1417  of  2009,  filed  against  the  common\njudgment  of  the  learned  Single  Judge  dated  03.04.2009  came  up   for\nconsideration before another Division Bench of  the  High  Court  which  set\naside the judgment  of  the  learned  Single  Judge  dated  03.04.2009,  the\njudgment of which is reported in AIR 2010 Ker 6.  The Bench  held  that  the\nobedience to Circular No.23 dated 1.6.2006 is optional in the sense that  if\nthe Society feels that it satisfies the definition of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(h)</a>,  it  can\nappoint an  Information  Officer  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_27\">RTI  Act</a>  or  else  the  State\nInformation Commissioner will decide when the  matter  reaches  before  him,\nafter examining the question whether the Society is substantially  financed,\ndirectly or indirectly, by the funds provided by the State Government.   The\nDivision Bench, therefore, held that the question whether the Society  is  a\npublic authority or not under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 2(h)</a> is a disputed  question  of  fact\nwhich has to be resolved by the authorities under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_29\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">8.    Writ Appeal No.1688 of 2009 later  came  up  before  another  Division\nBench, the Bench expressed some reservations about the  views  expressed  by\nthe earlier Division Bench in Writ Appeal  No.1417  of  2009  and  vide  its\norder dated 24.3.2011 referred the matter to a Full Bench,  to  examine  the\nquestion whether co-operative societies registered under the  <a href=\"/doc/151469296/\" id=\"a_30\">Societies  Act</a>\nare generally covered under the definition of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 2(h)</a> of the  RTI  Act.\nThe Full Bench answered the question in the  affirmative  giving  a  liberal\nconstruction  of  the  words  “public  authority”,  bearing  in   mind   the\n“transformation of law” which, according to the Full Bench,  is  to  achieve\ntransparency and accountability with regard to affairs of a public body.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">9.    We notice, the issue  raised  in  these  appeals  is  of  considerable\nimportance and may have impact on similar other Societies  registered  under\nthe various State enactments across the country.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">10.   The State of  Kerala  has  issued  a  letter  dated  5.5.2006  to  the\nRegistrar of Co-operative Societies, Kerala with reference to the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_32\">RTI  Act</a>,\nwhich led to the issuance of Circular  No.23/2006  dated  01.06.2006,  which\nreads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">“G1/40332/05\n                                        Registrar of Co-operative Societies,\n                                        Thiruvananthapuram, Dated 01.06.2006\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             Circular No.23/2006</span>\n\nSub: <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_33\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>- Co-operative Institutions included in\nthe definition of “Public Authority”\n\nRef: Governments Letter No.3159/P.<a href=\"/doc/157605/\" id=\"a_34\">S.1</a>/06\n      Dated 05.05.2006\n\nAccording to Right to Information Act, 2005,  sub-section  (1)  and  (2)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 5</a> of the  Act  severy  public  authority  within  100  days  of  the\nenactment of this Act designate  as  many  officers  as  public  information\nofficers as may be necessary to provide information  to  persons  requesting\nfor  information  under  the  Act.

It is not in dispute that the Society  has  not  been  constituted\n      under an Act. Its functions like any  other  cooperative  society  are\n      mainly regulated in terms of the provisions  of  the  Act,  except  as\n      provided in the bye-laws of the Society. The State has no say  in  the\n      functions of the Society. Membership, acquisition of  shares  and  all\n      other matters are governed by the bye-laws framed under the  Act.  The\n      terms and  conditions  of  an  officer  of  the  cooperative  society,\n      indisputably, are governed by the Rules. Rule 56, to  which  reference\n      has been made by Mr Vijay Kumar, does not  contain  any  provision  in\n      terms whereof any legal right as such is conferred upon an officer  of\n      the Society.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      10. It has not been shown before  us  that  the  State  exercises  any\n      direct or indirect control over the affairs of the  Society  for  deep\n      and pervasive control. The  State  furthermore  is  not  the  majority\n      shareholder. The State has the power only to nominate one Director. It\n      cannot, thus, be said that the State exercises any functional  control\n      over the affairs of  the  Society  in  the  sense  that  the  majority\n      Directors are nominated by the State. For arriving at  the  conclusion\n      that the State has a deep and  pervasive  control  over  the  Society,\n      several other  relevant  questions  are  required  to  be  considered,\n      namely, (1) How was the Society created? (2)  Whether  it  enjoys  any\n      monopoly character? (3) Do the functions of  the  Society  partake  to\n      statutory  functions  or  public  functions?  and  (4)   Can   it   be\n      characterised as public authority?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      11.

Control, therefore, is  not  merely\n      the power to  arrange  the  day  to  day  working  of  the  court  but\n      contemplates disciplinary jurisdiction over the presiding Judge.... In\n      our judgment, the control which is vested  in  the  High  Court  is  a\n      complete control subject only to the power  of  the  Governor  in  the\n      matter of appointment (including dismissal and  removal)  and  posting\n      and promotion of District Judges.

We are of the opinion that when we  test  the  meaning  of  expression\n“controlled”  which  figures  in  between  the  words   “body   owned”   and\n“substantially financed”, the control by the appropriate government must  be\na control of a substantial nature.  The mere ‘supervision’  or  ‘regulation’\nas such by a statute or otherwise of a body  would  not  make  that  body  a\n“public authority” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the RTI  Act.\n In other words just like a body owned or  body  substantially  financed  by\nthe appropriate government, the control  of  the  body  by  the  appropriate\ngovernment  would  also  be  substantial  and  not  merely  supervisory   or\nregulatory.  Powers exercised by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies  and\nothers  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_106\">Cooperative  Societies  Act</a>  are  only   regulatory   or\nsupervisory in nature, which will not amount to  dominating  or  interfering\nwith the management or affairs of  the  society  so  as  to  be  controlled.\nManagement  and  control  are  statutorily  conferred  on   the   Management\nCommittee or the Board  of  Directors  of  the  Society  by  the  respective\n<a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_107\">Cooperative Societies Act</a> and not on the authorities under the  <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_108\">Co-operative\nSocieties Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">35.   We are, therefore, of the view that  the  word  “controlled”  used  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act has to be understood in the context  in  which\nit has been used vis-a-vis a body owned or  substantially  financed  by  the\nappropriate government, that is the control of the body is of such a  degree\nwhich amounts to substantial control over the management and affairs of  the\nbody.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">SUBSTANTIALLY FINANCED\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">36.    The  words  “substantially  financed”  have  been  used  in  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_110\">Sections\n2(h)(d)(i)</a> &amp; (ii), while defining the expression public  authority  as  well\nas in <a href=\"/doc/425882/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act, while defining  the  expression  “appropriate\nGovernment”.  A body can be substantially financed, directly  or  indirectly\nby  funds  provided  by  the   appropriate   Government.    The   expression\n“substantially financed”, as such, has  not  been  defined  under  the  Act.\n“Substantial” means “in a substantial manner so as to be substantial”.    In\nPalser v. Grimling (1948) 1 All  ER  1,  11  (HL),  while  interpreting  the\nprovisions of Section 10(1) of the Rent and Mortgage  Interest  Restrictions\nAct, 1923, the House of Lords held that “substantial” is  not  the  same  as\n“not unsubstantial” i.e. just enough to  avoid  the  de  minimis  principle.\nThe word “substantial” literally means  solid,  massive  etc.    Legislature\nhas used the expression “substantially financed” in Sections 2(h)(d)(i)  and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">(ii) indicating that the degree  of  financing  must  be  actual,  existing,\npositive  and  real  to  a  substantial  extent,  not  moderate,   ordinary,\ntolerable etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">37.   We often use the  expressions  “questions  of  law”  and  “substantial\nquestions of law” and explain that any question of law affecting  the  right\nof parties would not by  itself  be  a  substantial  question  of  law.   In\nBlack&#x27;s Law Dictionary (6th Edn.), the word &#x27;substantial&#x27; is defined as  &#x27;of\nreal worth and importance; of considerable  value;  valuable.  Belonging  to\nsubstance; actually existing; real: not seeming or imaginary; not  illusive;\nsolid;  true;  veritable.  Something  worthwhile   as   distinguished   from\nsomething without value or merely nominal. Synonymous  with  material.&#x27;  The\nword  &#x27;substantially&#x27;  has  been  defined  to  mean  &#x27;essentially;   without\nmaterial qualification; in the main; in substance;  materially.&#x27;     In  the\nShorter Oxford English Dictionary (5th Edn.), the word  &#x27;substantial&#x27;  means\n&#x27;of ample or considerable amount of size;  sizeable,  fairly  large;  having\nsolid worth or  value,  of  real  significance;  sold;  weighty;  important,\nworthwhile; of an act, measure  etc.  having  force  or  effect,  effective,\nthorough.&#x27; The word &#x27;substantially&#x27; has been defined to mean &#x27;in  substance;\nas a substantial thing or being; essentially, intrinsically.&#x27; Therefore  the\nword &#x27;substantial&#x27; is not synonymous with &#x27;dominant&#x27; or  &#x27;majority&#x27;.  It  is\ncloser  to  &#x27;material&#x27;  or   &#x27;important&#x27;   or   &#x27;of   considerable   value.&#x27;\n&#x27;Substantially&#x27;  is  closer  to  &#x27;essentially&#x27;.    Both  words  can  signify\nvarying degrees depending on the context.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">38.   Merely providing subsidiaries, grants,  exemptions,  privileges  etc.,\nas such, cannot be said to be providing funding  to  a  substantial  extent,\nunless the record shows that the funding was  so  substantial  to  the  body\nwhich practically runs by such funding and but for such  funding,  it  would\nstruggle to exist.   The State may also float  many  schemes  generally  for\nthe betterment and welfare of the cooperative sector like deposit  guarantee\nscheme, scheme of assistance from  NABARD  etc.,  but  those  facilities  or\nassistance cannot  be  termed  as  “substantially  financed”  by  the  State\nGovernment to bring the body within the fold  of  “public  authority”  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act.  But,  there  are  instances,  where  private\neducational institutions getting ninety five per cent grant-in-aid from  the\nappropriate government, may answer the definition of public authority  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">39.   The  term  “Non-Government  Organizations”  (NGO),  as  such,  is  not\ndefined under the Act.  But, over a period of time, the expression  has  got\nits own meaning and, it has to be seen in that context,  when  used  in  the\nAct.   Government used  to  finance  substantially,  several  non-government\norganizations, which carry on various social and welfare  activities,  since\nthose  organizations  sometimes  carry  on  functions  which  are  otherwise\ngovernmental.   Now, the question, whether an  NGO  has  been  substantially\nfinanced or not by the appropriate Government, may be a  question  of  fact,\nto be examined by the authorities  concerned  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_114\">RTI  Act</a>.     Such\norganization can be substantially financed either directly or indirectly  by\nfunds provided by the appropriate Government.  Government may not  have  any\nstatutory control over the NGOs, as such, still it can be  established  that\na particular NGO has been substantially financed directly or  indirectly  by\nthe funds provided by the appropriate Government, in  such  an  event,  that\norganization will fall within the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 2(h)(d)(ii)</a>  of  the  RTI\nAct.   Consequently, even private organizations which are, though not  owned\nor controlled but substantially financed by the appropriate Government  will\nalso  fall  within  the  definition  of  “public  authority”  under  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_116\">Section\n2(h)(d)(ii)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">BURDEN TO SHOW:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">40.   The burden to show that a body is owned, controlled  or  substantially\nfinanced or that a non-government  organization  is  substantially  financed\ndirectly or indirectly by the funds provided by the  appropriate  Government\nis on the applicant who seeks information or the appropriate Government  and\ncan  be  examined  by  the  State  Information  Commission  or  the  Central\nInformation Commission as the case may be, when the question  comes  up  for\nconsideration.   A body or NGO is also free to  establish  that  it  is  not\nowned, controlled or substantially financed directly or  indirectly  by  the\nappropriate Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">41.   Powers have been conferred on the Central Information Commissioner  or\nthe State Information Commissioner under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 18</a> of the  Act  to  inquire\ninto any complaint received from any person and the reason for  the  refusal\nto access to any information requested from  a  body  owned,  controlled  or\nsubstantially  financed,  or  a  non-government  organization  substantially\nfinanced directly or indirectly by the funds  provided  by  the  appropriate\nGovernment.  <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 19</a> of the  Act  provides  for  an  appeal  against  the\ndecision of  the  Central  Information  Officer  or  the  State  Information\nOfficer to such officer who is senior in rank  to  the  Central  Information\nOfficer or the State Information Officer,  as  the  case  may  be,  in  each\npublic authority.   Therefore, there is inbuilt mechanism in the Act  itself\nto examine whether a body is owned, controlled or substantially financed  or\nan NGO is substantially financed, directly or indirectly, by funds  provided\nby the appropriate authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"> 42.  Legislative intention is clear and is discernible  from  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_119\">Section  2(h)</a>\nthat intends to include various categories, discussed earlier.  It is  trite\nlaw that the primarily language employed is the determinative factor of  the\nlegislative intention and the intention of the legislature must be found  in\nthe words used by the legislature itself.  In Magor and  St.  Mellons  Rural\nDistrict Council v. New Port Corporation (1951)  2  All  ER  839(HL)  stated\nthat the courts  are  warned  that  they  are  not  entitled  to  usurp  the\nlegislative function under the guise  of  interpretation.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"699436\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1791620\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"30721\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147832\" id=\"span_23\">This  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/147832/\" id=\"a_120\">D.A.

It is trite law that  words  of  a  statute\nare clear, plain and unambiguous i.e. they  are  reasonably  susceptible  to\nonly one meaning, the courts are  bound  to  give  effect  to  that  meaning\nirrespective of the consequences,  meaning  thereby  when  the  language  is\nclear and unambiguous and  admits  of  only  one  meaning,  no  question  of\nconstruction of a statute arises, for the statute speaks for  itself.</span></span></span></span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1057826\" id=\"span_24\">This\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1057826/\" id=\"a_124\">Kanai Lal Sur v.

We are of the view that the High Court has given a complete go-bye  to\nthe above-mentioned statutory principles and  gone  at  a  tangent  by  mis-\ninterpreting the meaning and content of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act.   Court\nhas given a liberal construction  to  expression  “public  authority”  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act, bearing in mind the  “transformation  of  law”  and\nits “ultimate object” i.e. to  achieve  “transparency  and  accountability”,\nwhich according to the court could alone advance the objective of  the  Act.\nFurther, the High Court has also opined that <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_127\">RTI Act</a> will certainly help  as\na protection against the  mismanagement  of  the  society  by  the  managing\ncommittee and the society’s liabilities and that  vigilant  members  of  the\npublic body by obtaining information through the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_128\">RTI Act</a>, will  be  able  to\ndetect and prevent mismanagement in  time.   In  our  view,  the  categories\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act exhaust themselves, hence, there is  no\nquestion of adopting  a  liberal  construction  to  the  expression  “public\nauthority” to bring in other categories into its fold, which do not  satisfy\nthe tests we have laid down.  Court  cannot,  when  language  is  clear  and\nunambiguous, adopt such a construction which, according to the Court,  would\nonly advance the objective of the Act. We are  also  aware  of  the  opening\npart of the definition clause which states  “unless  the  context  otherwise\nrequires”.   No  materials  have  been  made  available  to  show  that  the\ncooperative societies, with which we are concerned, in the  context  of  the\nAct, would fall within the definition of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">Right to Information and the Right to Privacy\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">44.

Consequently,  though  right  to  get  information  is   a\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_139\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>  of  the  Constitution,\nlimits are being prescribed under  the  Act  itself,  which  are  reasonable\nrestrictions within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_140\">Article  19(2)</a>  of  the  Constitution  of\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">46.    Right  to  privacy  is  also  not  expressly  guaranteed  under   the\nConstitution of India.  However, the Privacy Bill, 2011 to provide  for  the\nright to privacy to citizens  of  India  and  to  regulate  the  collection,\nmaintenance  and  dissemination  of  their  personal  information  and   for\npenalization for violation of such rights and matters  connected  therewith,\nis pending.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"698472\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572071\" id=\"span_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_31\">In several judgments including  <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_141\">Kharak  Singh  Vs.

Bharat Shanti Lal Shah and others</a> (2008) 13 SCC  5,\nthis Court has recognized the  right  to  privacy  as  a  fundamental  right\nemanating from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   Right  to  privacy\nis also recognized as a basic human right under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 12</a> of the  Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights Act, 1948, which states as follows:</span></span></span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">      “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,\n      family, home or correspondence, not to  attack  upon  his  honour  and\n      reputation.  Everyone has the right to the protection of  law  against\n      such interference or attacks.”\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 17</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/8475620/\" id=\"a_148\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  Act,\n1966</a>, to which India is a party also  protects  that  right  and  states  as\nfollows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"14042890\" id=\"span_32\">“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference  with\n      his privacy, family, home and correspondence nor to  unlawful  attacks\n      on his honour and reputation….”\n\nThis Court in <a href=\"/doc/14042890/\" id=\"a_149\">R. Rajagopal</a>  (supra) held as follows :-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      “The right to privacy is implicit in the right  to  life  and  liberty\n      guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_150\">Article  21.</a>   It  is  a\n      “right to be let alone”. A  citizen  has  a  right  to  safeguard  the\n      privacy of his own, his  family,  marriage,  procreation,  motherhood,\n      child bearing and education among other matters.”\n\n\n\nRestrictions and Limitations:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">47.   Right  to  information  and  Right  to  privacy  are,  therefore,  not\nabsolute rights, both the rights, one of which falls under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_151\">Article  19(1)(a)</a>\nand the other under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India,  can  obviously\nbe regulated, restricted  and  curtailed  in  the  larger  public  interest.\nAbsolute or uncontrolled individual rights do not and cannot  exist  in  any\nmodern State.  Citizens’ right to get information is statutorily  recognized\nby the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_153\">RTI Act</a>, but at the same time limitations are also  provided  in  the\nAct itself, which is discernible from the Preamble and other  provisions  of\nthe Act.  First of all, the  scope  and  ambit  of  the  expression  “public\nauthority” has been restricted by a statutory definition under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_154\">Section  2(h)</a>\nlimiting it to  the  categories  mentioned  therein  which  exhaust  itself,\nunless the context otherwise requires.   Citizens, as already  indicated  by\nus, have a right to get  information,  but  can  have  access  only  to  the\ninformation “held” and under  the  “control  of  public  authorities”,  with\nlimitations.  If the information is not statutorily accessible by  a  public\nauthority,  as  defined  in  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_155\">Section  2(h)</a>  of  the  Act,  evidently,  those\ninformation will not  be  under  the  “control  of  the  public  authority”.\nResultantly, it will not be possible for the citizens to  secure  access  to\nthose information which are not under the control of the  public  authority.\nCitizens, in that event, can always claim a right to privacy, the  right  of\na citizen to access information should be respected,  so  also  a  citizen’s\nright to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">48.   Public authority also is  not  legally  obliged  to  give  or  provide\ninformation even if it is held, or under its control,  if  that  information\nfalls under clause (j) of Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_156\">Section  8</a>.    <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_157\">Section  8(1)(j)</a>\nis of considerable importance so far as this case is concerned, hence  given\nbelow, for ready reference:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      “8.   Exemption from disclosure of information – (1)   Notwithstanding\n      anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation  to  give\n      any citizen –\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      (a) to (i)  xxx  xxx   xxx\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      (j) information which relates to personal information  the  disclosure\n      of which has no relationship to any public activity  or  interest,  or\n      which  would  cause  unwarranted  invasion  of  the  privacy  of   the\n      individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the  State\n      Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may\n      be, is  satisfied  that  the  larger  public  interest  justifies  the\n      disclosure of such information: Provided that  the  information  which\n      cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be\n      denied to any person.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">49.   <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 8</a> begins with a non obstante clause, which gives that  Section\nan overriding effect, in case of conflict, over the other provisions of  the\nAct.  Even if, there is any indication to the contrary, still  there  is  no\nobligation on the public authority to give information  to  any  citizen  of\nwhat has been mentioned in  clauses  (a)  to  (j).    Public  authority,  as\nalready  indicated,  cannot  access  all  the  information  from  a  private\nindividual, but only those information which he is legally obliged  to  pass\non to a public authority by law, and also only those  information  to  which\nthe public authority can have access in accordance  with  law.   Even  those\ninformation, if personal in nature, can be made available  only  subject  to\nthe limitations provided in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 8(j)</a> of the RTI Act.  Right to  be  left\nalone, as propounded in Olmstead v.  The  United  States  reported  in  1927\n(277) US 438 is the most comprehensive of the  rights  and  most  valued  by\ncivilized man.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_33\">50.   Recognizing the fact that the right to privacy is a  sacrosanct  facet\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 21</a> of  the  Constitution,  the  legislation  has  put  a  lot  of\nsafeguards to protect the rights under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 8(j)</a>, as  already  indicated.\nIf the information sought for is personal and has no relationship  with  any\npublic  activity  or  interest  or  it  will  not  sub-serve  larger  public\ninterest, the public authority or  the  officer  concerned  is  not  legally\nobliged to provide those information.  Reference may be  made  to  a  recent\njudgment  of  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_162\">Girish  Ramchandra   Deshpande   v.   Central\nInformation Commissioner and others</a> (2013) 1 SCC  212,  wherein  this  Court\nheld  that  since  there  is  no  bona  fide  public  interest  in   seeking\ninformation, the disclosure of  said  information  would  cause  unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy of the individual under  <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_163\">Section  8(1)(j)</a>  of  the  Act.\nFurther, if the authority finds that information  sought  for  can  be  made\navailable in the larger public interest, then the officer should record  his\nreasons in writing before providing  the  information,  because  the  person\nfrom whom information is sought for, has also a right to privacy  guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\">51.   We have found, on facts, that the Societies,  in  these  appeals,  are\nnot public authorities and,  hence,  not  legally  obliged  to  furnish  any\ninformation sought for by a citizen under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_165\">RTI Act</a>.   All  the  same,  if\nthere is any dispute on facts as  to  whether  a  particular  Society  is  a\npublic authority or not, the State Information Commission  can  examine  the\nsame and find out whether the Society in question satisfies  the  test  laid\nin this judgment.   Now, the next question is whether  a  citizen  can  have\naccess to any information  of  these  Societies  through  the  Registrar  of\nCooperative Societies, who is a  public  authority  within  the  meaning  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">Registrar of Cooperative Societies\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">52.   Registrar of Cooperative Societies functioning under  the  <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_167\">Cooperative\nSocieties Act</a> is a public authority within the meaning of  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_168\">Section  2(h)</a>  of\nthe Act.   As a public authority, Registrar of  Co-operative  Societies  has\nbeen conferred with lot of statutory powers under the respective  Act  under\nwhich he is  functioning.   He  is  also  duty  bound  to  comply  with  the\nobligations under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_169\">RTI Act</a> and furnish information  to  a  citizen  under\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_170\">RTI  Act</a>.   Information  which  he  is  expected  to  provide  is   the\ninformation enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_171\">Section  2(f)</a>  of  the  RTI  Act  subject  to  the\nlimitations provided under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 8</a> of the Act.   Registrar  can  also,  to\nthe extent law permits, gather information from a Society, on which  he  has\nsupervisory or administrative control under the <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_173\">Cooperative  Societies  Act</a>.\nConsequently, apart from the information  as  is  available  to  him,  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 2(f)</a>, he can also gather those information from the Society, to  the\nextent permitted by law.  Registrar is also not obliged  to  disclose  those\ninformation if those information fall under  <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_175\">Section  8(1)(j)</a>  of  the  Act.\nNo provision has been brought to our knowledge indicating  that,  under  the\n<a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_176\">Cooperative Societies Act</a>, a Registrar can call for the details of the  bank\naccounts maintained by the citizens or members in a cooperative bank.   Only\nthose information which  a  Registrar  of  Cooperative  Societies  can  have\naccess under the <a href=\"/doc/108006076/\" id=\"a_177\">Cooperative Societies Act</a> from a Society could be  said  to\nbe the  information  which  is  “held”  or  “under  the  control  of  public\nauthority”. Even those information, Registrar, as already indicated, is  not\nlegally obliged to provide if those information  falls  under  the  exempted\ncategory mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 8(j)</a> of the Act.  Apart from the Registrar  of\nCo-operative Societies, there  may  be  other  public  authorities  who  can\naccess information from a Co-operative Bank of a private account  maintained\nby a member of Society under  law,  in  the  event  of  which,  in  a  given\nsituation, the society will have to part with  that  information.   But  the\ndemand should have statutory backing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">53.   Consequently, an information which has  been  sought  for  relates  to\npersonal information, the disclosure of which has  no  relationship  to  any\npublic activity or interest or which would  cause  unwarranted  invasion  of\nthe privacy of the individual, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies,  even\nif he has got that information, is not bound  to  furnish  the  same  to  an\napplicant, unless he is satisfied that the larger public interest  justifies\nthe disclosure of such information, that too, for reasons to be recorded  in\nwriting.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">54.   We, therefore, hold that the Cooperative  Societies  registered  under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_179\">Kerala Co-operative Societies Act</a> will not fall  within  the  definition\nof “public authority” as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act  and  the\nState Government letter dated 5.5.2006 and  the  circular  dated  01.06.2006\nissued by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Kerala,  to  the  extent,\nmade applicable  to  societies  registered  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/8690867/\" id=\"a_181\">Kerala  Co-operative\nSocieties Act</a> would stand quashed in the absence of materials to  show  that\nthey are owned, controlled or  substantially  financed  by  the  appropriate\nGovernment.  Appeals are, therefore, allowed  as  above,  however,  with  no\norder as to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">                                                             ………..………………….J.\n                                                                 (K.S.\n                               Radhakrishnan)\n\n\n                                                               ……………………………J.\n                                                (A.K.
