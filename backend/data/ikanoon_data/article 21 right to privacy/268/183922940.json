He also argued that in the\n                            intercepted conversations, the Court Below has based its\n                            conclusions on the basis of conjectures and surmises since there\n                            was no categorical mention of the petitioner and further, there was\n                            no reason for them to converse in code words. He also argued that\n                            the Compact Disc on which the alleged intercepted phone calls\n                            were recorded was neither sent to CFSL nor was it used as a relied\n                            upon evidence. Thus, it was argued that the same could not have\n                            been admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 65-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                            c.    Thirdly, he also laid considerable emphasis on the seizure\n                            memoâ€Ÿs Item No. 50 regarding the alleged recovery of bribe\n                            amounting to two crores. It is the case of the Petitioner that the\n                            entry has been squeezed in the memo in order to incriminate the\n                            Petitioner notwithstanding the fact that the amount of Rs.\n                            2,17,75,000/- was well accounted for as it formed the part of the\n                            advance received by the Petitioner towards sale of his land situated\n                            at Village Maghrauli Khadar, Dospur Pargana Dadri, District\n                            Faridabad. He also submitted that the same fact has been\n                            corroborated by the witnesses who were involved in the above\n                            transaction, as well as the source of money was explained before\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                      CRL.

Further, he\n                            submitted that the Respondent has failed to produce any evidence\n                            to establish the money trail or establish any connection with the\n                            seized money and the allegations made in the chargesheet.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                            d.

The Respondent has failed to even\n                            establish involvement of any Public Servant in alleged conspiracy\n                            therefore, any prosecution/investigation under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_29\">PC Act</a> is thus\n                            void ab initio.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"73326336\" id=\"span_40\">e.    Fifthly, it was also submitted that the chargesheet was filed\n                            in violation to the CBI Manual (Crime) since the approval of the\n                            CBI director was not sought before filing the charge sheet. Thus,\n                            the proceedings have no validity in the eyes of law. To buttress the\n                            argument, reliance was placed on the judgment passed by the co-\n                            ordinate bench of this Honâ€Ÿble Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/73326336/\" id=\"a_30\">Ripun Bora v.\n                            State</a>, 2011 SCC OnLine Del 5235.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                            f.

Hence the\n                            evidence tendered by Dr. Suresh C.

The\n                            arguments raised by the petitioner have been dealt with by the\n                            Court below in its order on charge.

Thus, the issue is well-settled and the controversy qua revisional\n                      jurisdiction is set to rest with the actual position of law being that the\n                      order of framing charge or that of discharge is neither interlocutory nor\n                      final and hence, do not attract the bar of Section 397 (2) of the Code.

The whole purpose and object of framing\n                                   charges is to enable the defence to concentrate its\n                                   attention on the case that he has to meet, and if the\n                                   charge is framed in such a vague manner that the\n                                   necessary ingredients of the offence with which the\n                                   accused is convicted is not brought out in the charge\n                                   then the charge is not only defective but illegal. It is\n                                   no doubt that when the accused is charged with a\n                                   major offence, he can be convicted of a minor offence.\n                                   It is true that what is major offence and what is minor\n                                   offence is not defined. The gravity of offence must\n                                   depend upon the severity of the punishment that can\n                                   be inflicted, but the major and the minor offences must\n                                   be cognate offences which have the main ingredients\n                                   in common, and a man charged with one offence\n                                   which is entirely of a different nature from the offence\n                                   which is proved to have been committed by him,\n                                   cannot in the absence of a proper charge be convicted\n                                   of that offence, merely on the ground that the facts\n                                   proved constitute a minor offence. For example, a\n                                   man charged with an offence of murder cannot be\n                                   convicted for forgery or misappropriation of funds, or\n                                   such offences which do not constitute offences against\n                                   person, the reason being that the accused had no\n                                   opportunity in such a case to make defence, which\n                                   may have been open to him, if he had been charged\n                                   with the offence for which he is to be convicted.â€–\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"702724\" id=\"span_163\">26.

The Court has to\n                                   keep in mind that the exercise of revisional\n                                   jurisdiction itself should not lead to injustice ex facie.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">                                   Where the Court is dealing with the question as to\n                                   whether the charge has been framed properly and in\n                                   accordance with law in a given case, it may be\n                                   reluctant to interfere in exercise of its revisional\n                                   jurisdiction unless the case substantially falls within\n                                   the categories aforestated.

It is required to be noted\n                                  that when the High Court in exercise of powers under\n                                  Section 482 Code quashed the criminal proceedings, by\n                                  the time the Investigating Officer after recording the\n                                  statement of the witnesses, statement of the complainant\n                                  and collecting the evidence from the incident place and\n                                  after taking statement of the independent witnesses and\n                                  even statement of the accused persons, has filed the\n                                  charge-sheet before the Learned Magistrate for the\n                                  offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_101\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_102\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_103\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_104\">406</a>, <a href=\"/doc/430601/\" id=\"a_105\">329</a> and<a href=\"/doc/1183069/\" id=\"a_106\">386</a>\n                                  of IPC and even the learned Magistrate also took the\n                                  cognizance. From the impugned judgment and order\n                                  passed by the High Court, It does not appear that the\n                                  High Court took into consideration the material\n                                  collected during the investigation/inquiry and even the\n                                  statements recorded.

However,\n                                  thereafter when the statements are recorded, evidence\n                                  is collected and the charge-sheet is filed after\n                                  conclusion of the investigation/inquiry the matter\n                                  stands on different footing and the Court is required to\n                                  consider the material/evidence collected during the\n                                  investigation.

The right to privacy - by itself - has not been\n                                  identified under the Constitution. As a concept it may\n                                  be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially.\n                                  Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been\n                                  infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of\n                                  the said case. But the right to hold a telephone\n                                  conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office\n                                  without interference can certainly be claimed as\n                                  â€•right to privacyâ€–. Conversations on the telephone\n                                  are often of an intimate and confidential character.\n                                  Telephone-conversation is a part of modern man&#x27;s life.\n                                  It is considered so important that more and more\n                                  people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in\n                                  their pockets. Telephone conversation is an important\n                                  facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would\n                                  certainly include telephone-conversation in the\n                                  privacy of one&#x27;s home or office.

Therefore, when the Special\n                                   Judge took cognizance on 29-5-1995, there was no\n                                   sanction order under the law authorising him to take\n                                   cognizance. This is a fundamental error which\n                                   invalidates the cognizance as without jurisdiction.â€–\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">                      72.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1317279\" id=\"span_433\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1317279/\" id=\"a_159\">State of Karnataka v.
