The main contention urged in the plaint by the\n\nplaintiff is that the plaintiff was engaged in the business of\n\nT-Machinery (in the field of mining technology). He has two\n\nsiblings one of which is the defendant No.1 and he is\n\ncurrently residing in Bengaluru. The defendant No.1 is an\n\nIndian       Film   Actor,   whose       career   has   spanned   three\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               4</span>\n\n\n\ncontinents covering    India, the United States of America\n\nand Italy among other European countries in three media\n\nbeing film, television and theatre. The defendant No.1 is an\n\neminent film personality throughout the country as well as\n\nabroad. The defendant No.2 is a publishing business house\n\nin India acquired by Amazon which was earlier a Trent\n\nLimited subsidiary and is one of the leading publishing\n\nhouses in India. Westland Publications Private Limited was\n\nincorporated in the year 2016 and is registered at Registrar\n\nof Companies, Chennai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">     4.    The defendant No.1 authored a book named\n\n&#x27;Stories I must Tell: The Emotional Life of an Actor&#x27; by Kabir\n\nBedi ISBN:9789390679409 (&quot;the book&quot;). The copyright of\n\nthe book belongs to the defendant No.1. The above\n\nmentioned book has been launched and published by the\n\ndefendant No.2 on 19.04.2021 and is very popular and it is\n\navailable to public in India and abroad for reading/purchase\n\nonline.   It is stated that plaintiff recently learnt from an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                5</span>\n\n\n\nacquaintance that the said book has certain statements\n\nmade by the defendant No.1 inter-alia making allegations,\n\ninnuendos against him, his character, his reputation and\n\nwanted a clarification to know the truth. The plaintiff was\n\nshocked by the same and had the opportunity to peruse the\n\nbook. In the said book, some of what has been stated by\n\nthe defendant No.1 is extracted hereunder:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;7.1) &quot;I&#x27;ve been betrayed the most by people\n          who I trusted the most&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">     7.2) &quot;The most painful of all, my brother Ranga&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     7.3) &quot;An unexpected official letter in the post led\n          to   my discovering what had happened&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">     7.4) &quot;Eventually, I had to file a case of fraud\n          against him in Nelamangala Court near\n          Bengaluru in 2016&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     7.5) &quot;It was one of the hardest things I&#x27;ve ever\n          had to do&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">     7.6) &quot;I idolised him&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     7.7) &quot;But that&#x27;s a story for another time&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">     7.8) &quot;Trust is a perishable commodity, its gold\n          only if it lasts&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                6</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n\n\n     It is contended that the person referred to as &quot;Ranga&quot;\n\nin the above said book is the plaintiff, who is the elder\n\nbrother of the defendant No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">     5.    It is further contended that case of fraud\n\nmentioned in the book is a matter from 2016. Two plots of\n\nagricultural land were purchased by one Mr. Siddharth Bedi,\n\nSon of Kabir Bedi measuring 12 acres 33 guntas (including\n\n30 guntas of Kharab) in Sy.No.50/1 of Kukkenahalli Village\n\nand 4 acres 7 guntas (including 7 guntas of Kharab land) in\n\nKodihalli Village.   The aforementioned late Mr. Siddharth\n\nBedi died in 1997 leaving behind his mother Ms. Pratima\n\nBedi, defendant No.1 above named and his sister Ms. Pooja\n\nBedi. Thereafter, the aforesaid property was succeeded to\n\nby the defendant No.1 and his wife late Ms. Pratima Bedi.\n\nAs per the last Will and testament of Ms. Pratima Bedi, the\n\nplot in Kodihalli Village was bequeathed to her daughter,\n\nMs. Pooja Bedi.      Upon inheriting the said plot, by a sale\n\ndeed in 2005, Ms. Pooja Bedi sold the same to a third Party\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                7</span>\n\n\n\nfor a consideration of Rs.8,00,000/-. It is contended that\n\ndefendant No.1 inherited the plot in Kukkenahalli Village\n\nfrom his late son, Mr. Siddharth Bedi. The defendant No.1\n\nagreed to sell the plot in Kukkenahalli Village to the plaintiff\n\nand   after   defendant   No.1     received   the   entire   sale\n\nconsideration in 2005, he executed an affidavit admitting\n\nthe sale thereof and thereafter executed a power of\n\nattorney in favour of Ms. U.N. Bedi (since deceased). It is\n\ncontended that as the defendant No.1 had received the\n\nentire sale consideration in 2005 and had admitted receipt\n\nof the said sum by executing an affidavit, the said plot of\n\nland was converted in April 2007 by the defendant No.1\n\nthrough his Power of Attorney holder Ms. U.N. Bedi.          The\n\nrate of both these lands sold by Ms. Pooja Bedi and\n\ndefendant No.1 were more or less the same, sold at about\n\nthe same time and the lands are situated close-by and are\n\nagricultural in nature.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                               8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">       6.   It is contended that the sale consideration\n\nreceived by the defendant No.1 in 2005 remains with him\n\nand there is no dispute on this count. A decade after the\n\nreceipt of sale consideration of the land from the plaintiff,\n\nthe defendant No.1 filed a suit in O.S.No.227/2016 in the\n\nCourt of the Senior Civil Judge, Nelamangala which was civil\n\nin nature making false claims to which the plaintiff has filed\n\ntheir statement of defence refuting such allegations. In the\n\ncivil suit, the defendant No.1 has impugned the sale deed\n\nexecuted by him in 2007, despite having received the entire\n\nsale consideration in 2005 and which remains with him until\n\nthis date. It is contended that defendant No.1 sent an e-\n\nmail on February, 2020 to the plaintiff stating that &quot;Don&#x27;t\n\nbreak the deal by asking me for money.             Have the\n\nmagnanimity of elder brother and find a solution that unites\n\nus&quot;.   The defendant No.1 offered to withdraw allegations in\n\nthe plaint and the plaint itself for a price that is, in the\n\nevent he was returned a part of the land sold. Therefore, it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                9</span>\n\n\n\nis clear that the defendant No.1&#x27;s motivation to file the civil\n\nsuit is to resile from the sale and demand property from the\n\nplaintiff, which now belongs to him.     The defendant No.1\n\nallegations in the plaint are made with an intent to achieve\n\nhis illegal object and which is to resile from the sale and\n\nextract property from the plaintiff.        The plaintiff has\n\nrejected such an offer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">       7.     It is contended that the defendant No.1 has\n\nsuppressed the same in the above referred book and made\n\nfalse and wrongful allegations on the plaintiff&#x27;s fair name\n\nand reputation. It is further contended that the defendant\n\nNo.1    has    conducted   a   scandalous   and    defamatory\n\ncampaign, latest being, the book with an obvious intent to\n\nprofit and also coerce the plaintiff to submit to his illegal\n\ndemands.       This false, malicious, defamatory campaign is\n\nwith an intent to profit from the same. It is contended that\n\nthe plaintiff is having very good reputation and is held in\n\nhigh esteem amongst members at his family, his friends,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                               10</span>\n\n\n\nbusiness partners and society at large. The intent of\n\npublishing/making entirely false statements extracted supra\n\nwas with a premeditated object of defaming the plaintiff,\n\nspoiling his name and damaging his reputation. The\n\ndefamatory    and   scandalous      statements   made   by   the\n\ndefendant No.1 in the above referred book are entirely false\n\nand the same are published in order to hurt the reputation,\n\nimage and name of the plaintiff. The motivation to do so by\n\nthe defendant No.1 is the refusal to submit to his illegal,\n\nunlawful demands and claims made in the civil suit and\n\npersuaded by him in his e-mail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">     8.    It is contended that the defendant No.1 has\n\nmade false statement in the book with the object of\n\nincreasing its sales, as fiction sells more than facts.      The\n\ndefendant Nos.1 and 2 have joined hands to ensure good\n\nsales and profits of the above referred book at the cost of\n\nthe plaintiff and his reputation.    Hence, sought the relief of\n\ndamages and permanent injunction and inter-alia filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                11</span>\n\n\n\napplications i.e., I.A.Nos.2 and 3 under Order XXXIX Rule 1\n\nand 2 read with <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 151</a> of CPC.      In the application i.e.,\n\nI.A.No.2, the plaintiff sought for the relief of temporary\n\ninjunction restraining the defendants or their agents,\n\ndistributors, websites, e-business portal or other like agents\n\nand others from selling the book titled &#x27;Stories I Must Tell:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">The Emotional Life of an Actor. In the application i.e.,\n\nI.A.No.3, the plaintiff prayed for an ad-interim order of\n\ninjunction    against   the   defendants    or   their   agents,\n\ndistributors, websites, e-business portals or other like\n\nagents and others to remove all defamatory statements\n\nmade against the plaintiff from the book named &#x27;Stories I\n\nMust Tell: The Emotional Life of an Actor&#x27; by Kabir Bedi.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">     9.      In support of the applications, affidavits are also\n\nsworn to reiterating the averments of the plaint. The\n\napplications are resisted by both the defendant Nos.1 and 2\n\nby filing separate statement of objections. The defendant\n\nNo.1 took the contention that the claim made by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             12</span>\n\n\n\nplaintiff claiming damages of Rs.1,00,00,000/- along with\n\ninterest at 24% per annum for publishing the alleged\n\ndefamatory statement is false. The statements made\n\nagainst the plaintiff in the book are neither defamatory nor\n\nlibelous of the plaintiff and the statements made in the\n\nbook are bona-fide perception of the defendant No.1 about\n\nthe plaintiff. The defendant No.1 stands by the statements\n\nmade in the book and truthfulness of the same which are\n\nalready in public domain. Hence, any statement relating to\n\npending legal proceedings does not constitute defamation.\n\nAny order of injunction restraining the defendants from\n\nselling the book would violate the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India and\n\nwould also cause substantial financial loss and loss of\n\nreputation to the defendant No.1. It is contended that the\n\nplaintiff has not approached the Court with clean hands and\n\nthe present suit is an attempt by the plaintiff to arm twist\n\nthe defendant No.1 to withdraw the civil suit filed by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               13</span>\n\n\n\ndefendant No.1 against the plaintiff and pending before the\n\nCourt of II Additional Senior Civil Judge and JMFC,\n\nNelamangala.     The plaintiff has not made out any prima-\n\nfacie case for grant of interim order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">     10.    It is contended that the defendant No.1 is a\n\nhighly acclaimed cine actor, who has been active in the\n\nfilm, television and theatre for nearly 50 years now.         His\n\ncareer has spanned across India, Europe and the United\n\nStates of America. With the object of providing a close\n\ninsight into his personal and professional life as an\n\naccomplished actor and theatre personality, the defendant\n\nNo.1 decided to get his autobiography published to coincide\n\nwith his 75th birthday celebrations. The book chronicles his\n\nrelationship with people who he came across. However, the\n\ndefendant    No.1   shockingly     discovered   irrefutable   and\n\noverwhelming evidence of misrepresentation and fraud\n\nplayed by the plaintiff in purchasing the property, to which\n\nthe defendant No.1 succeeded after the untimely death of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                              14</span>\n\n\n\nhis son and he had filed a civil suit against the plaintiff in\n\nO.S.No.227/2016      which    is   pending     consideration.\n\nAlthough, the defendant No.1 could have filed a case for\n\ncheating, criminal breach of truest, causing wrongful gain\n\nand wrongful loss against the plaintiff; the defendant No.1\n\ndid not do so in order to protect the fair name of the family.\n\nThe defendant No.1, who is the plaintiff in O.S.No.227/2016\n\ncontend that sale deed was obtained by the plaintiff for a\n\nsong through misrepresentation and also by playing fraud\n\non the plaintiff. The plaintiff was ordinarily residing in\n\nMumbai and was frequently traveling abroad for many\n\nmonths. The plaintiff had utmost faith in the defendant and\n\nhe firmly believed that defendant had the experience of\n\nmanaging agricultural lands and therefore executed a Power\n\nof Attorney earlier in favour of his brother, the defendant\n\nauthorizing   him   to   manage    the   schedule   property.\n\nSometime in late 2005, the plaintiff was considering selling\n\nthe schedule property at a fair market price. Therefore, he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                     15</span>\n\n\n\nexecuted a Power of Attorney dated 27.12.2005 in favour of\n\nSmt.     Umi       Nalini   Bedi   (sister-in-law   of    the   plaintiff)\n\nauthorizing her to sell/alienate the schedule property in\n\nfavour of the prospective purchasers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">       11.     In December, 2005, the defendant informed the\n\nplaintiff that the market value of the schedule property is\n\nbetween Rs.2/2.5 lakhs per acre. The plaintiff believed in\n\nthe representations made by the defendant as the plaintiff\n\nhad completely trusted the defendant, his brother, to\n\nensure that the schedule property is sold at a fair market\n\nvalue and sale deed was executed by Power of Attorney\n\nholder       and     the    same    is   nothing    but     fraud    and\n\nmisrepresentation. The fraud played on the plaintiff came to\n\nlight when the plaintiff received a notice dated 29.10.2015\n\nfrom the Income Tax Department inter-alia reopening the\n\nAssessment in respect of the Income Tax returns filed by\n\nthe plaintiff for the Assessment year 2008-09 on the\n\npremise that a sum of Rs.1,70,34,000/- had escaped\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                16</span>\n\n\n\nassessment. The Income Tax Department was of the\n\nopinion that the plaintiff had not disclosed the actual sale\n\nconsideration in respect of the sale transaction between the\n\nplaintiff and the defendant. It is also contended that stamp\n\nduty was paid to the extent of Rs.2,25,00,000/- to\n\nRs.2,50,00,000/- as on the date of execution of the sale\n\ndeed, the plaintiff      had purchased the property      from\n\ndefendant No.1 for a sum of Rs.24,66,000/- by falsely\n\nmisrepresenting the market value of the property. Hence,\n\nsuit is filed and the same is pending before the II Additional\n\nSenior   Civil   Judge   and   JMFC,   Nelamangala   which   is\n\nnumbered as O.S.No.227/2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">     12.    It is contended that use of the words &quot;it was one\n\nof the hardest things to do&quot; &quot;I idolized him&quot; and &quot;But that&#x27;s\n\na story for another time&quot; in the passage alleged to be\n\ndefamatory clearly indicates that there is no intention to\n\ndefame the plaintiff. The reference to son of the defendant\n\nNo.1 sense of being betrayed by the plaintiff&#x27;s actions is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                17</span>\n\n\n\ncontained only in six lines and is not the highlight of the\n\nbook and prayer sought in I.A.No.2 cannot be granted,\n\nmore particularly since the plaintiff has already claimed\n\ndamages in the suit and hence, the question of granting\n\nany relief of temporary injunction and also stopping the\n\npublication does not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">     13.      The defendant No.2 also filed statement of\n\nobjections denying the allegations made in the plaint and\n\nthere is nothing mentioned in the said book that may be\n\nblatantly incorrect, wrong or defamatory in nature. The said\n\nbook is an autobiography about the defendant No.1 and it is\n\nnot a book about the plaintiff. An autobiography deals not\n\nonly with the individual by whom it is written, but about the\n\npeople whom he claims to have interacted with and there is\n\nonly six lines on page No.233 about the plaintiff and the\n\nsame has been again re-extracted in the statement of\n\nobjections.     Having   referred   the   said   statement   of\n\nobjections, the defendant No.2 contend that the plaintiff\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 18</span>\n\n\n\nhas failed to make out a prima facie case against the\n\ndefendants. The balance of convenience lies solely in favour\n\nof the defendants owing to the fact that the books have\n\nalready been printed and published and there is no\n\nirreparable loss caused to the plaintiff and hence, the\n\nquestion of granting interim order does not arise.               The\n\nplaintiff also filed rejoinder to the statement of objections\n\nfiled   by    the   defendant   Nos.1    and   2   reiterating   the\n\naverments of the plaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">        14.   The Trial Court, having considered the pleadings\n\nof the parties and also the affidavits filed by the parties,\n\nformulated the points whether the plaintiff has made out a\n\ncase    for   granting temporary        injunction as   sought    in\n\nI.A.Nos.2 and 3, whether balance of convenience lies in\n\nfavour of the plaintiff and whether irreparable loss and\n\ninjury will be caused to the plaintiff if an order of temporary\n\ninjunction is not granted.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               19</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">     15.   The Trial Court, having considered the material\n\non record, comes to the conclusion that the plaintiff has\n\nclaimed the damages and sought the relief of temporary\n\ninjunction restraining the defendants from selling the said\n\nbook and comes to the conclusion that already books have\n\nbeen sold even online and when already sufficient copies\n\nhave been supplied and removal of defamatory statement\n\nmade against the plaintiff has to be established by the\n\nplaintiff after full-fledged trial. Hence, grant of an interim-\n\ninjunction would amount to grant of final relief, if direction\n\nto   remove   the   statements     is   given.   Under    such\n\ncircumstances, when many of the copies have been sold,\n\nthe Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled\n\nfor relief as sought in both the applications. The contentions\n\nregarding the right to privacy and freedom of speech and\n\nthe line of balance between them and how the same has\n\nbeen violated needs to be proved by the plaintiff. Hence,\n\nrejected both the applications. Being aggrieved by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                               20</span>\n\n\n\nrejection of the applications i.e., I.A.Nos.2 and 3, the\n\npresent appeal is filed before this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">     16.   The main contention of the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant/plaintiff in this appeal is that\n\nthe very rejection of the applications is without considering\n\nthe pleadings and material available on record and the Trial\n\nCourt has passed an unreasonable order. The counsel also\n\nwould vehemently contend that the very allegations made\n\nagainst the plaintiff imputes the character of the plaintiff\n\nand it is also pleaded in the plaint as to how it affects the\n\ncharacter and reputation of the plaintiff. The counsel also\n\nwould vehemently contend that in the catena of judgments,\n\nthe Apex Court has from time to time reiterated the legal\n\nproposition that the application for granting or refusing to\n\ngrant injunction shall be only on the premise of prima-facie\n\ncase, balance of convenience and injury and in the\n\nimpugned order, the Trial Court has not considered the\n\nbasic principle for grant or refusal of injunction and taking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                               21</span>\n\n\n\ninto account that there would be irreparable injury caused\n\nto the appellant and committed an error.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">     17.   The   counsel    also   in   his   argument   would\n\nvehemently contend that the Trial Court committed an error\n\nin appreciating the factual aspects of the case. The counsel\n\nalso would vehemently contend that when prima facie case\n\nis made out that it is a slap by way of publication by the\n\ndefendant No.1 against the plaintiff and continued to sell\n\nthe book and the defendant No.1 is a celebrity and the\n\nstatement made attracts the general public and the same is\n\nnothing but targeting the character of the plaintiff.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_20\">18.

The   Supreme   Court   while   considering   these\n\naspects clearly opined that there were two aspects of the\n\nright of privacy.

The first is, a false and defamatory\n\nstatement must be made about another&#x27;s reputation or\n\nbusiness. What is necessary in a case of defamation is that\n\nthe statement made is understood by others to be &quot;of or\n\nconcerning&quot; the plaintiff.    It is also emphasized that the\n\nplaintiff must establish some extent of fault or negligence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                33</span>\n\n\n\non the part of the defendant in publishing the statements. A\n\nplaintiff who is a public figure will have to show that the\n\nstatements were made out of malice. The burden of proof is\n\nless demanding in case of a private individual. The\n\nstatements must result in actual or presumed damage and\n\nalso discussed with regard to importance of free speech.\n\nThe counsel also brought to notice of this Court Para No.43\n\nthat the Court cannot also sit in value judgment over the\n\nmedium (of expression) chosen by the defendant since in a\n\ndemocracy, speech can include forms such as caricature,\n\nlampoon, mime parody and other manifestations of wit.

It   is\n\nimportant to note that suit is filed for the damages and\n\nallegations of defamatory statements are made. It is settled\n\nlaw that the cardinal principle of defamation has to be\n\nproved. In law, the essence of defamation is its tendency to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                 50</span>\n\n\n\nthrough the defendant&#x27;s statements, lower the plaintiff&#x27;s\n\nreputation in eyes of others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"562656\" id=\"span_72\">50.

GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL &amp;\n\nANR.</a>, and held that the first is a false and defamatory\n\nstatement must be made about another&#x27;s reputation or\n\nbusiness. What is necessary in a case of defamation is that\n\nthe statement made is understood by others to be &quot;of or\n\nconcerning&quot; the plaintiff. The publication should be made\n\nout to a third party. Generally there is no liability if the\n\ndefendant did not intend the publication to be viewed by\n\nanyone other than the plaintiff. The plaintiff must establish\n\nsome extent of fault or negligence on the part of the\n\ndefendant in publishing the statements. The plaintiff who is\n\na public figure will have to show that statements are made\n\nout of malice. The burden of proof is less demanding in case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                51</span>\n\n\n\nof a private individual.

No doubt the counsel appearing for the appellant\n\nhas also relied upon the judgment of SURESH JINDAL&#x27;s\n\ncase which is referred supra wherein discussed <a href=\"/doc/1080998/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 40</a>\n\nof Specific Relief Act, the appellant claiming interim relief\n\nof a three second display in the &#x27;credit titles&#x27; of the serial, of\n\nhis name in public acknowledgment of the service rendered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                              52</span>\n\n\n\nby him in making the film possible, held that in such a\n\nsituation award of damages to the appellant would not be\n\nan adequate relief and also discussed <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 73</a> of\n\nContract Act and the prima facie case is made out with\n\nregard to the fact that necessary modifications in the &#x27;credit\n\ntitles&#x27; can be easily made as the film is still in the early\n\nstages of its exhibition and necessary to injunct the same.\n\nBut in the case on hand, it has to be noted that already\n\nbook is published and the same is in a public domain and\n\nthe same is circulated from 2021 and almost 3 years has\n\nbeen elapsed.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">     52.   The counsel appearing for the respondents also\n\nbrought to notice of this Court that when an application is\n\nfiled restraining an injunctive relief, order was passed on\n\n27th day of September-2022. The appeal is filed on\n\n15.06.2023 almost after 9 months and not immediately.\n\nThere is a force in the contention of the counsel appearing\n\nfor the respondents that a belated appeal is filed. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                              53</span>\n\n\n\nconduct shows that not intended to prevent the circulation.\n\nIt is important to note that when the extracts are made in\n\nthe plaint with regard to the a defamatory remarks made in\n\nthe autobiography book of defendant No.1, the Court has to\n\nlook into the said book also in the contest in which the said\n\nstatements are made. No doubt the defendant No.1 is the\n\ncelebrity and there is a force in the contention of the\n\nappellant&#x27;s counsel that if he makes a statement and the\n\nsame will be received as smooth. But, the Court has to\n\nexamine with regard to whether the same amounts to\n\ndefamatory as discussed above and ingredients has to be\n\nproved. The fact that the book is autobiography of\n\ndefendant No.1 is not in dispute and he has expressed his\n\nfeelings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">     53.    It is important to note that in order to lis\n\nbetween the parties is concerned, admittedly the defendant\n\nNo.1 has filed a suit questioning the very execution of sale\n\ndeed executed in favour of plaintiff. He contended that a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                              54</span>\n\n\n\nfraud was played and on misrepresentation, the sale is\n\nobtained. The suit is also pending which was filed in the\n\nyear 2016 itself making the allegation of fraud and\n\nmisrepresentation in the year 2016 itself. It is important to\n\nnote that this book is authored and is circulated from 2021,\n\nimmediately after filing of the suit in 2016 for making an\n\nallegation of fraud and misrepresentation, no action was\n\ntaken by the plaintiff, but immediately after the circulation\n\nof this book, he has approached the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">     54.   It is the contention of the appellant&#x27;s counsel\n\nthat there is a prima facie case and book is nothing but a\n\nslap by way of publication. It is important to note that when\n\nthe book was launched on 19.04.2021, notice was issued on\n\n30.04.2021   and   immediately    the   suit   was   filed   on\n\n12.05.2021. No order has been passed and a direction was\n\ngiven by this Court in the writ proceedings on 12.08.2021,\n\nbut the order was passed in the month of September. I\n\nhave already pointed out that even there is a delay in filing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                               55</span>\n\n\n\nthe appeal and almost nine months has been elapsed\n\nquestioning the said order. The main contention of the\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellant relying upon the case\n\nof MS. KANIMOZHI KARUNANIDHI&#x27;s wherein Madara\n\nHigh Court discussed the judgment of the Apex Court in\n\ncase of justice K.S.PUTTASWAMY&#x27;S case in paragraph\n\nNo.42 with regard to right to privacy as well as in\n\nattempting the balance between the right to privacy and\n\nright to free speech wherein elaborate discussion was made\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/769478/\" id=\"a_45\">the said judgment</a> in keeping a right to free speech\n\nenshrined the <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\nwhile discussing the scope of the right to privacy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_79\">55.   The counsel appearing for the appellant also\n\nrelied upon the judgment of justice <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_47\">K.S.PUTTASWAMY&#x27;S</a>\n\ncase with regard to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> right to\n\nlife and personal liberty includes right to privacy as an\n\nintegral part guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution\n\nand   extracted   certain   paragraphs   wherein   a   detailed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                56</span>\n\n\n\ndiscussion was made. In keeping the principles <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_49\">laid down in</a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_50\">the said judgment</a> and also the judgment of Delhi High\n\nCourt as well as judgment of Madras High Court and also\n\nthe pendency of the suit claiming damages and the very\n\ndefamatory statement, whether it amounts to defamatory\n\nstatement or not has to be adjudicated and triable issues is\n\nsubject matter of the suit also be taken note of by the Trial\n\nCourt.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"562656\" id=\"span_81\">56.    It is also important to note that paragraph No.28\n\nof the judgment of Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/562656/\" id=\"a_51\">TATA SON</a>&#x27;s case is\n\naptly applicable to the case on hand when the suit has\n\nalready been filed for the damages, whether circulating\n\nsuch book affects the reputation of plaintiff has to be\n\ndetermined only by after the trial, not at this stage. It is\n\nalso settled law that the Court should be very slow in\n\npassing the judgment with regard to if any publication of an\n\nallegedly   offending    and    defamatory,    prepublication\n\ninjunction of restraint should not be granted in case if the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                             57</span>\n\n\n\ndefendants supports the publication sites truth as a defense\n\nand pleads justification, the same is a matter of trial and\n\ndamages are the appropriate remedy. The division bench of\n\nDelhi High Court also in a case of SHAMAR RIMPOCHE&#x27;S\n\nwhich is <a href=\"/doc/562656/\" id=\"a_52\">referred above</a>, held in paragraph No.7 relying\n\nupon the judgment of KUSHWANT SINGH&#x27;S case that the\n\ninterim injunction sought against the publication of the\n\nbook and there is a dispute pertaining to the freedom of\n\nexpression and the author standing by the facts stated by\n\nhim held that interim injunction against the publication\n\ncannot be granted. The KUSHWANT SINGH&#x27;S case, Delhi\n\nHigh Court in detail dealt with the same in paragraph No.64\n\nthat while discussing the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and also\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 19(2)</a> of Constitution of India, wherein also\n\ndiscussed the total matter of the book is yet to be\n\npublished. The contents of the subject matter had been\n\nreported before and authors stands by the same and the\n\nsame has to be examined and respondent cannot make a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                              58</span>\n\n\n\ngrievance so as to prevent the publication itself when the\n\nremedy is available to her by way of damages. It would not\n\nbe appropriate to do so for us at this stage but, what we do\n\nobserved is that the statements are not of such a nature as\n\nto grant injunction even from publication of the material\n\nwhen the appellants are willing to face the consequences in\n\na trial in case the same are held to be defamatory and the\n\npleas of the appellants of truth were analyzed by the Trial\n\nCourt. In the case on hand also I have already extracted\n\nthe imputations which has been extracted by the plaintiff\n\ncontending that the same is a defamatory statement and it\n\naffects privacy, the same must be proved whether the same\n\namounts to a defamatory statement and dispute between\n\nthe brothers is with regard to selling of the property and it\n\nis contended by the defendant No.1 that by fraud and\n\nmisrepresentation obtained the sale deed and there was a\n\nfraud and also defendant contend that the same is a truth\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                               59</span>\n\n\n\nand he is defending his statement and he has already filed\n\nthe suit.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"547362\" id=\"span_85\">57.    The counsel for respondent No.1 also apart from\n\nrelying upon the certified copy of order sheet of the Trial\n\nCourt, he also relied upon similar judgments which have\n\nbeen relied upon by the respondent No.2. The counsel also\n\nbrought to notice of the judgment of the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_55\">R.RAJAGOPALA</a>&#x27;s case which has been <a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_56\">referred above</a>\n\nwherein fraud principles are evolved while considering the\n\ncase where an observation is made that it must be held that\n\nthe petitioners have a right to publish what they alleged to\n\nbe the life story/autobiography of the Auto Shankar in so\n\nfar as it appears from the public records, even without his\n\nconsent or authorization. It is also the contention that it is\n\nonly a autobiography and he had expressed feelings with\n\nregard to persons who have come across in his life including\n\nfamily members as well as friends. Hence, the said\n\nprinciples is also applicable to the facts of the case on hand,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                              60</span>\n\n\n\nsince the book which is published is also a autobiography of\n\nthe defendant No.1 which was released on his 75th birth\n\nanniversary.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">     58.   The counsel appearing for the respondent No.1\n\nalso relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in\n\nNACHIEKETA WALHEKAR&#x27;S case which is <a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_57\">referred above</a>\n\nand also the case of ADARSH COOP. SOCIETY LTD.,\n\nreferred supra wherein also the Apex Court observed that\n\ncompelling circumstances to be proved for grant of interim\n\ninjunction, if it is tantamount to final relief, the interim\n\ninjunction cannot be granted. In the case on hand, the\n\nrelief sought in I.A.No.3 amounts to granting of the final\n\nrelief in withdrawing and removing the contents of the book\n\nand without conducting the Trial, there cannot be such an\n\norder and it amounts to granting of final relief as contended\n\nby the appellant&#x27;s counsel. Hence, the said judgments are\n\naptly applicable to the facts of the case on hand and no\n\ndoubt in I.A.Nos.2 and 3 the relief sought that to prevent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                               61</span>\n\n\n\nthe defendants from making publication of the said book\n\nand restrain circulation of the said book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">     59.   It is important to note that already book is\n\nreleased in the year 2021 and I have already observed that\n\n3 years has been elapsed, the same is under circulation.\n\nThe relief is already sought for the relief of damage, the\n\nsame can be assessed in terms of money, if it is really\n\nimputes the reputation of the plaintiff and also there is a\n\nintersaid dispute between the parties with regard to the\n\nfraud and misrepresentation and the suit was already filed\n\nby the defendant No.1 in the year 2016 which is also\n\npending for consideration. When the contents of the book is\n\nalso extracted in the plaint and having taken note of the\n\nsaid extracts also whether it amounts to defamation or not\n\nand whether it harms the reputation of the plaintiff is the\n\nsubject matter of     the trial. The Trial Court also while\n\nrejecting the application which is numbered as I.A.Nos.2\n\nand 3 in paragraph No.20, after considering the rival\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                 62</span>\n\n\n\ncontents of the plaintiff as well as defendant, taken note of\n\nthe words which have been used in the said book. In\n\nparagraph No.20, comes to the conclusion that when the\n\nplaintiff has claimed the damages and restraining the\n\ndefendant from selling the said book and already sufficient\n\ncopies have been supplied and removal of defamatory\n\nstatements made against the plaintiff has to be established\n\nby the plaintiff after full fledged trail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">      60.   The Trial Court also taken note of the principles\n\n<a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_58\">laid down in</a> the judgments which have referred before the\n\nCourt and comes to the conclusion that grant of interim\n\ninjunction would amounts to grant of final relief with a\n\ndirection to remove the statements which are given. The\n\nTrial Court also taken note of the fact that when the books\n\nhave been sold, the plaintiff is not entitled for the relief as\n\nsought in both the applications. The contention regarding\n\nthe right to privacy and freedom of speech and the line of\n\nbalance between them, the same has been violated needs\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                63</span>\n\n\n\nto be proved by the plaintiff. The fact that admittedly the\n\ndefamation has to be proved by full fledged trial. The suit is\n\nfiled after the release of the book and the book was\n\nlaunched prior to the filing of the suit. No doubt plaintiff has\n\nalso filed the affidavits of various persons in favour of him\n\nand defendant also took specific defense that already the\n\nsuit is filed for setting aside the sale deed which has been\n\nobtained by the plaintiff on the ground that by fraud and\n\nmisrepresentation the sale deed is obtained. The said suit is\n\npending before Nelamangala Court, Bengaluru, the said suit\n\nwas    filed   making    the    allegation    of   fraud    and\n\nmisrepresentation in the year 2016 itself, when such being\n\nthe case, I do not find any substance in the argument of\n\nappellant&#x27;s counsel that this Court has to restrain the\n\ndefendant from publication of book since, the book is\n\nalready in circulation and in the public domain and question\n\nof directing the plaintiff to remove the statements does not\n\narise at this stage unless the plaintiff proves that the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                               64</span>\n\n\n\nextract which has narrated in the plaint contains in the book\n\nmade in the context of defamatory statement which\n\nimputes the reputation of the plaintiff. Hence, I do not find\n\nany ground to grant the relief as sought in the appeal. The\n\nTrial Court has not committed any error in rejecting the\n\nI.A.Nos.2 and 3 and it does not require any interference of\n\nthis Court and the appeal suffers from devoid of its merits.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">     61.
