The information as sought by the Petitioner has been rejected by the\n                          CPIO, Ministry of Home Affairs in W.P.(C) 12933/2021 and the CPIO,\n                          Department of Personnel and Training in W.P.(C) 12932/2021 on the\n                          ground that the information as sought for by the Petitioner is exempted from\n                          disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005. The\n                          appeals thereto were also rejected by the Appellate Authority on the very\n                          same ground.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">                          3.      It is pertinent to mention here that the Petitioner before both the\n                          CPIOs and the Appellate Authority had taken the ground that the\n                          information as sought could not be rejected on the ground that it relates to\n                          personal information of the officers as 20 years had passed since the\n                          appointment of the officers were made from the date on which the request\n                          for the information has been made.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">                          4.      The Ld.

The Ld. CIC held that the object of the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">RTI Act</a> is to ensure transparency and accountability but since the right to\n                          privacy is a continuous process and such a right to privacy will continue\n                          even after 20 years. The relevant portion of the Order dated 29.11.2019\n                          passed by the Ld. CIC reads as under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Signing Date:04.03.2024   W.P.(C) 12932/2021 etc.                                        Page 2 of 5</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">18:35:42</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                           &quot;6. The Commission after adverting to the facts and\n                                          circumstances of the easel, hearing both parties and\n                                          perusal of records, feels that the right to privacy being\n                                          a facet of fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the\n                                          Constitution has to be protected in accordance with the\n                                          three parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in\n                                          the case of KS.Puttaswamy (Supra) i.e. (i) there must\n                                          be legal object, (ii) there must be legal framework and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                          (iii) there must be nexus between the objective to be\n                                          achieved and the privacy to be compromised. It\n                                          appears that for meeting different treatment, there must\n                                          be a reasonable classification and the classification\n                                          must have a rational nexus with the objective to be\n                                          achieved. If we take that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">RTI Act</a> contains\n                                          provisions providing framework for disclosures\n                                          outweighing right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8(3)</a> of the\n                                          RTI Act which aims transparency and accountability,\n                                          the appellant may be entitled for the information of the\n                                          occurrence which took place 20 years before the RTI\n                                          application. Thus the Right to Privacy of the 3rd party\n                                          may not be absolute if the same is falling within the\n                                          ambit of the aforementioned parameters. However, the\n                                          respondent have claimed that the occurrence was not a\n                                          onetime event i.e. the Right to Privacy is a continuous\n                                          process and drawing a line of giving applications for\n                                          appointment as such may not be a water tight\n                                          compartment wherein the Right to Privacy was not\n                                          existing or continuing after the lapse of 20 years.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">                          5.

The Petitioner has been convicted and sentenced to death in the\n                          Mumbai Twin Blast known as the 7/11 bomb blast case which took place in\n                          the year 2006. The Petitioner was Accused No.4. The Petitioner was\n                          sentenced to the punishment of death for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> of\n                          the IPC, under <a href=\"/doc/44592612/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 3(b)</a> of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and\n                          <a href=\"/doc/21636269/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3(1)(i)</a> of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999\n                          and apart from this, the Petitioner had also been sentenced for various\n                          offences under the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">IPC</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">                          9.      The information as sought by the Petitioner is against the officers who\n                          were involved in the investigation and who were also involved in granting\n                          sanction to the prosecution relating to the arrest and conviction of the\n                          Petitioner. The information is of such a nature, if given to the Petitioner,\n                          may expose these officers to grave danger. The incident for which the\n                          Petitioner has been sentenced to the death penalty has occurred in the year\n                          2006. Admittedly, 20 years have not passed after the date of the incident,\n                          and therefore, in any event, the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8(3)</a> of the RTI Act is not\n                          available to the Petitioner in the facts of the present case. Even if it is\n                          assumed that 20 years have passed, in such cases the right of privacy for\n                          these officers, who can be exposed to grave risk, cannot be diverged to an\n                          accused and that too when the accused has been convicted and sentenced to\n                          death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          10.     The Petitioner has not brought out any case as to what public interest\n                          would be served by giving such information as sought for by the Petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">By:SHAZAAD ZAKIR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signing Date:04.03.2024   W.P.(C) 12932/2021 etc.                                           Page 4 of 5</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">18:35:42</span>\n                           which would outweigh the protected interest under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n                          RTI Act.

The Petitioner claims that the personal information can be granted to\n                          him because the information has been sought after 20 years from the date of\n                          appointment of the officers concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">                          12.     As rightly pointed out by the Ld.
