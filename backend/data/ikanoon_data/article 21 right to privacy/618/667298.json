Such   of   the   facts   as   are   necessary   for   the   decision   of   this \n\n    petition may briefly be summarized as follows : \n</p>      \n   \n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           Petitioner No.1 claims that she is married with respondent No.1 \n\n    on 09.05.2001 and out of the said wedlock, petitioner No.2 is born on \n\n    20.04.2003.   As respondent No.1 refused and neglected to maintain \n\n\n\n\n\n    the petitioners, petitioner No.1 has filed Criminal M.A. No.90/2006 in \n\n    the Court of J.M.F.C. Shrigonda, Dist. Ahmednagar.   In response to \n\n    the   summons   issued   to   respondent   No.1,   he   appeared   in   the   said \n\n\n\n\n\n    proceeding and by filing say cum written statement denied that he \n\n    had   married   with   the   first   petitioner   and   also   denied   paternity   of \n\n    petitioner No.2.   According to him, he never  had physical relations \n\n    with   present   petitioner   No.1,   and   hence   there   is   no   question   of \n\n    paternity   of   present   petitioner   No.2.       It   appears   that   after   the \n\n    pleadings were completed the parties were directed to lead evidence \n\n    by learned J.M.F.C. in support of their respective pleadings.  Present \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                           ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:09:35 :::</span>\n                                                   3       Cri.Writ Petition No.1050 of 2010\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     \n    respondent   No.1   examined   himself   and   his   deposition   is   at \n\n\n\n\n                                                             \n    Exhibit-40.  The  material part   of  his  cross  examination,  which was \n\n    concluded on 28.11.2007 reads as,  &quot;I denied that the first applicant  \n\n    was divorced from her husband on 11.08.2000.  I denied that after the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n    applicant no.1 obtained divorce from her husband, I got married with  \n\n    her on 09.05.2001.   It is not correct to suggest that from 09.05.2001 to  \n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    December 2003, I was residing and co-habiting with applicant no.1 as  \n\n    a husband and wife.     In no uncertain terms, he has further stated \n                            \n    that he had never established physical relations with petitioner No.1. \n</blockquote>                           \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">    He   has   further   stated   that   if   petitioner   No.1   is   ready   to   bear   the \n\n    expenses, he is ready to face the DNA test, to decide the paternity of \n\n    petitioner   No.2.   He   has   further   denied   that   the   petitioners   were \n      \n\n\n    treated in the hospital of Dr.Tamboli at Ahmednagar.   \n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">    4.             It   appears   that   on   the   day   the   cross   examination   was \n\n    over, an application (Exhibit-45) was moved by the present petitioner \n\n\n\n\n\n    No.1 for DNA test of petitioner No.2 and respondent No.1, on which \n\n    present   respondent   No.1   had   filed   his   say.       It   appears   that   after \n\n    hearing the parties and after considering the application and the say \n\n\n\n\n\n    filed to the said application, the learned Magistrate passed an order \n\n    below   Exhibit-45   and   allowed   the   application   and   directed \n\n    respondent No.1 to face the DNA test after petitioner No.1 deposits \n\n    necessary charges.     It appears that thereafter on 30.04.2008, the \n\n    present   petitioner   No.1   deposited   Rs.12,000/-   in   the   Court   of \n\n    J.M.F.C.   Shrigonda.       It   further   appears   that   an   application   was \n\n    moved   by   the   present   respondent   No.1   before   the   Trial   Court \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                             ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:09:35 :::</span>\n                                                4       Cri.Writ Petition No.1050 of 2010\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n    requesting to direct applicant No.1 to deposit the amount of traveling \n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n    expenses for the purpose of DNA test of respondent No.1. It appears \n\n    that   pursuant   to   the   request   of   respondent   No.1,   the   trial   Court \n\n    directed   the   petitioner   No.1   to   deposit   the   amount   towards   the \n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    traveling expenses.   It appears that petitioner No.1 deposited the said \n\n    amount   on   20.09.2008   by   moving   an   application   (Exhibit-67).     It \n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    further   appears   that   thereafter   an   application   (Exhibit-69)   was \n\n    moved by respondent No.1 requesting to allow him to withdraw the \n                           \n    amount of Rs.2,000/-  which was deposited by the present petitioner \n                          \n    No.1 towards traveling  expenses.   Record shows that  an order  was \n\n    passed directing present respondent No.1 first to bear the expenses \n\n    and   then   to   claim   reimbursement   by   producing   the   bills   of   the \n      \n\n\n    traveling expenses.   It appears that thereafter Criminal Revision No.\n   \n\n\n\n    198/2009 was preferred by the present respondent No.1 before the \n\n    Sessions   Judge,   Ahmednagar,   questioning   the   correctness   of   the \n\n    order   passed   by   the  learned  Magistrate  below   Exhibit-45,  referring \n\n\n\n\n\n    respondent No.1 for D.N.A. Test. Learned Additional Sessions Judge \n\n    while allowing the Criminal Revision Application has observed that in \n\n    view   of   the   judgment   of   the   Supreme   Court   that   no   one   can   be \n\n\n\n\n\n    compelled   to   give   blood   sample   for   analysis,   the   approach   of   the \n\n    learned Magistrate is not legal and proper, therefore, the order passed \n\n    below Exhibit-45 by the learned Magistrate is set aside and revision \n\n    is allowed, the said order is impugned in the present petition. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">    5.     In   this   backdrop,   heard   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioners \n\n    followed   by   the   submissions   of   learned   counsel   for   the   first \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:09:35 :::</span>\n                                                        5       Cri.Writ Petition No.1050 of 2010\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          \n    respondent   and   learned   APP.

It is \n\n    also urged that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 125</a> of the Cr.P.C further \n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    mandate   that   the   legitimate   as   well   as   illegitimate   children   are \n\n    entitled for maintenance from their father, provided that the paternity \n                              \n    is established.     It is further urged that the   present petitioner No.1 \n                             \n    has come with a specific case that after she obtained divorce from \n\n    her first husband, she married with present respondent No.1 in the \n\n    month of May 2001 and out of the relations with the first respondent, \n      \n\n\n    petitioner   No.2   is   born.   Learned   counsel   for   the   petitioners   has \n   \n\n\n\n    further drawn my attention towards cross examination of the present \n\n    respondent No.1, particularly the last part of the cross examination \n\n    which is material, &quot;there are no physical relations between him and  \n\n\n\n\n\n    the   first   petitioner.       I   am   ready   to   face   the   DNA   test   to   decide   the  \n\n    paternity of the petitioner No.2, if petitioner No.1 is ready to bear the  \n\n    expenses   of   the   DNA   test.&quot;       From   these   2   lines   in   the   cross \n\n\n\n\n\n    examination, it is clear that the present respondent No.1 had taken a \n\n    stand before the Lower Court that there were no physical relations \n\n    between   him   and   the   first   petitioner,   hence   no   question   about \n\n    paternity   of   petitioner   No.2   arises.     Secondly,   he   has   categorically \n\n    consented   to   face   the   DNA   test,   but   on   the   condition   that   the \n\n    expenses   be   borne   by   petitioner   No.1.     Considering   this   aspect,   it \n\n    cannot be said that the present respondent No.1 was compelled to \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:09:35 :::</span>\n                                                   6       Cri.Writ Petition No.1050 of 2010\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     \n    face   the   DNA   test   as   observed   by   the   learned   Additional   Sessions \n\n\n\n\n                                                             \n    Judge   in   the   impugned   order.
