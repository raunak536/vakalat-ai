The issues which arise for adjudication in this reference pertain to the\n\n      criteria to be fulfilled to qualify as a minority educational institution for the\n\n      purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Indian Constitution.\n\n\nA.    Background\n\n\n2.    In 1977, the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College was established in Aligarh.\n\n      The college was a teaching institution affiliated to the Calcutta University at\n\n      first and subsequently to the Allahabad University. The imperial legislature\n\n      passed the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_10\">Aligarh Muslim University Act</a> 1920.1 The enactment, as the\n\n      preamble        indicates,      “established        and     incorporated”        Aligarh      Muslim\n\n      University2. The AMU Act was amended by the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_11\">Aligarh Muslim University\n\n      (Amendment) Act</a> 19513 and <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_12\">Aligarh Muslim University (Amendment) Act</a>\n\n      19654. The amendments related to the religious instructions of Muslim\n\n      students5 and the administrative set-up of the university6. Proceedings under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution were instituted before this Court for challenging\n\n\n\n1\n  “AMU Act”\n2\n  “AMU”\n3\n  “1951 Amendment Act”\n4\n  “1965 Amendment Act”\n5\n  <a href=\"/doc/1798070/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8</a> was amended to stipulate that it would be unlawful for the University to adopt or impose any test\nof religious belief for admission or recruitment except where the religious test was made a condition for\nbenefaction. The amended proviso to the provision stipulated that nothing in the Section shall be deemed to\nprevent the provision of religious instruction to those who consent to it. <a href=\"/doc/756149/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 9</a> which empowered the Court\nto mandate religious instruction for Muslim students was deleted by the amendment. <a href=\"/doc/682651/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 23(1)</a>, which\nprovided that all members of the Court would be Muslims, was also deleted.\n6\n  Section 23 of the AMU Act was amended to delete clauses (2) and (3). By this amendment, the powers of\nthe Court were significantly reduced. The Court which was the supreme governing body of the University\nnow only had the power to advise the Visitor or any other authority of the University on matters which may\nbe referred to it for advice and exercise powers assigned to it by the Visitor. The powers of the Court were\ninstead placed in the hands of the Executive Council. The composition of the Court (which was an all-Muslim\nbody) was also amended. The process of constituting the Court and the Executive Council was also\namended.\n\n                                                                                              Page 5 of 118\n\f                                                                                    PART A\n\n        the constitutional validity of the 1951 Amendment Act and the 1965\n\n        Amendment Act. A Constitution Bench in the decision in S Azeez Basha v.\n\n        Union of India7 upheld the constitutional validity of the Amendments. The\n\n        petitioners made a three-fold argument: (a) AMU was established by Muslims,\n\n        who are a religious minority for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 30(1); (b)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 30(1)</a>\n\n        guarantees Muslims the right to administer the University established by\n\n        them; and (c) the 1951 and 1965 Amendments are violative of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 30(1)</a> to\n\n        the extent that it infringed the right of the Muslim community to administer the\n\n        institution. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 30</a> is extracted below:\n\n\n                        “30. Right of minorities to establish and administer\n                        educational institutions.—(1) All minorities, whether\n                        based on religion or language, shall have the right to\n                        establish and administer educational institutions of\n                        their choice.\n\n\n                        (1A) In making any law providing for the compulsory\n                        acquisition of any property of an educational\n                        institution established and administered by a\n                        minority, referred to in clause (1), the State shall\n                        ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under\n                        such law for the acquisition of such property is such\n                        as would not restrict or abrogate the right\n                        guaranteed under that clause.\n\n\n                        (2) The State shall not, in granting aid to educational\n                        institutions, discriminate against any educational\n                        institution on the ground that it is under the\n                        management of a minority, whether based on\n                        religion or language.”\n\n\n        The amendments were also impugned on the ground that they violated\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_21\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_22\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_23\">, 25</a><a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_24\">, 26</a><a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_25\">, 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_26\">31</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n\n7\n    AIR 1968 SC 662\n\n                                                                                  Page 6 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART A\n\n3.   The Union of India opposed the petitions, arguing that the Muslim minority did\n\n     not have the right to administer AMU since they had not established the\n\n     institution. It was submitted that AMU was established by Parliament. That\n\n     being the case, it was contended that the amendments were not violative of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n4.   A Constitution Bench dismissed the writ petitions in Azeez Basha (supra).\n\n     The challenge on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 30(1)</a> was rejected on the\n\n     following grounds:\n\n\n     a.        The phrase “establish and administer” in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 30(1)</a> must be read\n\n               conjunctively. Religious minorities have the right to administer those\n\n               educational institutions which they established. Religious minorities do\n\n               not have the right to administer educational institutions which were not\n\n               established by them, even if they were administering them for some\n\n               reason before the commencement of the Constitution;\n\n\n     b.        The word “establish” in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 30(1)</a> means “to bring into existence”;\n\n\n     c.        AMU was not established by the Muslim minority for the following\n\n               reasons:\n\n\n          i.        AMU was brought into existence by the AMU Act, which was\n\n                    enacted by Parliament in 1920. Section 6 of the AMU Act provides\n\n                    that the degrees conferred to persons by the University would be\n\n                    recognised by the government. This provision indicates that AMU\n\n                    was established by the Government of India because the Muslim\n\n\n                                                                            Page 7 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART A\n\n                 minority could not have insisted that the degrees conferred by a\n\n                 university established by it ought to be recognized by the\n\n                 Government. The AMU Act may have been passed as a result of\n\n                 the efforts of the Muslim community but that does not mean that\n\n                 AMU was established by them;\n\n\n     ii.         The conversion of the College to the University was not by the\n\n                 Muslim minority but by virtue of the 1920 Act; and\n\n\n     iii.        Section 4 of the AMU Act by which the MAO College and the\n\n                 Muslim University Association were dissolved, and the properties,\n\n                 rights and liabilities in the societies were vested in AMU shows that\n\n                 the previous bodies legally ceased to exist;\n\n\nd.          Since the Muslim community did not establish AMU, it cannot claim a\n\n            right to administer it under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 30(1).</a> Thus, any amendment to the\n\n            AMU Act would not be ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\ne.          The argument that the administration of the University vested in the\n\n            Muslim community though it was not established by them was rejected.\n\n            The administration of AMU did not vest in the Muslim minority under the\n\n            AMU Act for the following reasons:\n\n\n      i.         Although all the members of the Court (which was the supreme\n\n                 governing body in terms of Section 23 of the AMU Act) were\n\n                 required to be Muslims, the electorate (which elected the members\n\n                 of the Court) did not comprise exclusively of Muslims;\n\n\n                                                                          Page 8 of 118\n\f                                                                         PART A\n\n     ii.          Other authorities of AMU such as the Executive Council and the\n\n                  Academic Council were tasked with the administration of the\n\n                  University and were given significant powers. The members of\n\n                  these bodies were not required to be Muslims;\n\n\n     iii.         The Governor General (who was the Lord Rector) was also\n\n                  entrusted with certain “overriding” powers concerning the\n\n                  administration of the University. The Governor General was not\n\n                  required to be a Muslim. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/613561/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 28(3)</a>, the Governor\n\n                  General had overriding powers to amend or repeal the Statutes.\n\n                  The Governor General possessed similar powers with respect to\n\n                  amending or repealing Ordinances. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1608576/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 40</a>, the\n\n                  Governor General had the power to remove any difficulty in the\n\n                  establishment of the University; and\n\n\n     iv.

The reference and related events\n\n\n5.      In 1981, a two-Judge Bench of this Court in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya v.\n\n        District Inspector of Schools8 was faced with a question of whether\n\n        V.M.H.S Rehmania Inter College is a minority educational institution. By an\n\n        order dated 26 November 1981, the Bench questioned the correctness of\n\n        Azeez Basha (supra) and referred the matter to a Bench of seven Judges, in\n\n        the following terms:\n\n\n                           “After hearing counsel for the Parties, we are clearly\n                           of the opinion that this case involves two substantial\n                           questions regarding the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 30(1)</a>\n                           of the Constitution of India. The present institution\n                           was founded in the year 1938 and registered under\n                           the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_44\">Societies Registration Act</a> in the year 1940. The\n                           documents relating to the time when the\n                           institution was founded clearly shows that while\n                           the institution was established mainly by the\n                           Muslim community but there were members\n                           from the non-Muslim community also who\n                           participated in the establishment process. The\n                           point that arises is as to whether <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_45\">Art. 30(1)</a> of the\n                           Constitution envisages an institution which is\n                           established by minorities alone without the\n                           participation for the factum of establishment\n                           from any other community. On this point, there\n                           is no clear decision of this court. There are some\n                           observations in S. Azeez Basha &amp; ors. Vs. Union of\n                           India 1968(1) SCR 333, but these observations can\n                           be explained away. Another point that arises is\n                           whether soon after the establishment of the\n                           institution if it is registered as a Society under\n                           the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_46\">Society Registration Act</a>, its status as a\n                           minority institution changes in view of the broad\n                           principles laid down in S. Azeez Basha&#x27;s case.\n                           Even as it is several jurists including Mr. Seervai\n                           have expressed about the correctness of the\n                           decision of this court in S. Azeez Basha&#x27;s case.\n                           Since the point has arisen in this case we think\n                           that this is a proper occasion when a larger\n                           bench can consider the entire aspect fully. We,\n\n8\n    W.P.(C) No. 54-57 of 1981\n\n                                                                                     Page 10 of 118\n\f                                                                                     PART B\n\n                        therefore, direct that this case may be placed\n                        before Hon. The Chief Justice for being heard by\n                        a bench of at least 7 judges so that S. Azeez\n                        Basha&#x27;s case may also be considered and the\n                        points that arise in this case directly as to the\n                        essential conditions or ingredients of the\n                        minority institution may also be decided once for\n                        all. A large number of jurists including Mr. Seervai,\n                        learned counsel for the petitioners Mr. Garg and\n                        learned counsel for respondents and interveners Mr.\n                        Dikshit and Kaskar have stated that this case\n                        requires reconsideration. In view of the urgency it is\n                        necessary that the matter should be decided as early\n                        as possible we give liberty to the counsel for parties\n                        to mention the matter before Chief Justice.”\n\n\n                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n     The above extract indicates that the following three questions were of concern\n\n     to this Court: (i) the essential conditions or ingredients of a minority educational\n\n     institution; (ii) whether the expression ‘establish’ in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 30</a> means that the\n\n     institution should be established only by a minority without any association by\n\n     other communities; and (iii) whether the registration under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_48\">Societies\n\n     Registration Act</a> 1860 after the establishment of the institution alters its\n\n     character.\n\n\n6.    About a month after the order referring the matter to a Bench of seven Judges,\n\n      the AMU Act was amended. On 31 December 1981, the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_49\">Aligarh Muslim\n\n      University (Amendment) Act</a> 19819 received the assent of the President.\n\n      Various provisions of the AMU Act were amended, including the long title and\n\n      preamble from which the words “establish and” were omitted.10 <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 2(l)</a>\n\n      which defined the term ‘University’ was also amended.11 After the\n\n\n9\n  AMU (Amendment) Act 1981\n10\n   AMU (Amendment) Act 1981, Section 2\n11\n   AMU (Amendment) Act 1981, <a href=\"/doc/76226/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 3</a>\n\n                                                                                 Page 11 of 118\n\f                                                                                       PART B\n\n        amendment, ‘University’ was defined to mean “the educational institution of\n\n        their choice established by the Muslims of India, which originated as the\n\n        Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh, and which was subsequently\n\n        incorporated as the Aligarh Muslim University.” The amendment included\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/143764/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 5(2)(c)</a> by which the University was required to promote “the\n\n        educational and cultural advancement of the Muslims of India”12.\n\n\n7.      In 2002, an eleven-Judge Bench of this Court in TMA Pai Foundation v.\n\n        State of Karnataka13 heard a batch of tagged matters which included\n\n        Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra). This Court formulated a question which\n\n        reflected the reference made in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra). The\n\n        question was as follows: what is the indicia for an educational institution to be\n\n        a minority education institution to which the rights in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 30</a> would apply:\n\n\n                          “3(a) What are the indicia for treating an educational\n                          institution as a minority educational institution?\n                          Would an institution be regarded as a minority\n                          educational institution because it was established by\n                          a person(s) belonging to a religious or linguistic\n                          minority or its being administered by a person(s)\n                          belonging to a religious or linguistic minority?”\n\n\n8.      Despite framing the question arising from the reference, this Court did not\n\n        answer it in TMA Pai (supra). The decision stated that a regular Bench would\n\n        adjudicate the question. However, the regular Bench disposed of the matters\n\n        before it on 11 March 2003 without answering the question.\n\n\n\n\n12\n     AMU (Amendment) Act 1981, <a href=\"/doc/343062/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 4</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/1509263/\" id=\"a_55\">13\n     (2002)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1126943/\" id=\"a_56\">8</a> SCC 481\n\n                                                                                   Page 12 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n9.      Separately, AMU proposed a policy for admission into its post-graduate\n\n        medical course by which 50% of the seats were reserved for Muslim\n\n        candidates. The proposal was accepted by the Union of India. Proceedings\n\n        were initiated under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 226</a> for challenging the constitutional validity of the\n\n        reservation policy.\n\n\n10. The petitioners argued that the reservation policy by which 50% of the seats\n\n        were earmarked for Muslims was unconstitutional because AMU was not a\n\n        minority educational institution in view of the judgment of this Court in Azeez\n\n        Basha (supra). They averred that the amendments to Sections 2(l) and\n\n        5(2)(c) of the AMU Act by the AMU (Amendment) Act 1981 attempted to\n\n        overrule the judgment in Azeez Basha (supra) without altering the basis of\n\n        the decision in that case. In response, AMU contended that the AMU\n\n        (Amendment) Act 1981 had the effect of changing the basis of Azeez Basha\n\n        (supra) and that AMU was a minority institution after the amendment, and\n\n        thus was entitled to reserve seats for candidates from the Muslim community.\n\n\n11. A Single Judge of the Allahabad High Court in the decision in Dr. Naresh\n\n        Agarwal v. Union of India declared the reservation policy unconstitutional\n\n        on the following grounds:14\n\n\n        a.    The basis for the decision in Azeez Basha (supra) was <a href=\"/doc/76226/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/343062/\" id=\"a_59\">4</a>,\n\n              and <a href=\"/doc/1215324/\" id=\"a_60\">6</a>. These provisions were not amended by the AMU (Amendment)\n\n              Act 1981. The deletion of the word ‘establish’ from the long title and the\n\n              preamble, and the amendment to the definition of the term ‘University’ in\n\n\n14\n     2005 SCC OnLine All 1705\n\n                                                                             Page 13 of 118\n\f                                                                                             PART B\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 2(l)</a> are not sufficient to hold that AMU is a minority institution\n\n               under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 30;</a>\n\n\n         b.    The Muslim community willingly surrendered the right to administer the\n\n               University to statutory bodies;\n\n\n         c.    The amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 2(l)</a> is a legislative action which encroaches\n\n               on judicial power and is akin to Parliament functioning as an appellate\n\n               court or tribunal. To prevent <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 2(l)</a> from being struck down for\n\n               overruling Azeez Basha (supra), it is necessary to read down the term\n\n               &quot;established&quot; in the amended AMU Act as referring to MAO College; and\n\n\n         d.    AMU, not being a minority institution, is not entitled to the protection of\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 30</a> and shall not provide for reservation on the basis of religion as\n\n               this would amount to a violation of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 29(2).</a>\n\n\n12. The Court declared AMU’s reservation policy unconstitutional and directed\n\n         the cancellation of the admissions made under this policy. It directed the\n\n         University to conduct a fresh entrance examination without reservation on the\n\n         basis of religion.\n\n\n13. The judgement in appeal by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court\n\n         was reported as Aligarh Muslim University v. Malay Shukla.15 The Division\n\n         Bench affirmed the judgment of the Single Judge, with some modifications.\n\n         AN Ray, C.J. speaking for the Division Bench held that:\n\n\n\n\n15\n     Judgment in Special Appeal No 1321 of 2005 and connected matters, High Court of Allahabad\n\n                                                                                         Page 14 of 118\n\f                                                                       PART B\n\na.   When the minority status is not assumed or admitted, the factor of\n\n     administration and control by non-minority groups becomes important.\n\n     The indicia for the determination of whether an educational institution is\n\n     a minority educational institution is (i) who established it; (ii) who is\n\n     responsible for administration; and (iii) the purpose of the establishment;\n\n\nb.   By amending <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 2(l)</a>, Parliament attempted to overrule the decision\n\n     in Azeez Basha (supra). This amendment does not change the basis of\n\n     that decision because the incorporation of the University was not the\n\n     sole factor which influenced the decision;\n\n\nc.   <a href=\"/doc/143764/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 5(2)(c)</a> is discriminatory. Further, it does not change the basis of\n\n     the decision in Azeez Basha (supra);\n\n\nd.   The removal of the words “establish and” from the long title and\n\n     preamble of the AMU Act is impermissible because Azeez Basha\n\n     (supra) held that incorporation and establishment are intimately\n\n     connected. Permitting the omission of the word “establish” may give rise\n\n     to doubts as to whether incorporation alone is sufficient for the surrender\n\n     of the minority character of the institution;\n\n\ne.   AMU is not merely a university but a field of legislative power in Entry 63\n\n     of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 2(l)</a>\n\n     modified the definition of a word in an entry in the Seventh Schedule.\n\n     The definition of a word in the Constitution cannot be altered except\n\n     through a constitutional amendment. The AMU (Amendment) Act 1981\n\n     therefore suffers from lack of legislative competence; and\n\n                                                                   Page 15 of 118\n\f                                                                            PART B\n\n    f.   Parliament lacks the authority to create a minority institution. Only a\n\n         minority can do so and courts may declare whether a minority has\n\n         succeeded in establishing an institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 30.</a>\n\n\n14. Ashok Bhushan, J. concurred with AN Ray, C.J. in a separate judgment. The\n\n    learned Judge observed that the institution must have been both established\n\n    and administered by a minority to seek the protection of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 30(1).</a> The\n\n    1981 Amendment, in his view, has dealt with the establishment component of\n\n    the judgment but has left the administration component untouched. Further,\n\n    the learned Judge agreeing with Chief Justice Ray observed that the\n\n    requirements for a minority to establish an institution cannot be secured by\n\n    merely altering the definition of the institution and the long title and the\n\n    preamble of the Act. In view of the findings detailed above, the Court declared\n\n    that AMU was not a minority institution within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 30</a> and\n\n    struck down <a href=\"/doc/1694789/\" id=\"a_73\">Sections 2(l)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/143764/\" id=\"a_74\">5(2)(c)</a> as amended by the AMU (Amendment)\n\n    Act 1981. The High Court held that the removal of the words “establish and”\n\n    from the long title and preamble was invalid and restored them. It affirmed the\n\n    conclusion   of   the   Single   Judge   that   the   reservation   policy   was\n\n    unconstitutional. However, it overruled the direction issued by the Single\n\n    Judge to AMU to cancel the admission of students who had already been\n\n    accommodated in the University on the basis of the reservation policy.\n\n\n15. On 12 February 2019, while hearing the appeal against the judgment of the\n\n    Division Bench, a three-Judge Bench of this Court presided over by Chief\n\n    Justice Ranjan Gogoi noticed that the High Court relied on the decision in\n\n\n\n                                                                        Page 16 of 118\n\f                                                                          PART B\n\nAzeez Basha (supra). It also noticed that the reference in Anjuman-e-\n\nRahmaniya (supra) on the correctness of Azeez Basha (supra) was yet to\n\nbe determined. The observations in Azeez Basha (supra) that the words\n\n“establish” and “administer” in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 30(1)</a> must be read conjunctively were\n\nreferred to. Having noticed all of the above, the three-Judge Bench observed\n\nthat the correctness of the question arising from the decision in Azeez Basha\n\n(supra) is unanswered:\n\n\n          “1. This Court in S. Azeez Basha and Anr. Vs. Union of\n          India, inter alia, has observed as follows:\n\n\n                  “It is to our mind quite clear that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_76\">Art. 30(1)</a>\n                  postulates that the religious community will\n                  have the right to establish and administer\n                  educational institutions of their choice\n                  meaning thereby that where a religious\n                  minority established an educational\n                  institution, it will have the right to administer\n                  that. An argument has been raised to the\n                  effect that even though the religious\n                  minority may not have established the\n                  educational institution, it will have the right\n                  to administer it, if by some process it had\n                  been administering the same before the\n                  Constitution came into force. We are not\n                  prepared to accept this argument. The\n                  Article in our opinion clearly shows that the\n                  minority will have the right to administer\n                  educational institutions of their choice\n                  provided they have established them, but\n                  not otherwise. The Article cannot be read\n                  to mean that even if the educational\n                  institution has been established by\n                  somebody else, any religious minority\n                  would have the right to administer it\n                  because, for some reason or other, it might\n                  have been administering it before the\n                  Constitution came into force. The words\n                  “establish and administer” in the Article\n                  must be read conjunctively and so read it\n                  gives the right to the minority to administer\n                  an educational institution provided it has\n\n\n                                                                      Page 17 of 118\n\f                                                                                       PART B\n\n                                been established by it. ……….We are of\n                                the opinion that nothing in that case\n                                justifies the contention raised on behalf of\n                                the petitioners that the minorities would\n                                have the right to administer an educational\n                                institution even though the institution may\n                                not have been established by them. The\n                                two words in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_77\">Art. 30(1)</a> must be read\n                                together and so read the Article gives the\n                                right to the minority to administer\n                                institutions established by it. If the\n                                educational institution has not been\n                                established by a minority it cannot claim the\n                                right to administer it under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_78\">Art. 30(1)</a>.”\n\n\n                                […]\n\n\n                             8. The said facts would show that the\n                             correctness of the question arising from the\n                             decision of this Court in S. Azeez Basha (supra)\n                             has remained undetermined.\n\n\n                             9. That apart, the decision of this Court in Prof.\n                             Yashpal and another vs. State of Chhattisgarh\n                             and others and the amendment of the National\n                             Commission for <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_79\">Minority Educational Institutions\n                             Act, 2004</a> made in the year 2010 would also\n                             require an authoritative pronouncement on the\n                             aforesaid question formulated, as set out above,\n                             besides the correctness of the view\n                             expressed in the judgment of this Court in S.\n                             Azeez Basha (supra) which has been\n                             extracted above.”\n\n\n                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n16. The three-Judge Bench then referred the matter to a seven-Judge Bench.\n\n\n17. When this matter was taken up for hearing, the Union of India sought to\n\n         withdraw its appeal against the decision of the Division Bench of the\n\n         Allahabad High Court.16 This Court is competent to hear the present case\n\n\n\n16\n     Civil Appeal No. 2318 of 2006, Supreme Court of India\n\n                                                                                   Page 18 of 118\n\f                                                                                  PART C\n\n     even if the Union of India was permitted to withdraw its appeal because the\n\n     other appellants continue to press their case.\n\n\nC.   Submissions\n\n\n18. The petitioners broadly contend that the decision in Azeez Basha (supra) is\n\n     not correct, and that AMU is a minority institution. The submissions of the\n\n     learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the intervenors are\n\n     summarized below.\n\n\n19. Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned senior counsel made the following submissions:\n\n\n     a.      The Union of India&#x27;s recent attempt to withdraw its appeal against the\n\n             minority status of AMU contradicts its consistent position since 1981;\n\n\n     b.          Azeez Basha (supra) is no longer good law because:\n\n\n           i.        It failed to recognize that the words &#x27;establish&#x27; and &#x27;administer&#x27; are\n\n                     not preconditions to define a minority but the consequential rights\n\n                     that flow from such a recognition;\n\n\n          ii.        The assumption that universities lose their minority status when\n\n                     recognized by a statute conflicts with the right of minorities to\n\n                     establish educational institutions;\n\n\n          iii.       It recognized the role of the Muslim community in the establishment\n\n                     of AMU but held that its origins and administration were rooted in\n\n                     legislation. This interpretation could restrict the recognition of\n\n                     minority institutions under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 30;</a>\n\n\n                                                                              Page 19 of 118\n\f                                                                                PART C\n\n     iv.        Its restrictive interpretation of the word &#x27;establish&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 30(1)</a> is\n\n                contrary to the expansive view adopted by subsequent judgments;\n\n                and\n\n\n     v.         This decision has been superseded by subsequent decisions like\n\n                TMA Pai (supra), which emphasized that the religious character of\n\n                an    institution   cannot   be      stripped   down   by   government\n\n                interventions.\n\n\nc.         Upholding Azeez Basha (supra) could jeopardize the minority status of\n\n           several    educational    institutions,    including   recognized     minority\n\n           institutions like St. Stephen’s College and Christian Medical College;\n\n\nd.         Minority rights were acknowledged by the State before the adoption of\n\n           the Constitution through various legislative enactments like the Indian\n\n           Councils Act of 1909, and the Government of India Acts of 1919 and\n\n           1935, which provided reservations to Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians in\n\n           the legislature;\n\n\ne.         The formation of AMU was characterized as a &quot;movement&quot; rather than\n\n           a &quot;surrender&quot; by the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College. Provisions\n\n           in the AMU Act, including the transfer of assets, liabilities, and special\n\n           provisions for Muslim students, underscore the continuation of minority\n\n           rights with the establishment of AMU;\n\n\nf.         Entry 63 in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution\n\n           deals with the competence of the Union to make laws regarding AMU\n\n\n                                                                            Page 20 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\n             and BHU but does not determine who established or administers the\n\n             universities. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 30</a>, which guarantees minority rights, cannot be\n\n             negated merely because the institution is of national importance in terms\n\n             of Entry 63;\n\n\n      g.     The evolution of the AMU Act can be broken down into four phases: pre-\n\n             1951 with Muslim administration, the 1951 Amendment aligning with the\n\n             Constitution, the 1965 Amendment diluting minority status, and attempts\n\n             to restore minority status in 1972 and 1981;\n\n\n      h.     While the 1951 amendment aligned the Act with the Constitution by\n\n             removing compulsory religious education, the 1965 amendment diluted\n\n             minority administration by reducing &quot;the Court” to an advisory role,\n\n             shifting the supreme governing authority to the &quot;Visitor&quot; and the\n\n             President of India; and\n\n\n      i.     Amendments in 1972 and 1981 aimed to restore AMU to minorities. The\n\n             1981 amendment explicitly stated that AMU was &quot;established by the\n\n             Muslims of India&quot; and aimed to promote Muslim educational and cultural\n\n             advancement. The 1981 amendment accommodated a democratic\n\n             setup, focusing on the institution&#x27;s original purpose rather than numerical\n\n             representation.\n\n\n20.        Mr Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel made the following submissions:\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           Page 21 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART C\n\na.    The enactment of the Act of 1920 marked the formal recognition of the\n\n      MAO &quot;College&quot; as the Aligarh Muslim University, reflecting a crucial\n\n      legislative step in its evolution into a full-fledged University;\n\n\nb.    Compliance with regulatory requirements, constitutionally grounded in\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 19(6)</a>, is crucial for university status. However, adherence to\n\n      these regulations does not diminish the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 30</a> to\n\n      minorities to establish institutions of their choice;\n\n\nc.    <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 30</a> grants religious and linguistic minorities the autonomy to\n\n      establish and administer institutions of their “choice”. Institutions\n\n      covered by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 30</a> have the flexibility to choose their administrative\n\n      set-up, even if it includes individuals outside the minority community.\n\n      This choice is solely vested in the institution;\n\n\nd.        Assessing the numerical composition within the administration is\n\n          inadequate to determine its minority status. Minority institutions have the\n\n          prerogative to include non-minorities in their administration while\n\n          maintaining their minority status. St. Stephen’s College, Delhi, despite\n\n          having a Christian representation of less than 5 per cent, maintains its\n\n          classification as a minority institution;\n\n\ne.        The crucial factor for recognizing an educational institution as a Minority\n\n          educational institution lies in its genesis, focusing on three key aspects:\n\n\n     i.        the purpose for which it was founded (educational advancement of\n\n               the minority community);\n\n\n                                                                          Page 22 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\n     ii.         the identity of the founders and major fund providers (being\n\n                 substantially from the concerned minority); and\n\n\n     iii.        the concept&#x27;s initiation by a member of the minority,\n\n\nf.          Provisions within the AMU Act focus on governance structures,\n\n            academic standards, and prevention of maladministration. These\n\n            statutory measures primarily relate to the administration of the University\n\n            and do not alter the constitutional fact of its establishment by a minority;\n\n\ng.          &quot;Establish&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 30</a> must be interpreted to mean ‘found’. The\n\n            word does not cover the conversion process from a college to a\n\n            university through the AMU Act;\n\n\nh.          AMU was established with the objective of providing quality education\n\n            specifically to Muslims. The exclusivity of such institutions in offering\n\n            education tailored to the needs of minorities was not adequately\n\n            considered by Azeez Basha (supra);\n\n\ni.          The denial of reservation to institutions like AMU results in fewer degrees\n\n            and job opportunities, exacerbating socio-economic disparities within\n\n            minority groups;\n\n\nj.          The founders of AMU satisfactorily fulfilled the five-step criteria laid down\n\n            in TMA Pai (supra) to ascertain the right to administer. The criteria\n\n            related to admission policies, fee structures, governance, faculty\n\n            appointments and disciplinary action;\n\n\n\n                                                                           Page 23 of 118\n\f                                                                                               PART C\n\n         k.    The objective of establishing AMU was to obtain the status of an\n\n               independent university and not demonstrate allegiance to colonial\n\n               authorities;\n\n\n         l.    A minority institution can accede to some regulations to maintain a\n\n               particular standard of education. With that, the institution also retains the\n\n               right to challenge any invasive restrictions imposed on it; and\n\n\n         m.    The imperial government never interfered with the administration of the\n\n               University after it was incorporated. MAO College was also supervised\n\n               by the British government even when it was not a university. MAO\n\n               College was acknowledged as a minority institution under Azeez Basha\n\n               (supra).\n\n\n21. Mr Salman Khurshid, learned senior counsel made the following submissions:\n\n\n         a.    Adopting a &#x27;political, moral reading&#x27; of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 30</a> would facilitate a\n\n               broader interpretation of the term &#x27;established&#x27;. Ronald Dworkin’s\n\n               definition of a &#x27;political moral reading&#x27; involves invoking moral principles\n\n               about political decency and justice for interpreting constitutional\n\n               provisions17;\n\n\n         b.    Aligarh Tehzeeb represents a distinctive cultural ethos cultivated by the\n\n               AMU. This unique cultural identity encompasses traditions, values and\n\n               practices that have evolved within the university;\n\n\n\n\n17\n     Reliance was placed on Ronald Dworkin, “The Moral Reading of the Constitution” (March 21, 1996).\n\n                                                                                          Page 24 of 118\n\f                                                                                   PART C\n\n    c.     The concept of takeover in the context of educational institutions can be\n\n           categorized into non-consensual and consensual takeovers. In the case\n\n           of AMU, there was a consensual takeover, where changes and\n\n           amendments were made to its structure and character through a process\n\n           that involved the University&#x27;s participation and consent; and\n\n\n    d.         AMU was founded by members of the community. The societies formed\n\n               for this purpose had a crucial role in the establishment and evolution of\n\n               the University, contributing resources, support and a collective vision\n\n               that shaped the identity and character of AMU.\n\n\n22. Mr. Shadan Farasat, learned counsel submitted that:\n\n\n    a.         The purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 30</a> rests primarily on two grounds:\n\n\n         i.          The ability to retain the minority identity;\n\n\n         ii.        The ability to fully participate in the national mainstream;\n\n\n               Azeez Basha (supra) adopts an approach by which the institution could\n\n               either retain the minority status or integrate into the national mainstream\n\n               and lose it;\n\n\n    b.         The Indian secularism model allows state involvement in religious\n\n               activities without compromising their character;\n\n\n    c.         In advocating for a broader interpretation of &#x27;establish&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 30</a>, there\n\n               is a need to distinguish between &#x27;establish&#x27; and &#x27;incorporate&#x27; to better\n\n               preserve constitutional protection for minority educational institutions.\n\n\n                                                                               Page 25 of 118\n\f                                                                                PART C\n\n           The AMU Act of 1920 only “incorporated” AMU. This is fundamentally\n\n           different from the establishment of the institution;\n\n\n    d.     Stripping away the minority character of AMU would diminish its\n\n           significant place in history since the institution has led to:\n\n\n         i.        The creation of a Muslim-educated middle class; and\n\n\n         ii.       The education of women.\n\n\n    e.         The validity of the 1981 amendment should not be considered in this\n\n               case. The Parliament enacted it to reinstate AMU&#x27;s minority status,\n\n               which is now being contested by the current Union government.\n\n               Considering the Union&#x27;s arguments requires reassessing Parliament&#x27;s\n\n               reasoning behind the law.\n\n\n23. Mr MR Shamshad, learned counsel submitted that an inclusive definition of\n\n    ‘minority educational institutions’ includes universities established and\n\n    administered by minorities.\n\n\n24. The respondents broadly submitted that Azeez Basha (supra) is good law,\n\n    and that AMU is not a minority institution. They argued that AMU was\n\n    established by Parliament. The submissions of the learned counsel on behalf\n\n    of the respondents and the intervenors are summarized below.\n\n\n25. Mr R Venkataramani, Attorney General for India appearing for the Union of\n\n    India, made the following submissions:\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            Page 26 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART C\n\n     a.   The right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 30</a> can only be exercised if there is\n\n          legislation in place to enable the establishment and administration of\n\n          minority institutions. This legislation should empower minorities to form\n\n          institutions under constitutional provisions; and\n\n\n     b.   While <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 30</a> guarantees minorities certain rights, they are not exempt\n\n          from   other    constitutional   requirements,      particularly      regarding\n\n          reservation.\n\n\n26. Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India appearing for the Union of India,\n\n     made the following submissions:\n\n\n     a.   Azeez Basha (supra) correctly recognized the choices available to AMU\n\n          in 1920. It had the choice of either affiliating with another university or\n\n          surrendering its minority status to the imperial government;\n\n\n     b.   Under the AMU Act, AMU voluntarily surrendered its minority institution\n\n          status to the imperial government. This is shown by the historical context\n\n          of the Aligarh Split, where the institution&#x27;s leaders chose cooperation\n\n          with the British government over retaining its Muslim character;\n\n\n     c.   The British government exerted control over AMU, as evidenced by\n\n          provisions in the 1920 Act. The Lord Rector had significant authority in\n\n          the administration of the institution. <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_93\">The Act</a> dissolved the previous\n\n          governing body and transferred property and decision-making authority\n\n          to secular government authorities;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Page 27 of 118\n\f                                                                        PART C\n\nd.   The 1920 Act was a substantive statute which dealt with the specifics of\n\n     the administration of the institution. The administration of the institution\n\n     predominantly vested with the non-minority;\n\n\ne.   The British government mandated that AMU should not be a religious\n\n     institution and should be controlled by secular authorities;\n\n\nf.   Amendments in 1951 made the 1920 Act consistent with constitutional\n\n     provisions. This affirmed that AMU was established by statute, not by\n\n     the minority community;\n\n\ng.   Justice M.C. Chagla in the course of legislative debates in 1965 stated\n\n     that AMU was neither established nor administered by minorities. Azeez\n\n     Basha (supra) correctly held that AMU surrendered its minority status to\n\n     the British Government;\n\n\nh.   The validity of the 1981 amendment is questionable, as it is contrary to\n\n     previous judicial decisions;\n\n\ni.   The 1981 reference sought clarity on the definition of a minority\n\n     educational institution. The reference did not include the question of\n\n     whether AMU is a minority educational institution. Legal challenges in\n\n     2005 regarding reservations for Muslims in postgraduate programs led\n\n     to the current reference. This reference also focused on a specific legal\n\n     question without reopening factual controversies;\n\n\nj.   The term &quot;establish&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 30</a> should be interpreted to mean\n\n     tangible and manifest establishment. The indicia to decide the minority\n\n                                                                    Page 28 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART C\n\n           character of an institution contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 30(1)</a> of the\n\n           Constitution, must include the following:\n\n\n     i.         The institution/university must necessarily be established and\n\n                administered by the minority community; and\n\n\n     ii.        The institution/university should be established by the minority, for\n\n                the minority and as a minority institution.\n\n\nk.         There are concerns about the potential misuse of minority status without\n\n           a strict standard of actual establishment. The drafting history of\n\n           fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_96\">Articles 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_97\">30</a> consistently uses “establish”\n\n           and “administer” conjunctively and further expresses apprehensions\n\n           about an over-expansive interpretation of these Articles;\n\n\nl.         The genesis of an institution does not determine its minority status.\n\n           Legislative enactments are the final authority on the establishment, as\n\n           seen in legislations where the minority status is explicitly recognised;\n\n\nm.         The reliance on St. Stephen’s (supra) is self-defeating since this Court\n\n           applied the standard of administrative control as an indicia in that case.\n\n           The involvement of the Government in AMU&#x27;s establishment, clear intent\n\n           and specific provisions indicate the national and non-minority character\n\n           of the institution;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         Page 29 of 118\n\f                                                                                       PART C\n\n        n.          The Nation Commission for Minority Educational Institution Act 200418\n\n                   and its Amendment in 2010 provide that an institution needs to be\n\n                   established and administered by minorities to be a minority educational\n\n                   institution. The said definition is not under challenge; and\n\n\n        o.         The consequence of recognising AMU as a minority educational\n\n                   institution is that seats cannot be reserved for the other categories of the\n\n                   Scheduled     Castes/Scheduled      Tribes/Socially     and    Educationally\n\n                   Backward Classes.\n\n\n27. Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel submitted that:\n\n\n        a.         For a community to be considered a &quot;minority,&quot; it must fulfil three criteria:\n\n\n              i.         It must be numerically lesser than the majority;\n\n\n             ii.         It cannot be the ruling group even if it is numerically smaller; and\n\n\n             iii.        The group itself should identify as a minority.\n\n\n        b.          Muslims were not recognized as a minority during British rule, as Hindus\n\n                    and Muslims were considered equals. Syed Ahmed Khan, the founder\n\n                    of Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, claimed in a letter that the\n\n                    Muslim community never considered itself as a minority and instead as\n\n                    rulers prior to the British government;\n\n\n        c.         Judgments of this Court have held that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 30(1)</a> applies to\n\n                   institutions that were established before the commencement of the\n\n\n18\n     “<a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_99\">NCMEI Act</a>”\n\n                                                                                   Page 30 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART C\n\n           Constitution. However, these decisions dealt with colleges and schools\n\n           and not a University. <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 30(1)</a> does not apply to a University that was\n\n           established before the commencement of the Constitution because a\n\n           University before the enactment of the University Grants Commission\n\n           1956 could only have been established by the Government and not a\n\n           person; and\n\n\n      d.   Azeez Basha (supra) was a standalone and statute-specific judgment.\n\n           Overruling it would disrupt the Union&#x27;s control over AMU, constituting\n\n           “public mischief”. The precedent set by the case should only be\n\n           overturned if there is a substantial risk to public interest, which is not the\n\n           case here.\n\n\n28.   Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul, learned senior counsel submitted that:\n\n\n      a.   The correctness or validity of Azeez Basha (supra) was not within the\n\n           purview of the reference order, which solely aimed to clarify the meaning\n\n           of &quot;established and administered&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 30;</a>\n\n\n      b.   Parliament cannot deny a fact by creating legal fiction in a subsequent\n\n           legislation. The 1981 amendment only attempted to change who\n\n           “established” the University but made no change in the provision related\n\n           to the administration of the University. It attempted to rewrite history by\n\n           altering the recognition of the University&#x27;s establishment;\n\n\n      c.   AMU&#x27;s inclusion as an institution of national importance under Entry 63\n\n           of the Union list gives the Union government sole authority over it.\n\n\n                                                                           Page 31 of 118\n\f                                                                          PART C\n\n         Altering AMU&#x27;s status would require a constitutional amendment rather\n\n         than a legislative amendment; and\n\n\n    d.   Over the past decades, there has been no demand for minority status\n\n         for AMU, as evidenced by legislative actions in 1951 and 1965. The\n\n         demand for minority rights now would conflict with existing reservation\n\n         rights for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Socially and\n\n         Economically Backward Classes.\n\n\n29. Mr Guru Krishnakumar, learned senior counsel made the following\n\n    submissions:\n\n\n    a.   The &quot;new sovereign,&quot; presumably referring to contemporary legislative\n\n         and executive authorities, holds the discretion to determine the approach\n\n         towards minority rights. This implies that decisions regarding minority\n\n         rights are subject to the interpretation and judgment of current governing\n\n         bodies;\n\n\n    b.   H.V. Kamath in the Constituent Assembly advocated for parliamentary\n\n         legislation on universities to demonstrate their impartial and non-\n\n         communal nature. Similarly, Naziruddin Ahmed, a member of the Muslim\n\n         League in the Constituent Assembly, asserted that universities were\n\n         rightly under the Union&#x27;s jurisdiction; and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 32 of 118\n\f                                                                                                PART D\n\n         c.    A fact established by legislation cannot override a fact recognised by the\n\n               Court.19\n\n\n30. Mr Vijay Navare, learned senior counsel submitted that granting minority\n\n         status to AMU would undermine Parliament&#x27;s authority and interfere with\n\n         powers vested under Entry 63.\n\n\n31. Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, learned senior counsel submitted that AMU was\n\n         created &#x27;by the Statute&#x27; (Act 21 of 1920) and not &#x27;under the Statute’.\n\n\n32. Mr. Nachiketa Joshi, learned counsel submitted that the Rajya Sabha debates\n\n         related to the amendments of 1981 reveal a misconception that this Court in\n\n         Azeez Basha (supra) neglected AMU&#x27;s history before 1920. The amendment\n\n         failed to alter the foundational aspect of Azeez Basha (supra), which is\n\n         centred on the Muslim community&#x27;s concessions to the terms of the British\n\n         Government.\n\n\nD.       Issues\n\n\n33.       The petitioner and the respondents disagree on whether this Bench must\n\n         determine if AMU is a minority educational institution. In Anjuman-e-\n\n         Rahmaniya (supra), the two-Judge Bench referred the question of the\n\n         essential ingredients of a minority education institution. This was the core\n\n         issue which was referred to the Constitution Bench. The other two questions\n\n         which were formulated, that is, the meaning of the phrase “establish” and the\n\n         impact of registration under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_102\">Societies Registration Act</a> 1860 after the\n\n\n19\n     Reliance was placed on Indira Sawhney (II) v. Union of India &amp; Ors, AIR 2000 SC 498.\n\n                                                                                            Page 33 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART D\n\n     establishment of the institution are in essence, subsets of the core issue. The\n\n     question of the indicia for recognising an educational institution as a minority\n\n     educational institution was reflected in question 3(a) framed in TMA Pai\n\n     (supra). Thus, neither was Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) nor TMA Pai\n\n     (supra) concerned with the factual situation in Azeez Basha: that is, whether\n\n     AMU is a minority education institution.\n\n\n34. The 2019 reference order also limits the reference to the legal aspects arising\n\n     from the decision in Azeez Basha (supra) and not the factual aspects of the\n\n     decision relating to AMU. This is clear from the passages from the 2019\n\n     reference order extracted above, particularly paragraphs 8 and 9. Paragraph\n\n     8 states that the correctness of the “question arising from” Azeez Basha\n\n     (supra) has “remained undetermined”. The paragraph indicates that the 2019\n\n     reference order must be read along with the previous references in both\n\n     Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) and TMA Pai Foundation (supra).\n\n     Paragraph 9 mentions that the correctness of the view in Azeez Basha\n\n     (supra) “which has been extracted above” requires an authoritative\n\n     pronouncement. The paragraph from Azeez Basha (supra) extracted in the\n\n     2019 reference order deals with the question of indicia to be considered a\n\n     minority educational institution. It is evident upon a reading of the reference\n\n     orders that only the question of the criteria to be fulfilled to qualify as a minority\n\n     educational institution is referred to this Bench.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Page 34 of 118\n\f                                                                                  PART D\n\n35. From the order in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) referring the judgment in\n\n         Azeez Basha (supra) to a larger Bench, the question formulated in TMA Pai\n\n         (supra) and the 2019 Reference order, the question that must be decided by\n\n         this Bench is what are the ingredients, indicia or criteria for an educational\n\n         institution to be considered a minority educational institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 30.</a>\n\n         The following issues must be answered for this purpose:\n\n\n         a.     Whether an educational institution must be both established and\n\n                administered by a linguistic or religious minority to secure the guarantee\n\n                under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 30;</a>\n\n\n         b.     What are the criteria to be satisfied for the ‘establishment’ of a minority\n\n                institution? Whether <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 30(1)</a> envisages an institution which is\n\n                established by a minority with participation from members of other\n\n                communities;\n\n\n         c.     Whether a minority educational institution which is registered as a\n\n                society under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_106\">Societies Registration Act</a> 186020 soon after its\n\n                establishment loses its status as a minority educational institution by\n\n                virtue of such registration; and\n\n\n         d.     Whether the decision of this Court in Prof. Yashpal v. State of\n\n                Chhattisgarh21 and the amendment of National Commission for Minority\n\n\n\n\n20\n     “<a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_107\">Societies Registration Act</a>”\n21\n     (2005) 5 SCC 420\n\n                                                                              Page 35 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n            Educational Institutions Act 200522 in 2010 have a bearing on the\n\n            question formulated above and if so, in what manner.\n\n\nE.    Analysis\n\n\n      i.      The preliminary objection by the Union of India\n\n\n36. The Union of India advanced a preliminary objection to the reference. It\n\n      argued that the order dated 26 November 1981 in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya\n\n      (supra) by which the matter was referred to a Bench of seven Judges is\n\n      “wholly bad in law.” It relies on the decision of a Constitution Bench in Central\n\n      Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community v. State of Maharashtra23 to argue\n\n      that the two-Judge Bench of this Court in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra)\n\n      could not have referred the correctness of the decision rendered by the\n\n      Constitution Bench in Azeez Basha (supra) directly to a Bench of seven\n\n      Judges. It was suggested that the two-Judge Bench ought to have referred\n\n      the matter to a Bench of equal strength to the decision the correctness of\n\n      which is doubted, that is, a Bench of five Judges. The Union of India argued\n\n      that only a Bench of five Judges could have referred the matter to a Bench of\n\n      seven Judges.\n\n\n37. In Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community (supra), a Constitution\n\n      Bench discussed the legal precepts which apply to orders of reference and\n\n      reiterated the position of law as below:24\n\n\n\n\n22\n   “<a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_108\">NCMEI Act</a>”\n23\n   (2005) 2 SCC 673\n24\n   Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community (supra) [12]\n\n                                                                          Page 36 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\na.     Decisions of this Court rendered by a Bench of larger strength are\n\n       binding on Benches of a less or equal strength;\n\n\nb.        If a Bench of lower strength is doubtful about the correctness of a\n\n          judgment delivered by a Bench of larger strength, it cannot disagree or\n\n          dissent from the view taken by the larger Bench. In case of doubt, it can\n\n          invite the attention of the Chief Justice of India to its opinion and request\n\n          the Chief Justice to list the matter before a Bench, the strength of which\n\n          is greater than that which delivered the judgment which has been\n\n          doubted;\n\n\nc.        The correctness of the view taken by any Bench can only be doubted by\n\n          a Bench of equal strength. The matter will then be placed for hearing\n\n          before a Bench of greater strength;\n\n\nd.        There are two exceptions to the rules discussed above:\n\n\n     i.        The discretion of the Chief Justice is not bound by the rules. As the\n\n               master of the roster, the Chief Justice may list any case before any\n\n               Bench of any strength;\n\n\n     ii.       Despite the rules discussed above, if a particular case has come\n\n               up for hearing before a Bench of larger strength and that Bench is\n\n               of the opinion that the judgment of the Bench of lower strength\n\n               requires reconsideration or correction, or is otherwise doubtful of\n\n               its correctness, it may dispense with the need for a reference in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         Page 37 of 118\n\f                                                                         PART E\n\n               terms described above or an order of the Chief Justice and hear\n\n               the matter for reasons given by it.\n\n\n38. The position of law laid down in Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra\n\n    Community (supra) is correct. Decisions of a larger Bench are binding\n\n    precedent, and judicial discipline and propriety dictate that Benches of lower\n\n    strength must adhere to such decisions. This will also avoid inconsistencies\n\n    in the development of law. Questions concerning the correctness of\n\n    judgments must ordinarily be referred only by a Bench which is equal in\n\n    strength to the Bench whose judgment is doubted. We also agree with the\n\n    two exceptions to this rule, as detailed by this Court in Central Board of\n\n    Dawoodi Bohra Community (supra). They must remain exceptions and not\n\n    transmogrify into the rule itself.\n\n\n39. The three issues which required an authoritative pronouncement in\n\n    Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra), were not directly a point of contention in\n\n    Azeez Basha (supra). However, the decision would have a bearing on them.\n\n    Doubting the correctness of the opinion in Azeez Basha (supra), without\n\n    disagreeing with it, the two-Judge Bench requested that the matter may be\n\n    placed before the Chief Justice of India for being heard by a Bench of seven\n\n    Judges. This falls within the permissible limits laid down in Central Board of\n\n    Dawoodi Bohra Community (supra) as explained in point (b) of paragraph\n\n    37. Further, the Solicitor General has also stated that he is not pressing the\n\n    Union’s preliminary objection. The order of reference dated 12 February\n\n    2019, too, noted that although a three-Judge Bench could not ordinarily refer\n\n\n\n                                                                     Page 38 of 118\n\f                                                                                    PART E\n\n        a case directly to a seven-Judge Bench, it was doing so in this case because\n\n        the question was already referred to a Bench of seven Judges but was not\n\n        answered. The reference order notes:\n\n\n                        “10. Ordinarily and in the normal course the judicial\n                        discipline would require the Bench to seek a\n                        reference of this matter by a Five Judges Bench.\n                        However, having regard to the background, as\n                        stated above, when the precise question was\n                        already referred to a Seven Judges Bench and was,\n                        however, not answered, we are of the view that the\n                        present question, set out above, should be referred\n                        to a Bench of Hon’ble Seven Judges.\n\n\n                        11. Consequently and in the light of the above, place\n                        these matters before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice of\n                        India on the administrative side for appropriate\n                        orders.”\n\n\n40. This Court will hear the questions referred to a seven-Judge Bench for these\n\n        reasons.\n\n\n        ii.   The scope of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 30\n\n\n41.</a> The fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution do not operate in silos.\n\n        In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras,25 the majority judgment of this Court\n\n        held that fundamental rights operate to the mutual exclusion of one another.\n\n        In other words, each fundamental right was understood as being distinct and\n\n        unrelated to the others. This view of Part III of the Constitution was later\n\n        rejected in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India,26 which held that\n\n        Part III “weaves a pattern of guarantees on the texture of basic human rights.\n\n        The guarantees delimit the protection of those rights in their allotted fields:\n\n\n25\n     AIR 1950 SC 27\n26\n     (1970) 1 SCC 248\n\n                                                                                Page 39 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n         they do not attempt to enunciate distinct rights.”27 Maneka Gandhi v. Union\n\n         of India28 affirmed that Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (supra) overruled the\n\n         majority judgment in A.K. Gopalan (supra). Thus, the scope of the right of\n\n         “minorities to establish and administer educational institutions” must be\n\n         identified in the background of the other cultural and religious rights\n\n         guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\n42. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_110\">Articles 25</a> to 28 are placed under the heading ‘Right to freedom of religion’.\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 25(1)</a> stipulates that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of\n\n         conscience, the right to freely profess, practice or propagate religion. This is\n\n         subject, however, to public order, morality, health and other provisions of Part\n\n         III of the Constitution. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 25</a> provides that nothing in Clause\n\n         (1) would affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from\n\n         enacting a law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or\n\n         secular activity, which may be associated with religious practice, and\n\n         legislation providing for social welfare reform or opening Hindu religious\n\n         institutions of public character to all classes and sections of Hindus. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 26</a>\n\n         guarantees religious denominations or a section of them, the right to establish\n\n         and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, manage their\n\n         own affairs in the matter of religion, to own and acquire movable and\n\n         immovable property, and administer such property in accordance with law.\n\n         The rights are subject to public order, morality and health. <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 27</a> mandates\n\n         that no one shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are\n\n\n\n27\n     (1970) 1 SCC 248 [52]\n28\n     (1978) 1 SCC 248\n\n                                                                             Page 40 of 118\n\f                                                                                                 PART E\n\n      to be specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion and\n\n      maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.\n\n\n43. <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 28</a>, deals with the rights of individuals and secures to them vide clause\n\n      (3), the right not to take part in any religious instructions that may be imparted\n\n      in any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid of the\n\n      State funds. The provision stipulates that a person need not attend religious\n\n      worship conducted in such institution or any premises attached thereto unless\n\n      he wishes to do so, and if such person is a minor, upon the consent of his\n\n      guardian. Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 28</a> restricts educational institutions wholly\n\n      maintained out of the State funds29 from imparting ‘religious instructions’.\n\n      However, clause (2) to <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 28</a> stipulates that clause (1) will not apply to an\n\n      educational institution which is administered by the State but was established\n\n      under an endowment or trust which required religious instruction to be\n\n      imparted in such institution. The clause recognises the distinction between\n\n      ‘establishment’ and ‘administration’ of an institution.\n\n\n44. <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_118\">Articles 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_119\">30</a> under the heading ‘Cultural and Educational Rights’, are\n\n      two provisions which specifically confer rights on a section of citizens residing\n\n      in the territory of India or a part thereof, having a distinct language, script, or\n\n      culture. Some would say that these are in nature of special privileges, yet in\n\n      substance, they are in the nature of guarantees and protections given by the\n\n      Constitution not to any specific denomination by identity, but to any section of\n\n\n29\n  The expression ‘wholly maintained out of the State funds’ has been interpreted in DAV College v. State of\nPunjab (II), (1971) 2 SCC 269, to mean an institution which receives grants for its expenditure that may be\nwholly maintained out of the State funds even though it receives a fee for affiliation or holding examination\nas quid pro quo.\n\n                                                                                            Page 41 of 118\n\f                                                                                                  PART E\n\n      the citizens which can be distinguished on the basis of language, script or\n\n      culture. Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 29</a> gives them the right to conserve, secure and\n\n      extol their language, script or culture. The clause underscores the right to\n\n      conserve and nurture the language, script or culture. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 29</a>\n\n      is a negative right which stipulates that no citizen shall be denied admission\n\n      on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them in any\n\n      educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of the State\n\n      funds.\n\n\n45.     Though the heading of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 29</a> states that it is a provision for the protection\n\n      of the interest of minorities, the substantive portion stipulates that the right is\n\n      available to “any section of citizens” residing in India and having a distinct\n\n      language, script or culture of their own. Thus, <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 29</a> applies to non-\n\n      minorities as much as it applies to minorities, provided that the sections have\n\n      a distinct language, script and culture of their own.30 Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_124\">Articles 25</a> to\n\n      28 also do not make a distinction between majority and minority religious\n\n      sections. The provisions guarantee the right to freedom of religion to both\n\n      minorities and non-minorities. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 25</a> recognises the right of all persons\n\n      to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice and\n\n      propagate religion. <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 26</a> recognises the right of every religious\n\n      denomination or any section thereof to manage its religious affairs. The\n\n      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 28</a> also do not distinguish between a minority and a non-\n\n      minority educational institution. The provisions apply equally to educational\n\n\n30\n  See Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society v.

The provisions noted above, whether they refer to individual rights or\n\n       denomination rights are manifestations that India is a pluralistic society with\n\n       different religions, practices, cultures and languages. These provisions which\n\n       are in the nature of rights and guarantees, also prescribe the ambit of State\n\n       interference.\n\n\n47. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 30</a> consists of three clauses. Clause (1) states that all minorities\n\n       whether based on religion or language, shall have a right to establish and\n\n       administer educational institutions of their choice. Clause (1)(a) deals with\n\n       the provision for compulsory acquisition of any property for an educational\n\n       institution established and administered by a minority. We are not concerned\n\n       per se with the said clause. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 30</a> provides that the State\n\n       shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any\n\n       educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a\n\n       minority whether based on religion or language.\n\n\n48. The two crucial expressions which arise for consideration and interpretation\n\n       in this decision are the words ‘establish’ and ‘administer’ used in clause (1) of\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 30.</a> These two words and expressions have to be interpreted in the\n\n\n31\n   See TMA Pai (supra) [88-90;144]; “144 […] As in the case of a majority-run institution, the moment a\nminority institution obtains a grant of aid, <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 28</a> of the Constitution comes into play. When an educational\ninstitution is maintained out of State funds, no religious instruction can be provided therein. <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 28(1)</a> does\nnot state that it applies only to educational institutions that are not established or maintained by religious or\nlinguistic minorities. Furthermore, upon the receipt of aid, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 28(3)</a> would apply to all\neducational institutions whether run by the minorities or the non-minorities.

The purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 30(1)\n\n\n49.</a>    A brief reference to the drafting history of the provision will help us discern\n\n      the purpose of the provision. On 19 April 1947, the Minorities Sub-Committee\n\n      (which was appointed to examine and propose changes to the draft clauses\n\n      of the fundamental rights Committee) submitted the interim report to the\n\n      Chairperson of the Advisory Committee on Minorities and Fundamental\n\n      Rights.32 The Minorities Sub-Committee recommended, inter alia, the\n\n      inclusion of a constitutional provision that stipulated that all minorities,\n\n      whether based on religion, community or language shall be free to establish\n\n      and administer educational institutions of their choice.33 However, when the\n\n      first Draft of the Constitution was submitted by the Drafting Committee to the\n\n      President of the Constituent Assembly, the provision guaranteed a right to\n\n      establish and administer educational institutions.34 This change in the\n\n      language of the provision is crucial to understanding the scope of the\n\n      provision. The provision guaranteed a purely negative group right to religious\n\n      and linguistic minorities against the State with the use of the words “shall be\n\n      free”, that is, the right to ensure that the State does not discriminate against\n\n      minorities who wish to establish and administer educational institutions.\n\n\n\n\n32\n   B. Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: Select Documents [Vol II, The Indian Institute of Public\nAdministration] 207\n33\n   Ibid [ 273]\n34\n   Draft Constitution of India 1948, <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 23(a)</a>\n\n                                                                                             Page 44 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n      However, upon the use of the phrase ‘right’, the possibility of interpreting the\n\n      provision as a guarantee of a positive right arose.\n\n\n50.    It cannot be disputed that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 30(1)</a> guarantees the minority educational\n\n      institutions, the right to not be discriminated. In fact, <a href=\"/doc/1329698/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 30(2)</a> is a facet of\n\n      the principle of non-discrimination of minorities. The Article provides that the\n\n      State shall not discriminate in granting aid to educational institutions or\n\n      discriminate on the ground that it is under the management of a religious or\n\n      linguistic minority. The question is whether the use of ‘right’ in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 30(1)</a>\n\n      also guarantees a ‘special right’ in addition to the right to non-discrimination.\n\n\n51. While there is no doubt that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 30</a> protects the rights of minorities, this\n\n      Court has in numerous judgments conceptualised varied reasons for the\n\n      constitutional guarantee. In Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society v.\n\n      State of Gujarat35, a nine-Judge Bench discussed the objective of the\n\n      provision in detail. Chief Justice Ray writing for himself and Justice Palekar\n\n      observed that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 30</a> ensures equality between the majority and the\n\n      minority, which would be denied in the absence of a special provision.36\n\n      Justice HR Khanna cast the purpose of the provision in terms of substantive\n\n      equality and observed that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 30</a> guarantees ‘special rights’ to give\n\n      minorities a ‘sense of security’. The learned Judge observed that the real\n\n      effect of the provision was to “ensure the preservation of the minority\n\n      institutions by guaranteeing the minorities autonomy […] in administration.”37\n\n\n\n35\n   (1974) 1 SCC 717\n36\n   Ibid [8,9]\n37\n   Ibid [77]\n\n                                                                             Page 45 of 118\n\f                                                                                                     PART E\n\n       Justice Mathew, writing for himself and Justice YV Chandrachud, also traced\n\n       the purpose to the guarantee to substantive equality for minorities. The\n\n       learned Judge observed that it will be impossible to protect the group identity\n\n       of minorities and prevent the assimilation of identities in the absence of a\n\n       provision guaranteeing substantive equality.38\n\n\n52. Justice Mathew referred to the Advisory opinion of the Permanent Court of\n\n       International Justice on Minority Schools in Albania to draw on the purpose of\n\n       providing additional guarantees for minorities39. In this judgment, a crucial\n\n       principle regarding equality and differential treatment for minority groups was\n\n       articulated. The Permanent Court of International Justice observed that true\n\n       equality might necessitate differential treatment to establish equilibrium\n\n       between different situations:\n\n\n                            “Whereas equality in fact may involve the necessity\n                            of differential treatment in order to attain a result\n                            which establishes an equilibrium between different\n                            situations. It is easy to imagine cases in which\n                            equality of treatment of the majority and of the\n                            minority whose situation and requirements are\n                            different, would result in inequality. The equality\n                            between the members of the majority and of the\n                            minority must be effective, genuine equality…”\n\n\n53. This perspective underscores the imperative to enable minorities to maintain\n\n       their distinctive characteristics and fulfil their specific needs. The case in\n\n\n\n\n38\n   Ibid [131-133]; “132.The problem of the minorities is not really a problem of the establishment of equality\nbecause if taken literally, such equality would mean absolute identical treatment of both the minorities and\nthe major ities. This would result only in equality in law but inequality in fact. The distinction need not be\nelaborated for it is obvious that “equality in law precludes discrimination of any kind; whereas equality in fact\nmay involve the necessity of differential treatment in order to attain a result which establishes an equilibrium\nbetween different situations.”\n39\n   Minority Schools in Albania, Advisory Opinion, PCIJ Series A/B no 64, ICGJ 314 (PCIJ 1935), 6th April\n1935, League of Nations; Permanent Court of International Justice.\n\n                                                                                               Page 46 of 118\n\f                                                                                   PART E\n\n      question involved the abolition of all private schools, a measure challenged\n\n      primarily by the minority. The Court emphasized that the rationale for the\n\n      protection of minorities aimed at preserving their unique attributes. To achieve\n\n      this objective, it deemed two aspects crucial. Firstly, it stressed the\n\n      importance of ensuring that members of minority groups enjoy complete\n\n      equality with other nationals of the state. Secondly, it emphasized the\n\n      necessity of providing minority groups with appropriate means for preserving\n\n      their racial peculiarities, traditions and national characteristics.\n\n\n54. Distinct and diverse languages and religions have inherent value. It is also\n\n      indisputable that cultures are often entangled with language and religion. The\n\n      Constitution recognises that people who practise such religions or speak such\n\n      languages who find themselves in the minority must not be at a disadvantage\n\n      because of their numbers.\n\n\n55. That being said, the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 30</a> is not solely to enable religious\n\n      minorities to impart religious instruction. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 30</a> extends to secular\n\n      education as well. That minorities may wish to impart secular and religious\n\n      instruction side by side may be one aspect of the matter. Another equally\n\n      relevant aspect is that minorities may wish to impart secular education in a\n\n      manner that is conducive to the practice of their religion or harmonious with\n\n      it, even if religious instruction does not form part of the curriculum. In this way,\n\n      the right of linguistic and religious minorities to equality is protected.\n\n\n56.   The nine-Judge Bench in St. Xavier’s (supra) held that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 30(1)</a> is in\n\n      pursuance of the anti-discrimination and substantive equality facets of the\n\n\n                                                                             Page 47 of 118\n\f                                                                                                        PART E\n\n       equality doctrine.40 In TMA Pai (supra), Chief Justice Kirpal writing for the\n\n       majority of the eleven-Judge Bench observed that a law that discriminates\n\n       based on whether the institution is established by a minority or a majority is\n\n       unconstitutional for violation of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 30.</a> The Chief Justice observed that,\n\n       however, the provision should not lead to reverse discrimination.41 This\n\n       observation on a cursory view seems to indicate that the Court has taken a\n\n       volte-face by shifting from a special rights/substantive equality approach of\n\n       the provision to an anti-discrimination/formal equality reading of the provision.\n\n       However, a closer examination reveals that the observations of the majority\n\n       in TMA Pai (supra) were in line with the precedents that viewed the provision\n\n       as a guarantee of a ‘special right’. This is evident from the interpretation of\n\n       the interrelationship between <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 29(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 30.</a> One of the issues\n\n       in that case was whether <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 29(2)</a> which provides that no person shall be\n\n       denied admission in State aided educational institution only on the grounds\n\n       of religion, race, caste, language or any of them is applicable to minority\n\n\n\n40\n   St. Xavier’s (supra) Chief Justice Ray for himself and Justice Palekar [9]; Justice HR Khanna [77]; Justice\nMathew for himself and Justice YV Chandrachud [131-133]\n41\n   “138. As we look at it, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 30(1)</a> is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority\ninstitutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Secularism and\nequality being two of the basic features of the Constitution, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 30(1)</a> ensures protection to the linguistic\nand religious minorities, thereby preserving the secularism of the country. Furthermore, the principles of\nequality must necessarily apply to the enjoyment of such rights. No law can be framed that will discriminate\nagainst such minorities with regard to the establishment and administration of educational institutions vis-à-\nvis other educational institutions. Any law or rule or regulation that would put the educational institutions run\nby the minorities at a disadvantage when compared to the institutions run by the others will have to be struck\ndown. At the same time, there also cannot be any reverse discrimination. It was observed in St. Xavier&#x27;s\nCollege case [(1974) 1 SCC 717 : (1975) 1 SCR 173] at SCR p. 192 that : (SCC p. 743, para 9)\n“The whole object of conferring the right on minorities under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 30</a> is to ensure that there will be equality\nbetween the majority and the minority. If the minorities do not have such special protection they will be denied\nequality.”\nIn other words, the essence of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 30(1)</a> is to ensure equal treatment between the majority and the minority\ninstitutions. No one type or category of institution should be disfavoured or, for that matter, receive more\nfavourable treatment than another. Laws of the land, including rules and regulations, must apply equally to\nthe majority institutions as well as to the minority institutions. The minority institutions must be allowed to do\nwhat the non-minority institutions are permitted to do.”\n\n\n                                                                                                   Page 48 of 118\n\f                                                                                                     PART E\n\n       education institutions. The opinion of the majority held that the denial of\n\n       admission to non-minorities in minority institutions to a “reasonable extent” is\n\n       not violative of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 29(2)</a> since it “preserves the minority character of the\n\n       institution”.42 Thus, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 30</a>, beyond preventing the State from\n\n       discriminating against religious and linguistic minorities who wish to establish\n\n       educational institutions also guarantees a ‘special protection’.\n\n\n              b.     The ‘special protection’ guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 30(1)\n\n\n57.</a>     This purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 30</a> was further expanded in PA Inamdar v. State of\n\n       Maharashtra43, where a seven-Judge Bench observed that the provision is\n\n       better understood as a ‘protection’ and/ or a ‘privilege’ of the minority rather\n\n       than an abstract right.44 What is the special guarantee that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 30</a> provides\n\n       educational institutions established by religious and linguistic minorities which\n\n       is not otherwise available to non-minorities?\n\n\n58. Until the judgment of the eleven-Judge Bench in TMA Pai (supra), the right\n\n       to establish and administer educational institutions was interpreted as a right\n\n       that was exclusively available to religious and linguistic minorities by virtue of\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 30.</a> In TMA Pai (supra), the right of every citizen to establish and\n\n       administer educational institutions was traced to <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 19(1)(g)45</a>, which\n\n       guarantees the freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any\n\n\n\n42\n   TMA Pai (supra) [133]\n43\n   (2005) 6 SCC 537\n44\n   PA Inamdar (supra) [100]; Also see St. Stephen’s (supra) [28,30(1), 59]\n45\n   TMA Pai (supra) [Chief Justice Kirpal 19-20]; Chief Justice Kirpal authoring the majority opinion observed\nthat <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> covers activities of citizens in respect of which income or profit is generated. The learned\nJudge observed that “the establishment and running of an educational institution where a large number of\npersons are employed as teachers or administrative staff, and an activity is carried on that results in the\nimparting of knowledge to the students, must necessarily be regarded as an occupation.” [para 25]\n\n                                                                                                Page 49 of 118\n\f                                                                                                    PART E\n\n       occupation, trade or business. The eleven-Judge Bench also traced the right\n\n       of ‘every’ religious denomination (of both the majority and the minority) to\n\n       establish and administer educational institutions to <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 26(a)</a> which\n\n       guarantees the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and\n\n       ‘charitable’ purposes.

An educational\n\n       institution established and administered by any citizen can be regulated on\n\n       the grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 19(6)</a> which includes the ground of\n\n       professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any\n\n       profession or carrying on any occupation, trade, business.47 An educational\n\n       institution established by a religious denomination (without any element of\n\n       profit48) can be regulated on grounds of public order, morality and health. As\n\n       opposed to these two provisions, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 30</a> does not circumscribe the right on\n\n       any grounds. This Court has, however, consistently emphasised that the right\n\n       guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 30</a> is not absolute.\n\n\n\n\n46\n   TMA Pai (supra) [Chief Justice Kirpal 26]; “26.The right to establish and maintain educational institutions\nmay also be sourced to <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 26(a)</a>, which grants, in positive terms, the right to every religious denomination\nor any section thereof to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, subject to\npublic order, morality and health.

State of Bombay49, a Constitution Bench\n\n      observed that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 30</a> is absolute and cannot be restricted on any grounds\n\n      such as in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 19.</a> However, in the very next sentence this Court observed\n\n      that the right can be restricted on the grounds of efficiency of instruction,\n\n      discipline, health, sanitation, morality and public order.50 It must be noticed\n\n      that these grounds resemble the grounds for restraint prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_178\">Articles\n\n      19(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_179\">26.</a>\n\n\n61. The inconsistency of the observations in Rev. Sidhajbahi (supra) was set\n\n      right in State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial51. The six-Judge\n\n      Bench differentiated between restrictions on the autonomy of a minority\n\n      institution and the standard of education.52 The former is impermissible in\n\n      view of the protection under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 30(1).</a> The latter was traced to the\n\n      regulation of the profession which is covered by <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 19(6).</a> Thus, regulation\n\n      of a minority educational institution is permissible on the grounds in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_182\">Article\n\n      19(6).</a> However, the regulation must not infringe the minority character of the\n\n      educational institution. <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 30(1)</a> is absolute in that sense. Justice\n\n      Khanna’s concurring opinion in St. Xavier’s (supra) also highlighted this\n\n      point. The learned Judge observed that reasonable restrictions can be\n\n      imposed to ensure that a minority educational institution is an institution of\n\n      excellence. The examples given by the Judge included ensuring regular\n\n      payment of salaries and audit of accounts.53 The distinction between\n\n\n\n49\n   1962 (3) SCR 837\n50\n   1962 (3) SCR 837 [849]\n51\n   (1970) 2 SCC 417\n52\n   Ibid [9, 10]\n53\n   St. Xavier’s [91]\n\n                                                                         Page 51 of 118\n\f                                                                                  PART E\n\n      regulation which affects the minority character and a regulation in pursuance\n\n      of ‘national interest’ was also drawn by the opinion of the majority in TMA Pai\n\n      (supra).54 National interest was interpreted to include public safety, national\n\n      security and national integrity, preventing the exploitation of students or the\n\n      teaching community, and application of general laws such as laws on\n\n      taxation, sanitation and social welfare.55 The principle that can be inferred\n\n      from the above precedents is that regulations that may be justified on the\n\n      grounds stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_184\">Articles 19(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_185\">26</a> may fall foul of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_186\">Article 30</a> if they\n\n      infringe the ‘minority character’ of the institution.56 This is the ‘special right’ or\n\n      ‘protection’ which the Constitution guarantees minority education institutions.\n\n\n62. The right to administer was considered in some depth in St. Xavier’s (supra)\n\n      by Chief Justice AN Ray and Justice HR Khanna. Justice Khanna\n\n      emphasised that the right to administer an institution is to effectively manage\n\n      and conduct the affairs of the institution. The learned Judge held that it means\n\n      shaping the institution in congruence with their vision and ideas for best\n\n      serving the interests of both the community and the institution. Chief Justice\n\n      AN Ray, on the other hand, observed that the right to administer has four\n\n      components: (a) the right to choose its managing or governing body; (b) the\n\n      right to choose the teachers; (c) the right not to be compelled to refuse\n\n      admission to students; and (d) the right to use its properties and assets for\n\n      the benefit of its own institutions. The right to administer as guaranteed under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 30(1)</a> ensures autonomy in administration and the right of choice which\n\n\n54\n   TMA Pai (supra) [107]\n55\n   PA Inamdar (supra) [119]; TMA PAI [136]\n56\n   See PA Inamdar (supra)[92,122]\n\n                                                                              Page 52 of 118\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n        may not otherwise be available to a non-minority institution. The right to\n\n        administration, however, does not grant a carte blanche to flout or disregard\n\n        the regulations and controls established by statute, which are essential for\n\n        protecting the larger public interest and maintaining educational standards.\n\n        Thus, the right to administer is not impaired by factors such as rules and\n\n        regulations prescribing the proper utilization of State funds, qualifications of\n\n        the teachers, their remuneration and benefits, eligibility criteria for admission\n\n        of students, attendance requirements and the threshold to pass the exams\n\n        conducted by the board/university to which the college or school is affiliated.\n\n        What is barred is the interference in the internal management and overall\n\n        control of the institution. At the same time, we must clarify that a minority\n\n        institution can employ non-minority employees. Non-minority individuals can\n\n        be teachers or even hold the position of the academic or institution head. To\n\n        hold otherwise, would amount to interference with the choice, as envisaged\n\n        by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n63. This proposition was clearly elucidated by the seven-Judge Bench in PA\n\n        Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra57 which was formed to cull out the ratio\n\n        decidendi of the eleven - Judge Bench in TMA Pai (supra). The degree of\n\n        interference of the State in the administration of an educational institution\n\n        differs based on whether the institution receives aid or recognition from the\n\n        Government or whether the institution was established by a minority. In PA\n\n        Inamdar (supra), this Court discussed the extent of State interference in an\n\n\n\n\n57\n     (2005) 6 SCC 537\n\n                                                                            Page 53 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n      (i) unaided and unrecognised/unaffiliated minority institution; (ii) unaided\n\n      minority institution seeking recognition; and (iii) aided minority institution. In\n\n      the case of the first class, the seven-Judge Bench held that the minority ‘can\n\n      exercise the right to heart’s content’. Institutions that fall within the first class\n\n      could even fill all the seats with students from their community.58 With respect\n\n      to the second class, this Court held that the State cannot interfere in the day\n\n      to day administration, including the essential ingredients of management,\n\n      admission of students, recruiting staff and charging of fees.59 This Court held\n\n      that the regulation must be reasonable and for the purpose of ensuring that\n\n      the institution is effective for the minority and others who resort to it.60 For\n\n      institutions that fall within the third class, the State can only regulate the\n\n      proper utilisation of the grant without diluting the minority status of the\n\n      educational institution.61\n\n\n64. Thus, the position that emerges is that: (i) the regulations must be relevant to\n\n      the purpose of granting recognition (in the case of a State-recognised\n\n      institutions) and aid (in the case of Government aided institutions); and (ii) the\n\n      effect of the regulation must not infringe the minority character of the\n\n      institution.\n\n\n65. From the discussion above, the following principles emerge :\n\n\n      a.     The purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_189\">Article 30(1)</a> is to ensure that the State does not\n\n             discriminate against religious and linguistic minorities which seek to\n\n58\n   PA Inamdar (supra) [120]; TMA Pai (supra) [145]\n59\n   Ibid [121]\n60\n   ibid [122]\n61\n   PA Inamdar [123]; TMA Pai [143]\n\n                                                                             Page 54 of 118\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n           establish   and     administer    educational     institutions   (“the   non-\n\n           discrimination” purpose); and\n\n\n    b.     The purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 30(1)</a> is also to guarantee a ‘special right’ to\n\n           religious and linguistic minorities that have established educational\n\n           institutions. This special right is the guarantee of limited State regulation\n\n           in the administration of the institution. The State must grant the minority\n\n           institution sufficient autonomy to enable it to protect the essentials of its\n\n           minority character. The regulation of the State must be relevant to the\n\n           purpose of granting recognition or aid, as the case may be. This special\n\n           or additional protection is guaranteed to ensure the protection of the\n\n           cultural fabric of religious and linguistic minorities.\n\n\n    iii.   Indicia for a Minority Educational Institution\n\n\n66. To recall, the petitioners while challenging the 1951 and 1965 amendments\n\n    to the AMU Act in Azeez Basha (supra) argued that the amendments were\n\n    violative of the right to administration guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 30(1).</a> The Union\n\n    of India responded to the argument with the submission that the Muslim\n\n    minority cannot claim the right to administration since it did not ‘establish’ the\n\n    institution. Opposing this argument, the petitioners in Azeez Basha (supra)\n\n    submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 30(1)</a> guarantees the ‘right to administer’ an educational\n\n    institution to minorities even if it was not established by them, if by “some\n\n    process, it had been administering the same before the Constitution came\n\n    into force.” The argument of the petitioners was rejected. This Court held that\n\n    the words “establish” and “administer” must be read conjunctively, that is, the\n\n\n                                                                            Page 55 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\nguarantee of the right to administration is contingent on the establishment of\n\nthe institution by religious or linguistic minorities. In this context, the following\n\nobservations were made:\n\n\n                 “It is to our mind quite clear that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_193\">Art. 30(1)</a> postulates\n                 that the religious community will have the right to\n                 establish and administer educational institutions of\n                 their choice meaning thereby that where a religious\n                 minority establishes an educational institution, it will\n                 have the right to administer that. An argument has\n                 been raised to the effect that even though the\n                 religious minority may not have established the\n                 educational institution, it will have the right to\n                 administer it, if by some process it had been\n                 administering the same before the Constitution\n                 came into force. We are not pre-pared to accept this\n                 argument. The Article in our opinion clearly shows\n                 that the minority will have the right to administer\n                 educational institutions of their choice provided they\n                 have established them, but not otherwise. The\n                 Article cannot be read to mean that even if the\n                 educational institution has been established by\n                 somebody else, any religious minority would have\n                 the right to administer it because, for some reason\n                 or other, it might have been administering it before\n                 the Constitution came into force. The words\n                 &quot;establish and administer&quot; in the Article must be\n                 read conjunctively and so read it gives the right\n                 to the minority to administer an educational\n                 institution provided it has been established by it.\n\n\n                 …\n\n\n                 We are of opinion that nothing in that case justifies\n                 the contention raised on behalf of the petitioners that\n                 the minorities would have the right to administer an\n                 educational institution even though the institution\n                 may not have been established by them. The two\n                 words in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_194\">Art. 30(1)</a> must be read together and so\n                 read the Article gives the right to the minority to\n                 administer institutions established by it.”\n\n\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Page 56 of 118\n\f                                                                                                PART E\n\n         The Constitution Bench in St. Stephen’s (supra) reiterated this\n\n         interpretation of the phrases ‘establish’ and ‘administer’ in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 30(1)</a>.62\n\n\n67. Let us refer to <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> to understand what it means to conjunctively\n\n      read two words in a provision. <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 19</a> guarantees the fundamental right to\n\n      free speech and expression. The guarantee of the freedom of expression is,\n\n      however, not dependent on the freedom of speech. They are two separate\n\n      rights. However, the situation differs with regard to the rights to establish and\n\n      administer outlined in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 30.</a> It is settled that the rights to establish and\n\n      administer must be read conjunctively and not disjunctively. This Court has\n\n      not doubted this interpretation in any of the judgments subsequent to Azeez\n\n      Basha (supra).63\n\n\n68.    The question is whether the conjunctive reading of the words “establish” and\n\n      “administer” would also mean that for an educational institution to be a\n\n      minority institution, it should have been both established and administered by\n\n      a minority. In Azeez Basha (supra), the Constitution Bench held that the\n\n      institution must be both established and administered by the minority. The\n\n      Constitution Bench framed the following three questions to determine if AMU\n\n      was a minority educational institution:\n\n\n\n\n62\n   St Stephen’s [28] “It should be borne in mind that the words “establish” and “administer” used in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_199\">Article\n30(1)</a> are to be read conjunctively. The right claimed by a minority community to administer the educational\ninstitution depends upon the proof of establishment of the institution. The proof of establishment of the\ninstitution, is thus a condition precedent for claiming the right to administer the institute.”\n63\n   Manager, St. Thomas UP School v. Commr. &amp; Secy, to general Education Dept., (2002) 2 SCC 497; St.\nStephen’s (supra); DAV College trust &amp; Management Society v. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 4 SCC 14; SP\nMittal v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 51\n\n                                                                                           Page 57 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n      a.   Whether on the reading of the AMU Act, the University was established\n\n           by the Muslim minority;\n\n\n      b.   Whether the right to administer the University ever vested in the minority;\n\n           and\n\n\n      c.   If (b) is affirmative, whether the right to administer the University was\n\n           surrendered when AMU was established.\n\n\n69.   The issue before this Bench is the indicia for an educational institution to be\n\n      a minority educational institution. Should it be proved that the institution was\n\n      established by the minority, or it was administered by the minority, or both?\n\n      The petitioners and the respondents agree that the words ‘establish’ and\n\n      ‘administer’ must be read conjunctively. They argue that administration is a\n\n      sequitur to establishment. However, they disagree on the test to be applied\n\n      to identify a minority education institution. The petitioners argue that the only\n\n      indicia for a minority educational institution is that it must be established by a\n\n      minority, while the respondents argue that the dual test of establishment and\n\n      administration must be satisfied.\n\n\n70. Before proceeding further, it is relevant to note the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_200\">NCMEI\n\n      Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_201\">The NCMEI Act</a> was enacted in 2004 to constitute a National Commission\n\n      for minority educational institutions and to provide for matters connected or\n\n      incidental to it. <a href=\"/doc/143777/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 10</a> of the NCMEI Act was amended in 2006. The\n\n      amended provision prescribed a procedure for the establishment of a minority\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          Page 58 of 118\n\f                                                                                                     PART E\n\n       educational institution.64 Thus, there can be no ambiguity about the minority\n\n       status of educational institutions established after the enactment of NCMEI\n\n       (Amendment) Act 2006. However, that is not the case for institutions which\n\n       were established before the 2006 Amendment. How do we identify if an\n\n       educational institution established before 2006 is a minority educational\n\n       institution?\n\n\n71. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 30</a> does not prescribe conditions which must be fulfilled for an\n\n       educational institution to be considered a minority educational institution.\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 30</a> confers two group rights on all linguistic and religious minorities: the\n\n       right to establish an educational institution and the right to administer an\n\n       educational institution. This right can be exercised by an individual belonging\n\n       to a group or a collection of persons.65 As observed above, the provision\n\n       guarantees both a positive and negative right. Thus, the provision, in addition\n\n       to ensuring that the State does not discriminate against the minority\n\n       community also guarantees the minority educational institution certain\n\n\n\n64\n   “10. Right to establish a Minority Educational Institution.- (1) Any person who desires to establish a Minority\nEducational Institution may apply to the Competent authority for the grant of the no objection certificate for\nthe said purpose.\n(2) The Competent authority shall, -\n(a) on perusal of documents, affidavits or other evidence, if any;\n(b) after gving an opportunity of being heard to the applicant, decide every application filed under sub-section\n(1) as expeditiously as possible and grant or reject the application, as the case may be:\nProvided that where an application is rejected, the Competent authority shall communicate the same to the\napplicant.\n(3) Where within a period of ninety days from the receipt of the application under sub-section (1) for the grant\nof no objection certificate,-\n(a) the Competent authority does not grant such certificates; or\n(b) where an application has been rejected and the same has not been communicated to the person who\nhas applied for the grant of such certificate,\nIt shall be deemed that the Competent authority has granted a no objection certificate to the applicant.\n(4) The applicant shall, on the grant of a no objection certificate or where the Competent authority has\ndeemed to have granted the no objection certificate, be entitled to commence and proceed with the\nestablishment of a Minority Educational Institution in accordance with the rules and regulaitons, as the case\nmay be, laid down by or under any law for the time being in force.\n65\n   Mother Provincial (supra)\n\n                                                                                                Page 59 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n     guarantees. The institution is guaranteed the right of lesser State regulation\n\n     and greater autonomy in the administration of the educational institution. The\n\n     right to establish an educational institution guaranteed to the minority is not a\n\n     special right. That, as held in TMA Pai (supra) (as explained in the preceding\n\n     section), is a right which is available to every citizen under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and\n\n     to minority and non-minority religious denominations under <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_206\">Article 26.</a> The\n\n     special right that the provision guarantees to religious and linguistic minorities\n\n     relates to the administration of educational institutions “of their choice”. The\n\n     expression “of their choice” is of an expansive nature indicating that the\n\n     choice extends to the full range of educational institutions.\n\n\n72. <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot extend to a situation where the minority community which\n\n     establishes an educational institution has no intention to administer it. A\n\n     religious or linguistic community may establish an educational institution\n\n     and yet not administer it. This is evident from <a href=\"/doc/1747067/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 28(2)</a> of the\n\n     Constitution which states that <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 28(1)</a> will not apply to an educational\n\n     institution which is administered by the State but was established under an\n\n     endowment or a trust which require religious instruction to be imparted. It\n\n     is quite possible that a member or a group belonging to the minority\n\n     community wishes to establish an institution but intends to accept greater\n\n     State regulation and lesser autonomy for the community. In that case, putting\n\n     a ‘minority’ tag on such an educational institution merely because it has been\n\n     established by a person or a group belonging to a religious or linguistic\n\n     minority would not be permissible under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 30(1).</a> An educational\n\n     institution established by a minority, whether linguistic or religious, can give\n\n                                                                          Page 60 of 118\n\f                                                                                              PART E\n\n         up their right to claim the benefit under clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 30.</a> The right can\n\n         be given up consciously by waiver. This may occur where administration has\n\n         been consciously and willingly entrusted to the State. Therefore, to determine\n\n         whether an educational institution is a minority educational institution, a\n\n         formalistic test such as to whether it was established by a person or group\n\n         belonging to a religious or linguistic minority is not sufficient. The tests\n\n         adopted must elucidate the purpose and intent of establishing an educational\n\n         institution for the minority. Both the establishment and the administration by\n\n         the minority must be fulfilled cumulatively for that.66\n\n\n73. In Azeez Basha (supra), the Constitution Bench referred to the judgment in\n\n         The Durgah Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali67, for the proposition\n\n         that even if a minority established an educational institution, it may lose the\n\n         concomitant right of administration in certain circumstances. The relevant\n\n         observations are extracted below:\n\n\n                       “We should also like to refer to the observations in The Durgah\n                       Committee, Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali. In that case this Court\n                       observed while dealing with <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_212\">Art. 26(a)</a> and (d) of the\n                       Constitution that even if it be assumed that a certain religious\n                       institution was established by a minority community it may\n                       lose the right to administer it in certain circumstances. We\n                       may in this connection refer to the following observations at p.\n                       414 for they apply equally to <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_213\">Art. 30(1):</a>\n\n\n                              “If the right to administer the properties never\n                              vested in the denomination or had been validly\n                              surrendered by it or had otherwise been\n                              effectively and irretrievably lost to it, <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_214\">Art. 26</a>\n                              cannot be successfully invoked.”\n\n\n\n\n66\n     See Section E(v) of this judgment for an expansive elucidation of the indicia.\n67\n     (1962) 1 S.C.P 383\n\n                                                                                          Page 61 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n74. In Azeez Basha (supra), in addition to determining if AMU was established\n\n         by a Muslim minority, this Court also determined whether it was ever\n\n         administered by them or if the administration was validly surrendered by them,\n\n         on the basis of the above observations.\n\n\n75. The context of the above observations in Durgah Committee (supra) and its\n\n         application to the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 30(1)</a> needs to be clarified. In that\n\n         case, the constitutional validity of the Durgah Khwaja Saheb Act 195568 was\n\n         challenged by the Khadims of the tomb for violation of <a href=\"/doc/547354/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 26(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_217\">Article\n\n         26(d)</a> of the Constitution. To offer a brief background, Khwaja Saheb was a\n\n         saint who came to India at the end of the 12th Century AD and settled in Ajmer.\n\n         A tomb in the form of a kutcha structure was built immediately after his death.\n\n         However, there were no endowments at this time. Akbar, the Mughal\n\n         emperor, took interest in the tomb and rebuilt it. Documents also indicate that\n\n         eighteen villages were endowed to the Durgah. During this period, a\n\n         descendant of the Saint functioned as the Sajhadanashin and Mutawalli.\n\n         During the rule of Shahjahan, the office of Sajhadanashin and Mutawalli were\n\n         separated. The Mutawalli was solely made responsible for the management\n\n         of the properties of the Durgah and was appointed by the Ruler. Over the\n\n         years, this model was not altered. The Mutawalli was always appointed by the\n\n         Government in power.\n\n\n76. Section 4(1) of the Durgah Act dealt with the appointment of a Committee in\n\n         which the administration, control and management of the Durgah Endowment\n\n\n\n68\n     “Durgah Act”\n\n                                                                             Page 62 of 118\n\f                                                                                        PART E\n\n    would vest. The members of the Committee would be appointed by the\n\n    Central Government. These two provisions were challenged on the ground\n\n    they were ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/547354/\" id=\"a_218\">Article 26(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 26(d).</a>                   In this context, the\n\n    Constitution Bench observed that the denomination will not have a right to\n\n    administer the property if it never had the right to administer it; if it had been\n\n    surrendered; or if it had been irretrievably lost:\n\n\n                       “37. […] In other words, if the denomination\n                       never had the right to manage the properties\n                       endowed in favour of a denominational\n                       institution as for instance by reason of the\n                       terms on which the endowment was created,\n                       it cannot be heard to say that it has acquired\n                       the said rights as a result of <a href=\"/doc/547354/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 26(c)</a> and\n                       (d)…If the right to administer the properties\n                       never vested in the denomination or had been\n                       validly surrendered by it or has otherwise been\n                       effectively and irretrievably lost to it <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 26</a>\n                       cannot be successfully invoked. […]”\n\n\n77. On the facts of the case, the Constitution Bench observed that the\n\n    endowments were made on such terms that did not confer the right to manage\n\n    the properties to the denomination. This Court held that the right to administer\n\n    the property could not be claimed if the terms of the endowment did not confer\n\n    administration to the denomination.\n\n\n78. Azeez Basha (supra) relied on the decision of the Constitution Bench in\n\n    Durgah Committee (supra) which dealt with clauses (c) and (d) of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 26</a>\n\n    which guarantee the right of any religious denomination to own property and\n\n    administer such property. They were not made in the context of <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 26(a)</a>\n\n    by which the right to establish and maintain institutions is conferred on\n\n    religious denominations.\n\n\n                                                                                    Page 63 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n79. A parallel could have been drawn between the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/272397/\" id=\"a_224\">Article\n\n        26(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 30(1)</a>, which is what this Court in Azeez Basha (supra)\n\n        attempted to do. However, a parallel cannot be drawn between clauses (c)\n\n        and (d) of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 26</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 30(1).</a> The rights differ in nature and scope.\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1838869/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 26(d)</a> guarantees the right to administer property in ‘accordance with\n\n        law’. The provision does not confer any special right to administration as in\n\n        the case of minority educational institutions.\n\n\n        iv.   Applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_229\">Article 30</a> to a ‘University’ established before the\n\n              commencement of the Constitution\n\n\n80. Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, senior counsel appearing for the respondents made two\n\n        submissions on the application of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 30</a> to educational institutions which\n\n        were established before the commencement of the Constitution. First, he\n\n        urged that the claimant must prove that they were a linguistic or religious\n\n        minority when the institution was established and not when the Constitution\n\n        commenced; and second, before the Constitution was adopted, Universities\n\n        (unlike schools and colleges which could be established by persons) could\n\n        only be established by the Imperial Government. Thus, Universities which\n\n        could not have been established by persons before the Constitution was\n\n        adopted cannot, according to the submission, claim a right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 30.</a>\n\n        The observations in re Kerala Education Bill69, Rev. Bishop SK Patro v.\n\n        State of Bihar70 and St. Stephen’s (supra) that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 30(1)</a> applies to\n\n        educational institutions which were established before the Constitution was\n\n\n69\n     1958 SCR 995\n70\n     (1969) 1 SCC 863\n\n                                                                           Page 64 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n      adopted were distinguished on the ground that those cases dealt with\n\n      colleges and schools, and not Universities. The learned Attorney General also\n\n      made a similar argument. He submitted that in the absence of a legal\n\n      competence to establish a given class of institutions (that is, universities), the\n\n      question of availing of all attendant rights and claims in relation to <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 30</a>\n\n      cannot arise. In the subsequent sections, we will answer the following two\n\n      questions:\n\n\n      a.   Whether ‘universities’ established before the commencement of the\n\n           Constitution are excluded from the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 30(1);</a> and\n\n\n      b.   Whether those who established an educational institution have to prove\n\n           that they were a minority at the time of establishment.\n\n\n           a.    <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_235\">Article 30(1)</a> applies to educational institutions established before\n\n                 the commencement of the Constitution\n\n\n81.   In re the Kerala Education Bill 1957 (supra), a seven-Judge Bench of this\n\n      Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_236\">Article 30</a> applies to educational institutions which predate the\n\n      Constitution. This Court held that the right to administer guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_237\">Article\n\n      30(1)</a> is wide enough to cover educational institutions established both before\n\n      and after the Constitution was adopted:\n\n\n                         “22. … There is no reason why the benefit of\n                         <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 30(1)</a> should be limited only to\n                         educational institutions established after the\n                         commencement of the Constitution. The\n                         language employed in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 30(1)</a> is wide\n                         enough to cover both pre-Constitution and\n                         post-Constitution institutions. It must not be\n                         overlooked that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 30(1)</a> gives the\n\n\n                                                                          Page 65 of 118\n\f                                                                                     PART E\n\n                              minorities two rights, namely, (a) to establish,\n                              and (b) to administer, educational institutions\n                              of their choice. The second right clearly covers\n                              pre-Constitution schools just as <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 26</a>\n                              covers the right to maintain pre-Constitution\n                              religious institutions. …”\n\n\n82. Although the opinion in that case was rendered in exercise of the advisory\n\n      jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/210155/\" id=\"a_242\">Article 143</a>, it has immense persuasive value.71\n\n      The judgment in In re Kerala Education Bill (supra) has held the field for\n\n      many decades. Subsequent decisions of this Court have also relied on it. The\n\n      decision in Azeez Basha (supra) observed that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 30</a> would be “robbed\n\n      of much of its content” if it were held to apply only to educational institutions\n\n      established after the commencement of the Constitution.72 The Constitution\n\n      Bench in SK Patro (supra) also held the same. In that case, an educational\n\n      institution which was established in 1854 received the protection of the rights\n\n      guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_244\">Article 30(1)</a>.73 In St. Stephen’s (supra), a Constitution Bench\n\n      held that St. Stephen’s College which was established in 1881 is a minority\n\n      educational institution for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n83.    A distinction between educational institutions established before and after\n\n      the commencement of the Constitution cannot be made for the purposes of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 30(1).</a> <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_247\">Article 30</a> will stand diluted and weakened if it is to only apply\n\n      prospectively to institutions established after the commencement of the\n\n      Constitution.

The adoption of\n\n         the Constitution reflects a break from the system of sovereign and potentate\n\n         government under the colonial regime and the dawn of governance based on\n\n         the rule of law. It secures to the minority educational institutions, rights under\n\n         the Constitution from the date of its commencement.\n\n\n84. The Constitution annihilates the vestiges of colonial rule as reflected in <a href=\"/doc/493040/\" id=\"a_248\">Article\n\n         395.</a> <a href=\"/doc/493040/\" id=\"a_249\">Article 395</a> repeals the two enactments that established the system of\n\n         governance in pre-independent India: the Indian Independence Act 1947 and\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_250\">Government of India Act</a> 1935. <a href=\"/doc/493040/\" id=\"a_251\">Article 395</a> repudiates the chain of\n\n         colonial continuity and symbolises constitutional autochthony by repealing\n\n         the Indian Independence Act 1947. At the same time, <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 372</a>\n\n         represents the thread of continuity even when a new system of governance\n\n         is put in place. <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 372</a> stipulates that all laws which were in force in the\n\n         territory of India before the commencement of the Constitution will continue\n\n         in force. However, the only caveat was that the laws must not be inconsistent\n\n         with the provisions of the Constitution. Laws that are violative of the provisions\n\n         of Part III would be void to the extent of the inconsistency.74 It is crucial to\n\n         note that <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 13(1)</a> renders the laws to the extent of contravention void and\n\n         not void ab initio. Thus, the Constitution does not fully overhaul the system of\n\n         governance and administration. Rather, it only ensures that the governance\n\n         is in accordance with the rules prescribed in the Constitution. To put it in legal\n\n         terms, <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 13(1)</a> has a retroactive effect and not a retrospective effect.

It is retroactive if it imposes new results for\n\n        previous actions.75 Upon the commencement of the Constitution, citizens\n\n        received the protective cover of Part III. <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_257\">Article 372</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_258\">Article 13(1)</a>\n\n        stipulates that laws which pre-date the Constitution are unconstitutional if they\n\n        contravene the fundamental rights.76 The provisions do not stipulate that laws\n\n        which pre-date the Constitution cannot receive the additional protection which\n\n        the fundamental rights offer. The right to administration in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 30(1)</a> is one\n\n        such protection.\n\n\n85. What is the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_260\">Article 30</a> when read in the context of <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_261\">Article 372</a> read\n\n        with <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_262\">Article 13?</a> Any law enacted by the Imperial Legislature which\n\n        discriminates against linguistic and religious minorities in the establishment\n\n        and administration of educational institution would be void.

But, this Court has also interpreted the Article as a ‘special\n\n        rights’ provision guaranteeing additional protection to educational institutions\n\n        established by minorities. Thus, educational institutions established by\n\n        religious and linguistic minorities before the commencement of the\n\n        Constitution will also receive the special protection guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_266\">Article\n\n        30(1):</a> the right to administration without the infringement of their minority\n\n        character.\n\n\n\n\n75\n     SEBI v.

If the argument as propounded is accepted, we will have two sets of minority\n\n        educational institutions, one established before the commencement of the\n\n        Constitution which is deprived of the guarantee given under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 30(1)</a>, and\n\n        those established after the commencement of the Constitution which are\n\n        entitled to the benefit and guarantee given under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 30(1).</a> We do not\n\n        think the Constitution envisages such incongruous and unpalatable\n\n        differences in rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n              b.      There is no difference between ‘Universities’ and ‘colleges’\n\n                      established before the commencement of the Constitution\n\n\n87.      The next argument which needs to be addressed is whether ‘universities’\n\n        established before the commencement of the Constitution could receive the\n\n        protection of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 30(1).</a> To recall, the petitioners argued that prior to the\n\n        commencement of the Constitution, the law did not confer the power to\n\n        establish a university on a person. It was argued that the power only vested\n\n        in the Imperial Legislature and thus, no person could have “established” a\n\n        university.\n\n\n88.      The educational policy in pre-independent India must be referred to provide\n\n        a brief context on the distinction between universities and colleges. One of\n\n        the distinctions between a college and a university is the ability of the latter to\n\n        confer degrees to students as evidence of their proficiency in subjects which\n\n        they have studied and for which they are assessed. On 19 July 1854, the\n\n        Court of Directors of the East India Company submitted a despatch77 to the\n\n\n77\n     “Woods Despatch”\n\n                                                                             Page 69 of 118\n\f                                                                                            PART E\n\n      Governor-General of India in Council on the subject of General Education in\n\n      India. The despatch recommended the incorporation of Universities by Acts\n\n      of the Legislative Council of India. The first University established in India\n\n      was the University of Calcutta. It was established by Act No. II of 1857, passed\n\n      by the Legislative Council of India. The preamble to the enactment provides\n\n      that the University at Calcutta was to be established for the purpose of\n\n      awarding academic degrees to persons who have acquired proficiency in\n\n      subjects. Subsequently, the Legislative Council of India enacted Act No. XXII\n\n      of 1857 to establish and incorporate the University at Bombay for the same\n\n      purpose. In 1857, the University at Madras was established.78 In 1860, an Act\n\n      was passed to give the Universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay, the\n\n      power of conferring degrees in addition to those degrees provided for in the\n\n      earlier enactments. The Legislative Council of India passed sixteen other\n\n      enactments79 for the establishment of universities before the commencement\n\n      of the Constitution.\n\n\n89. <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_271\">The University Grants Commission Act</a> 195680 was enacted a few years after\n\n      the commencement of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_272\">The UGC Act</a> provides the power to\n\n      confer degrees even to institutions which are not established by an\n\n      enactment. <a href=\"/doc/385758/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 2(f)</a> defines a University as educational institutions\n\n      established or incorporated by or under a Central Act, a <a href=\"/doc/393016/\" id=\"a_274\">Provincial Act</a> or a\n\n\n78\n   Act No. XXVII of 1987\n79\n   The Punjab University Act 1992, the <a href=\"/doc/643474/\" id=\"a_275\">Allahabad University Act</a> 1887, The Mysore University <a href=\"/doc/51110245/\" id=\"a_276\">Regulation\n1916</a>, The Patna University Act 1917, The Firman of Osmania University 1918, The Lucknow University Act\n1920, <a href=\"/doc/65439626/\" id=\"a_277\">The Delhi University Act</a> 1922, The Nagpur University Act 1923, The Agra University Act 1926, <a href=\"/doc/37829543/\" id=\"a_278\">The\nAnnamalai University Act</a> 1926, University of Tranvancore Promulgation Act 1937, <a href=\"/doc/120192346/\" id=\"a_279\">The Utkal University Act</a>\n1943, <a href=\"/doc/128535908/\" id=\"a_280\">The Gauhati University Act</a> 1947, <a href=\"/doc/198116466/\" id=\"a_281\">The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda Act</a> 1949, <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_282\">The Gujarat\nUniversity Act</a> 1949; <a href=\"/doc/17541/\" id=\"a_283\">The Visva-Bharati Act</a> 1951; <a href=\"/doc/44669054/\" id=\"a_284\">The Jadavpur University Act</a> 1955.\n80\n   “<a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_285\">UGC Act</a>”\n\n                                                                                        Page 70 of 118\n\f                                                                                          PART E\n\n      State Act, and includes any such institution as may, in consultation with the\n\n      University concerned, be recognized by the Commission in accordance with\n\n      the regulations made in that behalf under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1055795/\" id=\"a_286\">Section 3</a> states that the\n\n      Central Government may, on the advice of the UGC, declare by notification\n\n      that any institution for higher education shall be deemed to be a University for\n\n      the purposes of the Act. All the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_287\">UGC Act</a> would apply to\n\n      deemed-to-be-Universities just as they apply to universities.81 <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_288\">Under the UGC\n\n      Act</a>, an institution (which is not a university or deemed-to-be university) can\n\n      be specially empowered by an Act of Parliament to confer degrees.82\n\n\n90. Two facets emerge from the above discussion. First, only Universities can\n\n      confer degrees83; and second, before the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_289\">UGC Act</a>, the\n\n      University had to necessarily be incorporated by a legislation for the degrees\n\n      conferred by them to be recognised. Thus, the argument of the petitioners\n\n      narrows down to one aspect. According to the submission, a member or\n\n      community belonging to a minority despite making efforts through\n\n      representation, mobilisation and participation to establish a University cannot\n\n      be regarded to have ‘established’ a Minority educational institution for the\n\n      purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 30(1)</a> only because the University was incorporated through\n\n      a legislation.

The Wood despatch noted that the purpose of universities upon their\n\n      establishment was to confer academic degrees on students as evidence of\n\n      attainment of proficiency in the branch of study.84 Universities were instituted,\n\n      “not so much to be in themselves places of instruction, as to test the value of\n\n      the education obtained elsewhere”.85 Affiliated colleges and other institutions\n\n      educated students and sent them to universities where their proficiency was\n\n      to be tested.86 This limited role of Indian Universities upon their establishment\n\n      was recognised in the statutory enactments which incorporated the first three\n\n      Universities in India. The preamble to Act No. II of 1857 which established\n\n      and incorporated the University at <a href=\"/doc/82166439/\" id=\"a_295\">Calcutta, Act</a> XXII of 1857 which\n\n      established and incorporated the University at <a href=\"/doc/8438375/\" id=\"a_296\">Bombay, and Act</a> XXVII of\n\n      1857 which established and incorporated the University at Madras stipulated\n\n      that the Universities were established to ascertain (through an examination)\n\n      those persons who had acquired proficiency in different branches. This was\n\n      the only power conferred upon Universities.87 The enactments also provided\n\n      that only candidates who were authorised through a certificate from one of\n\n      the institutions authorized by them shall be a candidate for the degree.88\n\n      However, the University at Punjab incorporated in 1882 had greater scope. In\n\n      1869, an institution styled the Lahore University College (and the Punjab\n\n      University College later) was established in pursuance of the wishes of the\n\n      Chiefs, Nobles and influential classes of Punjab.

On 12 January 1902, the Government of India issued a resolution to appoint\n\n       a commission to “inquire into the condition and prospects of the Universities\n\n       established in British India; to consider and report upon any proposals […] for\n\n       improving their constitution and working […]”. The Report of the Commission\n\n       discussed the necessity of establishing teaching Universities, where better\n\n       provision for advanced courses of study could be made.89 In 1904, Act No.\n\n       VIII of 1904 was enacted to amend the law relating to the Universities at\n\n       Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Allahabad. <a href=\"/doc/1221603/\" id=\"a_298\">Section 3</a> of the Act provided that\n\n       the University shall have the power to make provision for, inter alia, the\n\n       instruction of students and the power to appoint University professors and\n\n       Lecturers. Universities that were incorporated subsequent to Act No. VIII of\n\n       1904 had the power to instruct students in addition to conducting\n\n       examinations to confer degrees.90 However, teaching universities also had to\n\n       be incorporated through a legislative enactment because they would have the\n\n       power to confer degrees recognised by the Government.\n\n\n93. It is in this background that we should decide if Universities established before\n\n       the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_299\">UGC Act</a> could be covered by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_300\">Article 30(1).</a> It is true that\n\n       the intervention of the imperial legislature was necessary to incorporate a\n\n\n89\n   Report of the Indian Universities Commission 1902 [24, 25]\n90\n   See Section 4 of Osmania University Act, preamble and Section 4(1) of the Lucknow University Act 1920;\npreamble to the <a href=\"/doc/65439626/\" id=\"a_301\">Delhi University Act</a> 1922 which states that it established and incorporates a teaching and\naffiliating University; <a href=\"/doc/86877692/\" id=\"a_302\">Section 4(1)</a> of the Delhi University Act 1922; Section 4(1) of the Nagpur University Act\n1923\n\n                                                                                               Page 73 of 118\n\f                                                                                             PART E\n\n      university before the commencement of the Constitution.

The intervention of the\n\n      legislative body was required to ‘incorporate’ universities because the\n\n      degrees conferred by them would be recognised by the Government. This\n\n      was required even for the incorporation of teaching universities. However,\n\n      could it be argued that no person had the power to ‘establish’ a university\n\n      merely because the intervention of the legislative body was required for the\n\n      incorporation of the institution? Could it be argued that a university was\n\n      ‘established’ by the legislature merely because it enacted a legislation\n\n      incorporating it?\n\n\n94.    The     words       ‘incorporation’      and      ‘establishment’       cannot      be     used\n\n      interchangeably. They connote different meanings. ‘Incorporation’ signifies\n\n      the legal existence of the institution.92 In contrast, ‘establishment’ signifies the\n\n      founding or bringing into existence of the institution.93 The possibility of\n\n      distinguishing the establishment and incorporation of universities arose with\n\n      the advent of teaching Universities. Two kinds of institutions were\n\n      incorporated as teaching universities. They consisted of institutions which\n\n      were established and incorporated at the same time, and institutions in which\n\n      the establishment of the institution predated its incorporation. Universities in\n\n      the latter category, however, were teaching colleges converted into teaching\n\n\n\n91\n   See Entry 11 of List II to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution prior to Constitution<a href=\"/doc/50073852/\" id=\"a_304\">(Forty-second\nAmendment) Act</a> 1976\n92\n   Oxford Dictionary defines the word ‘incorporated’ as formed into business company with legal status\n93\n   Oxford Dictionary defines establish as ‘to start or create an organization, a system.’\n\n                                                                                         Page 74 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n         universities. The University at Punjab is one such example. The Annamalai\n\n         University would also fall in this category. In the case of Annamalai University,\n\n         the Hon’ble Diwan Bahadur Sir S.R.M Annamalai Chettiyar had established\n\n         and was maintaining colleges around Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu. The\n\n         college was converted to a University through the enactment of <a href=\"/doc/37829543/\" id=\"a_305\">Annamalai\n\n         University Act</a> 1928.94 The ‘establishment’ and ‘incorporation’ of these\n\n         universities was distinct. The incorporation of the University was necessary\n\n         to confer degrees recognised by the Government. However, there was an\n\n         institution that pre-dated the incorporation of the University that continued to\n\n         exist even after the incorporation. Thus, the instance of conversion of\n\n         teaching collages to teaching universities elucidates the distinction between\n\n         the “establishment” and “incorporation” of educational institutions.\n\n\n95. The word ‘establish’ as used in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_306\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot and should not be\n\n         understood in a narrow and legalistic sense. The words used in clause (1) of\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_307\">Article 30</a> have to be interpreted in view of the object and purpose of the\n\n         article, and the guarantee and protection it confers. The guarantee and\n\n         protection are not dependent on the basis or the manner in which the legal\n\n         requirements were/are complied with, rather it concerns the persons who\n\n         have founded and created the establishment. The incorporation by a statute\n\n         or the procedure and requirements in law are not determinative factors. The\n\n         persons behind it, that is, the promoters and founder(s) are important. They\n\n         should belong to a linguistic or a religious minority. There will always be\n\n\n\n\n94\n     See the preamble of the <a href=\"/doc/37829543/\" id=\"a_308\">Annamalai University Act</a> 1928\n\n                                                                             Page 75 of 118\n\f                                                                            PART E\n\n    individuals and groups instrumental in catalysing and setting up the institution.\n\n    Thus, giving a legal character to an educational institution through state or\n\n    sovereign action, it does not ipso facto follow that the university so established\n\n    deprives the group of persons/individuals the guarantee under clause (1) of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution. Universities are as much educational institutions\n\n    as schools and colleges. The interpretation in Azeez Basha (supra) confers\n\n    a legalistic meaning to the word ‘established’, sans the context of clause (1)\n\n    of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 30.</a> No distinction exists between universities and other educational\n\n    institutions such as schools and colleges for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_311\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n96. The following conclusions emerge from the discussion above:\n\n\n    a.   The teaching universities and colleges serve the common function of\n\n         educating students. No distinction between the two can be drawn for the\n\n         purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_312\">Article 30(1)</a> which guarantees minorities the right of greater\n\n         autonomy in the administration of educational institutions to curate a\n\n         model of education which best serves the interests of the community;\n\n         and\n\n\n    b.   The submission that a person did not have the power to ‘establish’ a\n\n         university before the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_313\">UGC Act</a> is rejected. The words\n\n         establishment and incorporation cannot be interchangeably used. They\n\n         connote different meanings. The former refers to founding an institution,\n\n         which in the case of teaching colleges that were converted to universities\n\n         would refer to any person or community who undertook the efforts the\n\n         establish the teaching college.\n\n\n                                                                        Page 76 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n           c.   The minority character of the institution is not ipso facto\n\n                surrendered upon the incorporation of the University\n\n\n97.   The Solicitor General argued that Azeez Basha (supra) — correctly\n\n      understood — holds that the Muslim minority surrendered its rights as a\n\n      denominational institution before the Constitution was adopted by\n\n      approaching the imperial legislature to recognise the degrees. He argued that\n\n      the decision tacitly recognised the fact that two broad groups existed during\n\n      the freedom struggle. The first of these groups was determined to conduct\n\n      their affairs without assistance from or reference to the imperial legislature. It\n\n      set up institutions which granted degrees which were not recognised by the\n\n      imperial government. They did not seek recognition of the degrees granted\n\n      by their institutions at that time. Instead, such institutions (and the degrees\n\n      granted by them) were recognised post-independence. Examples of such\n\n      universities include Shantiniketan; the predecessor of IIT Roorkee. In\n\n      contrast, the second group chose to collaborate with the imperial government\n\n      and sought recognition of the degrees awarded by its universities. Having\n\n      approached the imperial government for such recognition, the second group\n\n      surrendered their denominational status (comparable to minority status under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_314\">Article 30</a>). It was submitted that the founders of AMU formed a part of the\n\n      second group. While MAO College may have been of a denominational\n\n      character, it has been urged that the incorporation of the institute as AMU\n\n      resulted in the surrender of rights. Since we are only dealing with the\n\n      principles of law, we will address this argument without referring to the factual\n\n      aspects submitted by the learned Solicitor General. In short, the argument is\n\n                                                                          Page 77 of 118\n\f                                                                                                    PART E\n\n       that the minority character of an educational institution is surrendered upon\n\n       the incorporation of the institution.\n\n\n98. The minority character of institutions cannot be rejected if they were conferred\n\n       a legal character by a statute enacted prior to 1950. The enactment was\n\n       necessary to award degrees recognized by the British government, allowing\n\n       graduates to gain degree recognition and secure employment. The\n\n       enactment of the statute is a ministerial and a legislative act, which confers\n\n       juristic personality as well as legal rights in terms of the law in force. The\n\n       statute grants the power to the educational institution to confer the degrees.\n\n       The incorporation by way of statute is a legal requirement. That being the\n\n       case, we will not accept the argument that compliance with legal requirement\n\n       would tantamount to the ‘establishment’ of an institution by the Legislature,\n\n       and thereby the linguistic and religious minority forgo the guarantees and\n\n       protection under clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_315\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n99. In the same vein, the state may also provide for the mode by which\n\n       educational institutions may be set up or established. For instance, it may\n\n       require that a society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_316\">Societies Registration Act</a> or a\n\n       public trust constituted in accordance with law is a pre-requisite to\n\n       establishing a school.95 The state may also issue a certificate of recognition\n\n\n95\n   See, for instance, <a href=\"/doc/68967549/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 20A</a> of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act 1982 read with Rule 14(4) of the\nAndhra Pradesh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules 2010.\nSection 20A: “20-A. Prohibition of individual to establish institutions.—On and from the commencement of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/131537474/\" id=\"a_318\">Andhra Pradesh Education (Amendment) Act, 1987</a> no individual shall establish a private institution:\nProvided that this section shall not have any effect on any private institution established by an individual and\nrecognized by the competent authority prior to such commencement].”\nRule 14(4): “(4) The District Educational Officer, on being satisfied that the school fulfils the norms and\nstandards prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1553414/\" id=\"a_319\">section 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/301479/\" id=\"a_320\">section 25</a> of the Act, shall issue the recognition certificate in\nForm-2 as shown in the appendix. The certificate shall be for a period of three years and shall be issued\nwithin 30 days from the date of making application for recognition. The certificate of recognition shall be\n\n                                                                                               Page 78 of 118\n\f                                                                                                    PART E\n\n       to the school (or other educational institution) meeting the relevant criteria. It\n\n       may also require schools to register with the authorities.96 Certain steps as\n\n       mandated by law may be a sine qua non for setting up educational institutions.\n\n\n100. In the absence of these prerequisites (such as registration with the competent\n\n       authorities), the educational institution will have no existence in the eyes of\n\n       the law. It is only upon compliance with these requirements that the institution\n\n       assumes the legal form mandated by the regulatory provisions of the law.\n\n\n101. It is true that many persons or groups founded universities which awarded\n\n       degrees which were not recognised by the imperial government. The\n\n       existence of this option and the fact that others chose this path in colonial\n\n       times cannot shape the contours of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 30</a> in independent\n\n       India. This is because the recognition of degrees was and is essential not only\n\n       to the success of the university but more importantly, to the success of its\n\n       graduates. Recognition of the degrees or qualifications held by persons who\n\n       have completed courses from universities is essential to professional\n\n       development. It is impossible to avail of employment opportunities if the\n\n       degree that one holds is not recognised.\n\n\n102. This interpretation has also found support in numerous judgments of this\n\n       Court. Judgments of this Court have previously expounded on the importance\n\n\nissued subject to following conditions: (a) The school is run by a society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_322\">Societies\nRegistration Act, 1860</a> (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force; …”\n96\n   See, for instance, <a href=\"/doc/49594846/\" id=\"a_323\">Section 30</a> of the Karnataka Education Act 1983: “30. Educational institutions to be\nregistered.- (1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, every local authority institution and every private\neducational institution established on or before the date of commencement of this Act or intended to be\nestablished thereafter, shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,\nbe registered in accordance with this Act and the rules made thereunder. (2) No person or local authority\nshall establish or as the case may be, run or maintain an educational institution requiring registration under\nthis section, unless such institution is so registered.”\n\n                                                                                               Page 79 of 118\n\f                                                                                     PART E\n\n     of recognition or affiliation of a College. It is only with the affiliation of the\n\n     college with the University that a student could be awarded a degree upon\n\n     the completion of the course of study. The degree, beyond being a testament\n\n     of a personal achievement, is necessary for their professional growth. In in re\n\n     the Kerala Education Bill 1957 (supra), this Court expounded on the\n\n     importance of recognition and observed as follows:\n\n\n                     “32. […] Without recognition, therefore, the\n                     educational institutions established or to be\n                     established by the minority communities cannot fulfil\n                     the real objects of their choice and the rights under\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_324\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot be effectively exercised. The\n                     right to establish educational institutions of their\n                     choice must, therefore, mean the right to establish\n                     real institutions which will effectively serve the needs\n                     of their community and the scholars who resort to\n                     their educational institutions. There is, no doubt, no\n                     such thing as fundamental right to recognition by the\n                     State but to deny recognition to the educational\n                     institutions except upon terms tantamount to the\n                     surrender of their constitutional right of\n                     administration of the educational institutions of their\n                     choice is in truth and in effect to deprive them of their\n                     rights under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 30(1).</a> We repeat that the\n                     legislative power is subject to the fundamental rights\n                     and the legislature cannot indirectly take away or\n                     abridge the fundamental rights which it could not do\n                     directly and yet that will be the result if the said Bill\n                     containing any offending clause becomes law.”\n\n\n103. In Rev. Sidhajbhai (supra), this Court reiterated that regulations which may\n\n     impose conditions for the recognition of the educational institution must be\n\n     directed towards making the institution effective, while retaining its character\n\n     as a minority institution. The dual test laid down in this case to assess the\n\n     validity of such regulations is that the regulations must be reasonable and\n\n     regulate the educational character of the institution while being conducive to\n\n     making it an effective vehicle of education. An educational institution does not\n\n                                                                                 Page 80 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n     lose its minority character merely because it subjects itself to regulatory\n\n     measures essential to avail the benefit of recognition/affiliation, or grant in aid,\n\n     provided these controls are designed to maintain the standards of education\n\n     and larger public interest.\n\n\n104. The decision of the seven Judge Bench in In re the Kerala Education Bill\n\n     (supra) was followed by a six Judge Bench in Rev. Sidhajbhai Sabhai\n\n     (supra). This aspect was overlooked in Azeez Basha (supra) which was\n\n     decided by a bench of five judges. The importance of recognition and\n\n     affiliation cannot be understated. The position of law even at the time of the\n\n     decision in Azeez Basha (supra), as held in re the Kerala Education Bill\n\n     1957 (supra), was that recognition on terms tantamount to the surrender of\n\n     the right to administer the institution was a violation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 30(1).</a> For Azeez\n\n     Basha (supra) to hold that the minority character of the institution is\n\n     surrendered upon enactment by central imperial legislation is to hold that the\n\n     recognition of its degrees would result in the denial of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_327\">Article\n\n     30</a>, reducing the choice available to a religious or linguistic minority. This\n\n     would be in the teeth of settled law on the subject as well as <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n     Azeez Basha (supra) failed to notice this aspect of the decision in In re the\n\n     Kerala Education Bill 1957 (supra) discussed above and the decision in\n\n     Rev. Sidhajbhai (supra).\n\n\n105. Further, the decisions of this Court subsequent to Azeez Basha (supra) have\n\n     not disturbed the relevant part of the precedents in In re the Kerala\n\n     Education Bill 1957 (supra) and Rev. Sidhajbhai (supra). Azeez Basha\n\n\n\n                                                                           Page 81 of 118\n\f                                                                                    PART E\n\n     (supra) is the lone case which stands apart in the long line of cases on this\n\n     subject. In St. Xavier’s (supra), the majority of the nine-Judge Bench held\n\n     that an unconstitutional condition of surrendering the minority character in\n\n     exchange for affiliation or recognition cannot be imposed.\n\n\n106. Presently, the decision of eleven Judges in TMA Pai (supra) holds the field\n\n     on the subject and is binding on this Court. It, too, unequivocally affirms the\n\n     proposition of law discussed above. One of the many relevant paragraphs in\n\n     this regard is extracted below:\n\n\n                    “70. … The object of establishing an institution has\n                    thus been to provide technical or professional\n                    education to the deserving candidates, and is not\n                    necessarily a commercial venture. In order that this\n                    intention is meaningful, the institution must be\n                    recognized. At the school level, the recognition or\n                    affiliation has to be sought from the educational\n                    authority or the body that conducts the school-\n                    leaving examination. … A college or a professional\n                    educational institution has to get recognition from the\n                    university concerned, which normally requires\n                    certain conditions to be fulfilled before recognition. It\n                    has been held that conditions of affiliation or\n                    recognition, which pertain to the academic and\n                    educational character of the institution and\n                    ensure uniformity, efficiency and excellence in\n                    educational courses are valid, and that they do\n                    not violate even the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 30</a> of\n                    the Constitution; but conditions that are laid\n                    down for granting recognition should not be\n                    such as may lead to governmental control of the\n                    administration of the private educational\n                    institutions.”\n\n\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n107. Compliance with the legal requirement to secure a benefit provided by the\n\n     State cannot be on terms that require the relinquishment of fundamental\n\n     rights. An interpretation that leans towards this consequence must not be\n\n                                                                                Page 82 of 118\n\f                                                                                           PART E\n\n     adopted. Thus, the minority character of an educational institution could not\n\n     have been denied merely because it was converted to a University through a\n\n     legislative enactment.\n\n\n108. In Azeez Basha (supra), this Court recognised the efforts of the Muslim\n\n     community towards the establishment of AMU’s predecessor, the MAO\n\n     College, as well as towards the enactment of the AMU Act but held that the\n\n     central imperial legislature established AMU, and not the Muslim community.\n\n     In effect, it held that the enactment of the AMU Act rendered any previous\n\n     action undertaken by the Muslim community towards the establishment of\n\n     AMU irrelevant.\n\n\n109. The reasoning of the Court hinged on the fact that the Muslim minority could\n\n     have established a university and awarded degrees but could not have\n\n     insisted upon governmental recognition of its degrees. The Court held that\n\n     the fact that AMU was brought into existence by a statute which mandated\n\n     the recognition of its degrees meant that the central imperial legislature\n\n     established it. Since the correctness of the reasoning of the Court is being\n\n     considered in these proceedings, it is extracted below:\n\n\n               “22. There was nothing in 1920 to prevent the Muslim minority, if it\n               so chose, to establish a university; but if it did so the degrees of such\n               a university were not bound to be recognised by Government. …\n               The Aligarh University was also in the same way established by\n               legislation and it provided under <a href=\"/doc/1773201/\" id=\"a_330\">Section 6</a> of the 1920 Act that “the\n               degrees, diplomas and other academic distinctions granted or\n               conferred to or on persons by the University shall be recognised by\n               the Government as are the corresponding degrees, diplomas and\n               other academic distinctions granted by any other university\n               incorporated under any enactment”. It is clear therefore that even\n               though the Muslim minority could have established at Aligarh in\n               1920 a university, it could not insist that degrees granted by such a\n\n\n                                                                                    Page 83 of 118\n\f                                                                                          PART E\n\n                university should be recognised by Government. Therefore when\n                the Aligarh University was established in 1920 and by <a href=\"/doc/1773201/\" id=\"a_331\">Section 6</a> its\n                degrees were recognised by Government, an institution was brought\n                into existence which could not be brought into existence by any\n                private individual or body for such individual or body could not insist\n                upon the recognition of the degrees conferred by any university\n                established by it. The enactment of <a href=\"/doc/1773201/\" id=\"a_332\">Section 6</a> in the 1920 Act is a\n                very important circumstance which shows that the Aligarh University\n                when it came to be established in 1920 was not established by the\n                Muslim minority, for the minority could not insist on the recognition\n                by Government of the degrees conferred by any university\n                established by it.\n\n\n                23. … There was no Aligarh University existing till the 1920\n                Act was passed. It was brought into being by the 1920 Act and\n                must therefore be held to have been established by the\n                Central Legislature which by passing the 1920 Act\n                incorporated it. The fact that it was based on the M.A.O.\n                College, would make no difference to the question as to who\n                established the Aligarh University. The answer to our mind as\n                to who established the Aligarh University is clear and that is\n                that it was the Central Legislature by enacting the 1920 Act\n                that established the said University. As we have said already,\n                the Muslim minority could not establish a university whose\n                degrees were bound to be recognised by Government as\n                provided by <a href=\"/doc/1773201/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 6</a> of 1920 Act : that one circumstance\n                along with the fact that without the 1920 Act the University in\n                the form that it had, could not come into existence shows\n                clearly that the Aligarh University when it came into existence\n                in 1920 was established by the Central Legislature by the\n                1920 Act. It may be that the 1920 Act was passed as a result\n                of the efforts of the Muslim minority. But that does not mean\n                that the Aligarh University when it came into being under the\n                1920 Act was established by the Muslim minority.”\n\n\n110. In Azeez Basha (supra), this Court observed that the term ‘establish’ means\n\n     ‘to bring into existence’ and not any of the other dictionary meanings that is,\n\n     to ratify, confirm, settle, found, or create. Adopting a formalistic interpretation,\n\n     the Bench held that AMU was not established by the Muslim minority since it\n\n     was brought ‘into existence’ by the Central Legislature. In Mother Provincial\n\n     (supra), another Constitution Bench which was decided before Azeez Basha\n\n     (supra) interpreted the word ‘establish’ to mean to found an institution, which\n\n\n                                                                                   Page 84 of 118\n\f                                                                                                PART E\n\n      offers a broader interpretation.97 In our view, it is inconsequential whether the\n\n      word means ‘to bring into existence’ or ‘to found’. We have held above that\n\n      the enactment of a legislation to incorporate a university would not repudiate\n\n      the minority character. The Court must pierce the veil of the statute to identify\n\n      if the institution intended to retain its minority character even upon\n\n      incorporation.\n\n\n111. The respondents further submitted that the long title and the preamble of the\n\n      enactment must be used to determine if the minority established the\n\n      institution. A comparison was drawn between the preamble of the AMU Act\n\n      and statutes by which other universities were incorporated. For example, the\n\n      preamble of the <a href=\"/doc/37829543/\" id=\"a_334\">Annamalai University Act</a> 1928 stipulates that the founder of\n\n      the college, Shri Annamalai Chettiyar, handed over the college with the\n\n      property and a fund of twenty thousand rupees to the local Government for\n\n      the establishment of a University. The preamble also recognises that he and\n\n      his heirs would be entitled to certain powers and privileges in the University.\n\n      However, in contrast, the preamble of the AMU Act 1920 stated that it is an\n\n      enactment to ‘establish’ and ‘incorporate’ a University.\n\n\n112. We do not agree with this submission. It cannot be argued that a university\n\n      was established by Parliament merely because the long title and preamble of\n\n      the statute incorporating the university states that it is an Act to establish and\n\n      incorporate. If such a formalistic interpretation is adopted, fundamental rights\n\n\n\n97\n   8. […] Establishment here means the bringing of an institution and it must be by a minority community. It\nmatters not if a single philanthropic individual with his own means, founds the institution or the community\nat large contributes the funds.” (emphasis supplied)\n\n                                                                                           Page 85 of 118\n\f                                                                                                   PART E\n\n      would be made subservient to legislative language. The preamble of the\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/37829543/\" id=\"a_335\">Annamalai University Act</a> certainly provides context to the incorporation of the\n\n      University and brings out the distinction between incorporation and\n\n      establishment. However, the courts in the absence of such an elaborate\n\n      preamble must not be ready to conclude that Parliament established the\n\n      University. The courts must identify the circumstances surrounding the\n\n      incorporation of the University (including through a reading of the statute) to\n\n      identify who established the university. Formalism must give way to actuality\n\n      and to what is real.\n\n\n113. The written submissions filed on behalf of the Union of India place reliance on\n\n      Dalco Engg. (P) Ltd. v. Satish Prabhakar Padhye98 to argue that the term\n\n      ‘establish’ means “coming into existence by virtue of a statutory enactment”.\n\n      It suggests that the institution owes its existence to the legislature if the long\n\n      title to an enactment states that it is an act to “establish and incorporate”.\n\n\n114. In Dalco (supra), the question before this Court was whether companies\n\n      incorporated in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_336\">Companies Act</a> 1956 were bound by the norm\n\n      contained in Section 47 of the same enactment. Section 47 stipulated that an\n\n      ‘establishment’ shall not dispense with or reduce in rank an employee who\n\n      acquires a disability during their service.99 <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_337\">Section 2(k)</a> of the same statute\n\n      defined ‘establishment’ in the following terms:\n\n\n\n98\n  (2010) 4 SCC 378\n99\n   <a href=\"/doc/1360925/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 47</a>, Companies Act 1956: “47.

After analysing the precedents, this Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 2(k)</a> referred to\n\n       companies which owe their existence to a statute. It held that without such a\n\n       statute, the company would not exist. It held that the term “established by or\n\n       under” in <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 2(k)</a> referred to companies which are created by statutes\n\n       and not ones which are merely governed by statutes after coming into\n\n       existence. This court, therefore, held that companies incorporated and\n\n       registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_342\">Companies Act</a> 1956 are not necessarily established by\n\n       it.\n\n\n116. Dalco (supra) does not have a bearing on the interpretation of the term\n\n       “establish” in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_343\">Article 30</a> because it was concerned with the interpretation of\n\n       the term “established by or under a Central, Provincial or State Act” as it\n\n       occurs in a parliamentary statute.

Mr Dwivedi submitted that an educational institution to be a minority\n\n      educational institution must have been established by a linguistic or religious\n\n      minority at the time of establishment. He proposed that the following tests\n\n      must be satisfied to determine if the community was a minority:\n\n\n      a.    The numerical test:101 Which community ruled the country when the\n\n            university was established? Is the community which seeks to claim the\n\n            right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_344\">Article 30</a> a minority compared to the former?\n\n\n      b.    The qualitative test of non-dominance:102 Even if the community which\n\n            seeks to claim the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_345\">Article 30</a> was in a numerical minority, was\n\n            it in a non-dominant position in the state at the point of time at which the\n\n            institution was established?\n\n\n      c.    The test of self-assessment: Did the specific persons who established\n\n            the educational institute consider themselves to be a minority?\n\n\n\n\n100\n    Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi (1975) 1 SCC 421; Vaish Degree College v.\nLakshmi Narain (1976) 2 SCC 58; S.S. Dhanoa v.

A preliminary question must be answered before addressing the feasibility\n\n     and legality of adopting the above tests. What should be the relevant point to\n\n     determine if the educational institution that was founded before the\n\n     commencement of the Constitution was established by a minority? Should it\n\n     be determined based on the time of establishment, the time of the\n\n     commencement of the Constitution, or the time when the right was claimed.\n\n\n119. Before the commencement of the Constitution, there was no concept of\n\n     minority institutions, both linguistic and religious. The guarantee and the\n\n     protection given by the Constitution are applicable on the date when the\n\n     Constitution was adopted. It is on this date that it must be determined if the\n\n     right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_346\">Article 30</a> accrues. However, when the question of whether the\n\n     educational institution was established by a linguistic or a religious minority\n\n     arises, we will have to relate back to the point in time when the institution was\n\n     established. It would be immaterial that back then the educational institution\n\n     was not granted the status and treated as a linguistic or a religious minority\n\n     institution. Thus, the details of the persons who had established the institution,\n\n     though earlier in point of time, is relevant and determines the character of the\n\n     institution. Such interpretation would do justice to <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_347\">Article 30(1)</a> and not deny\n\n     and rob minority educational institutions of constitutional guarantees.\n\n\n120. The question of whether they qualify as a ‘minority’ has to be answered with\n\n     reference to the date of enforcement of the Constitution. The Constitution\n\n     upon its adoption guaranteed fundamental rights to specific groups such as\n\n     ‘persons’, ‘citizens’, ‘religious and linguistic minorities’, ‘women’,        ‘the\n\n\n\n                                                                         Page 89 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n         Scheduled Castes’ and ‘Scheduled Tribes’. These groups consist of such\n\n         members as conceived by the Constitution. For example, Part II of the\n\n         Constitution and provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/305990/\" id=\"a_348\">Citizenship Act</a> 1955 enacted in pursuance\n\n         of the power provided under <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_349\">Article 11</a> stipulate conditions for acquiring\n\n         citizenship. Only those persons who satisfy the conditions prescribed can\n\n         enforce the rights guaranteed to citizens as a class. Similarly, the President\n\n         in exercise of the power under <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_350\">Article 341</a> may notify castes, tribes or groups\n\n         that would be Scheduled Castes for the purposes of the Constitution.\n\n\n121. The only criteria that is prescribed for right-bearers under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_351\">Article 30</a> is that\n\n         they should be linguistic or a religious minorities. The courts have, however,\n\n         specified what constitutes a minority. Chief Justice Kirpal, writing for the\n\n         majority of the eleven-Judge Bench in TMA Pai (supra) observed that the\n\n         minority must be determined based on the test of numerical minority within\n\n         the State.103 If a group or community is required to prove that it was a religious\n\n         or linguistic minority at the time of establishment of the institution (where the\n\n         institution was established before the commencement of the Constitution), it\n\n         would lead to a situation where the fundamental right is conferred upon a\n\n         group other than the one intended by the Constitution. The demography of\n\n         the Dominion of India underwent a drastic change upon partition. The\n\n         Constitution, through <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_352\">Article 30(1)</a>, confers a right on those communities that\n\n         were disadvantaged upon the commencement of the Constitution and not the\n\n         group that was disadvantaged in pre-independent India.\n\n\n\n\n103\n      TMA Pai (supra) [81]\n\n                                                                             Page 90 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n122. We reject the argument that the test of whether an educational institution is a\n\n     minority institution must be examined based on whether the community or the\n\n     group which had established the institution was a minority at the time of its\n\n     establishment in pre-independent India. The purpose of the provision as\n\n     highlighted in the preceding sections is to ensure that the minorities are able\n\n     to preserve and promote their linguistic and religious culture. For this purpose,\n\n     the status of the group/community, that had established the institution, on the\n\n     date of commencement of the Constitution should be considered. The test of\n\n     establishment will apply to future situations on the day when new educational\n\n     institutions are established. The protection under clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_353\">Article 30</a>\n\n     cannot be denied to institutions established before the commencement of the\n\n     Constitution for the reason that at the time of establishment in pre-\n\n     independent India, the founders were not aware that they would receive\n\n     protection of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_354\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n123. Having addressed the preliminary arguments on the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_355\">Article 30</a>,\n\n     we will now proceed to formulate the indicia for the establishment of an\n\n     educational institution.\n\n\n     v.    Indicia for the ‘establishment’ of a minority educational institution\n\n\n124. In this section of the judgment, we will answer two questions: (i) the indicia\n\n     for ‘establishment’ of a minority educational institution; and (ii) the burden and\n\n     degree of proof required to prove ‘establishment’ of a minority educational\n\n     institution.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          Page 91 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n125. In SK Patro (supra), the question before the Constitution Bench was whether\n\n      Church Missionary Society Higher Secondary School was a minority\n\n      educational institution. It was contended that the school was established by\n\n      the Church Missionary Society, London and not the local residents of\n\n      Bhagalpur. The Bench relied on the following evidence to conclude that the\n\n      School was established by the local Christians:\n\n\n      a.     The correspondence and resolutions indicated that a permanent home\n\n             for the Boys School was set up on property acquired by local Christians\n\n             and in buildings erected from funds collected by them104;\n\n\n      b.     The institution and the land on which it was built and the balance in the\n\n             local fund were handed over to the Church Missionary Society105; and\n\n\n      c.     Though substantial assistance was obtained from the Church\n\n             Missionary Society London, it could not be said that the school was not\n\n             established by local residents only because of that106.\n\n\n126. In Mother Provincial (supra), this Court observed that the intention to found\n\n      an institution for the benefit of the minority community must be present. In St.\n\n      Stephen’s (supra), a Constitution Bench determined whether St. Stephen’s\n\n      College is a minority educational institution. St Stephen’s College is a\n\n      constituent college of Delhi University. The Bench held that the college was\n\n\n\n\n104\n    SK Patro (supra) [15]\n105\n    ibid [15]\n106\n    ibid [16]\n\n                                                                         Page 92 of 118\n\f                                                                                              PART E\n\n      established by the Indian Christian community based on the following\n\n      material:\n\n\n      a.     The purpose of establishing the educational institution emerged from the\n\n             Report of 1878 to the Cambridge Brotherhood. The purpose of founding\n\n             the college was to ensure that graduates from St. Stephen’s Mission\n\n             School could be given the benefit of Christian teachings in college107;\n\n\n      b.     The buildings depicted the Christian orientation of the college108\n\n\n      c.     The motto of the college is “Ad Dei Gloriam”, that is the glory of god109;\n\n\n      d.     There is a chapel in the college campus, where religious instruction is\n\n             imparted110;\n\n\n      e.     The Constitution of the college reflects its Christian character. It states\n\n             that the object of the college is, inter alia, to offer instruction on doctrines\n\n             of Christianity111, the original members of the society were mostly\n\n             Christians112, and the composition of the society reflects its Christian\n\n             character where a large number of Christian members of the Church of\n\n             North India are a part of it113; and\n\n\n      f.     The Governing Body has a distinct christian character. The Supreme\n\n             Council comprises of members of the Church of North India. Their role\n\n\n107\n    St Stephen’s (supra) [30]\n108\n    Ibid [31-32] Foundation stone has the inscription :”to the glory of god, and the advancement of sound,\nlearning and religious education”; a cross was placed in the new building.\n109\n    ibid [33]\n110\n    ibid [34]\n111\n    Memorandum of the Society and Rules, Clause 2\n112\n    Memorandum of the Society and Rules, Clause 4\n113\n    ibid [35]\n\n                                                                                          Page 93 of 118\n\f                                                                                   PART E\n\n               is to look after the religious and moral instruction to students114. The\n\n               administration vests with the Governing Body which predominantly\n\n               consists of Christians. Though three of the thirteen members of the\n\n               Governing Body may be non-Christians, that does not dilute the\n\n               Christian character of the institution.\n\n\n127. The decisions in Mother Provincial (supra), SK Patro (supra) and St.\n\n         Stephen’s (supra) emphasise that the indicia for establishment must\n\n         elucidate the minority character of the educational institution. What is the\n\n         meaning of the phrase ‘minority character’? Are special rights guaranteed by\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_356\">Article 30(1)</a> only if educational institutions are established ‘for’ the minorities,\n\n         towards the purpose of protecting minority interests? If yes, when can the\n\n         courts be certain that the above two conditions are satisfied? That is, what\n\n         are the ‘core essentials’ of minority character? We will answer this by referring\n\n         to judicial decisions on four questions. Clarity over the essentials of the\n\n         minority character will help us ascertain the indicia for ‘establishment’ of a\n\n         minority educational institution.\n\n\n128. The first question that arose in earlier cases was whether a minority\n\n         educational institution must be established towards the conservation of the\n\n         distinct language, script or culture of linguistic and religious minorities\n\n         protected by <a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_357\">Article 29(1).</a> In Rev. Father W. Proost v. The State of Bihar115,\n\n         a Constitution Bench answered the question in the negative. The Bench held\n\n         that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_358\">Article 30(1)</a> covers a minority educational institution which is established\n\n\n114\n      ibid [36]\n115\n      (1969) 2 SCR 73\n\n                                                                               Page 94 of 118\n\f                                                                                                       PART E\n\n       to conserve culture and language. However, that need not be the only\n\n       purpose for the establishment of the institution. This Court held that the scope\n\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_359\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot be restricted by <a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_360\">Article 29(1)</a>.116 In St. Xavier (supra),\n\n       the majority of the nine-Judge Bench approved this interpretation.117\n\n\n129. The second question that arose in earlier decisions was whether an\n\n       educational institution would retain its minority character even if non-\n\n       minorities are admitted in it. Would a Muslim minority education institution\n\n       retain its minority character when it admits students from other faiths in the\n\n       institution? In re the Kerala Education Bill 1957 (supra), a seven-Judge\n\n       Bench held that a minority educational institution would not lose its minority\n\n       character by merely admitting students belonging to non-minorities and that\n\n       the provision contemplates an institution with a ‘sprinkling of outsiders’.118\n\n       This position was further fortified in TMA Pai (supra). In TMA Pai (supra),\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_361\">Article 29(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_362\">Article 30(1)</a> were read harmoniously to hold that <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_363\">Article\n\n       29(2)</a> would apply to a limited extent to minority educational institutions as\n\n       well.119 Thus, an aided minority educational institution is mandated to admit\n\n\n116\n    Rev. Father W Proost v. State of Bihar [5J] (1969) 2 SCR 73;\n117\n    See footnote 30 of this judgment.\n118\n     “By admitting a non-member into it the minority institution does not shed its character and cease to be a\nminority institution. Indeed the object of conservation of the distinct language, script and culture of a minority\nmay be better served by propagating the same amongst non-members of the particular minority community.”\n119\n    “149. […] As observed quite aptly in St. Stephen&#x27;s case [(1992) 1 SCC 558] (at SCC p. 608, para 85) “the\nfact that <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_364\">Article 29(2)</a> applies to minorities as well as non-minorities does not mean that it was intended to\nnullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_365\">Article 30(1)</a>”. The word “only” used in <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_366\">Article 29(2)</a> is of\nconsiderable significance and has been used for some avowed purpose. Denying admission to non-\nminorities for the purpose of accommodating minority students to a reasonable extent will not be only on\ngrounds of religion etc., but is primarily meant to preserve the minority character of the institution and to\neffectuate the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_367\">Article 30(1).</a> The best possible way is to hold that as long as the minority\neducational institution permits admission of citizens belonging to the non-minority class to a\nreasonable extent based upon merit, it will not be an infraction of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_368\">Article 29(2)</a>, even though the\ninstitution admits students of the minority group of its own choice for whom the institution was\nmeant. What would be a reasonable extent would depend upon variable factors, and it may not be\nadvisable to fix any specific percentage. The situation would vary according to the type of institution and\nthe nature of education that is being imparted in the institution. Usually, at the school level, although it may\nbe possible to fill up all the seats with students of the minority group, at the higher level, either in colleges or\n\n                                                                                                  Page 95 of 118\n\f                                                                                                        PART E\n\n       students from other faiths and that in itself does not erode the minority\n\n       character of the institution.\n\n\n130. The third question was whether a minority education institution would lose its\n\n       minority character when secular education is taught. In In re Kerala\n\n       Education Bill (supra) and St. Xavier’s (supra), this Court held that the word\n\n       ‘choice’ in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_369\">Article 30(1)</a> expands the scope of the provision to include not only\n\n       religious but also secular education.120\n\n\n131. The fourth question was whether it is essential that religious instruction must\n\n       be provided in a minority educational institution. In TMA Pai (supra), this\n\n       Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_370\">Article 28</a> equally applies to minority educational\n\n       institutions.121 Thus, if the minority institution has received aid from the State\n\n       wholly or in part, no student can be forced to participate in religious\n\n\nin technical institutions, it may not be possible to fill up all the seats with the students of the minority group.\nHowever, even if it is possible to fill up all the seats with students of the minority group, the moment the\ninstitution is granted aid, the institution will have to admit students of the non-minority group to a reasonable\nextent, whereby the character of the institution is not annihilated, and at the same time, the rights of the\ncitizen engrafted under <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_371\">Article 29(2)</a> are not subverted. It is for this reason that a variable percentage of\nadmission of minority students depending on the type of institution and education is desirable, and indeed,\nnecessary, to promote the constitutional guarantees enshrined in both <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_372\">Article 29(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_373\">Article 30.</a> [emphasis\nsupplied]\n120\n    In re Kerala Education Bill (supra) [23] “23. […] the right conferred on such minorities is to establish\neducational institutions of their choice. It does not say that minorities based on religion should establish\neducational institutions for teaching religion only, or that linguistic minorities should have the right to establish\neducational institutions for teaching their language only. What the article says and means is that the religious\nand the linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions of their choice. There\nis no limitation placed on the subjects to be taught in such educational institutions. As such minorities will\nordinarily desire that their children should be brought up properly and efficiently and be eligible for higher\nuniversity education and go out in the world fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make\nthem fit for entering the public services, educational institutions of their choice will necessarily include\ninstitutions imparting general secular education also.”; St. Xavier’s (supra) [Chief Justice Ray for himself and\nJustice Palekar, 8]; [Justice HR Khanna, 96]; [Justice Beg, 197]; [Justice Dwivedi, 236];\n121\n    See TMA Pai (supra) [88-90;144]; “144 […] As in the case of a majority-run institution, the moment a\nminority institution obtains a grant of aid, <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_374\">Article 28</a> of the Constitution comes into play. When an educational\ninstitution is maintained out of State funds, no religious instruction can be provided therein. <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_375\">Article 28(1)</a> does\nnot state that it applies only to educational institutions that are not established or maintained by religious or\nlinguistic minorities. Furthermore, upon the receipt of aid, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 28(3)</a> would apply to all\neducational institutions whether run by the minorities or the non-minorities. […] Just as <a href=\"/doc/265235/\" id=\"a_377\">Articles 28(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_378\">(3)</a>\nbecome applicable the moment any educational institution takes aid, likewise, <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_379\">Article 29(2)</a> would also be\nattracted and become applicable to an educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of\nState funds.”\n\n                                                                                                   Page 96 of 118\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n     instruction. Similarly, a minority educational institution which is fully\n\n     maintained out of State funds cannot provide religious instruction. Even here,\n\n     a harmonious construction of <a href=\"/doc/1734560/\" id=\"a_380\">Article 28</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_381\">Article 30(1)</a> was adopted.\n\n\n132. The discussion above elucidates that the ‘minority character’ of the institution\n\n     is not a rigid concept. The provision does not contemplate institutions which\n\n     are exclusively for the benefit of members from the minority community. A\n\n     minority institution established by a religious or linguistic minority need not be\n\n     solely for their students or only for the purpose of teaching the tenets of their\n\n     religion or language. The issue of whether an institution is a minority institution\n\n     should not be determined purely on the basis of the number of their students\n\n     or the teaching staff. Such an interpretation is contrary to precedent.\n\n\n133. A holistic and realistic view should be taken keeping in mind the objective and\n\n     purpose of the provision. Based on the above principles laid down by Benches\n\n     of co-equal strength and larger Benches of this Court on the components of\n\n     the ‘minority character’, the following inferences can be drawn:\n\n\n     a.   The existence of a religious place for prayer and worship is not a\n\n          necessary indicator of the minority character because institutions wholly\n\n          maintained out of State funds are constitutionally barred from providing\n\n          religious instructions; and\n\n\n     b.   The existence of religious symbols in the precincts of the educational\n\n          institution are not necessary to prove the minority character because\n\n          educational institutions could be established for minorities to provide\n\n          secular education without imparting any lessons on religion.\n\n                                                                          Page 97 of 118\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n134. As discussed above, ‘establishment’ or formation of an institution can be at\n\n         any point of time and even before the commencement of the Constitution. If\n\n         an institution was established before the commencement of the Constitution,\n\n         the enquiry on the question of ‘establishment’ must relate back to the date\n\n         when the institution was established or formed to ascertain whether it would\n\n         qualify as a minority institution upon the commencement of the Constitution.\n\n\n135. To determine who established the institution, the Courts must consider the\n\n         genesis of the educational institution. For this analysis, the Courts must trace\n\n         the origin of the idea for the establishment of the institution. The Court must\n\n         identify who was the brain behind the establishment of the educational\n\n         institution. Letters, correspondence with other members of the community or\n\n         with government/State officials and resolutions issued could be valid proof for\n\n         establishing ideation or the impetus to found and establish. The proof of\n\n         ideation must point towards one member of the minority or a group from the\n\n         community.122\n\n\n136. The second indicia is the purpose for which the educational institution was\n\n         established. Though it is not necessary that the educational institution must\n\n         have been established only for the benefit of a religious or linguistic minority\n\n         community, it must predominantly be for its benefit. It is not necessary that\n\n         education must be provided in the language spoken by the minority or on the\n\n         religion of the minority. For example, it is not necessary that an educational\n\n         institution established for the Tamils in Uttar Pradesh must necessarily\n\n\n\n122\n      Mother Provincial (supra)\n\n                                                                            Page 98 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n         prescribe Tamil as the language of instruction. However, it must be proved\n\n         that the institution was established for the benefit of the tamil-speaking\n\n         community. This indicia could be proved by a reference to private\n\n         communication or speeches about the necessity of establishing an\n\n         educational institution for the community and a recognition of the educational\n\n         difficulties faced by the community.\n\n\n137. The third test is tracing the steps taken towards the implementation of the\n\n         idea. Information on who contributed the funds for its creation, who was\n\n         responsible for obtaining the land, and whether the land was donated by a\n\n         member of the minority community or purchased from funds raised by the\n\n         minority community for this purpose or donated by a person from some other\n\n         community specifically for the establishment of a minority educational\n\n         institution are elements that must be considered. Similar questions must be\n\n         asked of its other assets. Other important questions are: who took the steps\n\n         necessary for establishing the institution (such as obtaining the relevant\n\n         permissions, constructing the buildings, and arranging other infrastructure)?\n\n         It is also important to note that the state may grant some land or other\n\n         monetary aid during or after the establishment of the educational institution.\n\n         If the land or monies were granted after the establishment, the grant would\n\n         not have the effect of changing the minority character of the institution.\n\n         Minority institutions are not barred from receiving aid save at the cost of their\n\n         minority status.123 If the land or monies are granted at the time of\n\n\n\n\n123\n      TMA Pai (supra) [141]\n\n                                                                             Page 99 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n     establishment, the circumstances surrounding the establishment must be\n\n     considered as a whole to determine who established the institution. The\n\n     presence of a grant must not be automatically interpreted as leading to the\n\n     erasure of a claim to minority status.\n\n\n138. The next question is whether the administrative structure of the educational\n\n     institution is an indicia for the establishment of a minority educational\n\n     institution. We have already held above that an educational institution is a\n\n     minority educational institution if it is established by a religious or linguistic\n\n     minority. We have clarified that it is not necessary to prove that administration\n\n     vests with the minority to prove that it is a minority educational institution\n\n     because the very purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_382\">Article 30(1)</a> is to grant special rights on\n\n     administration as a consequence of establishment. To do otherwise, would\n\n     amount to converting the consequence to a pre-condition. The right to\n\n     administer is guaranteed to minority educational institutions to enable them\n\n     to possess sufficient autonomy to model the educational institution according\n\n     to the educational values that the community wishes to emphasise. It is not\n\n     necessary that the purpose can only be implemented if persons belonging to\n\n     the community helm the administrative affairs. This is so particularly because\n\n     a minority institution may wish to emphasise secular education. The founders\n\n     or the minority community may choose to populate the managing board (or a\n\n     comparable authority) responsible for the day-to-day administration of the\n\n     institution with persons belonging to the same community. However, they are\n\n     not compelled to do so. They may wish to appoint persons who do not belong\n\n     to their community but who they deem fit for the proper administration of the\n\n                                                                        Page 100 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n     institution. This may be the case for professional colleges which offer\n\n     specialised courses such as law, medicine, or architecture, where the\n\n     founders may not possess the knowledge, experience, or insight necessary\n\n     to manage or administer the institution personally.\n\n\n139. The test to be adopted by the Court is whether the administrative set up of\n\n     the educational institution affirms the minority character of the institution. If\n\n     the administrative structure of the educational institution does not reflect its\n\n     minority character or when it does not elucidate that the educational institution\n\n     was established to protect and promote the interests of the minority, it may\n\n     be reasonably inferred that the purpose was not to establish an educational\n\n     institution for the benefit of the minority community.\n\n\n140. We may specifically deal with a scenario of an educational institution\n\n     established before the commencement of the Constitution. The test of\n\n     administration should be evaluated in praesenti, that is, on the date of the\n\n     commencement of the Constitution. An institution to be a minority institution\n\n     must satisfy the criteria of being ‘administered’ as a minority institution on the\n\n     date of commencement of the Constitution, and being a minority institution on\n\n     the date of formation. Even if an educational institution was established by\n\n     the minority for the purposes of the community, we must assess the impact\n\n     of any subsequent events that altered the character of the institution before\n\n     the commencement of the Constitution. We have in section E(iv)(c) held that\n\n     the statutory incorporation of the institution does not ipso facto amount to a\n\n     surrender of the minority character of the institution. We have held that the\n\n\n\n                                                                        Page 101 of 118\n\f                                                                           PART E\n\n     Court must pierce the veil to identify if the University was established by a\n\n     minority for the purpose of promoting the interest of the community. The Court\n\n     may on a holistic reading of the statutory provisions relating to the\n\n     administrative set-up of the educational institution deduce if the minority\n\n     character or the purpose of establishment was relinquished upon\n\n     incorporation. The question is whether the regulatory measures wrest the\n\n     administrative control from the founders of the institution. This is a question\n\n     of fact which must be determined on the facts of each case. The Court must\n\n     make that determination upon a comprehensive analysis of the administrative\n\n     framework which includes host of factors such as the representation of the\n\n     interests of the community in the administrative set-up.\n\n\n141. Taken together, these are the main indicia which assist the Court in\n\n     determining who established an educational institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_383\">Article 30.</a>\n\n     However, the complex nature of establishing an educational institution is not\n\n     lost on us. Undoubtedly, there can be no straitjacket formula which may be\n\n     applied. The above indicia of establishment must be considered as a whole,\n\n     along with any relevant facts which are available to the Court. The matter\n\n     must be considered in totality and competing factors must be weighed against\n\n     each other depending on the facts and circumstances of each institution.\n\n\n142. The above indicia must be proved through the submission of cogent material.\n\n     Reliance must be placed on primary sources such as office documents, letters\n\n     and resolutions or memorandums issued to implement the resolutions.\n\n     Secondary sources must only be used to corroborate the primary sources.\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 102 of 118\n\f                                                                            PART E\n\n     The onus to prove that the educational institution was established by a\n\n     minority is on the claimants.\n\n\n143. One of the questions referred to this Bench was whether <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_384\">Article 30(1)</a>\n\n     envisages an institution which is established by minorities alone without\n\n     participation from any other community? This question was based on the facts\n\n     as observed by this Court in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) where some\n\n     persons from communities other than the Muslim community had contributed\n\n     to the establishment of the educational institution. That case has been finally\n\n     adjudicated and the issues which arose in it do not survive. Nothing in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_385\">Article\n\n     30</a> prevents some persons from other communities in contributing to the\n\n     establishment of an institution by a minority. There may be persons hailing\n\n     from different communities who are concerned about the need for minority\n\n     educational institutions and lend their assistance in some form – be it by\n\n     contributing monies or otherwise. Their participation and involvement would\n\n     not preclude <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_386\">Article 30</a> from being applicable to such institutions provided that\n\n     the minority community continues to shoulder the core of the responsibility of\n\n     establishing an educational institution.\n\n\n     vi.   Impact of Entry 63 of List I on the minority status of educational\n\n           institutions\n\n\n144. Entry 63 of the Union List to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution deals\n\n     with the institutions known at the commencement of the Constitution as\n\n     Benares Hindu University, Aligarh Muslim University and Delhi University.\n\n     Notably, the entry also indicates that Parliament may enact laws which pertain\n\n\n                                                                       Page 103 of 118\n\f                                                                                                  PART E\n\n      to any other institutions which are declared by law to be institutions of national\n\n      importance.124\n\n\n145. Entry 63 of List I had its genesis in Entry 13 of <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_387\">List I to the Seventh Schedule\n\n      to the Government of India Act</a> 1935. Entry 13 read as “Benares Hindu\n\n      University and the Aligarh Muslim University”. Entry 17 of List II read as\n\n      “Educations including Universities other than those specified in paragraph 13\n\n      of List I”. The Federal Legislature had the power to enact laws with respect to\n\n      BHU and AMU while the Provincial Legislatures had the power to enact laws\n\n      to establish new Universities and amend the legislation through which\n\n      Universities were established and/or incorporated, except for the laws relating\n\n      to AMU and BHU.125\n\n\n146. The Constitution of India adopted a similar model of division of legislative\n\n      power as regards the subject at hand. The State Legislature had the power\n\n      to enact laws with respect to education, including Universities by virtue of\n\n      Entry 11 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. This power was\n\n      subject to Entries 63,64 and 65 of List I and Entry 25 of List III. <a href=\"/doc/124607337/\" id=\"a_388\">By the\n\n      Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Act</a> 1973, Entry 63 was amended to\n\n      include the University established in pursuance of Article 371-E126.127\n\n      Subsequently, by the <a href=\"/doc/50073852/\" id=\"a_389\">Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act</a> 1976,\n\n\n124\n     Entry 63: “The institutions known at the commencement of this Constitution as the Benares Hindu\nUniversity, the Aligarh Muslim University and the Delhi University, and any other institution declared by\nParliament by law to be an institution of national importance.”\n125\n    <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_390\">The Government of India Act</a> 1935, Section 100\n126\n    <a href=\"/doc/371998/\" id=\"a_391\">Article 371-A</a> Establishment of Central University in Andhra Pradesh.- Parliament may by law provide for\nthe establishment of a University in the State of Andhra Pradesh.\n127\n     Entry 63 subsequent to the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/124607337/\" id=\"a_392\">Constitution (Thirty-second Amendment) Act</a> 1973: “The\ninstitutions known at the commencement of this Constitution as the Benares Hindu University, the Aligarh\nMuslim University and the Delhi University; the University established in pursuance of <a href=\"/doc/87434/\" id=\"a_393\">Article 371-E</a> any other\ninstitution declared by Parliament by law to be an institution of national importance.”\n\n                                                                                            Page 104 of 118\n\f                                                                                               PART E\n\n      Entry 11 of List II was deleted and a similar subject was placed in Entry 25 of\n\n      List III128. Both Entry 11 of List II (prior to its omission) and Entry 25 of List III\n\n      (as it currently stands) were made subject to the provisions of Entries 63, 64\n\n      and 65 of List I. The effect of this was that Parliament retained the exclusive\n\n      power to legislate upon AMU, BHU and Delhi University in Entry 63 of List I\n\n      and the subjects which fall within the scope of Entries 64 and 65\n\n      notwithstanding the broader or more general entries in the Seventh Schedule\n\n      which include Universities.\n\n\n147. <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_394\">In the Government of India Act</a> 1935, the Federal Legislature only had the\n\n      power to legislate upon AMU and BHU. However, the scope of Parliament’s\n\n      legislative domain over education and Universities was enlarged in the\n\n      Constitution of India. In addition to Entry 63, Parliament also has the power\n\n      to legislate upon educational institutions which fall within the ambit of Entries\n\n      64 and 65. Entry 64 deals with institutions of scientific or technical education\n\n      financed by the Government of India wholly or in part and declared by\n\n      Parliament by law to be institutions of national importance. Entry 65 deals with\n\n      Union agencies and institutions for (i) professional, vocational or technical\n\n      training, including the training of police officers; (ii) the promotion of special\n\n      studies or research; and (iii) scientific or technical assistance in the\n\n      investigation or detection of crime. Thus, Entries 64 and 65 deal with\n\n      institutions which provide education in specific fields. Another crucial point is\n\n      that by virtue of Entries 63 and 64, Parliament has the power to legislate upon\n\n\n\n128\n    Entry 25: “Education, including technical education, medical education and universities, subject to the\nprovisions of Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I; vocational and technical training of labour.”\n\n                                                                                         Page 105 of 118\n\f                                                                               PART E\n\n    institutions which are declared by law to be institutions of national importance.\n\n    While Entry 64 provides broad criteria for declaring an institution to be of\n\n    national importance, <a href=\"/doc/694525/\" id=\"a_395\">Article 63</a> does not contain similar indicia.\n\n\n148. The question is whether the inclusion of a University as an institution of\n\n    ‘national’ importance amounts to an abrogation of its minority character. The\n\n    declaration of an institution as one of national importance does not amount to\n\n    a change in the minority character of the institution. This is for multiple\n\n    reasons. First, Entries in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule delineate the\n\n    legislative competence of Parliament and of the legislatures of the States. As\n\n    discussed in the preceding sections of this judgment, the State may regulate\n\n    various aspects of education and educational institutions. The field of\n\n    legislative competence over universities does not amount to a surrender of\n\n    minority character. The distribution of legislative competence between\n\n    Parliament and the State legislatures does not bear upon the minority\n\n    character of the institution. Second, as a matter of principle, nothing prevents\n\n    a minority educational institution from being an institution of national\n\n    importance. The qualities denoted by the terms “national” and “minority” are\n\n    not at odds with each other nor are they mutually exclusive. The former\n\n    indicates that the institution has a pan-India or national character, as opposed\n\n    to relatively more local or regional institutions. It is indicative of the importance\n\n    of the institution on the national stage. The latter is evidence of the religious\n\n    or linguistic background of the founders and the constitutional rights which\n\n    vest in them. Each term indicates distinct attributes which are not antithetical\n\n    to one another. A university may well be both national and ergo, of national\n\n                                                                          Page 106 of 118\n\f                                                                                               PART E\n\n      importance, as well as minority in character. There is no reason why a minority\n\n      educational institution cannot also be an institution of national importance.\n\n      Third, Entries 63 and 64 provide Parliament with the power to declare an\n\n      institution to be of national importance. An interpretation that an institution of\n\n      national importance cannot be a minority institution would amount to\n\n      rendering the fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_396\">Article 30(1)</a> subservient to the\n\n      legislative power of Parliament. Parliament can in terms of Entries 63 and 64\n\n      declare any institution to be of national importance.129 If the submission of the\n\n      respondents is accepted, such a declaration would automatically exclude the\n\n      institution(s) from the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_397\">Article 30(1).</a>\n\n\n      vii.   The decision of this Court in Prof. Yashpal\n\n\n149. Question (d) formulated in these proceedings requires the Court to assess\n\n      whether the decision in Prof. Yashpal (supra) has a bearing on the other\n\n      questions and if so, in what manner. It is therefore necessary to advert to the\n\n      facts and decision in that case.

This was in violation of <a href=\"/doc/240466/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 22</a>\n\n          of the UGC Act as well as the Schedule;\n\n\n     e.   These universities were offering professional courses without obtaining\n\n          permission or approval from regulatory bodies such as the All India\n\n          Council of Technical Education, Medical Council of India and Dental\n\n          Council of India; and\n\n\n\n                                                                    Page 108 of 118\n\f                                                                                                   PART E\n\n      f.     These universities conferred degrees without obtaining the requisite\n\n             permission from statutory bodies. These degrees would not be\n\n             recognised by professional organisations or other employers. The\n\n             students who were awarded such degrees would therefore not only\n\n             suffer financially but would also have lost the time spent completing\n\n             these courses.\n\n\n151. In response, the State of Chhattisgarh submitted that it was competent to\n\n      enact the statute under challenge in view of Entry 32 of List II of the Seventh\n\n      Schedule to the Constitution131. It argued that the universities were\n\n      established on the basis of the representations made by the sponsoring body\n\n      as set out in the project reports. However, it admitted that some of these\n\n      universities did not meet the minimum standards expected of educational\n\n      institutions, giving rise to serious concerns about the academic interest of the\n\n      students. It stated that it therefore amended the <a href=\"/doc/68163505/\" id=\"a_410\">Chhattisgarh Act</a> in 2004.\n\n      After the amendments, a large number of universities were de-notified\n\n      because they failed to comply with the amended statute. Finally, it argued that\n\n      the writ petitions ought to be dismissed because the concerns raised in them\n\n      no longer subsisted after the amendments in 2004 and the consequent\n\n      denotification of many universities.\n\n\n152. This Court analysed the relevant entries in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule\n\n      to the Constitution as well as the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_411\">UGC Act</a> and held that <a href=\"/doc/1261645/\" id=\"a_412\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1773201/\" id=\"a_413\">6</a> of\n\n\n\n131\n   “32. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of corporations, other than those specified in List I, and\nuniversities; unincorporated trading, literary, scientific, religious and other societies and associations; co-\noperative societies.”\n\n                                                                                            Page 109 of 118\n\f                                                                       <a href=\"/doc/68163505/\" id=\"a_414\">PART E\n\nChhattisgarh Act</a> were ultra vires the Constitution and liable to be struck down\n\nfor the following reasons:\n\n\na.   The term “university” occurring in the three Lists of the Seventh\n\n     Schedule must mean an institution with adequate facilities and\n\n     resources for advanced learning and research. The standard of teaching\n\n     and education must be such as would befit a university. The power\n\n     conferred on state legislatures with respect to the incorporation of\n\n     universities must be exercised only with respect to institutions which\n\n     would in substance amount to universities. <a href=\"/doc/68163505/\" id=\"a_415\">The Chhattisgarh Act</a> did not\n\n     provide for the establishment of universities in the true sense. Rather, it\n\n     conferred the legal status of a university to mere institutions or project\n\n     reports and permitted them to issue degrees. In doing so, it clothed an\n\n     institute which is not a university and cannot amount to a university\n\n     (because of a lack of infrastructure and resources) with the juristic\n\n     personality of a university. This is not contemplated either by Entry 32 of\n\n     List II or Entry 25 of List III. <a href=\"/doc/78746609/\" id=\"a_416\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/31717557/\" id=\"a_417\">6</a> of the Chhattisgarh Act\n\n     were a fraud on the Constitution;\n\n\nb.   Although Entry 32 of List II and Entry 25 of List III empower the state\n\n     legislatures to enact laws concerning the incorporation of universities,\n\n     the whole gamut of the university including teaching, quality of\n\n     education, curriculum and examinations, would not come within the\n\n     purview of the state legislature because of Entry 66 of List I. Entry 66 of\n\n     List I concerns the coordination and determination of standards in\n\n\n\n                                                                  Page 110 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\n          institutions for higher education or research and scientific and technical\n\n          institutions. Parliament alone is competent to enact legislation which\n\n          pertains to Entry 66 of List I. The UGC Act was enacted in pursuance of\n\n          this entry;\n\n\n     c.   A statute enacted by the state legislature which stultifies or has the effect\n\n          of nullifying a statute validly enacted by Parliament would be ultra vires.\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/68163505/\" id=\"a_418\">The Chhattisgarh Act</a> made it impossible for the UGC to perform its\n\n          duties and to ensure the coordination and determination of standards in\n\n          terms of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_419\">UGC Act</a>; and\n\n\n     d.   The expression “established or incorporated” in <a href=\"/doc/603538/\" id=\"a_420\">Sections 2(f)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/240466/\" id=\"a_421\">22</a> and <a href=\"/doc/248832/\" id=\"a_422\">23</a>\n\n          of the UGC Act must be read as “established and incorporated” insofar\n\n          as private universities are concerned. This is necessary in order to give\n\n          effect to the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_423\">UGC Act</a>.\n\n\n153. The decision of this Court in Prof. Yashpal (supra) will not have a bearing on\n\n     this case for the following reasons:\n\n\n     a.   The interpretation of a statutory provision cannot influence the\n\n          interpretation of a provision of the Constitution. The Constitution is the\n\n          basic or fundamental law of the country. It controls all other laws;\n\n\n     b.   The decision in Prof. Yashpal (supra) was rendered in the context of\n\n          institutions which were given the status of universities by the operation\n\n          of law but which existed only on paper, without any facilities, and offered\n\n          some courses which were not approved by the relevant authorities. The\n\n\n                                                                        Page 111 of 118\n\f                                                                                 PART E\n\n              purpose of this Court reading “established or incorporated” as\n\n              “established and incorporated” was to prevent such institutions from\n\n              being given the status of universities in the absence of essential features\n\n              of universities. It was to ensure that institutions which were accorded the\n\n              status of universities existed in actuality; and\n\n\n         c.   The distinction between the meaning of the term ‘establish’ and that of\n\n              the term ‘incorporate’ was not effaced by this interpretation. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_424\">Article 30</a>\n\n              uses the word ‘establish.’ The indicia for determining whether an\n\n              institution is a minority educational institution for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_425\">Article\n\n              30</a> would depend only upon whether the minority community in question\n\n              established the educational institution.\n\n\n         viii. The amendment of the <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_426\">NCMEI Act</a> in 2010\n\n\n154. <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_427\">The NCMEI Act</a> was enacted in 2004 to constitute a National Commission for\n\n         minority educational institutions and to provide for matters connected or\n\n         incidental to it. <a href=\"/doc/1221603/\" id=\"a_428\">Section 3</a> mandates the constitution of the National\n\n         Commission For Minority Educational Institutions.132 <a href=\"/doc/1490948/\" id=\"a_429\">Section 11</a> details the\n\n         functions of the Commission which include advising the Central or State\n\n         governments on questions related to the education of minorities which may\n\n         be referred to it; suo motu enquiries or enquiries based on petitions instituted\n\n         by minority educational institutions; and intervening in proceedings before\n\n         courts (with the leave of the court) which concern the deprivation or violation\n\n         of the educational rights of minorities. <a href=\"/doc/73361/\" id=\"a_430\">Section 12</a> empowers the Commission\n\n\n132\n      “Commission”\n\n                                                                            Page 112 of 118\n\f                                                                                                PART E\n\n         to adjudicate disputes between a minority educational institution and\n\n         university regarding affiliation and confers upon it the power of a civil court\n\n         trying a suit in certain matters. Section 12B empowers the Commission to\n\n         hear appeals against orders of authorities established by the Central or State\n\n         governments, which reject applications for the grant of minority status filed by\n\n         educational institutions. The Commission also has other powers.133 <a href=\"/doc/522578/\" id=\"a_431\">Section\n\n         10</a> prescribes the procedure to establish a minority educational institution. In\n\n         terms of the provision, any person who desires to establish a minority\n\n         educational institution has to apply to the competent authority for the grant of\n\n         a no objection certificate for the purpose. The competent authority would upon\n\n         the perusal of documents, affidavits or other evidence and after giving the\n\n         applicant an opportunity to be heard either allow or reject the application.\n\n\n155. <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_432\">The NCMEI Act</a> was amended in 2010.134\n\n\n156. <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_433\">Section 2(g)</a> defined a ‘minority educational institution’ as reproduced below:\n\n\n                             “(g) “Minority educational institution” means a\n                             college or institution (other than a University)\n                             established or maintained by a person or group of\n                             persons from amongst the minorities;”\n\n\n         In 2010, <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_434\">Section 2(g)</a> was amended to read as follows:\n\n\n                             “(g) “Minority educational institution” means a\n                             college or an educational institution established and\n                             administered by a minority or minorities;”\n\n\n\n\n133\n      <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_435\">Sections 12D</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_436\">12E</a>, NCMEI Act.\n134\n      See the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (Amendment) Act 2010.\n\n                                                                                          Page 113 of 118\n\f                                                                            PART E\n\n157. Two material changes were made to <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_437\">Section 2(g)</a> in 2010. The first was the\n\n     removal of the words “other than a University” from the definition. <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_438\">The NCMEI\n\n     Act</a> did not extend to universities prior to 2010. The amendment in that year\n\n     widened the ambit of the Act and made its provisions applicable to minority\n\n     universities as well. The second change was the replacement of the term\n\n     “established or maintained” with “established and administered.” The\n\n     amendment in 2010 to the definition of a minority educational institution in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1374757/\" id=\"a_439\">Section 2(g)</a> cannot impact the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_440\">Article 30(1).</a> In the preceding\n\n     sections, we have held that establishment by a minority is the only indicia for\n\n     a minority educational institution. <a href=\"/doc/143777/\" id=\"a_441\">Section 10</a> of the NCMEI Act recognises this\n\n     by prescribing the procedure to ‘establish’ a minority educational institution.\n\n     The amendment to the definition of a minority educational education in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/603538/\" id=\"a_442\">Section 2(f)</a> only recognises the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_443\">Article 30(1).</a> It\n\n     recognises that a minority educational institution once established is also\n\n     administered by them.\n\n\n     ix.   Registration under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_444\">Societies Registration Act</a>\n\n\n158. The question is whether a minority educational institution which is registered\n\n     as a society under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_445\">Societies Registration Act</a> soon after its establishment\n\n     loses its status as a minority educational institution by virtue of such\n\n     registration.\n\n\n159. As discussed in Section B of this judgment, this question was referred to a\n\n     larger Bench by this Court in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra). This question\n\n     was referred because the institution in that case was founded in 1938 and\n\n\n                                                                       Page 114 of 118\n\f                                                                            PART F\n\n     was registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_446\">Societies Registration Act</a> in 1940. The judgment in\n\n     Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) has been rendered and the case has been\n\n     disposed of. This judgment will therefore not have a bearing on that case.\n\n     Moreover, the parties in the present proceedings have not addressed this\n\n     Court as to question (c) nor does the question have a bearing on the other\n\n     questions referred. In these circumstances, we are of the opinion that this\n\n     question is not required to be answered.\n\n\nF.   Conclusion\n\n\n160. In view of the above discussion, the following are our conclusions:\n\n\n     a.   The reference in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya (supra) of the correctness of\n\n          the decision in Azeez Basha (supra) was valid. The reference was within\n\n          the parameters laid down in Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra\n\n          Community (supra);\n\n\n     b.   <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_447\">Article 30(1)</a> can be classified as both an anti-discrimination provision\n\n          and a special rights provision. A legislation or an executive action which\n\n          discriminates against religious or linguistic minorities in establishing or\n\n          administering educational institutions is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_448\">Article 30(1).</a> This is\n\n          the anti-discrimination reading of the provision. Additionally, a linguistic\n\n          or religious minority which has established an educational institution\n\n          receives the guarantee of greater autonomy in administration. This is the\n\n          ‘special rights’ reading of the provision;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       Page 115 of 118\n\f                                                                           PART F\n\nc.    Religious or linguistic minorities must prove that they established the\n\n      educational institution for the community to be a minority educational\n\n      institution for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_449\">Article 30(1);</a>\n\n\nd.    The right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_450\">Article 30(1)</a> is applicable to universities\n\n      established before the commencement of the Constitution;\n\n\ne.    The right under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_451\">Article 30(1)</a> is guaranteed to minorities as defined upon\n\n      the commencement of the Constitution. A different right-bearing group\n\n      cannot be identified for institutions established before the adoption of the\n\n      Constitution;\n\n\nf.    The incorporation of the University would not ipso facto lead to\n\n      surrendering of the minority character of the institution. The\n\n      circumstances surrounding the conversion of a teaching college to a\n\n      teaching university must be viewed to identify if the minority character of\n\n      the institution was surrendered upon the conversion. The Court may on\n\n      a holistic reading of the statutory provisions relating to the administrative\n\n      set-up of the educational institution deduce if the minority character or\n\n      the purpose of establishment was relinquished upon incorporation; and\n\n\n\n\ng.        The following are the factors which must be used to determine if a\n\n          minority ‘established’ an educational institution:\n\n\n     i.        The indicia of ideation, purpose and implementation must be\n\n               satisfied. First, the idea for establishing an educational institution\n\n\n                                                                      Page 116 of 118\n\f                                                                             PART F\n\n               must have stemmed from a person or group belonging to the\n\n               minority community; second, the educational institution must be\n\n               established predominantly for the benefit of the minority\n\n               community; and third, steps for the implementation of the idea must\n\n               have been taken by the member(s) of the minority community; and\n\n\n        ii.    The administrative-set up of the educational institution must\n\n               elucidate and affirm (I) the minority character of the educational\n\n               institution; and (II) that it was established to protect and promote\n\n               the interests of the minority community.\n\n\n161. The view taken in Azeez Basha (supra) that an educational institution is not\n\n     established by a minority if it derives its legal character through a statute, is\n\n     overruled. The questions referred are answered in the above terms. The\n\n     question of whether AMU is a minority educational institution must be decided\n\n     based on the principles laid down in this judgment.

BACKGROUND\n     A.    History of minority rights\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">     4.    The basis of defining the term ‘minorities’ and bestowing associated\n           rights on them have varied significantly across different eras and\n           regions. Indicators such as religion, nationality, ethnicity, and race\n           frequently emerge as markers of minority status across the world. In\n           contrast, the Indian perspective on minorities is broadly categorized as\n           religious and linguistic minorities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">     A.1. Global history of minority rights\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">     5.    The idea of minority rights can generally be traced back to the ‘Peace of\n           Westphalia’, a set of treaties concluded in the mid-17th century, which\n           sought to give rights to certain religious minorities in newly ceded\n           territories post-war.5 Hence, globally, the concept of minority rights\n           broadly emerged along the fault lines of religion.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">     5 Jennifer Jackson Preece, “Minority rights in Europe: from Westphalia to Helsinki” Review of\n\n     International Studies (1997), Vol. 23, pp. 75–92; Joseph B. Kelly, “National Minorities in\n     International Law”, Denv. J. Int&#x27;l L. &amp; Pol&#x27;y, (1973) Vol. 3, pp. 253; Liebich, Andre. “Minority\n     as Inferiority: Minority Rights in Historical Perspective” Review of International Studies,\n     (2008) Vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 243–63.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                                                   4</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\f6.    However, the focus on religion changed subsequently with the rise of\n      nationalism in Europe. Since national identities emerged as the\n      primary means of distinguishing insiders from outsiders, the concept of\n      minorities in different instruments—such as the 1815 <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_466\">Final Act</a> of\n      Congress of Vienna—was defined in terms of national groups. 6\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">7.    As national identities began to take shape, the notion of minority rights\n      became increasingly intertwined with the quest for international\n      legitimacy. By the time of the 1878 Congress of Berlin, the question of\n      minorities had become a crucial factor in the emergence of new nation-\n      states beyond Western Europe. These States, requiring international\n      recognition, were accordingly required to demonstrate a willingness to\n      comply with a ‘standard of civilization’, which included the protection of\n      minority rights.7 This was not merely a moral obligation but a strategic\n      tool for gaining acceptance within the global community. Nations such\n      as Greece, for example, were compelled by powers like France, Great\n      Britain, and Russia to uphold minority rights as a condition for their\n      recognition and support.8\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">8.    This momentum of bestowing rights to minorities continued to gain\n      further traction across Europe. For instance, Hungary&#x27;s Parliament first\n      proclaimed minority rights in July 1849, 9 followed by their formal\n      codification into Austrian law in 1867. Similarly, Belgium joined the\n      movement in 1898. Although this era did not achieve universal respect\n      for minority rights, it marked a pivotal shift, with these categories of\n      rights increasingly taking centre stage in international negotiations and\n      settlements, particularly in the aftermath of conflicts.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">6 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">7 G.

The mid-19th century also witnessed the gradual upliftment of\n      historically-oppressed groups, such as the African-Americans, who\n      constituted the largest minority in the United States. The American\n      Civil War of the 1860s culminated in the issuance of the Emancipation\n      Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. This landmark decree\n      effectively abolished slavery and guaranteed freedom to all African-\n      Americans. This progress was further bolstered by the 14th Amendment\n      of 1868, which granted various civil rights to all citizens. 10\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">10. This trajectory of liberation extended into the early 20th century, with\n      the League of Nations making the establishment of a minority state\n      system one of its key priorities. The new Nation-States that emerged in\n      East-Central Europe post-1919 were so ethnographically diverse that\n      recognising minority rights became essential. The victorious powers\n      understood that ethnic dissatisfaction with the territorial status quo\n      could potentially escalate into domestic and even international violence.\n      Thus, the rights of minorities became a prerequisite for independence,\n      as well as a condition for war reparations or admission into the League\n      of Nations. A notable example is the Polish Minority Treaties of 1918,\n      which granted special and presumably temporary rights in areas such\n      as education, allowing minorities to read and learn their preferred\n      languages. 11\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">11. The growing significance of minority rights during this period is further\n      exemplified      by    several    cases     before     the    Permanent       Court     of\n      International Justice (PCIJ). In a 1923 case of the Rights of Minorities\n      in Upper Silesia, the PCIJ affirmed that individuals should have the\n      autonomy to decide their minority affiliation.12 Similarly, in the 1930\n      Greco-Bulgarian communities case, the PCIJ emphasized the rights\n\n\n10 Holloway, Jonathan Scott, “Civilization, race, and the politics of uplift”, African American\n\nHistory: A Very Short Introduction, Chapter 4, (Oxford University Press) (2023).\n11 Treaty of Peace with Poland [Polish Minorities Treaty], (adopted on 28 June 1919).\n12 Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia (Germ. v.

In this manner, the historical development of minority rights from the\n     16th to 20th centuries illustrates a progressively advancing standard of\n     rights accorded to these groups. Initially, minority status was primarily\n     defined by religious affiliation; however, over time, nationality and\n     linguistic identity became key criteria. This evolution reflects a broader\n     international understanding of minority groups. There have been\n     instances where the dominant majority has also actively sought to\n     empower these minorities, highlighting the complex interplay between\n     oppression and advocacy throughout history.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">A.2.

The trailing analysis put forth hereinabove sets the context to hereafter\n     understand the Indian experience with minority rights.

As a melting pot of cultures, India is home to a diverse array of different\n     communities. One such example is the Parsis, who came to India from\n     Persia—escaping persecution by the then Arab conquerors—and have\n     since    established     themselves      as   one    of   the    most    prosperous\n     communities in India. 15 Another important minority is the Sikhs, who\n     follow Sikhism, which “is believed to be a deep synthesis of divine\n     virtues, ceaseless, remembrance, relentless service of mankind, equality\n     of mind, and ephemeral nature of the world besides the defiance of\n     tyranny and fighting for righteousness”.16 These instances, among\n     others, provide ample historical evidence supporting India’s tradition of\n     tolerance, as embodied in the notion of &#x27;Vasudeva Kutumbakam’, 17\n     where all communities have flourished and seamlessly integrated into\n     Indian culture.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43587527\" id=\"span_15\">15. It was only with the advent of British rule in India that longstanding\n     religious, caste, linguistic and regional ethnic tribal entities that had\n     existed in India for centuries began to receive renewed scrutiny.18 The\n     late 19th century, particularly after the Revolt of 1857, saw an\n     increasing incorporation of Indians into the colonial government. This\n     increasing     inclusion     of   Indians     in    British     institutions   forced\n     imperialists to address how Indians were to be represented, leading to\n     the concept of group-based representation. 19 They were initially defined\n     by religious terms—evident in the first Indian Census of 1872, which\n     classified Indians by religion—the representation later expanded to\n     include caste and racial categories.

History indicates that during the British Rule, Hindi was sought to be\n     projected as the language of the majority community. 21 In this vein, the\n     British decided to introduce the permissive use of the Devanagari script\n     in the Courts of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, with a view to\n     undermine the influence of the Mughal elites. 22 From the late 19th\n     century onwards, there seemed to be murmurs against the perceived\n     imposition of Hindi language, in regions where other languages were\n     spoken.     These concerns were          endeavoured to be redressed by\n     reorganising and carving out new States, predominantly on linguistic\n     considerations, such as, for instance, the division of the States of Bihar\n     and Odisha.23\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">17. The reorganization of the States based on linguistic differences gained\n     momentum with the appointment of the Indian Statutory Commission,\n     and subsequently, in April 1938, when a resolution was passed by the\n     Madras      Legislative   Assembly,      unsuccessfully      recommending        the\n     establishment      of   four   new    Provinces     from   the    former    Madras\n     Presidency. Ultimately, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 enabled the\n     division of States on a linguistic basis, aligning administrative\n     boundaries with the linguistic identities of the population.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">20 Sumit Mukherjee, “Conceptualisation and Classification of Caste and Tribe by the Census\n\nof India,” Journal of the Anthropological Survey of India, (2013), Vol. 62 no. 2 pp.807.\n21 Tariq Rahman, “Punjabi Language during British Rule,” International Journal of Punjab\n\nStudies (2007).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">22 Amit Ranjan, “How Hindi came to dominate India” The Diplomat, (06 May, 2017) available\n\nat https://thediplomat.com/2017/05/how-hindi-came-to-dominate-india/.\n23 Fazal Ali, Report of the States Reorganisation Committee (1955), available at\n\nhttps://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/State%20Reorganisation%20Commisison%20\nReport%20of%201955_270614.pdf.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                        9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\f     A.2.2. The concept of religious minorities\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">18. In addition to linguistic minorities, the question of rights and privileges\n     for religious minorities also gained prominence. The genesis of this\n     category of minority rights in India can be traced back to the 1909\n     Morley-Minto       Constitutional      Reforms,     which      introduced    separate\n     electorates and reserved quotas to protect the interests of one of the\n     minority     communities       within    the    evolving    political   framework. 24\n     Following this development, the British government extended similar\n     provisions to other communities, as well as the Depressed Classes,\n     thereby     institutionalizing     measures      for   their   representation      and\n     protection.25\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">19. Subsequently, political organisations seeking to leverage the 1919\n     Montagu-Chelmsford reforms played a crucial role in consolidating\n     minority identities. 26 The principle that eventually emerged for Indian\n     representation in colonial institutions was that minority groups should\n     be represented in proportion to their population size. 27 The primary\n     demand of these groups was to secure safeguards against potential\n     dominance by the Congress or the majority community in Indian\n     politics.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">20. The 1928 Simon Commission further solidified the foundation of\n     minority     rights    by   recommending        the    continuation     of   separate\n     electorates.28 At the same time, the 1928 Nehru Report, which\n     influenced the framing of a Constitution for India, laid great emphasis\n     on the safeguards of minorities. 29 However, in a significant departure\n\n\n24  Meetika Srivastava, “Evolution of the System of Public Administration in India from the\nPeriod 1858- 1950: A Detailed Study Highlighting the Major Landmarks in Administrative\nHistory Made During this Period” (2009), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=1482528.\n25 Dick Kooiman, “Communalism and Indian Princely States: A Comparison with British\n\nIndia” Economic and Political Weekly (1995) Vol. 30 No. 34 pp. 2123-2133.\n26 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">27 Francesca R.

However, these provisions sought to be incorporated under Part XIV\n     were short-lived.

The conflicts, violence, exploitation, general\n     public disorder and lawlessness during the migration exercise resulted\n     in the deaths of almost one million people, with an estimated\n     displacement of approximately ten to twenty million people.42\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">27. Naturally, the aftermath of these events sent shockwaves throughout\n     the country. It profoundly affected the Constituent Assembly and the\n     Drafting Committee, particularly in regard to the recognition of\n     communal minority rights. 43 Prior to the Partition, the Assembly had\n     granted religious reservations in legislative bodies. However, these\n     reservations were done away with post-Partition.44 The prevailing\n     sentiment was that such measures could foster separatist tendencies\n     and were inconsistent with the principles of a Secular Democratic\n     State. This view was also supported by various Muslim members of the\n     Constituent      Assembly. 45      For   instance,     Mohammad         Ismail    Khan\n     stated: 46\n               “[…] Because this reservation of seats would only keep\n               alive Communalism and would be ineffectual as a\n               safeguard for the Muslim minorities or for the matter\n               of that for any other minorities.

Brief history of AMU\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">41. The history of AMU begins after the founding of the Muhammaden\n     Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College at Aligarh in 1875 by Sir Syed Ahmad\n     Khan. It seems that by the year 1895, MAO College had begun to\n     experience considerable decline. It faced governmental pressure to\n     increase student fees and make examinations more difficult, leading to\n     a decrease in student enrolment and endowments. 53 The death of Sir\n     Syed in 1898 further intensified the situation, creating a sense of\n     distrust among the benefactors of the college and a power vacuum. 54\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">42. History further suggests that in 1898, the Sir Syed Memorial Fund was\n     created with the goal of raising funds to pay off the debts of the College\n     and to create an endowment to establish a university. The then\n     Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces is said to have\n     promised aid and support in the management of the College, provided\n     that there was a stable governing body for the same directly under\n     government supervision. The record further indicates that, by 1903, the\n     fund collection drive had raised enough money to meet the College’s\n     needs and restore its stability. 55\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">43. At the ‘All India Muhammadan Educational Conference’ in Calcutta, the\n     idea of establishing a university in Aligarh sparked significant\n     deliberations and gained momentum. Some proposed a pan-India,\n     affiliating   university,56     while    others    advocated      for   a   university\n\n\n53 Theodore Beck, “The Principal&#x27;s Annual Report for 1898—99” (&#x27;Principal&#x27;s Report),\n(1898—99), Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Magazine (Aligarh) (MAOCM), and Aligarh\nInstitute Gazette (Aligarh) (AIG), New Series VII, No. 11 (15 July 1899) (At this time the two\njournals were temporarily merged).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">54 Shamim Akhtar, “Aligarh: From College to University” Proceedings of the Indian History\n\nCongress (2018-19) Vol. 79, pp. 623.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">55 Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College Magazine (Aligarh) MAOCM, VII, (January 1899), pp.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">15-21.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">56 Rafiuddin Ahmad, &#x27;The Proposed Muslim University in India&#x27;, The Nineteenth Century,\n\nXLIV (1898), 915-21.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                                          19</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\f     completely in line with Muslim ideals, with mandatory religious\n     instruction and administration in consonance with Islamic principles. 57\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">44. However,      nothing    tangible   happened     on    the     ground   level   for\n     multifarious reasons. In early 1910, efforts to establish a university at\n     Aligarh resurfaced. Once the requisite funds had been collected, a\n     committee was established to draft the constitution for the proposed\n     university, designating the Viceroy as the chancellor and placing\n     governance in the hands of a Muslim Court of Trustees. The matter of\n     affiliation was cursorily mentioned only in the context of the powers of\n     approval    by   various    authorities.   Finally,   after    long    drawn-out\n     negotiations between relevant stakeholders, in September 1920, the\n     <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_522\">Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920</a> (AMU Act, 1920) was passed by\n     the Central Legislature of British India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_94\">C.1.

The\n     Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Act clearly\n     articulated its purpose: “to incorporate this University, to indicate its\n     functions, to create its governing bodies and to define their functions.” In\n     essence, the AMU Act, 1920 was focused on establishing the University\n     and making it operational by setting up its Governing Bodies and\n     outlining their respective functions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">46.

While this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_549\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) did not explicitly outline the\n    issues, a plain reading of the decision reveals the following key issues\n    that were broadly addressed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">    a.   Whether a ‘university’ established prior to the Constitution coming\n         into force could be construed to be an educational institution\n         included within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_550\">Article 30?</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">    b.

Since the conclusion of this\n    case forms the bedrock of the present challenge, it is essential to\n    discuss the key holdings of this judgment.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">65. In this regard, the Court held that to be a minority institution under\n    <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_555\">Article 30</a>, such an institution must have been both established and\n    administered by the minority community. In other words, it noted that\n    the test provided under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_556\">Article 30</a> is conjunctive, and an institution\n    cannot enjoy autonomy to such an extent unless it satisfies both the\n    prongs of establishment as well as administration by the minority\n    community. This Court thus opined that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">         “19. […] The Article in our opinion clearly shows that the\n         minority will have the right to administer educational\n         institutions of their choice provided they have established\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                         31</span>\n\f           them, but not otherwise. The article cannot be read, to mean\n           that even if the educational institution has been established\n           by somebody else, any religious minority would have the right\n           to administer it because, for some reason or other, it might\n           have been administering it before the Constitution came into\n           force.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_558\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) firstly observed that the term\n     ‘educational institution’ in the Constitution had a wide expanse, and\n     that universities, which would be institutions that could confer degrees,\n     would be covered under the wide import of this term. It further\n     observed that though some private universities in pre-Constitution\n     India did not have government recognition, this would not disentitle\n     them from being covered under the category of an ‘educational\n     institution’.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">68. Further, relying on the decision in In re the Kerala Education Bill,58\n     it held that if <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_559\">Article 30</a> were to be interpreted such that it covered only\n     educational institutions established after the coming into force of the\n     Constitution, it would rob <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_560\">Article 30</a> of its very meaning. In this vein, it\n     held as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">           “19. … The words “establish and administer” in the article\n           must be read conjunctively and so read it gives the right to the\n           minority to administer an educational institution provided it\n           has been established by it. In this connection our attention\n           was drawn to In re; The Kerala Education Bill, 1957 where, it\n           is argued, this Court had held that the minority can\n           administer an educational institution even though it might not\n\n58 In re the Kerala Education Bill, 1957, 1958 SCR 995.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                                              32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">\f         have established it. In that case an argument was raised\n         that under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_561\">Article 30(1)</a> protection was given only to\n         educational        institutions     established      after   the\n         Constitution came into force. That argument was\n         turned down by this Court for the obvious reason that if\n         that interpretation was given to <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_562\">Article 30(1)</a> it would be\n         robbed of much of its content. … It is true that at p. 1062\n         the Court spoke of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_563\">Article 30(1)</a> giving two rights to a minority\n         i.e. (i) to establish and (ii) to administer. But that was said\n         only in the context of meeting [t]he argument that educational\n         institutions established by minorities before the Constitution\n         came into force did not have the protection of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_564\">Article 30(1).</a> We\n         are of opinion that nothing <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_565\">in that case</a> justifies the contention\n         raised of behalf of the petitioners that the minorities would\n         have the right to administer an educational institution even\n         though the institution may not have been established by them.\n         …”\n\n                                                      [Emphasis supplied]\n\n    D.3.2 What is the meaning of the term ‘establish’ and whether AMU was\n    ‘established’ by the Muslim community?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_58\">69. The Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_566\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) interpreted the term ‘establish’ in\n    <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_567\">Article 30</a> to mean ‘to bring into existence.’ To determine whether AMU\n    was established by the Muslim community, the Court examined the\n    legal framework for the establishment of a university. It was found that\n    prior to independence, a private individual could create a university\n    independently, with State intervention only required for the purposes of\n    recognition of the degree conferred. In this context, it observed that\n    though Muslims had the option to establish a university without any\n    state involvement, they opted for State intervention to secure degree\n    recognition. Consequently, this Court concluded that AMU was\n    established vide the AMU Act, 1920, which was enacted by the then\n    Parliament. It therefore held that AMU was established by an act of the\n    Central Legislature and not by the Muslim community:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">         “22. There was nothing in 1920 to prevent the Muslim\n         minority, if it so chose, to establish a university; but if it did so\n         the degrees of such a university were not bound to be\n         recognised by Government. It may be that in the absence of\n         recognition of the degrees granted by a university, it may not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                                 33</span>\n\fhave attracted many students, and that is why we find that\nbefore the Constitution came into force, most of the\nuniversities in India were established by legislation. […] It is\nclear therefore that even though the Muslim minority could\nhave established at Aligarh in 1920 a university, it could not\ninsist that degrees granted by such a university should be\nrecognised by Government. Therefore, when the Aligarh\nUniversity was established in 1920 and by <a href=\"/doc/23509/\" id=\"a_568\">Section 6</a> its\ndegrees were recognised by Government, an institution was\nbrought into existence which could not be brought into\nexistence by any private individual or body for such individual\nor body could not insist upon the recognition of the degrees\nconferred by any university established by it. The enactment\nof <a href=\"/doc/23509/\" id=\"a_569\">Section 6</a> in the 1920. Act is a very important circumstance\nwhich shows that the Aligarh University when it came to be\nestablished in 1920 was not established by the Muslim\nminority, for the minority could not insist on the recognition by\nGovernment of the degrees conferred by any university\nestablished by it.”\n\n“26. […] But if the M.A.O. College was to be converted into a\nuniversity of the kind whose degrees were bound to be\nrecognised by Government, it would not be possible for those\nwho were in-charge of the M.A.O. College to do so. That is\nwhy the three institutions to which we have already referred\napproached the Government to bring into existence a\nuniversity whose degrees would be recognised by\nGovernment. The 1920 Act was then passed by the Central\nLegislature and the university of the type that was\nestablished thereunder, namely, one whose degrees would be\nrecognised by Government, came to be established. It was\nclearly brought into existence by the 1920 Act for it\ncould not have been brought into existence otherwise. It\nwas thus the Central Legislature which brought into\nexistence the Aligarh University and must be held to\nhave established it. It would not be possible for the Muslim\nminority to establish a university of the kind whose degrees\nwere bound to be recognised by Government and therefore it\nmust be held that the Aligarh University was brought into\nexistence by the Central Legislature and the\nGovernment of India. If that is so, the Muslim minority\ncannot claim to administer it, for it was not brought\ninto existence by it.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_570\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) then examined the AMU Act, 1920\n    in   greater   detail   and   determined that   the Act   did   not   grant\n    administrative control of the University to the Muslim community. It\n    observed that members of the AMU Court were elected by individuals\n    who made donations exceeding INR 500, a category which included\n    non-Muslims as well. Furthermore, the Lord Rector, who was the\n    Governor-General, held overriding powers concerning administrative\n    matters. Additionally, various bodies, such as the Executive Council\n    and the Academic Council, possessed significant authority over the\n    University&#x27;s affairs. Based on this analysis, the Court concluded that\n    AMU did not meet the administrative criteria required by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_571\">Article 30</a>\n    and, therefore could not be recognized as a minority institution:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">         “28. It appears from para 8 of the Schedule that even though\n         the members of the Court had to be Muslims, the electorates\n         were not exclusively Muslims. For example, sixty members of\n         the Court had to be elected by persons who had made or\n         would make donations of five hundred rupees and upwards to\n         or for the purposes of the University. Some of these persons\n         were and could be non-Muslims. Forty persons were to be\n         elected by the Registered Graduates of the University, and\n         some of the Registered Graduates were and could be non-\n         Muslims, for the University was open to all persons of either\n         sex and of whatever race, creed or class. Further fifteen\n         members of the Court were to be elected by the Academic\n         Council, the membership of which was not confined only to\n         Muslims.”\n         “29. Besides there were other bodies like the Executive\n         Council and the Academic Council which were concerned with\n         the administration of the Aligarh University and there was no\n         provision in the constitution of these bodies which confined\n         their members only to Muslims. It will thus be seen that\n         besides the fact that the members of the Court had to be\n         all Muslims, there was nothing in the Act to suggest\n         that the administration of the Aligarh University was in\n         the Muslim minority as such. Besides the above, we\n         have already referred to <a href=\"/doc/1816859/\" id=\"a_572\">Section 13</a> which showed how\n         the Lord Rector, namely, the Governor-General had\n         overriding powers over all matters relating to the\n         administration of the University. Then there was\n         <a href=\"/doc/1866052/\" id=\"a_573\">Section 14</a> which gave certain over-riding powers to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                            35</span>\n\f        Visiting Board. The Lord Rector was then the Viceroy\n        and the Visiting Board consisted of the Governor of the\n        United Provinces, the members of his Executive Council,\n        the Ministers, one member nominated by the Governor\n        and one member nominated by the Minister in charge of\n        Education. These people were not necessarily Muslims\n        and they had overriding powers over the administration\n        of the University. Then reference may be made to Section\n        28(2)(c) which laid down that no new statute or amendment or\n        repeal of an existing statute, made by the University, would\n        have any validity until it had been approved by the Governor-\n        General-in-Council who had power to sanction, disallow or\n        remit it for further consideration. Same powers existed in the\n        Governor-General-in-Council with respect to ordinances. Lastly\n        reference may be made to Section 40, which gave power to the\n        Governor-General-in-Council to remove any difficulty which\n        might arise in the establishment of the University. These\n        provisions in our opinion clearly show that the\n        administration was also not vested in the Muslim\n        minority; on the other hand it was vested in the\n        statutory bodies created by the 1920 Act, and only in\n        one of them, namely, the Court, there was a bar to the\n        appointment of any one else except a Muslim, though\n        even there some of the electors for some of the members\n        included non-Muslims. We are therefore of opinion that\n        the Aligarh University was neither established nor\n        administered by the Muslim minority and therefore\n        there is no question of any amendment to the 1920 Act\n        being unconstitutional under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_574\">Article 30(1)</a> for that\n        Article does not apply at all to the Aligarh University.”\n\n                                                 [Emphasis supplied]\n\n   D.3.4 Whether any other Articles of Part III were violated?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">71.

Whether <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_585\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution envisages an institution\n          which is established by minorities alone without the participation\n          for the factum of establishment from any other community?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_67\">ii.

Dr. Rajeev Dhavan, Mr. Kapil Sibal, Mr. Salman Khurshid, Mr. Nikhil\n          Nayyar, and Mr. Shadan Farasat, Learned Senior Advocates, appeared\n          for AMU. Their contentions are detailed hereinbelow:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_82\">a.   In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_601\">Article 30</a>, the term ‘minority’ means a\n               community    that   constitutes less than     fifty   percent   of   the\n               population in the State where the educational institution is\n               situated. This standard was <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_602\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/8064/\" id=\"a_603\">TMA Pai</a> (supra). Per\n               this standard, Muslims are a minority in the State of Uttar\n               Pradesh. Moreover, the status of Muslims as a minority was\n               evident even before the Constitution came into force, as they were\n               already being afforded reservation in legislative organs.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">          b.   To claim protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_604\">Article 30</a>, the minority community is\n               only required to prove that it established the institution. The\n               question of administration, on the other hand, is not relevant in\n               determining the minority character of an institution. It is a right\n               that flows once the institution is established as a minority\n               institution, thus making it a consequence and not a pre-requisite.\n               In other words, the test under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_605\">Article 30</a> is not conjunctive, and\n               the claimant is not required to necessarily prove that the\n               institution was being administered by the minority community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">          c.   The word ‘establish’ should be interpreted widely since it is the\n               only protection available to minorities. ‘Establishment’, under\n               <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_606\">Article 30</a>, is the meeting of minds of the community for the\n               purpose of taking forward the idea that ultimately results in the\n               university being set up. Thus, the genesis of the institution must\n               be considered while examining the word ‘established.’ In contrast,\n               the word ‘established’ used in the AMU Act, 1920 refers to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                                                    41</span>\n\f     recognition for incorporation and is not the same as the term\n     ‘establish’ used in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_607\">Article 30.</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">d.   The term ‘administration’ does not mean cent percent control over\n     the institution by the minority community. The State can prescribe\n     reasonable    regulations     for   the   management   of   minority\n     institutions. Administration merely requires overall control. The\n     minority community, in this regard, has the choice to ask others to\n     administer on their behalf.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">e.   Under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_608\">Article 30</a>, the term ‘establish’ requires the genesis of the\n     institution to be linked to the minority community. AMU meets\n     this criterion since it originated as MAO College, which was\n     established and administered by Muslims. The desire to convert\n     MAO College to AMU came from the Muslim community, having\n     gathered funds from the Muslim community. Further, AMU was\n     established with the desire of the Muslim community to have their\n     own university. Therefore, AMU can be said to have been\n     established by the Muslim community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">f.   The establishment of AMU was an exercise completed by the\n     Muslim community, and the AMU Act, 1920 merely conferred\n     statutory recognition to such an establishment. It was not a\n     creation of the Statute but was rather an acknowledgement by a\n     Statute. Merely because a university was incorporated through\n     State action cannot confer or take away from its nature, as every\n     juristic entity is a creation of State action.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">g.   The administration of AMU was also under the control of Muslims.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">     All members of the AMU Court were required to be Muslims, and\n     its powers were further strengthened by the 1981 Amendment Act.\n     The administration, which entails overall control, remains with the\n     Muslim community. Even if it were determined that external\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                                      42</span>\n\f         members had administrative roles, it would not jeopardize the\n         university&#x27;s    minority   status.   This   is   because   the   Muslim\n         community retains the right to reclaim administrative control, as\n         Fundamental Rights cannot be waived.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">    h.   Lastly, the Union of India (UOI) cannot be allowed to challenge its\n         own statutory enactment, i.e., 1981 Amendment Act. Such a\n         summersault in its stance cannot be permitted merely because of\n         a change in the political regime. Furthermore, the UOI has not\n         substantiated the reason for such a volte-face. Thus, its approach\n         lacks bona fides, and the UOI, particularly the Attorney General\n         for India, is obligated to defend such an act of Parliament. Hence,\n         it cannot take a stand against the minority status of AMU.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">    Respondents’ submissions:\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_143\">81.

Kumar, Mr. Vinay Navare,\n    Mr. Sridhar Potaraju and Ms. Archana P. Dave Learned Senior\n    Advocates, appeared on behalf of the Respondents. Their arguments are\n    detailed hereinbelow:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">    a.   A bench of two judges could not have directly referred the matter\n         to a bench composed of seven judges in Anjuman (supra) and as\n         such, the reference itself ought to be construed as bad in law.\n         Further, the reference only sought clarity on the definition of a\n         minority institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_609\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution and did\n         not include examination of whether AMU is a minority educational\n         institution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">    b.   Challenging the locus standi of the Appellant, it was argued that\n         Muslims    do    not   constitute    a   minority   community.   For    a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                                43</span>\n\f     community to be a minority, it should not just be numerically less\n     than the majority but should also be politically non-dominant. Per\n     this test, Muslims were a numerically larger group than the pre-\n     independence dominant class, i.e., Christians. Hence, Muslims do\n     not have the locus to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_610\">Article 30.</a> In any case, the\n     institutions that   were formed prior      to the coming      of   the\n     Constitution cannot claim minority status because there was no\n     such Fundamental Right when such institutions were created.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">c.   To claim protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_611\">Article 30</a>, the minority community\n     must prove that the institution was both established and is being\n     administered by the community. Merely proving that the minority\n     community established the institution is not enough to claim the\n     status of a minority institution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">d.   The word ‘establish’ in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_612\">Article 30</a> means bringing an institution\n     into existence. For this, the Court must see if the institution in its\n     legally operational form could have existed ‘but for’ the Statute. If\n     the Statute accorded legal operationalization to the institution, the\n     establishment would be attributed to the legislature and not the\n     minority community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">e.   The de facto position of the minority’s role in administration is\n     irrelevant to determining administration by a minority. The Court\n     must see various relevant indicia of administrative control,\n     including who controls the decisions regarding admission, levy of\n     fees, governing council, the appointment of staff, disciplinary\n     powers, and ordinances and statutes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">f.   The meaning of ‘establish’ in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_613\">Article 30</a> is bringing an institution\n     into existence. AMU was brought into existence by the then\n     Central Legislature, through the AMU Act, 1920. The Constituent\n     Assembly Debates also do not expressly identify AMU as a minority\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                        44</span>\n\f            institution within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_614\">Article 30.</a> This indicates that the\n            drafters intended to establish the university’s national character.\n            To this day, the UOI contributes over a thousand crores to AMU,\n            which has resulted in a complete metamorphosis of the university.\n            Finally, the Preamble to the AMU Act, 1920 reflects that AMU was\n            brought into existence by the Act and not by the Muslim\n            community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">       g.   The AMU Court only has residuary powers, not administrative\n            powers. There is no majority of Muslims in the AMU Court, as only\n            32 out of 180 or more members are Muslims. Except for the AMU\n            Court, no other body or authority is required to be Muslim.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">            Moreover, various administrative functions are vested with bodies\n            such as the Executive and Academic Councils and the Visitor,\n            which are characteristically governmental or external. Even if there\n            are a few Muslim members present in any of the bodies, it was\n            simply an initiative by the State to instil confidence in the\n            community and to ensure their participatory role without giving\n            them   any   significant   control.   Hence,    AMU       is   not   being\n            administered by the Muslim community.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_145\">       h.   The contention that the Attorney General for India must defend\n            the 1981 Amendment Act is flawed, especially when the same does\n            not exist in the eyes of law—the same having been struck down by\n            the Allahabad High Court. Regardless, the present dispute is not\n            limited to   inter se the parties,      but    involves    questions of\n            constitutional interpretation and national importance. Hence, the\n            primary duty of the UOI is to assist the Court and not to defend an\n            amendment in the Act, which is per se unconstitutional.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">III.

If\n           not, whether the recognition of a university by a Statute amounts to\n           establishment by the Legislature? and (c) Is there any conflict in the\n           opinions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_622\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) vis-à-vis <a href=\"/doc/564368/\" id=\"a_623\">Prof.\n           Yashpal</a> (supra) and the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_624\">NCMEI Act</a>?</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">      V.

The issue concerning the power of a regular bench to refer a matter to a\n      larger bench must be examined in light of the order passed in Anjuman\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                                47</span>\n\f    (supra),   which    opined     that   <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_627\">Azeez    Basha</a>      (supra)    required\n    reconsideration by a larger bench and proceeded to refer it to a seven-\n    judge bench. To this end, the Respondents have vehemently contended\n    that such reference was bad in law and should be declared so.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_157\">84. In this vein, we have identified two key aspects of this issue: (i) what\n    were the issues identified in Anjuman (supra) which were intended for\n    the larger bench to address; and (ii) whether the manner of making\n    such a reference was legally sound.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">F.1. Issues that were intended to be addressed by the larger bench\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">85. At the outset, it is crucial to determine whether the bench in Anjuman\n    (supra) intended to restrict the reference in such a way that the seven-\n    judge bench would only analyse the criteria necessary for an institution\n    to qualify as a minority institution under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_628\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.\n    For the sake of clarity and despite the risk of repetition, we find it\n    essential to put forth the relevant extract from the observations made\n    in Anjuman (supra):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_93\">“After hearing counsel for the Parties, we are clearly of the\n            opinion that this case involves two substantial questions\n            regarding the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_629\">Article 30(1)</a> of the\n            Constitution of India. The present institution was founded in\n            the year 1938 and registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_630\">Societies\n            Registration Act</a> in the year 1940. The documents relating to\n            the time when the institution was founded clearly shows\n            that while the institution was established mainly by the\n            Muslim community but there were members 5 from the non-\n            Muslim community also who participated in the\n            establishment process. The point that arises is as to whether\n            Act. 30(1) of the Constitution envisages an institution which\n            is established by minorities alone without the participation\n            for the factum of establishment from any other community.\n            On this point, there is no clear decision of this court. There\n            are some observations in S. Azeez Basha &amp; ors. Vs. Union of\n            India 1968(1) SCR 333, but these observations can be\n            explained away: Another point that arises is whether soon\n            after the establishment of the institution if it is registered as\n            a Society under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_631\">Society Registration Act</a>, its status as a\n            minority institution changes in view of the broad principles\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                                48</span>\n\f           laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_632\">S. Azeez Basha</a>&#x27;s case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_95\">Even as it is several\n           jurists including Mr. Seervai have expressed about the\n           correctness of the decision of this court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_633\">S. Azeez\n           Basha</a>&#x27;s case. Since the point has arisen in this case\n           we think that this is a proper occasion when a larger\n           bench can consider the entire aspect fully.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_96\">We,\n           therefore, direct that this case may be placed before\n           Hon. The Chief Justice for being heard by a bench of\n           at least 7 judges so that <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_634\">S. Azeez Basha</a>&#x27;s case may\n           also be considered and the points that arise in this\n           case directly as to the essential conditions or\n           ingredients of the minority institution may also be\n           decided once for all. A large number of. jurists including\n           Mr. Seervai, learned counsel for the petitioners Mr. Garg and\n           learned counsel for respondents and interveners Mr. Dikshit\n           and Kaskar have stated that this case requires\n           reconsideration. In view of the urgency it is necessary that\n           the matter should be decided as early as possible we give\n           liberty to the counsel for parties to mention the matter before\n           Chief Justice.”\n                                                    [Emphasis supplied]</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_97\">86. A plain reading of these observations reveals that the two-judge bench\n    in Anjuman (supra) doubted the correctness of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_635\">Azeez\n    Basha</a> (supra) and the principles enunciated therein.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_98\">The bench while\n    questioning the holding in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_636\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra), also borrowed\n    strength from the views expressed by some jurists.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">87. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_99\">In <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_637\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra), the issue pertained to the constitutional\n    validity of the AMU 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_100\">While questioning\n    the correctness of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_638\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra), it is evident\n    that the reference in Anjuman (supra) also insinuated that potential\n    errors may have occurred in the analysis of the constitutionality of\n    those enactments.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_101\">The reference seeking to re-open the issues settled\n    in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_639\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra), thus, necessarily means not only to re-\n    examine the correctness of that decision but also an attempt to revisit\n    the constitutionality of the AMU 1951 and 1965 Amendment Acts.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">88. Importantly, the key term used in the reference order in Anjuman\n    (supra) is ‘and’, which is clearly used to state that both ‘Azeez Basha&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                                             49</span>\n\f    case may also be considered’ and ‘the ingredients of a minority\n    institution’ should be examined definitively. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_103\">Such an analysis would\n    also have to consider the question posed in <a href=\"/doc/8064/\" id=\"a_640\">TMA Pai</a> (supra) under 3(a)\n    regarding the criteria required for an institution to qualify as a ‘minority\n    institution’ under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_641\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution, and consequently, as\n    to whether, AMU fulfils such criteria or not.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">89. We therefore find it difficult to align ourselves with the opinion\n    expressed by Hon’ble the Chief Justice, according to which the\n    reference before us was limited to determining only the criteria an\n    educational institution must meet under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_642\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.\n    However, given the Hon’ble Chief Justice’s decision to further refer the\n    matter pertaining to AMU to a regular bench, we have confined our\n    views to discerning the relevant indicia under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_643\">Article 30</a>, so as to avoid\n    binding or influencing the regular bench that will ultimately decide the\n    factual issues.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">F.2.

The two-judge bench in Anjuman (supra), after expressing doubt about\n    the correctness of <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_644\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) and its principles, referred the\n    matter for reconsideration to a larger bench.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_105\">Additionally, the bench in\n    Anjuman (supra) specifically stated that the larger bench reviewing\n    <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_645\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra)—a decision by a five-judge bench—should\n    consist of seven judges.

With utmost respect at our command, we do not\n    appreciate as to how a two-judge bench could dictate its viewpoint to\n    the Chief Justice of India. This, to our mind, effectively impaired the\n    Chief Justice&#x27;s authority as the master of the roster. Allowing such a\n    practice would enable benches of lesser strength, such as a two-judge\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                             52</span>\n\f     bench, to undermine the decisions of larger benches, potentially even\n     an eleven-judge bench. This would also place the Chief Justice in an\n     untenable position, who would be bound by a judicial order while\n     acting in an administrative role, leading to procedural complications\n     and embarrassment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">95. We reiterate that such actions completely undermine the principle of\n     stare decisis, a well-established doctrine that mandates the consistent\n     application of legal principles once pronounced by authoritative courts.\n     This principle is rooted in the idea that once a court has determined a\n     rule applicable to a specific set of circumstances, it should be followed\n     in all future cases involving substantially similar facts.61 Stare decisis\n     et non quieta movere—which means to stand by things decided and not\n     disturb settled matters. Accordingly, the importance of precedents and\n     stare decisis as fundamental features of our legal system requires that\n     law laid down by higher courts be followed by coordinate or co-equal\n     benches, and most certainly by smaller benches and subordinate\n     courts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_173\">96. The very purpose of these principles is to ensure predictability and\n     stability in judicial decisions, thereby upholding the Rule of Law. It is\n     trite law that when legal precedents are consistently followed, the law\n     remains stable and strengthened, rather than being disrupted at every\n     opportunity.62 Consistency and finality in judicial orders foster greater\n     confidence and trust in the judicial system, which is the need of the\n     hour. The mere fact that another interpretation may be possible does\n     not warrant unsettling well-established law that has long governed the\n     field.63 Deviation from these long-settled principles, leads to a situation\n     marred by uncertainty and instability, vitiating any sense of finality.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">61 Krishen Kumar v.

This would erode\n    the concept    of   well-settled   principles   and   destabilize    the legal\n    framework, as each judgment would strive to chart new directions,\n    undermining legal certainty and continuity. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708017\" id=\"span_120\">Ironically, the reference in\n    Anjuman (supra) strikes through the very core of <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_657\">Dawoodi Bohra</a>\n    (supra) and the law laid therein.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">98. We thus have no hesitation in holding that it is the Chief Justice of\n    India alone, who is the custodian of the authority to determine the\n    composition of benches, and, in public or national interest, place a\n    matter before any bench he deems appropriate, even in the absence of\n    any reference. That being so, the 2019 Reference Order issued by a\n    three-judge bench, which included the then Chief Justice of India,\n    cannot be faulted. Consequently, based on that order, we consider it\n    appropriate to proceed with the determination of some of the issues\n    concerning the constitutional challenge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_121\">99. We also respectfully disagree with the opinion of Hon’ble the Chief\n    Justice in paragraph 39 of his draft judgement, according to which,\n    Anjuman (supra) has merely ‘doubted’ and not ‘disagreed’ with <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_658\">Azeez\n    Basha</a> (supra). It seems to us that the terms ‘doubt’ and ‘disagree’\n    broadly carry similar connotations. It is difficult to doubt a judicial\n    opinion unless we disagree with the correctness of its contents and\n    substance. Similarly, a disagreement would originate only when such\n    opinion is shrouded with doubts on law or on facts.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                                                                54</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_178\">\fG.

The Respondents have countered the Appellant’s locus standi to invoke\n     <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_659\">Article 30.</a> They have argued that there was no such Fundamental\n     Right available at the time when AMU was established. It is their\n     assertion that since Fundamental Rights are not retrospectively\n     applicable,     and     considering        AMU   was     established     before     the\n     Constitution, it cannot claim protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_660\">Article 30.</a> In addition,\n     the Respondents have challenged the Appellant’s locus on the ground\n     that Muslims did not constitute a ‘minority’ in 1920.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_180\">101.

Accordingly,\n     the Appellant contended that it has the locus standi to enforce the right\n     granted by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_662\">Article 30.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">102.

Locus of pre-Constitution institution\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">103. It is a settled principle of law that Fundamental Rights are not\n     retrospectively applicable. 64 The Constitution of India was framed in a\n     social context that marked a significant departure from an exacting\n     colonial regime to a system based on rights and self-governance. Hence,\n     the legal milieu in these two regimes inevitably differed, with the\n     Constitution imposing more stringent restrictions on governmental\n     actions.    Consequently,       if   the    previous    actions    of   the   colonial\n\n64 Sushila Rao, “The Doctrine of Eclipse in Constitutional Law: A Critical Reappraisal of its\nContemporary Scope and Relevance” National Law School of India Review, (2006) Vol. 18 No.\n1 pp. 49.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                                         55</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">\f     government were to be tested on the touchstone of the Constitution,\n     nearly all such acts would need to be overturned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">104. Such a wholesale invalidation of past actions would have far-reaching\n     consequences. It could undermine the stability of the legal system, as\n     people’s    lives      and   rights—such       as    property   rights,   contractual\n     relationships, etc.—have been shaped by those earlier actions. Hence,\n     the social and economic disruption resulting from such a scenario\n     would      be   severe.      Furthermore,      the   retrospective    application   of\n     Fundamental Rights could also lead to a legal quagmire, where Courts\n     would be crippled with cases in which relevant documents and evidence\n     might no longer be available. Moreover, such an unscrambling of the\n     egg might nearly be impossible in some instances, such as cases of\n     criminal convictions from decades ago.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">105.

At this point, it is essential to distinguish between retrospective and\n     retroactive laws. A retrospective law imposes new obligations or rights\n     on transactions that have already been completed. In contrast,\n     retroactive     legislation     applies   to    ongoing    transactions,    affecting\n     obligations that arise after the law’s enactment, even if the transactions\n     began beforehand. 65 For example, if a law prohibits houses from having\n     more than two floors and requires existing houses exceeding this limit\n     to be demolished, it is retrospective. If the law only affects houses\n     under construction when it comes into force, it is retroactive.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100300986\" id=\"span_124\">107.

Similarly, practices prevailing before 1950 but prohibited afterwards\n        must be struck down if it does not align with the constitutional ethos.\n        The significance of 26.01.1950 lies in its role as a golden date for\n        eradicating unconstitutional practices and safeguarding the rights\n        guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. It would then accordingly\n        follow that if an institution was established and administered by\n        minorities as on 26.01.1950, such an institution would be entitled to\n        seek protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_665\">Article 30.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">109.

Each of these points are analysed separately below.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">G.2.

Under the Indian Constitution, the framework of rights can be broadly\n    divided into three classes based on who holds the right and who can\n    exercise it:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">    a.   The first category, known as ‘individual rights’, encompasses rights\n         available to all individuals and can be claimed by them. An\n         example of such a right is the right to privacy, which pertains to\n         all individuals and can be asserted by any individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">    b.   The second category, termed ‘group rights’ in India, consists of\n         rights available to individuals, provided they belong to a specified\n         group. An example of such a right could be the right of reservation\n         provided to individuals belonging to certain classes. In this regard,\n         this Court has held:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">            “407. Unless the creamy layer is removed, OBCs cannot\n            exercise their group rights. The Union of India and other\n            respondents argued that creamy layer exclusion is wrong\n            because the text of the Ninety-third Amendment bestows a\n            benefit on “classes”, not individuals. While it is a group\n            right, the group must contain only those individuals\n            that belong to the group. I first take the entire lot of\n            creamy and non-creamy layer OBCs. I then remove the\n            creamy layer on an individual basis based on their income,\n            property holdings, occupation, etc. What is left is a group\n            that meets constitutional muster. It is a group right that\n            must also belong to individuals, if the right is to have\n            any meaning. If one OBC candidate is denied special\n            provisions that he should have received by law, it is\n            not the group&#x27;s responsibility to bring a claim. He\n            would be the one to do so. He has a right of action to\n            challenge the ruling that excluded him from the\n            special provisions afforded to OBCs. In this sense, he\n            has an individual right. Group and individual rights\n            need not be mutually exclusive. In this case, it is not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                           59</span>\n\f              one or the other but both that apply to the impugned\n              legislation.” 67\n                                                [Emphasis supplied]\n\n           As elucidated in the extract above, such group rights are\n           possessed by an individual, and such individual can assert their\n           claim to exercise these rights. The individual does not need to\n           demonstrate that the group as a whole is affected and may\n           exercise such rights in their singular capacity.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">     c.    The third category, which we would like to refer to as collective\n           rights, includes rights that belong to groups as a whole and can\n           only be exercised by those groups collectively. An example of such\n           a right could be the right of a country to vote in the UN General\n           Assembly.68 Such rights belong to the entire nation as a\n           community and are not contingent on whether individual citizens\n           of the nation are individually exercising this right. Another\n           example of such a category is the right of a country to be free from\n           intervention by other countries, which also belongs to and is to be\n           exercised by the nation as a whole. 69 Unlike the previous two\n           categories, the bearer of these rights is a collective unit and not\n           individual constituents. Accordingly, the right can be claimed by\n           the community at large or by an individual representing the entire\n           community.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63489929\" id=\"span_132\">115. Based on the foregoing discussion, we believe that the right ensconced\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_682\">Article 30</a> belongs to the second category, namely, it is granted to\n     a minority community at large but can be exercised by an individual or\n     a group of individuals. This right does not fit into the first category\n     because <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_683\">Article 30</a> specifically aims to uplift and protect certain\n     minority communities, making membership in such a community a\n     necessary pre-condition.

Thus, while the right exists for the\n     benefit of the whole community, it can be exercised qua its individual\n     members       rather     than    requiring      collective   action   by   the   whole\n     community. 70\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_201\">116. Having said that, it is important to emphasize that the technical issue\n     of who can invoke <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_687\">Article 30</a> should not be used to oust the claim at the\n     threshold. Procedure, ultimately, is the handmaiden of justice. This is\n     especially true for contentions regarding locus and who can invoke a\n     particular provision, especially when there is public interest at stake.\n     Unless there is a risk of collusion between the parties or the Court\n     believes that the interest of all the stakeholders might not be\n     adequately represented and there might be some ‘invisible victims’, the\n     Court typically refrains from scrutinizing who has invoked the\n     constitutional provision and whether the claimant represents the entire\n     community. Constitutional Courts are envisaged as liberal platforms\n     where vital questions regarding the violation of Fundamental Rights\n     can     be    analysed     without      being     bogged     down     by   procedural\n     technicalities. In that sense, the substance of the claim usually takes\n     precedence over its form, instead of the form foreclosing the substance\n     at the very outset.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">117.

Having answered the prefatory issues of locus and maintainability, we\n     now proceed to delve into the contours of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_689\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution\n     and make an endeavor to explain the true meaning of the expressions\n     ‘establish’ and ‘administer’.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">               Questions regarding constitutional interpretation\n\n\nH.

When posed with the question of whether the prongs of ‘establishment’\n     and   ‘administration’     ought      to   be    construed   conjunctively     or\n     disjunctively in determining whether it is a minority institution, the\n     Appellant sought to contend that minority administration of their\n     institution is merely discretionary and that they are not bound to\n     satisfy   the   twin   test.   They    instead    urged   that   the   prong   of\n     administration, would not be a prerequisite for determining the\n     minority status of an educational institution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_209\">121. The Respondents, on the other hand, assailed that for an institution to\n     claim the protection proffered under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_691\">Article 30</a>, the minority community\n     would have to demonstrate the two prongs of ‘establishment’ and\n     ‘administration’ of the institution conjunctively.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">122. Having considered the rival submissions tendered by the parties as well\n     the language of the provision itself, it is evident that ‘establishment’\n     and ‘administration’ are qualitatively distinct: while the former deals\n     with the history of the institution, the latter deals with the control over\n     the institution, at present. Accordingly, ‘establishment’ is temporally\n     fixated, while ‘administration’ requires analysis over a continuous span\n     of time, both during and post-establishment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">123. Of these two aspects, the necessity of the prong of establishment is not\n     in dispute. Both parties agree that an institution must be established\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                                                    62</span>\n\f     by the minority community. This issue is also largely settled by various\n     judicial precedents of this Court, which have held that establishment\n     by minority is a necessary pre-requisite for claiming the right under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_692\">Article 30.</a> 71 The question, however, has been raised in regard to the\n     administration prong. The Respondents have argued it to be a pre-\n     requisite for invoking <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_693\">Article 30</a>, while the Appellant has argued it to be\n     the result of such an invocation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_212\">124. We find that both the Appellant and Respondents are right, but only to\n     the extent that administration is both a pre-requisite and the result. In\n     this respect, it mirrors its counterpart, <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_694\">Article 29</a>, under the section\n     ‘Cultural and Educational Rights’. <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_695\">Article 29</a> makes the distinctiveness\n     of culture a pre-requisite for invoking its provision, and once invoked, it\n     bestows the right to conserve such distinctiveness. Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_696\">Article 30</a>\n     outlines administration by the minority community as a pre-requisite\n     for invoking the provision, ultimately granting the right to continue\n     such administration free from unreasonable government interference.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">125. There are multifarious reasons behind upholding administration as a\n     pre-requisite rather than merely a right or result. First, if <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_697\">Article 30</a>\n     were contingent only on the establishment by the minority community,\n     it would render the provision susceptible to significant misuse. In a bid\n     to attain special protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_698\">Article 30</a>, majority communities\n     could purchase or takeover institutions established by minorities and\n     then administer such institutions with reduced State interference in\n     perpetuity. This will potentially lead to all communities ultimately\n     enjoying the special right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_699\">Article 30</a>, denuding the very\n     purpose of this Article.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13651090\" id=\"span_137\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312939\" id=\"span_138\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"686466\" id=\"span_139\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1978528\" id=\"span_140\">71 <a href=\"/doc/1978528/\" id=\"a_700\">Kerala Education Bill</a>, 1957, supra note 58; <a href=\"/doc/686466/\" id=\"a_701\">State of Kerala vs. Very Rev.

Second, it is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_704\">Article 30</a> carves out an exception to the general\n     power of the Government to regulate and intervene in educational\n     institutions. It has also been defined broadly, extending to all religious\n     and linguistic minorities, potentially encompassing a significant portion\n     of India’s population. If not interpreted narrowly, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_705\">Article 30</a> would\n     undermine governmental control over educational institutions and\n     compromise the quality of higher education.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"197490\" id=\"span_142\">127.

The first right is the initial right to establish\n           institutions of the minority&#x27;s choice. Establishment here\n           means the bringing into being of an institution and it\n           must be by a minority community.

It is equally irrelevant that in addition to\n           the minority community others from other minority\n           communities or even from the majority community can take\n           advantage of these institutions.

Hence, as rightly held by this Court, the term ‘establish’ means\n      bringing the institution into existence for the benefit of the minority\n      community. However, we must ask ourselves as to when an institution\n      can be said to have come into existence, and what it means to establish\n      it for the benefit of the community. Each of these prongs have been\n      analysed separately below.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">I.1. Bringing into existence—meaning and factors\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">138. In this regard, the Appellant and Respondents both suggested that an\n      institution comes into existence at a single point in time but disagreed\n      on what that exact point should be. The Appellant suggested looking\n      back into the genesis of the institution to determine when it was\n      ‘founded’ or when the idea was conceived. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"686466\" id=\"span_154\">In contrast, the Respondents\n      argued against going back in time and instead urged that the\n\n76 <a href=\"/doc/686466/\" id=\"a_726\">Mother Provincial</a>, supra note 71, para 8.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                                                               67</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\">\f    institution should be considered established the moment it was\n    operationalized.   According     to   them,   if   the   institution   was\n    operationalized by virtue of a statute, then it was established at that\n    specific point by the Legislature.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">139. To clarify these divergent views, it might be helpful to consider\n    analogous situations. For instance, if the question is about when a\n    photograph taken with an analogue camera comes into existence, one\n    perspective would argue that it is created when the photograph is\n    clicked, while the other would assert that it only exists when the photo\n    is finally printed on paper. Similarly, in the context of a melody, one\n    side might argue that it comes into existence when it is composed,\n    whereas the other side could contend that it only comes into being\n    when it is finally performed. Or in the context of art, one perspective\n    could be that a painting comes into existence when the idea is\n    conceived, and the other side could be that it is only when it is fully\n    completed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">140. We believe that both sides are partly right and partly wrong. They are\n    right in considering both the genesis of the institution and the point of\n    sanction by the statute for operationalizing the institution as relevant\n    factors to determine establishment. However, they are incorrect in\n    asserting that coming into existence is an event frozen at a single point\n    in time. Instead, we believe that coming into existence operates in a\n    continuum, which requires the analysis of the entire gamut of relevant\n    factors that brought the institution into being. The essence of\n    existence—be it that of an educational institution or a photograph,\n    melody, or an art as instantiated above—is a multi-faceted and an\n    ontological question that cannot be answered by artificially fixating it at\n    a specific time with a bright-line test. Since there are several factors\n    that contribute towards the existence of the educational institution, at\n    no point can we say that the institute came into existence as soon as\n    one specific factor was fulfilled. Such an exercise would highlight one\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                                                            68</span>\n\f      factor while discounting the importance of others, which would be\n      arbitrary and irrational. Instead, the correct approach requires an\n      appraisal of the entirety of facts—i.e., the origin, the point of finality,\n      and the whole process in between—to reach an understanding about\n      the establishment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">141. Hence, while the parties are right in pointing out the relevant factors of\n      genesis and the statutory sanction, the analysis of who establishes the\n      educational institution has to go beyond them to cover all aspects\n      holistically. Since these factors would be a question of fact that would\n      differ from case to case, giving a laundry list of all such aspects would\n      be erroneous in law. However, to determine whether the minority\n      community has established the institution or not, a few illustrative\n      factors that the Courts have considered in the past include:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">      a.

Caveat to these factors\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_238\">142. In regard to these factors and any additional ones that may be relevant\n      based on the specifics of each case, there are two important\n      qualifications to note. First, as was previously stated, none of these\n      factors individually would be determinative of the minority status; the\n      analysis must be holistic, and the factum of existence must be seen in\n      a continuum instead of fixating on one factor and point of time. In\n      several instances, Courts have clarified that the absence of certain\n      factors, such as the institution not being constructed by the minority\n      community 81 or receiving external financial assistance,82 does not\n      negate the minority character of the institution. These decisions\n      reiterate that the presence or absence of a single factor should not alter\n      the Court’s overall conclusion.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\">143. Second, the analysis concerning who fulfils each individual factor\n      should not aim at creating absolutes, i.e., the Court must not mandate\n      that the minority community must be single-handedly responsible for\n      fulfilling the role prescribed by that factor. It could be the case that the\n      community takes aid of external parties for setting up the institution,\n      but still takes the lead role in such establishment. If we were to hold\n      that such aid would take away the minority character of the institution,\n      we would, in effect, be laying down a requirement that the community\n      must work in silos and that no member belonging to any other\n      community should provide any assistance in achieving its purpose.\n      This would squarely contravene the very spirit of our Constitution,\n\n80 Ibid, para 35-40.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_160\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1777876\" id=\"span_161\">81 <a href=\"/doc/1777876/\" id=\"a_729\">Rt.

That being said, the converse must also hold true. If the leading role in\n    establishing an institution is played by an external party, mere\n    contributions from a member of the minority community would not be\n    sufficient to attribute the establishment itself to the minority. To hold\n    otherwise would expose the protection given under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_733\">Article 30</a> to\n    potential misuse, allowing institutions established by the majority\n    community to claim minority status based on some insignificant\n    contribution from the minority community.

To   determine whether     the minority     community   established the\n    institution, the Court should thus examine whether it was indeed that\n    community which brought the institution into existence. This involves\n    assessing who played the leading role from the institution&#x27;s inception,\n    through the process of making its creation a reality, and finally, in\n    making it operational.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">146. Having understood the meaning of ‘bringing into existence’, we shall\n    now revisit the Respondent’s argument that if an institution is being\n    created by Statute, then it cannot be said to have been brought into\n    existence by the minority community since <a href=\"/doc/1939329/\" id=\"a_734\">in that, case</a> it is the\n    Legislature which establishes the university. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"564368\" id=\"span_165\">This particular element\n    requires some detailed analysis, not only because it was vehemently\n    argued by both sides but also because, as confirmed by this Court in\n    <a href=\"/doc/564368/\" id=\"a_735\">Prof Yashpal</a> (supra), a University can only be created by or under a\n    Statute.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                                           71</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_167\">147.

In case such a statutory framework is used by\n    the community, the question arises who truly brings the institution into\n    existence—the community or the statute that is used to create the\n    institution?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                                                72</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"472954\" id=\"span_169\">150.

Rejecting this view, the Court held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">           “Here a distinction must be made between an\n           institution which is not created by or under a statute\n           but is governed by certain statutory provisions for the\n           proper maintenance and administration of the\n           institution. There have been a number of institutions which\n           though not created by or under any statute have adopted\n           certain statutory provisions, but that by itself is not, in our\n           opinion, sufficient to clothe the institution with a statutory\n           character. […]\n\n           It is, therefore, clear that there is a well-marked distinction\n           between a body which is created by the statute and a body\n           which after having come into existence is governed in\n           accordance with the provisions of the statute. In other\n           words the position seems to be that the institution\n           concerned must owe its very existence to a statute\n           which would be the fountainhead of its powers. The\n           question in such cases to be asked is, if there is no\n           statute would the institution have any legal existence.\n           If the answer is in the negative, then undoubtedly it is\n           a statutory body, but if the institution has a separate\n           existence of its own without any reference to the\n           statute concerned but is merely governed by the\n           statutory provisions it cannot be said to be a statutory\n           body […].”\n                                                     [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1004292\" id=\"span_173\">155. Hence, if an institution possesses legal existence independent of the\n     statute, then the Statute merely recognizes an existing institution and\n     does not ‘establish’ it.

Accordingly, just because a college is affiliated with a\n    university and follows its statutory requirements, it would not deprive\n    the institution of its minority character. This was also stated in <a href=\"/doc/1545248/\" id=\"a_753\">St.\n    Stephens</a> (supra), where this Court held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">        “41. It was contended that St. Stephen&#x27;s College after\n        being affiliated to the Delhi University has lost its\n        minority character. The argument was based on some\n        of the provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/65439626/\" id=\"a_754\">Delhi University Act</a> and the\n        Ordinances made thereunder. It was said that the\n        students are admitted to the University and not to the\n        College as such. But we find no substance in the\n        contention. In the first place, it may be stated that the State\n        or any instrumentality of the State cannot deprive the\n        character of the institution, founded by a minority community\n        by compulsory affiliation since <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_755\">Article 30(1)</a> is a special right\n        to minorities to establish educational institutions of their\n        choice […]”\n\n        “45. From these and other relevant provisions of the Act and\n        Ordinances, we have not been able to find any indications\n        either in the general scheme or in other specific provisions\n        which would enable us to say that the College is legally\n        precluded from maintaining its minority character. That in\n        matters of admission of students to Degree courses including\n        Honours courses, the candidates have to apply to the College\n        of their choice and not to the University and it is for the\n        Principal of the College or Dean of Faculties concerned to take\n        decision and make final admission. It is, therefore, wrong to\n        state that there is no admission to the College but only for the\n        University. The procedure for admission to Post Graduate\n        courses is of course, different but we are not concerned with\n        that matter in these cases.”\n                                                 [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">156. It may also be relevant at this stage to examine instances of such\n    universities, which, under law, are mandated to be operationalized by a\n    Statute.

Since the UGC Act mandates that degrees can be conferred only by\n    those universities that are established ‘by or under’ a statute, it is a\n    necessary corollary that the university must be operationalized by a\n    statute itself in order to validly confer the degrees. Given that the legal\n    existence in this context flows directly from the statute, the question\n    thus arises: does this mean that the minority community does not\n    bring such universities into existence, and that they are instead\n    established by the legislature? <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_177\"><a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_761\">Indeed, Azeez Basha</a> (supra) says so.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_260\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_178\">Contrarily, the NCMEI Act, as amended from time to time, enables a\n    minority community to establish a university on its own.

In this regard, one needs to note the nuance between legal recognition\n    and other facets of existence. As was discussed before, existence covers\n    other aspects apart from legal sanction. Especially for universities, this\n    Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/564368/\" id=\"a_766\">Prof. Yashpal</a> (supra), held that the Statute shall\n    not give legal sanction unless it is satisfied that there exist enough\n    infrastructural facilities within the institution:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">         “44.

The State Legislature can make an enactment providing\n         for incorporation of universities under Entry 32 of List II and\n         also generally for universities under Entry 25 of List III. The\n         subject “university” as a legislative head must be\n         interpreted in the same manner as it is generally or\n         commonly understood, namely, with proper facilities\n         for teaching of higher level and continuing research\n         activity.

The body is required to create an endowment fund, possess\n     certain specified areas of land, construct buildings, install equipment,\n     appoint professors, plan curriculum and other activities, make rules for\n     the functioning of the university, and comply with other norms. 85\n     Subsequently, such a body is then required to apply for the sanction by\n\n\n\n\n85 <a href=\"/doc/55566817/\" id=\"a_775\">Uttar Pradesh Private Universities Act, 2019</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1055795/\" id=\"a_776\">Section 3</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                                                                        78</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_265\">\f      furnishing the requisite details. 86 Only once the government is satisfied\n      with the necessary compliances by the sponsoring body, does it grant\n      the sanction and incorporates it under the statute. 87 Therefore, even\n      though the final legal existence is sanctioned through the statute, it is\n      the private body which initiates and fulfils other essential roles.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_266\">161. A similar situation existed in India prior to independence. During this\n      pre-independence era, the very nature of universities was in a state of\n      flux.    Up     until   the    1920s,   universities   primarily    functioned   as\n      administrative units rather than teaching institutions. Accordingly,\n      they were established by the State as government bodies to exercise\n      control over all the colleges in the respective provinces. This factum is\n      acknowledged by the Saddler Commission of 1917-19, which noted:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">              “These territorial limits have been deemed necessary in the\n              past, mainly for the following reasons.

So long as each of these universities is engaged,\n              subject to Government control, in administrative rather\n              than teaching functions, it necessarily follows that its\n              boundaries should be as far as possible co-terminous\n              with those of a province […] The self-contained\n              provincial university affords some administrative\n              conveniences. Because it exercises direct control over\n              Government colleges, gives grants-in-aid to others, and\n              is deeply interested in the secondary school system,\n              Government is necessarily hampered in carrying out\n              these duties if the affiliation and inspection of colleges\n              within its area and the recognition of schools situated\n              within its territorial jurisdiction are in any respect\n              under the authority or in the hands of another\n              Government and university.”88\n\n                                                             [Emphasis supplied]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_267\">162.

Hence, even when the legal existence—i.e., the authority to grant\n     degrees—comes from an external body or legislature, it is an important\n     but not the sole facet that constitutes a University. Further, the\n     legislative object and intent of such a Statute would be a determinative\n     factor in ascertaining the nature of the University. If it were solely\n     responsible for the creation of the university, the statute might assume\n     a size larger than the University. Instead, since the concept of a\n     university encompasses numerous other factors beyond legal sanction,\n     these factors also contribute to its existence, and the statute is one of\n     them.

The previous section showed that an institution would not owe its\n      existence to the legislature itself, provided that other facets apart from\n      legal operationalization are fulfilled by another body. However, it may\n      also happen that the Government itself may fulfil the other aspects by\n      perhaps ideating the institution, providing funds and infrastructure for\n      its set-up, making its charter documents, and finally operationalizing it\n      through different bodies. In case the leading role in the different factors\n      instantiated in paragraph 141 of this judgement is played by the\n      Legislature itself or through the Executive Government, then it will be\n      said to have brought the institution into existence and not any private\n      individual or community.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_280\">169.

To this end, the very concept of ‘administration’ is inherently fluid, and\n           a specific definition is likely to be underinclusive. Determining whether\n           a minority community exercises control over an institution is a factual\n           question that varies from case to case. Although there is no definitive\n           test to ascertain whether administration lies with the minority\n           community, various judicial precedents provide indicators that may be\n           considered relevant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_300\">180. Similar to the test to determine ‘establishment’, these indicators alone\n           may not conclusively establish whether the administration rests with\n           the minority community. Instead, a cumulative and holistic analysis of\n           these factors can assist the court in making its determination.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_301\">181.

It thus emerges that the minority community must largely be free from\n        external control and must have broad autonomy to mould the\n        institution’s functioning and administration per their idea of what\n        would be best for the community. 117 If the long-term administrative\n        factors and the day-to-day sundry decisions do not lie with the\n        community, it would mean that the institution is being administered by\n        an outside authority and not by the minority community. As already\n        elucidated, while the minority community can be subjected to general\n        regulations regarding the betterment of such management, and while\n        there can be a sprinkling of outsiders, administration itself cannot be\n        taken away from the minority community.

On a careful reflection and conscious of the\n            constitutional dilemma, we are inclined to the view that this\n            case falls on the valid side of the delicate line. Regulation\n            which restricts is bad; but regulation which facilitates\n            is good. Where does this fine distinction lie? No rigid\n            formula is possible but a flexible test is feasible. Where\n            the object and effect is to improve the tone and temper\n            of the administration without forcing on it a stranger,\n            however superb his virtues be, where the directive is\n            not to restructure the governing body but to better its\n            performance by a marginal catalytic induction, where\n            no external authority&#x27;s fiat or approval or outside\n            nominee is made compulsory to validate the\n            Management Board but inclusion of an internal key\n            functionary appointed by the autonomous management\n            alone is asked for, the provision is salutary and saved,\n            being not a diktat eroding the freedom of the freedom.”\n                                                     [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_310\">183. Notably, for such administration to lie with the community, it is not\n      enough if the decisions are taken by a member of such a community. If\n      these decisions lie with the community but there is an outside\n      authority with the power to change these decisions, it would imply that\n      the minority community does not have pervasive control over the\n      administrator, and its status is merely that of a paper tiger.119\n      Conversely, if there are outside authorities and the minority community\n      does not have the power to oversee or reverse the decisions of such\n      authorities, it would again imply that control lies externally. In other\n      words, the administration shall cover both the active and the reactive\n      aspects, such that the minority community can take active steps to\n      effect changes in the institution without outside restriction and can\n      also veto decisions taken or changes made from the outside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_311\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1241088\" id=\"span_240\">184. Consequently, in order to satisfy the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_835\">Article 30</a>, a\n      minority community must retain both de jure and de facto control over\n\n119 <a href=\"/doc/1241088/\" id=\"a_836\">Lilly Kurian</a>, supra note 111.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                                                                            89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_312\">\f     the institution. It is insufficient for the community to simply have a\n     minority member appointed by the majority for administrative roles;\n     this does not confer genuine control. If the minority member&#x27;s position\n     can be revoked at any time by the majority, the real power of\n     administration does not lie with the minority community. Allowing\n     <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_837\">Article 30</a> protection under such circumstances would create legal\n     unpredictability, as non-minority institutions could temporarily appoint\n     minority members to exploit the benefits. To meet the administration\n     test, the minority community must therefore first have visible de jure\n     control over the institution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_313\">185. Similarly, mere de jure control over the institution may not be sufficient\n     on its own. It is possible that, to secure protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_838\">Article 30</a>, a\n     minority community might be nominally granted administrative power\n     while actual control is exercised behind the scenes by individuals\n     outside the community. Such a scenario would amount to a façade of\n     minority administration, failing to satisfy the test of genuine physical\n     control over the management. Thus, the need arises for both aspects of\n     control over the educational institution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_314\">186. To summarize, the test for administration under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_839\">Article 30</a> involves\n     identifying who holds effective and overall control within the institution.\n     While external authorities may assist in its administration, the decisive\n     influence and control must rest with members of the minority\n     community. To meet this test, the minority community must exercise\n     both active and reactive control, ensuring that administrative powers\n     are genuinely held in both de jure and de facto terms.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_315\">K.

In <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_848\">Sidhajbhai Sabhai</a> (supra), the challenge was laid to a\n     government order directing that “80% of the total number of seats\n     in non-Government Training Colleges should be reserved for School\n     Board teachers deputed by the Government…” In this regard, the\n     six-judge Constitution Bench held that “unlike <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_849\">Article 19</a>, the\n     fundamental freedom under Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_850\">Article 30</a>, is absolute in\n     terms; it is not made subject to any reasonable restrictions of the\n     nature the fundamental freedoms enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_851\">Article 19</a> may be\n     subjected to. All minorities—linguistic or religious—have, by virtue of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_852\">Article 30(1)</a>, an absolute right to establish and administer\n     educational institutions of their choice; and any law or executive\n     direction which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_853\">Article 30(1)</a> would to that extent be void.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_250\">This, however, is not to\n     say that it is not open to the State to impose regulations upon the\n     exercise of this right...”\n\n\nc.   What comes to light in <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_854\">Sidhajbhai Sabhai</a> (supra) is that the\n     bench therein did not rely upon the opinion delivered by the seven-\n     judge bench in Kerala Education (Bill) and rather distinguished\n     it, as the latter was relied on by the State.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_251\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1978528\" id=\"span_252\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_253\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1978528\" id=\"span_254\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_255\">The Constitution bench\n     in <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_855\">Sidhajbhai Sabhai</a> (supra) thus took pains to explain that the\n     opinion in <a href=\"/doc/1978528/\" id=\"a_856\">Kerala Education Bill</a> (supra) was distinguishable\n     and that it “is not an authority for the proposition submitted by the\n     Additional Solicitor General that all regulative measures which are\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                                                         92</span>\n\f     not destructive or annihilative of the character of the institution\n     established by the minority, provided the regulations are in the\n     national or public interest, are valid…”\n\n\nd.

The aforesaid decision does indicate that the right\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_887\">Article 30(1)</a> is not so absolute as to prevent the\n       government from making any regulation whatsoever. As\n       already noted hereinabove, in <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_888\">Sidhajbhai Sabhai</a>&#x27;s case, it\n       was laid down that regulations made in the true interests of\n       efficiency of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation,\n       morality and public order could be imposed. If this is so, it is\n       difficult to appreciate how the government can be prevented\n       from framing regulations that are in the national interest, as\n       it seems to be indicated in the passage quoted hereinabove.\n       Any regulation framed in the national interest must\n       necessarily apply to all educational institutions, whether run\n       by the majority or the minority. Such a limitation must\n       necessarily be read into <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_889\">Article 30.</a> The right under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_890\">Article\n       30(1)</a> cannot be such as to override the national interest or to\n       prevent the government from framing regulations in that\n       behalf. It is, of course, true that government\n       regulations cannot destroy the minority character of\n       the institution or make the right to establish and\n       administer a mere illusion; but the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_891\">Article\n       30</a> is not so absolute as to be above the law.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_278\">It will\n       further be seen that in <a href=\"/doc/751632/\" id=\"a_892\">Sidhajbhai Sabhai</a>&#x27;s case, no\n       reference      was      made    to <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_893\">Article      29(2)</a> of   the\n       Constitution.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_279\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"751632\" id=\"span_280\">This decision, therefore, cannot be an\n       authority for the proposition canvassed before us.”\n                                               [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\nc.

In order to avoid any repetition, we wish to mention here that an\n     elaborate answer to the aforesaid question has been given under\n     ‘Issue I’ from paragraphs 83 to 99 of our judgement. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708017\" id=\"span_284\">In essence,\n     the reference by the two-judge bench to a larger bench of seven-\n     judges is totally impermissible; such a recourse is directly in the\n     teeth of the dictum of the Constitution bench in <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_899\">Dawoodi Bohra</a>\n     (supra). Such an attempt by a two-judge bench is hit by: (i) the\n     doctrine of predictability; (ii) the doctrine of finality; (iii) the\n     principle of judicial propriety; and (iv) the doctrine of stare decisis.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_329\">b.   Further, there is no substantial difference between ‘doubting’ a\n     larger bench or ‘disagreeing’ with such a judgement. ‘Doubt’ and\n     ‘disagreement’ both originate from a tentative opinion which is in\n     conflict with the reasons already assigned by the larger bench.\n     There cannot be disagreement without doubting the correctness\n     and there cannot be a doubt unless you disagree with the reasons.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">c.   Most importantly, entertaining a reference by a two-judge bench\n     doubting a larger bench would dilute the authority and position of\n     the Chief Justice of India as enjoyed upon <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_900\">Article 145</a> read with\n     Order VII Rule 2 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966, as was then\n     applicable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">189.4. What is the true import of Entry 63 of List I of the Constitution?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_332\">a.   The Seventh Schedule derives its relevance from <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_901\">Article 246</a> of the\n     Constitution. This provision is included in Chapter I of Part XI of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                                                                            96</span>\n\f     the Constitution, which deals with the relationship between the\n     Union and the State and defines their legislative relations.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_333\">b.   It may be seen that Parliament has exclusive power to make laws\n     with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the\n     Seventh schedule, known as the Union List. In this vein, Entry 63\n     of List I reads as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">       “63. The institutions known at the commencement of\n       this Constitution as the Benares Hindu University, the\n       Aligarh Muslim University and the Delhi University; the\n       University established in pursuance of <a href=\"/doc/87434/\" id=\"a_902\">article 371E;</a> any\n       other institution declared by Parliament by law to be an\n       institution of national importance.”\n                                              [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\nc.   Entry 63 has two significant components which we can broadly\n     label as procedural and substantive. The former, i.e., the\n     procedural feature, flows from <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_903\">Article 246</a> and reiterates that the\n     Parliament is the sole Competent Authority for legislating to\n     declare any other institution to be an institution of National\n     Importance\n\n\nd.   The first component of Entry 63 is a substantive part, which is a\n     constitutional declaration of BHU and AMU, to be institutions of\n     National Importance. The opening part of Entry 63 manifestly\n     indicates that the Constituent Assembly was determined to confer\n     such an elevated status on both, BHU and AMU.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">e.   The second component of Entry 63 on the other hand, permits the\n     Parliament to declare any other institution also to be an institution\n     of national importance. It seems from the language of Entry 63\n     that the Parliament has no power to take away the status of an\n     institute of national importance conferred upon BHU or AMU, save\n     and except by following the route of an amendment to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                                                       97</span>\n\f         Constitution itself. Though the Parliament can declare any other\n         institution as an institution of National Importance through the\n         route of <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_904\">Article 246;</a> such plenary legislative power cannot be\n         invoked to take away the status of an institution of National\n         Importance, accorded by the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_334\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_287\">190.

The legislative intent behind the\n         establishment of a university or an institution will have a\n         significant role in determining the status of such an institution.\n         For instance, if the Preamble or the Statement of Objects and\n         Reasons of a Statute explicitly states that the University or the\n         institution concerned is intended to be established and shall be\n         administered by a minority community, we see no reason as to\n         why such a University or institution would be denuded of its\n         minority     character     merely    because it     was created through\n         legislative means.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">    d.

Failing which, the holders of the dissenting view point\n     could have prepared their dissenting opinions. That was not to be.\n     On the other hand, it has so transpired, that, the full draft judgment\n     running into 237 pages has come to be circulated in the morning of\n     July 11, 1985, less than 3 hours before the deadline for pronouncing\n     the judgment. There is a time compulsion to pronounce the\n     judgment, on 11th July, 1985, as the learned Chief Justice who has\n     presided over the Constitution Bench is due to retire on that day, and\n     the judge-time invested by the five Judges would be wasted if it is\n     not pronounced before his retirement. The judge-time would be so\n     wasted because the entire exercise would have to be done afresh.\n     The neck-to-neck race against time and circumstances is so keen\n     that it is impossible to prepare an elaborate judgment presenting the\n     other point of view within hours and circulate the same amongst all\n     the Judges constituting the Bench in this important matter which was\n     heard for months, months ago.

Spread over 8 (eight) days of marathon hearing, learned senior\n\n         counsel/counsel advanced erudite arguments in respect of a\n\n         reference which this Bench of 7 (seven) Judges has been called upon\n\n         to answer. Judgment was reserved on 1st February, 2024. The task\n\n         of authoring the judgment had not been assigned to me, which\n\n         obviously left me with no other option but to wait for the draft opinion\n\n         to reach my residential office.

Aware of the deadline\n\n         of 10th November, 2024 (the day the HCJI would demit office) within\n\n         which the final judgment had to be pronounced, the task of reading\n\n         the learned dissertation started right away squeezing out time from\n\n         the long hours that had to be spent in getting ready for the matters\n\n         on board for each day and in conducting proceedings in court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_318\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_319\">No\n\n         sooner had I completed reading the draft opinion, came a revised\n\n         draft opinion of the HCJI spread over almost the equal number of\n\n         pages.

However, in view of disagreements on a couple of\n\n    points, coupled with my inability to be ad idem with the noteworthy\n\n    progressive approach of the HCJI, writing a separate opinion (which\n\n    was already in progress and was nearing completion) seemed all the\n\n    more the better, the safer and the easier option.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_354\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1134697\" id=\"span_327\">6. I do not grudge getting very little time to express my views in the\n\n    manner I would have wished to express. Had it not been a race\n\n    against time to circulate the opinion by 6th November, 2024, the limit\n\n    I had set for myself and assured to the HCJI, the opinion could have\n\n    been much better articulated and more compact. But my pain is truly\n\n    reflected in the passage from <a href=\"/doc/1134697/\" id=\"a_947\">Tulsiram Patel</a> (supra) quoted above\n\n    and how, despite all the advancements in the justice delivery system\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">                                                                        7</span>\n\fthat we proudly boast of having introduced, in a way history seems\n\nto have repeated itself. Here, a Constitution Bench of 7 (seven)\n\nJudges had apparently embarked on a voyage to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_948\">Article\n\n30(1)</a> of the Constitution navigating through considerable weight of\n\nmaterials without any physical or virtual meeting of the members of\n\nthe Bench post-reservation of judgment, not to speak of meeting of\n\nminds, either immediately after hearing was concluded or even 9\n\n(nine) months thereafter (either collectively or even in small groups\n\nof four-five) to explore which acceptable direction should the\n\noutcome sail. A common venue for a purposeful and effective\n\ndialogue where members of the bench could freely express their\n\npoints of view, an attempt to share thoughts and to exchange\n\nopinions, a ‘give’ and ‘take’ of ideas, in true democratic spirit to build\n\nup a consensus - all these seem to have taken a backseat, having\n\nregard to the immense pressure of work which we, the HCJI and the\n\nother Judges on the bench, have undertaken during the time ever\n\nsince the judgment was reserved. Judicial and administrative works\n\nof varied nature, which I need not dilate here, also weighed me down\n\nto such an extent that sending a request to the HCJI for a meeting of\n\nall the colleagues at this stage would have been too late to make a\n\ndifference (if at all it were to happen). Alas, without any insightful\n\nand constructive discussion of the rival contentions in the presence\n\nof all the members comprising this Bench of 7 (seven) Judges, it is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">                                                                        8</span>\n\f        only individual opinions of 4 (four) Judges that could be crafted and\n\n        circulated for perusal and approval.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_355\">    7. That being said, after circulation of my draft opinion, all the Judges\n\n        forming the quorum had the occasion to meet together for a little\n\n        while on 7th November, 2024, when it emerged that the opinion of\n\n        the HCJI, as circulated, had the concurrence of 3 (three) Judges6 and\n\n        I was part of the minority trio (3 out of 7) with a distinct perspective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_356\">        As the narrative would reveal, my view diverges from the other 2\n\n        (two) Judges in the minority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_357\">    8. Since it was revealed in the aforesaid meeting that my view did not\n\n        align with the majority, my draft opinion warranted certain changes\n\n        and such changes have been incorporated in this final opinion without\n\n        changing the core foundation thereof.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">THE REFERENCE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_359\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"71140963\" id=\"span_330\">9.

So the air is full of new cults that disavow\n           the ancient faiths. Some of them tell us that instead of seeking certainty\n           in the word, the outward sign, we are to seek for something deeper, a\n           certainty relative and temporary, a writing on the sands to be effaced\n           by the advancing tides. Some of them even go so far as to adjure us to\n           give over the vain quest, to purge ourselves of these yearnings for the\n           unattainable ideal, and to be content with an empiricism that is\n           untroubled by strivings for the absolute.’ (See page 9 Selected Writings\n           of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo by Margaret E. Hall.)\n        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1293557\" id=\"span_349\">At the same time, it has to be borne in mind that certainty and\n        continuity are essential ingredients of rule of law. Certainty in law would\n        be considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if the highest court\n        of the land readily overrules the view expressed by it in earlier cases,\n        even though that view has held the field for a number of years. In quite\n        a number of cases which come up before this Court, two views are\n        possible, and simply because the Court considers that the view not\n        taken by the Court in the earlier case was a better view of the matter\n        would not justify the overruling of the view. The law <a href=\"/doc/1293557/\" id=\"a_954\">laid down by</a> this\n        Court is binding upon all courts in the country under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_955\">Article 141</a> of the\n        Constitution, and numerous cases all over the country are decided in\n        accordance with the view taken by this Court. Many people arrange their\n        affairs and large number of transactions also take place on the faith of\n        the correctness of the view taken by this Court.

These amendments were challenged\n\n         as violative of the Fundamental Rights enumerated, inter alia, under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_961\">Articles 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_962\">30</a> of the Constitution. In such decision, it was held\n\n         by this Court both on facts as well as law that AMU cannot be declared\n\n         a minority institution. It was held that AMU was not established by a\n\n         minority community, as it was the creature of a statute. The right\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_963\">Article 30(1)</a> was interpreted so as to give the linguistic and\n\n         religious minorities the right to administer the institutions which were\n\n         established by the minority community. Building on this argument,\n\n         the Court further stated that a minority would not enjoy the rights of\n\n         administering the institution not established by it, merely because it\n\n         might have been administering it before the Constitution came into\n\n         force. The phrase “establish and administer” in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_964\">Article 30</a> has to be\n\n         read conjunctively and there is no precedent which holds that it can\n\n         be read disjunctively. The Court further went on to hold that in 1920,\n\n         there was nothing to stop the Muslim community from establishing a\n\n         university if they so desired. The nucleus of AMU was Mohammedan\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_356\">15</span>\n     AMU Act, hereafter\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">                                                                                 14</span>\n\f       Anglo-Oriental         College16,       an    institution     under   the    Allahabad\n\n       University.

The said order reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">           “After hearing counsel for the Parties, we are clearly of the opinion\n           that this case involves two substantial questions regarding the\n           interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_975\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution of India. The\n           present Institution was founded in the year 1938 and registered\n           under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_976\">Societies Registration Act</a> in the year 1940. The documents\n           relating to the time when the institution was founded clearly shows\n           that while the institution was established mainly by the Muslim\n           community but there were members from the non-muslim\n           community also who participated in the establishment process. The\n           point that arises is as to whether Act. 30(1) of the Constitution\n           envisages an institution which is established by minorities alone\n           without the participation for the factum of establishment from any\n           other community. On this point, there is no clear decision of this\n           court. There are some observations in S. Azeez Basha &amp; ors. Vs.\n           Union of India 1968 (1) SCR 333, but these observations can be\n           explained away. Another point that arises is whether soon after the\n           establishment of the institution if it is registered as a Society under\n           the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_977\">Society Registration Act</a>, its status as a minority institution\n           changes in view of the broad principles laid down in S. Azeez Basha’s\n           case. Even as it is several jurists including Mr. Seervai have\n           expressed about the correctness of the decision of this court in S.\n           Azeez Basha’s case. Since the point has arisen in this case we think\n           that this is a proper occasion when a larger bench can consider the\n           entire aspect fully. We, therefore, direct that this case may be placed\n           before Hon. The Chief Justice for being heard by a bench of at least\n           7 judges so that S. Azeez Basha’s case may also be considered and\n           the points that arise in this case directly as to the essential conditions\n           or ingredients of the minority institution may also be decided once\n           for all. A large number of jurists including Mr. Seervai, learned\n           counsel for the petitioners Mr. Garg and learned counsel for\n           respondents and interveners Mr. Dikshit and Kaskar have stated that\n           this case requires reconsideration.

Ever since the mid-fifties of the last century, the entire functional\n\n         strength of Judges of the Supreme Court of India has never\n\n         assembled to decide any case. The last time the entire strength of 8\n\n         (eight) Judges did assemble was in 1954, when the Constitution\n\n         Bench decided two writ petitions under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_978\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution\n\n         in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_979\">M.

Although voices of the benches could be different\n\n         on a common point of law, yet, the reasons and the ultimate\n\n         conclusions are treated as the view-point of the Supreme Court.

It is also well known that it is the power of the Chief Justice of\n\n         India, on the administrative side, to determine appropriate numerical\n\n         strength of the benches. However, the mere fact of this Bench having\n\n         a numerical strength of 7 (seven) Judges and presided over by none\n\n         other than the Chief Justice of India does not necessarily make it\n\n         competent to decide the re-reference, if the orders of reference/re-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_379\">         reference are found to be seriously flawed and no such reference/re-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_380\">         reference should have or could have been made in the first place.

The principle is simple. Whether it be the Supreme Court, or the high\n\n    courts, it is beyond any shadow of doubt that a decision of a bench\n\n    of greater strength is binding on a bench of lesser strength. Our\n\n    system of administration of justice aims at certainty in the law and\n\n    that can be achieved only if Judges do not ignore decisions by courts\n\n    of coordinate authority or of superior authority.

It will be open only for a\n             Bench of coequal strength to express an opinion doubting the\n             correctness of the view taken by the earlier Bench of coequal\n             strength, whereupon the matter may be placed for hearing before a\n             Bench consisting of a quorum larger than the one which pronounced\n             the decision laying down the law the correctness of which is doubted.\n             (3) The above rules are subject to two exceptions: (i) the abovesaid\n             rules do not bind the discretion of the Chief Justice in whom vests\n             the power of framing the roster and who can direct any particular\n             matter to be placed for hearing before any particular Bench of any\n             strength; and (ii) in spite of the rules laid down hereinabove, if the\n             matter has already come up for hearing before a Bench of larger\n             quorum and that Bench itself feels that the view of the law taken by\n             a Bench of lesser quorum, which view is in doubt, needs correction\n             or reconsideration then by way of exception (and not as a rule) and\n             for reasons given by it, it may proceed to hear the case and examine\n             the correctness of the previous decision in question dispensing with\n             the need of a specific reference or the order of the Chief Justice\n             constituting the Bench and such listing.

These decisions of high authority seek to reinforce the principles of\n\n    judicial discipline, propriety and comity, which have been followed by\n\n    the courts since time immemorial. Permitting a bench of lesser\n\n    strength to doubt a decision given by a bench of greater strength and\n\n    to refer a given issue to a still larger bench would be in the teeth of\n\n    principles which are well-established and well-entrenched. Doctrines\n\n    of precedents and stare decisis provide a level of certainty to\n\n    individuals appearing before the court and bring a degree of\n\n    objectivity in a largely subjective decision-making process. The\n\n    litigant needs to have confidence that the legal position which has\n\n    been chiselled on the tapestry of law by legal precedents will not be\n\n    unceremoniously       blown    away    through     subsequent      judicial\n\n    commands, which could be ill-advised, like the vagaries of wind and\n\n    weather. It would behove this Court to remember the legal maxim\n\n    interest republicae ut sit finis litium, i.e., it is in the interest of the\n\n    State that there be an end to litigation, and the importance of not\n\n    disturbing legally sound precedents without following the procedure\n\n    established by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_393\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708017\" id=\"span_390\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1862740\" id=\"span_391\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"673494\" id=\"span_392\">28. <a href=\"/doc/673494/\" id=\"a_989\">Although Pradip Chandra Parija</a> (supra), <a href=\"/doc/1862740/\" id=\"a_990\">Hansoli Devi</a> (supra) and\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_991\">Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community</a> (supra) are later\n\n    decisions and were not in existence when the order in Anjuman-e-</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_394\">    Rahmania (supra) was made by the bench of 2 (two) Judges, it\n\n    matters little. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"122986172\" id=\"span_393\">The principle flowing from <a href=\"/doc/122986172/\" id=\"a_992\">Lala Shri Bhagwan</a> (supra)\n\n    bound the bench of 2 (two) Judges in Anjuman-e-Rahmania\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_394\">                                                                           22</span>\n\f(supra).

Besides, it seems elementary though it\n\nrequires to be restated that a bench sitting in a combination of 2\n\n(two) Judges is bound by what is laid down by a Constitution Bench\n\nof 5 (five) Judges and should the bench of lesser strength have valid\n\nreasons to disagree with the view expressed by the latter bench of 5\n\n(five), the former bench of 2 (two) cannot straightway make a\n\nreference for being placed before a Constitution Bench of greater\n\nnumerical strength.

Though the\n\n    second sentence of the said paragraph is a bit ambiguous, but the\n\n    same - read harmoniously with the other sentences - would lead to\n\n    the inevitable conclusion that even in case of a doubt being expressed\n\n    by a bench of 2 (two) Judges in respect of the ratio <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_996\">laid down by</a> a\n\n    bench of 5 (five) Judges, the case on a reference being made (with\n\n    sufficient reasons) ought to be first placed before a bench of 3 (three)\n\n    Judges, and not to a bench of either 5 (five) or 7 (seven) Judges.

Why I perceive the re-referral order to suffer from the same invalidity\n\n    and to be untenable is this. Apart from Anjuman-e-Rahmania\n\n    (supra) being non-est for the reason adverted to above, neither the\n\n    bench of 11 (eleven) Judges in <a href=\"/doc/8064/\" id=\"a_1021\">T.M.A. Pai Foundation</a> (supra) nor\n\n    the Regular Bench of 2 (two) Judges considered it necessary to\n\n    answer question 3(a).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_431\">The order dated 11th March, 2003 observing\n\n    that the question could be answered should a problem arise in future\n\n    did put a quietus, for the time being, to question 3(a), as formulated,\n\n    as well as provided finality qua what was said about <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1022\">Azeez Basha</a>\n\n    (supra) in Anjuman-e-Rahmania (supra).

Exercise of jurisdiction by\n\n    a bench of lesser strength would not permit such an approach. That\n\n    the bench of 3 (three) Judges was presided over by none other than\n\n    the then Chief Justice of India did not make things better and\n\n    ameliorate the circumstances. With due respect and utmost humility\n\n    at my command, although the Chief Justice of India is primus inter\n\n    pares and on the administrative side has powers and authority which\n\n    no puisne Judge has, the Chief Justice of India while discharging\n\n    judicial functions on the bench with a puisne judge or judges may not\n\n    enjoy any power greater than what the puisne judge or judges\n\n    forming the quorum has/have in authoring judgments/ passing\n\n    orders. Therefore, the re-referral order merely by reason of the\n\n    presence of the Chief Justice on the bench did not get sanctified.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_444\">It\n\n    was not that the bench of 3 (three) Judges were not alive to the\n\n    settled law and the principles of judicial propriety, discipline and\n\n    comity; yet, any doubt touching upon the correctness or otherwise of\n\n    the view expressed in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1032\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra), if at all, should not have\n\n    been sought to be resolved by referring the matter directly to a bench\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_445\">                                                                       30</span>\n\fof 7 (seven) Judges.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708017\" id=\"span_446\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1862740\" id=\"span_447\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"673494\" id=\"span_448\">Such an order of reference, apart from being in\n\nthe teeth of <a href=\"/doc/673494/\" id=\"a_1033\">Pradip Chandra Parija</a> (supra), <a href=\"/doc/1862740/\" id=\"a_1034\">Hansoli Devi</a> (supra)\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/708017/\" id=\"a_1035\">Central Board of Dawoodi Bohra Community</a> (supra), could\n\nnot have been justified by reasoning that earlier, the issue had been\n\nreferred to a bench of 7 (seven) Judges.</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"71140963\" id=\"span_449\">It was incumbent on the\n\nbench while hearing <a href=\"/doc/71140963/\" id=\"a_1036\">Aligarh Muslim University</a> (supra) to examine\n\nwhether the referral order made in Anjuman-e-Rahmania (supra)\n\nwas legal and valid.

More often than not, this Court treats procedure as a hindrance\n\n    towards attaining justice rather than treating it as a guardrail to\n\n    ensure fairness and non-arbitrariness while conducting judicial\n\n    proceedings. It must be remembered that at times, leaving aside the\n\n    urge to render substantive justice without following the laid down\n\n    procedure, it is perhaps advisable to follow the procedure as the\n\n    means towards the end.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_411\">37.

Notwithstanding what I have opined above in support of my viewpoint\n\n    that the referral orders are invalid and the references incompetent,\n\n    albeit for technical reasons, there is a weightier reason for declaring\n\n    the referral orders fragile. That is on the merits and I would\n\n    immediately proceed to say why.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_413\">39.

The minority character of AMU as well\n\n      as the contours of rights under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1066\">Article 30(1)</a>, assuming the same to\n\n      be under a cloud of uncertainty, needs to be cleared.

Hon’ble Surya Kant\n\n     and Hon’ble Satish Chandra Sharma, JJ. also seem to have proceeded\n\n     to dispense with the factual inquiry of whether or not AMU is a\n\n     minority educational institution and focussed on the indicia to\n\n     determine the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1067\">Article 30(1).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_432\"> 50. Respectfully, I cannot bring myself to traverse the same path. After\n\n     almost 9 (nine) months the judgment came to be reserved, it pricks\n\n     my conscience to send the matter back once again to an appropriate\n\n     bench; more so, after both sides have exhaustively addressed us on\n\n     the very issue as to whether AMU answers the characteristics of a\n\n     minority institution. In present times, when there is a lot of emphasis\n\n     on pendency of cases and expeditious disposal thereof, precious\n\n     judicial time would be wasted if the same issue has to be agitated yet\n\n     again when such time could be well utilised in answering other\n\n     pressing questions of law. I feel the urge to decide here and now,\n\n     based on whatever indicia we identify or formulate, as well as the\n\n     circumstances - antecedent, attending and surrounding – of the\n\n     relevant time, as to whether AMU is a minority educational institution\n\n     or not. I feel equipped to do so on account of extensive evidence\n\n     having already been led by both sides.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_433\">THE INDICIA\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_434\"> 51. In the majority opinion, the indicia for treating an educational\n\n     institution as a minority educational institution are these:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_477\">                                                                         37</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">\f        I. Ideation of establishment: The brain behind the establishment of\n\n          the institution, as gauged from, inter alia, correspondence and\n\n          government resolutions, should be a member of the minority\n\n          community.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">    II. Purpose:      The   institution   should   have   been       established\n\n          predominantly for the benefit of the minority community, as\n\n          opposed to solely for their benefit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">   III. Implementation: The implementation of the idea to establish the\n\n          institution, with respect to raising of funds, acquisition of land,\n\n          etc. has to be examined. State aid in the same, would not\n\n          adversely affect the minority status of the institution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">    IV. Administration: The right to administer flows as a consequence of\n\n          the institution having been established by the minority. Thus, it is\n\n          not required that the institution be administered by the minority,\n\n          but what is essential is that the administrative structure reflects\n\n          the minority character of the institution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_435\">52. Hon’ble Surya Kant, J. has, however, identified the indicia as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">   I.     <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1068\">Article 30(1)</a> provides for a twin fold test – establishment and\n\n          administration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">  II.     Establishment is to be understood as coming into existence of the\n\n          institution, which is to be holistically gauged from examination of\n\n          factors, inter alia, who is responsible for the genesis of the idea,\n\n          accumulation of funds, framing of charter documents of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_478\">                                                                             38</span>\n\f           educational institution, procuring of government approvals. In\n\n           such acts, the minority community must play a decisive role.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\"> III.      Incorporation of a university under a statute would not necessarily\n\n           mean that the institution is a creature of statute, unless it is the\n\n           Government which has played the decisive role in ideation,\n\n           funding, implementation and operationalising the institution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\"> IV.       Establishment has to be for the benefit of the minority\n\n           community.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">  V.       Administration, at its core, has to vest with the minority\n\n           community. This would include within its fold long term\n\n           administrative roles and day to day sundry decisions. The minority\n\n           community should thus be vested with both, de jure and de facto\n\n           control.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_436\">53. Hon’ble Satish Chandra Sharma, J. has in His Lordship’s draft opinion\n\n        laid out a threefold indicia:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\"> I.        The minority community must play a predominant role, almost to\n\n           the point of exclusion of all other forces, in tangibly bringing about\n\n           the entirety of the institution into existence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\"> II.       The purpose of the institution must be to predominantly serve the\n\n           interests of the minority community, irrespective of the form of\n\n           education provided.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\"> III.      The actual functional, executive, and policy administration should\n\n           rest with the minority community. The real decision making\n\n           authority of the institution should be the minority community.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_479\">                                                                             39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_437\">\f54. While the majority opinion seems to have identified establishment as\n\n    the sole indicium, Hon’ble Surya Kant and Hon’ble Satish Chandra\n\n    Sharma, JJ. have laid equal stress on administration apart from\n\n    establishment as the indicia. Inasmuch as the broad criteria which\n\n    can be used to assess the status of an educational institution is\n\n    concerned, I express my agreement with the indicia laid out by Their\n\n    Lordships.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_438\">55. Taking a cue from the above indicia, what comes to mind is that a\n\n    seed, by itself, cannot germinate into a plant without being sown in\n\n    the soil. It is the farmer’s endeavours of watering, nourishing and\n\n    caring for the seed, not the sheer existence of the seed itself, which\n\n    results in the emergence of the tree. Similarly, mere ideation by itself\n\n    amounts to little if it is not backed by action or implementation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_439\">    Ideation and conceiving of an idea are mere seeds, while the work of\n\n    gathering resources, acquiring land, establishing an administrative\n\n    structure, recruiting teachers, and admitting students are akin to the\n\n    planting and nurturing required for those seeds to grow into a\n\n    flourishing tree. Educational institutions, like all other institutions, are\n\n    an outcome of the coalescence of resources, actions, and meticulous\n\n    planning by the people “establishing” it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_440\">56. Indicia is a term often used in various disciplines including law to\n\n    describe signs or symptoms that suggest the presence of something.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_441\">    When we say that ‘x’ is the indicia of ‘y’, it could be so that ‘x’ could\n\n    be the definite indicium of ‘y’ (implying a comprehensive or exclusive\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_480\">                                                                            40</span>\n\f    indicator); at the same time, it may not necessarily imply that ‘x’ is\n\n    the only indicator of ‘y’ (exhaustiveness) or that ‘x’ guarantees the\n\n    presence of ‘y’ (certainty) or ‘x’ is unique to ‘y’ (specificity). However,\n\n    to suggest that, ‘x’ is the definite indicum of ‘y’, it may not be\n\n    appropriate in the present context where I can identify multiple\n\n    indicia for concluding whether AMU answers the characteristics of a\n\n    minority educational institution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_442\">57. Certain broad indicia, which are universally applicable, may be\n\n    applied   prospectively    to   facilitate   identification   of   minority\n\n    institutions. However, any indicium or the indicia, as identified or\n\n    formulated, for treating an institution as a minority institution may\n\n    not be exhaustive so as to cater to all situations. Previous decisions\n\n    of this Court, as earlier discussed, have also determined the minority\n\n    character of educational institutions vis-à-vis <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1069\">Article 30</a>, as per indicia\n\n    tailored to the specific factual matrices. It could be well-nigh difficult,\n\n    if not impossible, to fix indicia without regard to a whole lot of\n\n    relevant facts and circumstances, which might have escaped notice\n\n    or may not have been visualized. In my humble opinion, a flexible\n\n    framework rather than a rigid one-size-fits-all model is always\n\n    desirable and essential for accurately assessing minority institution\n\n    status. Having regard to special features that each minority\n\n    institution is most likely to have, a nuanced approach would be\n\n    required to identify minority institutions by balancing the general\n\n    guidelines with unique institutional circumstances. The indicia, which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_481\">                                                                            41</span>\n\f         have been proposed, could partly inform classification of minority\n\n         institutions but a tailored evaluation is all the more necessary to\n\n         account for distinct characteristics which each such institution is\n\n         associated with; more so, when AMU is unique in itself and its status\n\n         is under consideration as a standalone institution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_443\"> 58. Having clarified my stance on the general indicia which should\n\n         prospectively     govern   the   evaluation   of   minority   educational\n\n         institutions, I shall now endeavour to be punctilious in assessing the\n\n         status of AMU bearing in mind its unique institutional characteristics.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_444\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_482\">59. However, my consideration of the indicia must be preceded by this\n\n         philosophical musing. If, indeed, indicia for treating an educational\n\n         institution as a minority educational institution have not been either\n\n         identified or formulated by any previous decision of this Court and\n\n         this is the first time an attempt to so identify/formulate is being\n\n         made, can the tests <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1070\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1071\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) which are\n\n         facts specific be held invalid? My answer would be in the negative.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_445\"> 60. Nonetheless, the search for the truth must continue appreciating all\n\n         the relevant factors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_446\"> ESTABLISHMENT OF AMU\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_447\"> 61. AMU traces its origins to its institutional predecessor, MAO College\n\n         which was established on 08th January, 1877. The establishment of\n\n         MAO College was spearheaded by late Sir Syed Ahmed Khan35, a\n\n         national leader who envisioned the idea of a modern and Western\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_483\">35</span>\n     Sir Syed, hereafter\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_484\">                                                                               42</span>\n\f         educational institution for the Muslim community, distinct from the\n\n         traditional madrasas, which otherwise prevailed. There is no contest\n\n         to the fact that that MAO College was established specifically for the\n\n         educational advancement of the Muslims; it is what comes thereafter\n\n         which is the point of contention and calls for being noticed, to the\n\n         extent relevant, and addressed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_448\"> 62. Upon Sir Syed’s death in 1898, the Muslim community in his honour\n\n         started collecting funds with the goal to raise a sum of Rs 1,00,000/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_449\">         (Rupees one lakh only) so that MAO College could evolve into a\n\n         university. It is the appellants’ submission that over a period of 22\n\n         (twenty-two) years, the Muslim community, through the Muslim\n\n         University Association, collected a staggering sum of Rs 30,00,000/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_450\">         (Rupees thirty lakh only) which finally led the British Government to\n\n         agree with the demands for a university, leading to the establishment\n\n         of AMU in 1920.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_451\"> 63. Travelling down memory lane, one is bound to trace the emergence\n\n         of the movement for a Hindu university which, over a period of time,\n\n         took shape with the establishment of the Banaras Hindu University36\n\n         through a similar statute, viz. the Banaras Hindu University Act,\n\n         191537. Despite all the efforts of Sir Syed, who did not consider\n\n         Muslims to be in any way inferior, and the later endeavours to have\n\n         a university established with full control being exercised by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_485\">36</span>\n     BHU, hereafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_486\">37</span>\n     BHU Act, hereafter\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_487\">                                                                            43</span>\n\fMuslim community, refusal of the imperial government to succumb\n\nto the demand was a blow to the aspirations that many of the leaders\n\nof the Aligarh movement harboured. There emerged two disputing\n\nfactions within the Aligarh movement – that of the Loyalists headed\n\nby Aftab Ahmad Khan and the other by Maulana Mohammad Ali, the\n\nlatter being vexed with the increasing control of the imperial\n\ngovernment over the proposed AMU. Once the BHU Act had been\n\npassed leading to establishment of the BHU, the Loyalists realised\n\nthat they were caught between the devil and the deep sea, i.e., they\n\neither accede to the British envisioning of AMU, which was under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">overwhelming government control, or they stick to their demands\n\nand lose out on the proposed university altogether. Writ large was\n\nthe fact that since BHU had not been granted the right of affiliation,\n\nit seemed to be inevitable that the proposed Muslim university will\n\nalso be governed by similar such provisions governing BHU. In a\n\ndecisive meeting of the Muslim University Association, the decision\n\nwas put to a vote and the Loyalists emerged the winner, leading to\n\nthe eventual walkout of the dissenting faction headed by Maulana\n\nMohammad Ali, who would go on to establish Jamia Milia Islamia. A\n\nsalient feature of Jamia was that it was independently funded and\n\nthrived without any aid from the imperial government. Registered in\n\n1939 as Jamia Milia Islamia Society, the institution was deemed to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_488\">                                                                   44</span>\n\f         be a University under section 3 of the University Grants Commission\n\n         Act, 195638 in 1962.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_452\"> 64. Much would turn on this piece of historical evidence while\n\n         appreciating whether AMU was an institution established by the\n\n         Muslim community.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_453\"> 65. Further, in British India, the legislative framework governing\n\n         educational institutions was such that schools and colleges, such as\n\n         MAO     College,   could   be   established   by   private   persons, but\n\n         universities in particular were exclusively within the domain of the\n\n         Governor General-in-Council39. Though there existed no legal bar to\n\n         the establishment of universities by private individuals or societies,\n\n         the British Government granted recognition only to degrees issued\n\n         by universities which were creatures of statute. It is the appellants’\n\n         submission that in such a context, the appellants had no recourse but\n\n         to obtain the concurrence of the British Government, if Sir Syed’s\n\n         dream was ever to be realised. It is pressed that the British\n\n         Government enacted the AMU Act only upon furnishing of adequate\n\n         funds by the Muslim community, and hence, though AMU was a\n\n         statutory institution, it was argued to be established by the Muslims,\n\n         for the Muslims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_454\"> 66. <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1072\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution guarantees to minorities, religious\n\n         and linguistic, the right to establish and administer educational\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_489\">38</span>\n     <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1073\">UGC Act</a>, hereafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_490\">39</span>\n     GGIC, hereafter\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_491\">                                                                               45</span>\n\f       institutions of their choice.

While on the subject, a study of contrasts would be of profit, if one\n\n         were to examine the founding Acts of one contemporary university,\n\n         i.e., the Annamalai University Act, 192840. It would also be of profit to\n\n         examine the Visva Bharati Act, 195141, which came to be enacted\n\n         immediately after India attained independence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_458\">70.

It is evident upon bare perusal of the above extracts that while\n\n      establishing the respective universities, which are obviously statutory\n\n      creations, the 1928 Act and the 1951 Act categorically recognise\n\n      establishment of the respective predecessor institution by its founder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_461\">      Annamalai University and Visva Bharati University are synonymous\n\n      with Sir Annamalai Chettiar and Gurudeb Rabindra Nath Thakur,\n\n      respectively; however, the AMU Act is woefully bereft of the same or\n\n      similar recognition. The AMU Act is conspicuously silent on two major\n\n      elements which the appellants argue was what brought AMU into\n\n      existence – the contributions of Sir Syed and that of the donations\n\n      collected en masse from the Muslim community in order to establish\n\n      the erstwhile MAO College. If the institution was truly founded by the\n\n      minority community, as contended by the appellants, there is no\n\n      reason why the Preamble would not have been drafted in a similar\n\n      manner so as to highlight the same. I am unable to subscribe to the\n\n      majority opinion of recognition of the respective founders in the 1928\n\n      Act and the 1951 Act being of no relevance.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_462\">73.   It would be further apposite to examine the enactments establishing\n\n      two other minority universities. Firstly, the Sam Higginbottom\n\n      University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Uttar Pradesh Act,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_497\">                                                                                  48</span>\n\f      2016, whose Preamble decisively recognises the establishment of the\n\n      said university by the minority Christian community, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">           “<a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_1083\">An Act</a> to establish and incorporate a Teaching, Research and\n           Extension University with a view to upgrade and reconstitute the\n           existing Sam Higginbottom Institute of Agriculture, Technology\n           and Sciences (Deemed-to-be- University), Allahabad, established\n           and administered by the Ecumenical Minority Christian Society\n           namely the Sam Higginbottom Educational and Charitable\n           Society, Higginbottom House, 4- Agricultural Institute, Allahabad-\n           211007, Registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_1084\">Society Registration Act, 1860</a> in\n           the State of Uttar Pradesh, and to provide for natters connected\n           therewith or incidental thereto.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_463\">74.   Secondly, the preamble of Era University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Act,\n\n      2016, unambiguously recognises the minority character of the\n\n      institution by stating that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">           “Preamble\n           An Act to establish and incorporate a teaching University sponsored by\n           Era Educational Trust duly established and administered by the\n           members of Muslim Minority community,\n           ***\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">           2.

Thus, these enactments are in stark contrast to the AMU Act, insofar\n\n      as they categorically recognise the factum of establishment and\n\n      administration   of   the   universities   by   the   respective   minority\n\n      community.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_465\">76.   Proceeding further, section 7 of the AMU Act states that:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_498\">                                                                              49</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\">\f          “The University shall invest and keep invested in securities in which\n          trust funds may be invested in accordance with the law for the time\n          being in force relating to trusts in British India a sum of thirty lakhs of\n          rupees as a permanent endowment to meet the recurring charges of\n          the University other than charges in respect of Fellowships,\n          Scholarships, Prizes and rewards…”\n                                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n      Therefore, the sum of Rs 30,00,000/- (Rupees Thirty lakh only)\n\n      collected by donations across the country was not spent in the\n\n      establishment of AMU; rather, it was to be used as a fund to meet\n\n      recurring expenditure. The appellants have repeatedly underscored\n\n      the contribution made by the Muslim community, motivated to do the\n\n      same by a systematic and sustained effort on the part of Sir Syed, in\n\n      the setting up of AMU. The impact of such a monetary contribution\n\n      cannot be gainsaid, but can the same be equated to establishment of\n\n      AMU? I think not. The efforts of the Muslim community in leading to\n\n      the establishment of AMU were no doubt monumental in spearheading\n\n      the movement, and perhaps without such efforts AMU would never\n\n      have become a reality, but this cannot by any stretch of imagination\n\n      mean that the community itself established AMU.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_466\">77.   There is no contest that MAO College was a minority institution, but\n\n      AMU would not be endowed with the same characteristic solely on\n\n      account of tracing its lineage from MAO College. The same is evidenced\n\n      by section 4 of the AMU Act, which is reproduced hereinbelow:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">          “4.

AMU was, thus, an institution unto itself, distinct from MAO\n\n        College. There was a clear and statutory break from the antecedent\n\n        history, and the character of AMU as it were, has to be examined on\n\n        its own merit.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_467\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545248\" id=\"span_500\">78.     The appellants have relied on a number of decisions to contend that a\n\n        university could also be a minority institution, foremost of which was\n\n        St. Stephen’s <a href=\"/doc/1545248/\" id=\"a_1086\">College vs. University of Delhi42</a>.

Though both are educational institutions which come\n\n      under the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1087\">Article 30(1)</a>, they are not synonymous with each\n\n      other and are markedly different, particularly in one aspect, i.e.,\n\n      universities only can confer degrees while colleges cannot unless, as\n\n      in present days, a college is also deemed to be a university and can\n\n      award degrees. MAO College when it existed, established by Muslim\n\n      individuals, could not confer degrees and it was only Allahabad\n\n      University, of which MAO College was an affiliated college, that could\n\n      award degrees.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_468\">79.   As rightly contended by the learned Attorney General, the private\n\n      individuals who had set up MAO College were not legislatively\n\n      competent to establish a university in the first place. Being devoid of\n\n      the authority to establish, the power to do which was the sole preserve\n\n      of the British Government, the establishment of AMU could not possibly\n\n      be owed to the Muslim community. An example of this is section 6 of\n\n      the AMU Act, which stated that degrees conferred by AMU would be\n\n      recognised by the Government. The provision states:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_261\">          “6. Recognition of degrees. – The degrees, diplomas and other academic\n          distinctions granted or conferred to or on persons by the University shall\n          be recognised by the Central and State Governments as are the\n          corresponding degrees, diplomas and other academic distinctions\n          granted by any other University incorporated under any enactment.”\n\n      As has been discussed, the only universities whose degrees were\n\n      recognised by the Government were those established by statute.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_503\">                                                                                52</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_262\">\f         Degrees issued by private universities were not recognised by the\n\n         British Government. The degrees issued by AMU being officially\n\n         recognised, it could not, as a logical corollary, be said that AMU was\n\n         established by the Muslim community. The university being brought\n\n         into existence solely by virtue of the statute, its establishment could\n\n         not be owed to anything other than the statute.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_469\">80.

The appellants advocated for the verb “to establish” to be interpreted\n\n         widely so as to mean “to found”.

The two words are very\n\n      distinct in their purport and understanding.

A perusal of the decisions of this Court, which\n\n      shall     be   discussed     henceforth,     categorically     evinces    that   this\n\n      contention is untenable in law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_473\">83.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"686466\" id=\"span_506\">In <a href=\"/doc/686466/\" id=\"a_1090\">Very Rev.

It was seriously contended before us that any minority, even a single\n             individual belonging to a minority, could found a minority institution and\n             had the right so to do under the Constitution and neither the\n             government nor the University could deny the society’s right to establish\n             a minority institution, at the very threshold as it were, howsoever, they\n             may impose regulatory measures in the interests of uniformity,\n             efficiency and excellence of education. The fallacy of the argument\n             insofar as the instant case is concerned lies in thinking that neither the\n             government nor the University has the right to go behind the claim that\n             the institution is a minority institution and to investigate and satisfy\n             itself whether the claim is well-founded or ill-founded. The government,\n             the University and ultimately the court have the undoubted right to\n             pierce the ‘minority veil’ — with due apologies to the corporate lawyers\n             — and discover whether there is lurking behind it no minority at all and\n             in any case, no minority Institution. The object of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1094\">Article 30(1)</a> is not to\n             allow bogies to be raised by pretenders but to give the minorities ‘a\n             sense of security and a feeling of confidence’ not merely by\n             guaranteeing the right to profess, practise and propagate religion to\n             religious minorities and the right to conserve their language, script and\n             culture to linguistic minorities, but also to enable all minorities, religious\n             or linguistic, to establish and administer educational institutions of their\n             choice. These institutions must be educational institutions of the\n             minorities in truth and reality and not mere masked phantoms. They\n             may be institutions intended to give the children of the minorities the\n             best general and professional education, to make them complete men\n             and women of the country and to enable them to go out into the world\n             fully prepared and equipped. They may be institutions where special\n             provision is made to the advantage and for the advancement of the\n             minority children. They may be institutions where the parents of the\n             children of the minority community may expect that education in\n             accordance with the basic tenets of their religion would be imparted by\n             or under the guidance of teachers, learned and steeped in the faith.\n             They may be institutions where the parents expect their children to\n             grow in a pervasive atmosphere which is in harmony with their religion\n             or conducive to the pursuit of it. What is important and what is\n             imperative is that there must exist some real positive index to enable\n             the institution to be identified as an educational institution of the\n             minorities. We have already said that in the present case apart from the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_510\"> 44</span>\n      (1986) 2 SCC 667\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_511\">                                                                                       55</span>\n\f           half a dozen words ‘as a Christian minorities’ institution’ occurring in\n           one of the objects recited in the memorandum of association, there is\n           nothing whatever, in the memorandum or the articles of association or\n           in the actions of the society to indicate that the institution was intended\n           to be a minority educational institution.

There have been extensive submissions on the nature of the Court of\n\n     AMU, and much reliance has been placed by the appellants on section\n\n     23(2) of the AMU Act. According to the appellants, the Court of AMU is\n\n     the supreme governing body of the university. At first blush, this\n\n     submission by the appellants seems reasonable; however, on closer\n\n     examination of the statute, this submission cannot be accepted. <a href=\"/doc/1652564/\" id=\"a_1102\">Section\n\n     23(2)</a> gives only residuary powers to the Court of AMU over matters not\n\n     explicitly provided for in the AMU Act and rules of the University.

In view of the consensus on the\n\n        point that ‘and’ between ‘establish’ and ‘administer’ has to be read\n\n        and understood as ‘and’ and not ‘or’, the discussion is rendered\n\n        practically academic. However, some discussion on the topic is\n\n        considered worthwhile having regard to the re-referral order in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/71140963/\" id=\"a_1107\">Aligarh Muslim University</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_503\">  104.

It is well settled that\n\n\n     the word “and” connotes a conjunctive nature whereas the word “or”\n\n     connotes a disjunctive meaning. Though the terms can be, in\n\n     exceptional circumstances, interchangeably interpreted with the aim\n\n     of fulfilling the legislative intent, there is nothing in the provision,\n\n     which impels us to read and understand the word other than what is\n\n     conveyed by its ordinary meaning.

There is by now, fairly abundant case law on the questions\n               as to ‘minority’; the minority’s right to ‘establish’, and their\n               right to ‘administer’ educational institutions. These questions\n               have arisen in regard to a variety of institutions all over the\n               country. They have arisen in regard to Christians, Muslims and\n               in regard to certain sects of Hindus and linguistic groups. The\n               courts in certain cases have accepted without much scrutiny\n               the version of the claimant that the institution in question was\n               founded by a minority community while in some cases the\n               courts have examined very minutely the proof of the\n               establishment of the institution.

Finally, reference to <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1114\">Azeez Basha</a> (supra) again, is considered\n\n    relevant. The argument raised before the Court was a bit different in\n\n    the sense that right to administer AMU was claimed by almost\n\n    abandoning the claim that AMU was established by the minority\n\n    community. It was held that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_285\">          “It is to our mind quite clear that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1115\">Article 30(1)</a> postulates that\n          the religious community will have the right to establish and\n          administer educational institutions of their choice meaning\n          thereby that where a religious minority establishes an\n          educational institution, it will have the right to administer that.\n          An argument has been raised to the effect that even though\n          the religions (sic, religious) minority may not have established\n          the educational institution, it will have the right to administer\n          it, if by some process it has been administering the same before\n          the Constitution came into force. We are not prepared to accept\n          this argument. The Article in our opinion clearly shows that the\n          minority will have the right to administer educational\n          institutions of their choice provided they have established\n          them, but not otherwise. The article cannot be read, to mean\n          that even if the educational institution has been established by\n          somebody else, any religious minority would have the right to\n          administer it because, for some reason or other, it might have\n          been administering it before the Constitution came into force.\n          The words ‘establish and administer’ in the article must be read\n          conjunctively and so read it gives the right to the minority to\n          administer an educational institution provided it has been\n          established by it. In this connection our attention was drawn to\n          In re: The Kerala Education Bill, 1957 [(159) SCR 995] where,\n          it is argued, this Court had held that the minority can\n          administer an educational institution even though it might not\n          have established it. In that case an argument was raised that\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1116\">Article 30(1)</a> protection was given only to educational\n          institutions established after the Constitution came into force.\n          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_529\">That argument was turned down by this Court for the obvious\n          reason that if that interpretation was given to <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1117\">Article 30(1)</a> it\n          would be robbed of much of its content. But that case in our\n          opinion did not lay down that the words ‘establish and\n          administer’ in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1118\">Article 30(1)</a> should be read disjunctively, so that\n          though a minority might not have established an educational\n          institution it had the right to administer it. It is true that at p.\n          1062 the Court spoke of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1119\">Article 30(1)</a> giving two rights to a\n          minority i.e. (i) to establish and (ii) to administer.

The majority opinion, though extensive, seems to have created an\n\n     existential impasse, akin to the Chakravyuh orchestrated by\n\n     Dronacharya. While it is mentioned in paragraph 73 of the revised\n\n     draft opinion that “Article 30(1) cannot extend to a situation where\n\n     the minority community which establishes an educational institution\n\n     has no intention to administer it”, it has been opined at paragraph\n\n     156 (could also be 155) that “In the preceding sections we have held\n\n     that establishment by a minority is the only indicia for a minority\n\n     educational institution”. To my mind, these two positions create an\n\n     inherent contradiction which is as perplexing to solve as the\n\n     Chakravyuh was for Abhimanyu, inasmuch as it lays out mutually\n\n     exclusive positions of law which cannot possibly co-exist. In view\n\n     thereof, a question comes to my mind that if a minority community\n\n     establishes an educational institution and thereafter abandons its\n\n     administration to rank outsiders, can such an institution be said to\n\n     merit protection under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1130\">Article 30(1)</a>, if establishment is the only\n\n     indicium, as held in the majority opinion?

Excerpts from Mr. Chagla’s speech in the Parliament50\n\n         read as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_288\">             “In my opinion, the Aligarh Muslim University is a national institution,\n             an institution of national importance. There are four Central\n             universities: there is the Banaras Hindu University; there is the Aligarh\n             Muslim University; there is the Delhi University; and there is the\n             Visvabharati University. All these institutions are institutions of national\n             importance. If you look at the Seventh Schedule entry 63 therein is very\n             significant; entry 63 of List I of the Seventh Schedule gives the power\n             to the Parliament to legislate […]\n\n             My submission to this House is that Aligarh University has neither been\n             established nor is being administered by the Muslim Community. […]\n             You had first the Muslim college which was founded by Sir Syed Ahmed.\n             Sir Syed Ahmed has asked the British Government of those days to\n             establish a university and the British Government established the\n             University. Therefore, the establishment of the institution was by the\n             legislature and not by the community […] Now I cannot understand how\n             it can be said that the administration is in the hands of the minorities.\n             The administration of the University depends upon the law. During the\n             British times it depended upon this Act. After independence it depends\n             upon the Act, as had been amended by the Parliament. Does Mr.\n             Anthony suggest that it is open to the Aligarh University or the Muslim\n             community to change the administration of the university even to the\n             slightest degree and go contrary to what the Parliament has laid down?\n             If the minority had the right to administer the Aligarh University, then\n             it can have any administration it liked; it can change the administration\n             and it can close down the University; it can change the constitution of\n             the court or the Executive Council. Can it do so? Even the constitution\n             of the court, of the executive council and of the academic council is\n             regulated and not by the minority committee but by the Parliament.\n             There is another aspect of the matter which Mr. Anthony has completely\n             forgotten. He has attached great importance to the fact that under the\n             Act of 1920, the British Government, as a concession, said that the court\n             shall consist wholly of Muslims. Now everybody know that the University\n             is administered by the executive council and not by the court. The court\n             of course is the supreme authority and it is like a show-piece. It meets\n             once a year; lots of people come there and make speeches and pass\n             resolutions. But the day-to day administration, selection, appointments,\n             and so on are carried on by the executive council and it is significant\n             that even in the British days it was not provided that the executive\n             council shall consist only of Muslims. That clearly shows that the British\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_540\">49</span>\n     Lok Sabha Debates, Twelfth Session, Third Series Vol. XLIV – No. 9, 27th August 1965\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_541\">50</span>\n     Lok Sabha Debates, Twelfth Session, Third Series Vol. XLIV – No. 9, 27th August 1965\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_542\">                                                                                      69</span>\n\f             Government did not concede the argument. Although there is no\n             Constitution then the arguments is now advanced by Mr. Anthony that\n             the minority has a right to administer a particular institution. I say that\n             this institution was not established by the minority; nor is it being\n             administered by the minority community. That is the legal position as\n             far as <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1131\">Article 30</a> is concerned.”51\n\n                                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_520\">118. Prof. Nurul Hasan, a reputed historian, followed in the footsteps of\n\n         Mr. M.C. Chagla as the Minister of Education. This is what Prof. Hasan\n\n         had to say in Parliament:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_289\">             “**Regards the third objection that as a minority institution it is only\n             Muslims who should be on the Court and on the Executive Council and\n             they should have an exclusive hand in the management of the\n             University, hon Members are aware of the writ which had been filed in\n             the Supreme Court. It has since been withdrawn. Mr. Chagla has\n             expressed his opinion on the legal aspect of the matter. He thinks that\n             this University was not established by the minorities, but by Parliament\n             and, therefore, this objection is not right. As far as interpretation of the\n             Constitution is concerned, I see no reason to differ from the\n             interpretation given by him. I do feel, however, that the spirit\n             underlying the Constitution should not be lost sight of. As far as the\n             objection that there should be only Muslims, who should manage the\n             affairs of the University, is concerned, I know that one of our learned\n             colleagues, Shri P. N. Sapru, has been on the Executive Council of the\n             University for quite a number of years.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_521\">119. The inclusion of AMU in Entry 63 of List I conferred upon it a distinct\n\n         status of being an “institution of national importance”. The\n\n         Constitution itself did not categorize AMU as either a minority\n\n         institution or otherwise. Following the adoption of the Constitution in\n\n         1950, amendments were promptly enacted to the AMU Act in 1951\n\n         and again in 1965. These amendments were designed to align with\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_543\">51</span>\n     Lok Sabha Debates, Twelfth Session, Third Series Vol. XLV- No. 13, 2nd September 1965\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_544\">                                                                                      70</span>\n\f     constitutional provisions and to reflect the status of AMU as an\n\n     “institution of national importance”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_522\">120. Entry 63 grants exclusive legislative authority over the specified\n\n     universities therein to Parliament, and to any other institution\n\n     declared by Parliament by law to be an institution of national\n\n     importance.    The   scheme    of   Entry   63,   which   constitutionally\n\n     designates AMU, BHU and Delhi University as institutions of national\n\n     importance, is sufficient to indicate that AMU is not a minority\n\n     institution. Absence of specific names of universities other than the\n\n     ones in Entry 63 or anywhere else in the Constitution cements AMU’s\n\n     distinctive status as an institution of national importance, with its\n\n     national and non-minority character at the forefront. There could be\n\n     other institutions of national importance, even institutions which have\n\n     minority character, but such institutions being designated by ordinary\n\n     laws would never reach the elevated status of AMU.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_523\">121. As clearly distinguishable from other entries in the three lists forming\n\n     part of Schedule VII, which only provide the vast field of subjects\n\n     pertaining to which laws could be enacted by the Centre/the States,\n\n     it is essential to interpret Entry 63 of List I not merely as a field over\n\n     which Parliament has the authority to make a law but also as a\n\n     Constitutional provision of recognition of certain institutions as\n\n     ‘institutions of national importance’. The language of the Entry\n\n     explicitly designates these institutions with a unique status, thereby\n\n     affirming their designation as universities of national importance.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_545\">                                                                            71</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_524\">\f     Thus, it would be inappropriate to construe this Entry solely as a\n\n     legislative subject without acknowledging its broader implications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_525\">122. In light of the above, an institution having secular traits which was\n\n     designated as one of national importance by the framers of the\n\n     Constitution and enshrined in the Constitution adopted in 1950,\n\n     cannot be retroactively reclassified as a minority Muslim institution in\n\n     2024 without violating the secular principles that underpin our\n\n     Constitution. Such a reclassification would fundamentally conflict with\n\n     the secular ethos embedded in our Constitutional framework, which\n\n     upholds the equal status of all institutions irrespective of religious\n\n     affiliation. The original intent was to recognize these institutions for\n\n     their national significance, and altering this status now would\n\n     undermine the foundational values of secularism and equality that\n\n     guide our Constitutional order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_526\">123. Moreover, universities of national importance, such as AMU, cannot\n\n     be subordinated to the control of any minority community or\n\n     particular group. Their national character necessitates that they\n\n     remain under the jurisdiction of the Central Government to ensure\n\n     that their operations and management align with their designated\n\n     national significance. This is crucial as the Central Government\n\n     provides full funding for these institutions, which is vital for their\n\n     continued existence. The control of the Central Government and the\n\n     Parliament’s jurisdiction to legislate on AMU could in a way be\n\n     terminated if the minority community is conceded the right to close\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_546\">                                                                          72</span>\n\f     down AMU even. A ‘right to administer’ (although may not include\n\n     the ‘right to maladminister’) could include the ‘right not to administer’\n\n     and, thus, bring about a closure of AMU. This would not be in the\n\n     greater national interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_527\">124. AMU’s status having been firmly established upon the adoption of the\n\n     Constitution through its inclusion in Entry 63 of List I, any alteration\n\n     of AMU’s status—particularly as executed by the Amendment of\n\n     1981— is untenable. Any such modification must be effected through\n\n     an appropriate Constitutional amendment under Entry 63 of List I,\n\n     adhering to the procedure set forth in <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_1132\">Article 368</a> of the Constitution\n\n     and such changes cannot be made merely by amending the relevant\n\n     statute, i.e., the AMU Act. Under these circumstances, the intention\n\n     of the framers of the Constitution to affirm the national and secular\n\n     character of AMU may not be altered, particularly not in the manner\n\n     proposed by the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_528\">125.

There is,\n\nhowever, no such tether insofar as debates of the Constituent\n\nAssembly or proceedings of Parliament are concerned. Judicial notice\n\nthereof can be taken without any reservation and what have been\n\ndebated, as seen from documented records, are assumed to be\n\ncorrect.

Judges of the Supreme Court of India are no doubt the final arbiters\n\n     in resolving disputes and differences between the parties; however,\n\n     the recent judicial trend of eschewing all that is old, for the sake of\n\n     progress and constitutional dynamism, is disturbing. We, the Judges,\n\n     at times tend to forget the confines of our own jurisdiction and that\n\n     we too, like every other human, are fallible. We are meant to be\n\n     guided in our approach by Constitutional morality and the words of\n\n     the architects of the Constitution. Facilitating history to be re-written,\n\n     more than a century later by a judicial opinion, is not what we, as\n\n     Judges, are supposed to do. Additionally, in matters such as the one\n\n     under consideration, there is no warrant for the thought process to\n\n     gain ground that Judges of this Court who had authored opinions in\n\n     the relevant past were wrong and that the present generation of\n\n     Judges are correct. Judicial deference, in my view, ought to have\n\n     leaned towards the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1158\">Article 30(1)</a> that has stood the\n\n     test of time for almost 75 (seventy-five) years since the Constitution\n\n     has been in existence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_541\">134. It is doubtful whether any of us, as Judges, would lay a claim to be\n\n     omniscient. The limitations of a Judge’s expertise would negate any\n\n     assertion of authority in extra-legal areas as well as to claim special\n\n     knowledge of what the canvas was prior to 1920 when AMU came to\n\n     be established. Conscious as I am of my limitations, it would be a\n\n     misadventure on my part to agree with the majority opinion and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_565\">                                                                           78</span>\n\fcommand the appropriate bench to determine whether AMU was\n\nestablished by the minority community based on the indicium\n\nproposed therein, post-independence decisions of this Court and\n\nliberal ideas of present times, without there being credible material\n\nof proof that AMU, all along, was perceived as an educational\n\ninstitution established ‘by the Muslim community’, as distinguished\n\nfrom ‘for the Muslim community’, even during the pre-Constitution\n\ndays. Whether or not an educational institution has been established\n\nby a particular community has to be judged bearing in mind all\n\nantecedent, attending and surrounding circumstances of the relevant\n\ntime. No one can claim with certainty that the entirety of the\n\ndialogue/correspondence/incidents/events, which did precede the\n\nestablishment of AMU, have been placed before us and that too with\n\ncent percent accuracy. Such being the state of affairs, we ought not\n\nto substitute historical facts by our appreciation of half-baked\n\nevidence. Notwithstanding the knowledge, erudition and eminence\n\nthat some of us have been gifted with, I am sceptical as to whether\n\nany of us can claim to be more learned than those who played\n\nsignificant roles in framing of the Constitution. It is not as if they were\n\nwholly unaware of the circumstances of the yesteryears. If ‘establish’\n\nwere to be read as ‘found’, there is no reason as to why the framers\n\ndid not express themselves differently by using ‘to found’ instead of\n\n‘to establish’ or, in the alternative, both - but one after the other.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_566\">                                                                         79</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_542\">\f135. Tinkering with understanding of a Constitutional provision, which has\n\n     been consistent and has stood the test of time since its inception, in\n\n     the name of interpretation and overruling of longstanding precedents\n\n     is too frequent an occurrence which judicial activism has brought\n\n     about, sometimes unnecessarily, in the past couple of decades. It is\n\n     time that we refrain from such an approach, unless absolutely\n\n     required, and allow the people’s will to prevail and the Constitution\n\n     to reign supreme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_543\">136. Turning to the point of indicia, the tests employed for identifying\n\n     post-Constitution minority educational institutions cannot be the\n\n     same as for identification of pre-Constitution institutions, more so\n\n     when a college established by the minority is elevated to the status\n\n     of a university upon establishment and incorporation through statute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_544\">     There can be no dispute that an educational institution undoubtedly\n\n     established prior to the Constitution coming into force by a minority\n\n     community, either based on religion or language, and administered\n\n     as well by such community would be entitled to the protection\n\n     envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1159\">Article 30(1).</a> However, if there is a serious doubt as to\n\n     who established the educational institution and how it was\n\n     established, question of piercing of the minority veil does not arise in\n\n     the absence of any concept of minority when the institution came to\n\n     be established. One has to understand, in this regard, the purpose\n\n     for which the minority community is sought to be extended protection\n\n     post-Constitution era. The dominant purpose is to protect the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_567\">                                                                          80</span>\n\f    minority from the domination of the majority. Until independence of\n\n    India was achieved, irrespective of whether a ‘native’ so called was a\n\n    Hindu or a Sikh or a Muslim or a Christian or a Jain or a Buddhist or\n\n    a Zoroastrian, each individual irrespective of his faith was the subject\n\n    of colonial rule with little freedom. The concept of minority being\n\n    totally absent in those days, extending the protective umbrella of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1160\">Article 30</a> to AMU by proposing to hold that establishment by a\n\n    minority is the only indicia for a minority educational institution\n\n    without any indicia as to administration of such institution would be\n\n    inherently contradictory to the terms of such article and susceptible\n\n    to invalidity. Formulating indicia now without there being a holistic\n\n    consideration of all relevant factors ought not to be embarked upon\n\n    by the Court as a task particularly when earlier benches, including\n\n    benches larger than this one, have jettisoned the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_545\">137. Though schools, colleges and universities are all known to be\n\n    educational institutions, their purposes and direction are different.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_546\">    Depending upon the areas of focus and emphasis, they vary in\n\n    importance too. Education remains largely incomplete without a basic\n\n    bachelor’s degree, which a student obtains by qualifying in the\n\n    relevant examination conducted by the university to which the\n\n    college,   where   he   studied,   is   affiliated.   One   other   major\n\n    distinguishing feature is the way each institution is created. In the\n\n    days with which we are concerned, a school or college could be\n\n    privately created but not a university. To ‘found’ an institution such\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_568\">                                                                          81</span>\n\f     as a school or a college or a university cannot be equated with its\n\n     ‘establishment’. Conscious of such limitation, the argument of\n\n     construing <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1161\">Article 30(1)</a> in a manner such that the verb ‘to establish’\n\n     does not call for being read in a narrow and formalistic sense and in\n\n     its expansive reading ought to take within its fold ‘to found’ would\n\n     only beg the question that AMU was not established but, at best,\n\n     found by the Muslim community.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_547\">138. The parties having agreed that the words ‘establish’ and ‘administer’\n\n     must be read conjunctively, there can be little doubt that\n\n     administration has to necessarily follow establishment. It is axiomatic\n\n     that to enjoy the protection that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1162\">Article 30(1)</a> guarantees, the right\n\n     of the minority community to administer an educational institution\n\n     can be claimed only if the educational institution is established by it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_548\">     Also, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1163\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot extend to a situation where the minority\n\n     community which establishes an educational institution shows no or\n\n     little intention to administer it. This being the unequivocal position in\n\n     law, it would be an indicium as to whether the educational institution,\n\n     apart from being established by the minority, was or is being\n\n     administered by the minority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_549\">139. For the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1164\">Article 30</a>, the right to establish and the right to\n\n     administer must go hand in hand. Once established, administration\n\n     of the institution begins. In order to attract the protection guaranteed\n\n     by <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1165\">Article 30</a>, it would not be sufficient for the minority community to\n\n     say that though it might have established the institution, whether to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_569\">                                                                           82</span>\n\f     administer it or not is a choice given by the article itself so much so\n\n     that the administration can be wholly left to even a non-minority\n\n     community. Only those institutions which are established by the\n\n     minority community and are being administered by such community\n\n     may exercise their choice of whether to establish a school or a college\n\n     or a university as well as the manner and mode of management of\n\n     such institution. These are of course tests which need to be applied\n\n     to specific institutions which have not been brought into existence\n\n     through a statute. If any institution is a creature of a statute, various\n\n     other circumstances need to be holistically considered. Whether or\n\n     not AMU is a minority institution presents a unique case bearing no\n\n     similarity with any other pre-independence university.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_550\">140. Having regard to the state of affairs existing in India during the last\n\n     quarter of the nineteenth century and the first two decades of the\n\n     twentieth century, there can be no disagreement that both the Hindus\n\n     and the Muslims were aspiring to have universities to cater to the\n\n     needs of their respective communities. The imperial government,\n\n     however, was not prepared to give up an inch and hand over control\n\n     of the proposed universities to either community. The Hindus\n\n     relented and BHU came to be established in 1915. The Muslims too\n\n     wished to have a university but the degree of control sought to be\n\n     exercised by the imperial government brought about the rift, referred\n\n     to earlier. What followed was sort of a compromise. The Muslim\n\n     community relented in the same manner the Hindus had relented to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_570\">                                                                           83</span>\n\f     get BHU established, leading to the process for establishment of AMU.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_551\">     The Loyalists mixed priority with pragmatism. Prioritisation meant\n\n     focus on the most essential thing, i.e., establishment of AMU, and by\n\n     being pragmatic, they recognised their limitations of being unable to\n\n     administer a university. Once AMU came to be established through\n\n     statute   and   became   a   body    corporate,   there   was   a   total\n\n     relinquishment of all claims. The land used for AMU was a public land;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_552\">     the funds for AMU were sourced to public money; the person at the\n\n     helm of administration was the Rector, who was none other than the\n\n     Governor General; and the sum of Rs. 30 lakh that belonged to the\n\n     Muslim community and which they were prepared to spend for AMU\n\n     was kept as the reserve fund, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_553\">141. Assuming that the verb ‘to establish’ could be read as ‘to found’,\n\n     although I found no warrant to so read, it is clear that the Muslim\n\n     community had no intention to administer AMU which was left to be\n\n     worked out as per the AMU Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_554\">142. There are a couple of other aspects, which must not escape notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_555\">143. First, AMU is a creature of a statute and is engaged in discharging\n\n     public duties. By passage of time, AMU happens to be one of the\n\n     foremost Central Universities in the country. It is, however, entirely\n\n     dependent on finances allocated by the Central Government. It is\n\n     mandatorily required to function as per the AMU Act as well as\n\n     provisions of other enactments. There can, thus, be no doubt that\n\n     AMU is an <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1166\">Article 12</a> authority. Being an <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1167\">Article 12</a> authority, it is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_571\">                                                                          84</span>\n\f    bound by all the articles in Part III of the Constitution which impose\n\n    duty upon it inter alia to ensure equality and fairness in all its actions\n\n    including <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1168\">Article 29(2).</a> In the present context, <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1169\">Article 30(1)</a> cannot\n\n    be divorced from <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1170\">Article 29(2).</a> The scope of ‘choice’ of the minority\n\n    as in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1171\">Article 30(1)</a>, if at all it has established AMU, could diminish for\n\n    an institution such as AMU, for, it is always subject to the\n\n    Constitutional provisions and the enactment that has created it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_556\">    Whatever the Constitution as well as the AMU Act now provides or\n\n    could provide in future, would represent the will of the people of\n\n    India, and not the will of the minority. It, therefore, admits of no\n\n    doubt that in administrative, functional and financial matters, the\n\n    control of AMU vests in assigned entities not designated by the\n\n    minority community. This being the status of AMU, it would be an\n\n    indicium of not being an educational institution over which and in\n\n    respect whereof the minority has a choice to administer it in the\n\n    manner the minority prefers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_557\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_572\">144. Secondly, regard must be had to how <a href=\"/doc/8064/\" id=\"a_1172\">TMA Pai Foundation</a> (supra)\n\n    answered questions 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c). The declaration of law seems\n\n    to be clear that the minority community administering an aided\n\n    minority educational institution does not enjoy full liberty to act as\n\n    per its choice in matters relating to admission of students. Admission\n\n    has to be on the basis of merit and it will also be permissible for the\n\n    Government to provide that consideration should be shown to the\n\n    weaker sections of the society.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_573\">                                                                          85</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_558\">\f145.

We should be careful not to abridge the rights enumerated in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1173\">Article 15</a> in our quest to expand and solidify the rights provided in\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1174\">Article 30.</a> The architects of the Constitution were acutely aware of\n\n     the stratified nature of our society. To minimise this stratification, the\n\n     framers made a concerted effort towards integrating various\n\n     communal identities into a composite national identity of “Indians”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_560\">     The immediacy of this exercise can be garnered from the preamble\n\n     to the Constitution, where we find the idea of fraternity, a\n\n     brotherhood of Indians.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_561\">146. The idea of substantive equality, which arose as a remedy to the\n\n     historical injustices suffered by the        members     of the    SC/ST\n\n     community, was central to this new national identity. This national\n\n     identity is manifested in institutions such as AMU, which has\n\n     pioneered the idea that India and its institutions, belong, and are\n\n     open to all Indians, irrespective of caste, creed, religion, or sex. To\n\n     remove an institution like AMU from this national project would hurt\n\n     India’s integrity and the idea of fraternity among its citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_562\">147. The appellants have argued that the Constitution is a living document\n\n     which needs to evolve with time and this Court has not only the power\n\n     but also the duty to read and interpret the Constitution to reflect the\n\n     aspirations of the people of this county. The doctrine of progressive\n\n     realisation of rights has been this Court’s north star for over several\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_574\">                                                                            86</span>\n\f     decades. This Court has “found” rights which were not explicitly set\n\n     forth in Part III of the Constitution. For better or for worse, the\n\n     Constitution in the present form is substantially different than the\n\n     Constitution which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly. Hence,\n\n     there are no inherent or constitutional limitations before us to expand\n\n     the scope of Part III of the Constitution in suitably appropriate cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_563\">148. However, that is quite different than what the appellants are asking\n\n     us to do in the present case. Acceptance of their arguments will result\n\n     in this Court engaging in historical revisionism. Anyone claiming that\n\n     historical facts can be changed by judicial fiat, is sorely mistaken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_564\">     Courts are the custodian of the “truth” and cannot create an\n\n     alternative version of the “truth”, which are not supported by\n\n     historical facts. To do so would be thoroughly unjust, arbitrary, and\n\n     unreasonable. Allowing Courts to create alternative facts in support\n\n     of a pre-determined conclusion would obliterate the creditability of\n\n     this Court among the citizenry. Facts cannot be created by the stroke\n\n     of a pen, and to attempt to do that, 100 years later, would be a\n\n     misguided endeavour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_565\">CONCLUSION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_566\">149. In the light of the above discussion, the claim of the appellants cannot\n\n     stand. AMU was neither established by any religious community, nor\n\n     is it administered by a religious community which is regarded as a\n\n     minority community; hence, AMU does not qualify as a minority\n\n     institution. Protection under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1175\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution is, thus,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_575\">                                                                          87</span>\n\f     not available.

In terms of clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_1176\">Article 145</a> of the Constitution, it is my firm\n\n     opinion that not only do the references not require an answer, it is\n\n     also declared that AMU is not a minority educational institution and\n\n     that the appeals seeking minority status for it should fail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_568\">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_569\">151. Before parting, I express my sincere appreciation for the members of\n\n     the bar who addressed this bench. Listening to their erudite\n\n     arguments was indeed enriching. Further, I express gratefulness to\n\n     my research assistants who worked tirelessly and burned the\n\n     midnight oil, in tandem with me, to help me win the race against\n\n     time. The scholarly contributions in books and treatises which were\n\n     consulted and the artificial intelligence systems now available, which\n\n     have opened up a whole new world, did provide me with valuable\n\n     guidance and inputs. The assistance and cooperation received from\n\n     this Court’s library also significantly enhanced this work and has\n\n     made my opinion richer.

The present larger bench of seven Hon’ble Judges, had\nassembled in order to adjudicate upon validity of some of the\namendments made to the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_1179\">Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920</a>\n[hereinafter referred to as the “AMU Act”], through the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_1180\">Aligarh\nMuslim University Amendment Act, 1981</a> [hereinafter referred\nto as “1981 amendment(s)”] and the notifications of the\nAdmission Committee dated 10.01.2005, Academic Council\ndated 15.01.2005 and the Executive Council dated 19.05.2005,\nproviding for reservation to the extent of 50 per cent of seats to\nbe reserved for Muslims of India for admission to post graduate\nprogrammes.

While the said judgments amongst others, have cleared the\nair on the broader interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_1189\">Article 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1190\">30</a>, the question\nwhich concerns the present bench is of an atypical nuance, which\nrequires further elaboration and jurisprudential extraction.\nConsidering the unique position that the Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity [hereinafter referred to as “the AMU”] has in the\nhistory, the constitutional text and the facts surrounding the\nbirthing of the University itself, this Court was required to\ninterrogate certain aspects of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_1191\">Article 29</a> and specifically <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1192\">Article\n30</a>, which have not necessarily arisen before this Court in any\nprevious case. The specific occasion on which issues of the like\narose was in the case concerning the AMU itself in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1193\">S. Azeez\nBasha v. Union of India</a>, (1968) 1 SCR 833 (hereinafter referred\nto as “Azeez Basha”), the correctness of which is a subject matter\nof intense and rigorous debate before this Court in the present\nproceedings.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_582\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8064\" id=\"span_589\">5.     <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_1194\">Article 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1195\">30</a>, forming a part of the fundamental rights\nchapter of the Constitution, represent an important constitutional\nguarantee available to the citizens of the country. It is a guarantee\nthat embeds cultural diversity, secularism and fairness on the\ncanvas of the Constitution. The judgment in <a href=\"/doc/8064/\" id=\"a_1196\">TMA Pai</a> [supra]\ndescribes India as ‘a land of diversity – of different castes\npeoples, communities, languages, religions and culture’. It was\nthis inherent diversity that perhaps led the Constitution makers to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_590\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                  Page 6 of 193</span>\n\fmake specific provisions to guard and celebrate the cultural,\nreligious and linguistic diversity. The Constitution thus provided\nminorities, based on religion or language, the right to establish\nand administer, educational institutions of their choice. The right\nwas geared towards educational institutions as it was felt that\neducation forms the bedrock of the identity of the next generation\nof individuals which would help preserve, protect and further the\ncultural, religious and linguistic diversity.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_583\">6.     This diversity is not a coincidence in India and is a product\nof inherent genetic built of Indian society. The citizens of this\nland mass, which we call India, or Bharat, are therefore\ninherently pluralistic and organically imbibe within them the\nideals of religious, cultural and linguistic diversity. It is a\nfunction of this cultural synthesis that almost accidently and not\nnecessarily by design, the fundamental rights are also provided\nfor in the Constitution at two separate levels or units – the\nindividual; and the group. The rights against arbitrariness, for\nequality,   freedom     of    speech/    move   freely/reside   and\nsettle/profession, freedom of life and liberty, freedom of religion,\netc. are granted at an individualistic level.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_584\">7.     At the same time, the freedom of trade, freedom of\nassociation, rights against untouchability, right to manage\nreligious institutions and the right establish and administer\neducational institutions, are granted to group(s) or specific\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_591\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                 Page 7 of 193</span>\n\fgroups. The said individual rights and their interplay with groups\nrights colour the palette of Indian constitutional law and would\nassist the Court in chartering its future course.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_585\">8.     The specific rights to the minorities under the Constitution,\nover and above the existing individual and group rights available\nto all citizens and/or groups which are agnostic to minority/non-\nminority classification, are to be theorised within the distinctive\ncontext of Indian nationhood. It is necessary to note that India is\na “nation”, but not in the euro-centric sense, which merges\nlinguistic identity with a colonial or medieval past. India is a\ncontinuum, it is a civilization that has perpetuated its course\nthrough the annals of history, carrying with it the lives and stories\nof every hue of human existence. India’s national identity merges\nmany diverging groups, communities, sects, etc. which often\nintersect with each other in varying fashions. This diversity does\nnot rob the country of a unified past, a shared history and\ncomposite present. It is, in fact, this kaleidoscope of\nintermingling and off-shooting cultures that builds the national\nidentity or the national character. The uniqueness of India, its\nnationalism, its shared cultural history and the context in which\nthe Constitution came in to being, gives life to the provisions of\nConstitution. It is with this broad understanding that this Court\nwould seek to locate the answers to the questions presented\nbefore it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_592\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

There has been a considerable degree of contest over the\nfacts that may be germane in the present matter. The question of\nestablishment of the AMU and the facts surrounding it, the\nresultant AMU Act, 1920 [as it then stood] and the history of the\nMahommedan Anglo-Oriental College [hereinafter referred to as\nthe “MAO College”] have been presented by the parties in their\nown manner and style. Without adverting to the contested facts\nor claims, the Court would be benefitted by culling out the\nuncontested facts which are relevant for the purposes of the\npresent adjudication.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_588\">10.    The history of modern higher education in India starts\nfrom the <a href=\"/doc/24598525/\" id=\"a_1197\">Charter Act</a> of 1813 of the British Crown which\nallocated funds for education in British India, leading to the\nestablishment of institutions like the Hindu College in Calcutta\nin 1817. In 1854, an education policy of the British for British\nIndia came in the form of the Wood’s Dispatch, officially known\nas the “Despatch on Indian Education”. It was a seminal\neducational policy document issued in 1854 by Sir Charles\nWood, the President of the Board of Control for India and marked\na significant step in the development of the modern education\nsystem in India. The Dispatch advocated for the establishment of\nuniversities in major cities and improvements in schools and\nspecifically provided that the “examinations for degrees will not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_593\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

In 1857, Act II, XXII and XXVII were passed by the\nImperial Legislative Council [a representative body empowered\nby the British Parliament to make laws for British India] to\nestablish the first three Universities in India, namely Universities\nof Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. Thereafter, Act XLVII of\n1860, was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council, which\nexpanded the powers of the abovesaid three Universities to grant\ndegrees. As a matter of policy and practice, the British Imperial\npower in India therefore, set-up Universities through a legislative\nenactment and resultantly “recognised” such Universities for the\npurposes the colonial power deemed fit. The legislations\nmentioned above, provided the British officials significant\ncontrolling and regulatory powers to administer the institutions.\nThere has been considerable emphasis on this aspect of the matter\nand shall be discussed separately in a particular section of the\njudgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_590\">12.

On 24.05.1875, the opening ceremony of the MAO\nCollege was held in Aligarh. On 08.01.1877, the foundation of\nthe MAO College was laid by Sir Syed. The Rules and\nRegulations for the Appointment of the Trustees of the MAO\nCollege were passed in 1889. The said Rules described the object\nof MAO College was “primarily the education of Mahomedans\nand, so far as may be consistent therewith, of Hindus and other\npersons.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_592\">14.    In 1902, the Report of the Indian Universities Commission\nwas published. The said report, with regard to MAO College, it\nwas specifically noted that “no obstacle should be placed in the\nway of denominational colleges, it is important to maintain the\nundenominational character of the Universities”. On 24.03.1904,\nthe Indian Universities Act (VIII of 1904) was passed which\nunified the pre-existing legislation based University regime in\nBritish India, repealed the previous Acts, and brought within its\npurview the five Universities. It also reconstituted the then\nexisting Governing Bodies of the universities and gave statutory\nrecognition to the ‘Syndicates’ in the said Universities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_593\">15.    From the late 1800s to 1910, several individuals associated\nwith the MAO College propounded various differing ideas for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_595\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

In May 1911, representatives from\nthe MAO College met Harcourt Butler, Member of the Governor-\nGeneral’s Council for the setting up of a “University”. From 1911\ntill 1913-14, the prayer was for the setting up of a predominantly\n“denominational” University which would be recognised by the\nBritish Indian Government. The stances of parties took a sharp\nturn on the passing of the Benaras Hindu University Act, 1915\n[hereinafter referred to as the “BHU Act”] by the Imperial\nLegislative Council on 01.10.1915 leading to the establishment\nof the Benares Hindu University [hereinafter referred to as the\n“BHU”].\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_594\">16.    At the said time, as per the British officials in-charge, the\n“Benares model” as it was then referred, had to be followed. It is\nsought to be presented that once the movement to establish the\nBHU gained prominence and acceptance, the tone and tenor of\nall sides changed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_595\">17.    Separately, there were also considerable disagreements\nwithin the various groups of the minority community advocating\nfor a University over issues such as recognition by the British\nIndian Government and extent of control that the British Indian\nGovernment would exercise over any such proposed University.\nAs the said matter also involves minute machinations of the\nworking of the colonial government and the views and counter\nviews of various personalities involved in the process, the parties\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_596\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Once the deck was cleared for the in-principle\n“acceptance” of having a University on the Benares model, the\ndiscussions started on the actual draft of the Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity Bill.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_597\">19.    Finally, on 27.08.1920, Sir Mian Muhammed Shafi, the\neducation member in the Imperial Legislative Council,\nintroduced the Bill for the establishment of a University and on\nthe same day, sought to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. On\n08.09.1920, the Select Committee submitted its Report. On\n09.09.1920, Mr. Shafi moved the report of the Select Committee\non the Bill to establish AMU in the Indian Legislative Council.\nFinally, on 14.09.1920, the <a href=\"/doc/892594/\" id=\"a_1198\">Aligarh Muslim University Act, 1920</a>\nwas passed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_597\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

In matters related to higher education,\nboth the central and provincial legislatures had the authority to\nmake laws. However, there was a specific legislative entry with\nregard to “Benares Hindu University” and “Aligarh Muslim\nUniversity” which vested the Federal Legislature with the\nexclusive legislative powers over the same under Entry 13, List\nI, in<a href=\"/doc/63026120/\" id=\"a_1200\"> S. 100</a>, of the Government of India Act, 1935.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_598\">3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_600\"> University of Calcutta; University of Bombay (now known as University\nof Mumbai); University of Madras; Panjab University (Established as\nUniversity College, Lahore.

In 1944, the Central Advisory Board of Education made\nattempts to formulate a national system of higher education and\nsubmitted the “Sargent Report” which recommended the\nformation of a “University Grants Committee” to coordinated\nHigher Education in India. In pursuance to the same, in 1945, the\nDepartment of Education, Health and Lands vide resolution dated\nJune 4, 1945 established the University Grants Committee to\nadvise the government on the grants to be given to the Central\nUniversities [Delhi, Benares and Aligarh].\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_602\">23.

On 28.12.1952, the Government of India set up an\n‘interim’ University Grants Commission (hereinafter referred to\nas “UGC”) by resolution to advise it on the allocation of grants-\nin-aid from public funds. On 03.03.1956, the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1201\">University Grants\nCommission Act, 1956</a> [hereinafter referred to as the “<a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1202\">UGC\nAct</a>”] was enacted thereby giving statutory recognition to the\nUGC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_605\">26.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_601\">In 1968, the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1203\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra] was\ndelivered which held that the AMU was neither established nor\nadministered by the minority community.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_602\">After the judgement in\n<a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1204\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra] was delivered, the AMU was treated to be\na free and open institution as opposed to a minority educational\ninstitution.

The word “established”\nwas deleted from the long title of the Act and it now read “<a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_1208\">An\nAct</a> to incorporate a teaching and residential Muslim University\nat Aligarh” as opposed to the unamended long title i.e., “<a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_1209\">An Act</a>\nto establish and incorporate a teaching and residential Muslim\nUniversity at Aligarh”. <a href=\"/doc/1361927/\" id=\"a_1210\">The Act</a> also empowered the Court of\nthe University to act as the Supreme Governing Body.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_608\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_604\">28.    Consequent to this amendment, no issue arose till 2005,\nwhen the Admissions Committee of the University took a\ndecision at its meeting of January 10, 2005 to reserve 50% of\nseats in the Post Graduate Medical Courses for Muslims. The\nsame was also accepted by the Union of India on February 25,\n2005. The Resolutions providing such reservations and the 1981\namendments were challenged before a Single Judge of the\nHon’ble High Court of Judicature at Allahabad [hereinafter\nreferred to as the “Allahabad High Court” or “High Court”] on\nthe ground that the amendments amounted to an impermissible\nlegislative overruling of <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1211\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra].</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_605\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

The learned Single Judge further\nheld that the amendment of 1981 did not turn the AMU into a\nminority institution because <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1213\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra] still held the\nfield.

It was held that\nthis recognition of historical fact could not be overcome by “an\nenforced declaration of substantial identity” as given in <a href=\"/doc/547498/\" id=\"a_1215\">section\n2(l)</a> and as sought to be done by removing the word “establish”\nfrom the long title of the Act. Consequently, <a href=\"/doc/1309512/\" id=\"a_1216\">Section 5(2)(c)</a> was\nalso struck down for being discriminatory since it privileged the\nadvancement of a particular section over others. It was further\nheld that the Parliament had no competence to enact the 1981 Act\nbecause only a minority could create a minority institution,\nParliament could not.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_611\">31.

Also, that the university loses\nits minority character as soon as it is established by a statute.\nTherefore, there is inherent contradiction in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1251\">the said judgment</a>.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_631\">Secondly, while <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1252\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra] recognizes the history,\nbackground and antecedent role that the MAO College played in\nbuilding this institution, the bench, however, ignores it at the end\nin view of the existence of 1920 Act. The said history and\nbackground ought to be appreciated as has been done in case of\nSt. Stephen’s [supra].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_632\">Thirdly, in this respect, <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1253\">Azeez Basha</a>\n[supra] completely ignores the purpose of the 1920 Act.

If a minority\ncan establish a university under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1257\">Article 30(1)</a>, and if universities\nare required to be incorporated under a statute for degrees to be\nrecognised, then it must follow that the minority community is\nentitled to seek incorporation of its institution as a university.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_635\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Dr. Dhawan emphasized that the then\nImperial Legislature had incorporated various provisions in the\n1920 Act which are clearly intended for the benefit of the Muslim\ncommunity.

The 1920 Act is\nnot the establishing factum of the University but only a\nrecognition of such establishment, which has been done by the\nMuslim community at the relevant time. In order to highlight the\nhistory and purpose behind the institute, Mr. Sibal relied upon\nletters exchanged between Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the\nrelevant authorities of the Government and the debates which\ntook place when the Aligarh Muslim University Bill was being\ndiscussed in the Imperial Legislature in the year 1920.

Mr. Sibal vehemently argued that the mere presence of\n“outsiders” in the administration of a minority institution would\nnot deprive the institution from its minority status. He accepted\nthat certain regulations can be imposed by the State on such\ninstitution to maintain the stands of excellence, however, those\nregulations would not affect the minority status of the institution.\nIn contrast, the right of a linguistic or a religious minority under\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1278\">Article 30</a> to establish and administer an institution “of their\nchoice”, which cannot be subject to any regulation, is absolute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_627\">46.    Additionally, it is submitted that the only benefit to a\nparticular institute of having a minority character is that the\ninstitute has the right to reserve a certain number of seats for\nstudents of the said minority community. The said right should\nnot be taken away in the case of Aligarh Muslim University,\nwhere de facto, majority of students are already of Muslim\ncommunity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_647\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

If that is so\ndone, it will follow that the rights under Part III of the\nConstitution of India are natural to or inherent in a human being.\nMr. Khurshid argued that the natural rights are inalienable\nbecause they are inseparable from the human personality and\nhave been just preserved by the Constitution. In this context, the\nrights under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1279\">Article 30</a> that the minorities have, as individuals,\nexisted even prior to 1950.

The 1920 Act is a device to bring\ninto legal existence the Aligarh Muslim University, which was\nestablished by the Muslim Community.

He\nhas also sought to distinguish the existence of the University\nfrom its predecessor, the Mohammedan Anglo Oriental College,\nas the enabling power to create such a college came from the\n<a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_1289\">Societies Registration Act</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_654\">Ld.

The Ld.

It was asserted that it was open to the AMU to remain a\ncollege and be free of government control or to establish a\nuniversity without recognition of its degrees by the government\nbut it chose not to exercise these options. The substance of the\nsubmission was that the right of administration was ‘surrendered’\nwhen the proponents of the AMU accepted establishment by\nstatute of the kind made by the 1920 Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_659\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

The\nthrust of the argument was that the institution must be shown to\nhave been established by the minority community.

It was urged that the circumstances in\nwhich such surrender was made cannot be gone into by the Court\nin exercise of its power of judicial review while placing reliance\non the judgment in the case of Dir. of Endowments Gov. of\n<a href=\"/doc/26511/\" id=\"a_1307\">Hyderabad v.

Mr. Vikramjit Bannerjee, learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral of India, briefly traced the history and purpose of\nincorporating Articles 25-30 from the Constituent Assembly\nDebates. It was argued that the purpose of these provisions was\nto instil a sense of confidence in the minorities with a final view\nto erasing the difference between majority and minority\naltogether. In that view, allowing an institute of national\nimportance to be classified as a minority institution would go\nagainst the principles behind <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1312\">Article 30.</a> To support his stand, he\nrelied on <a href=\"/doc/502741/\" id=\"a_1313\">Bal Patil v.

Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel, submitted\nthat in the pre-constitution era, the sole prerogative of\nestablishing universities lay with the Governor-General-in-\nCouncil. He refers to the establishment of a number of\nUniversities during the time of British time to show that all such\nUniversities were established by an Act of the Legislature. It was\nargued that the intent of a minority in establishing a university\nwas material factor because the ultimate fact of establishment\ncould be only through the Government. It was argued that the\nMuslim community in the pre-constitution era did not identify as\nminorities at all. Therefore, it was stated that if the community\nitself did not accept a minority character, it was not open to\nconfer such a character on them through operation of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1314\">Article 30</a>\ninsofar as the AMU is concerned. It was argued that the\nnumerical inferiority is only one aspect of minority status. Other\naspects would include whether or not the community was\ndominant either socially or politically and whether or not it\nconsidered itself a minority. He relied on certain reports of the\nUnited Nations to reinforce the idea that minority must be\ndefined with respect to socio-political dominance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_647\">66.

He also\nreferred to the Constituent Assembly Debates to argue that the\nunderstanding of the constitution makers was that the AMU was\nan institution of a national character. It is argued that there is a\ndifference between a university established under an Act by\nprivate persons and a university established by an Act.

Mr. Kaul argued that the creation of the AMU was the\ncreation of a new and distinct entity, not merely the incorporation\nof an existing institution as a university. The old MAO college\nhad been completely dissolved and its assets and liabilities\ntransferred to the University. It was further stated that the Act\nused the words “an act to establish” and it did not anywhere state\nthat it was recognising an existing institution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_651\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_684\">70.

Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, Ld. Senior Counsel, made\nextensive reference to the history of the AMU to argue that it was\nnever established as a minority institution but as an institution for\ngeneral and secular education. It was argued that the British\nGovernment was consistently opposed to both, the possibility of\na denominational character of the university and the proposed\npower of the university to affiliate colleges. It was argued that the\nword “Muslim” in the university’s name was accepted more out\nof deference to local sentiment than as an indication of minority\ncharacter.

Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar argued that the fact that the\nMuslim community approached the then Government for\nestablishing a university is insignificant, as it was not necessary.\nIt was argued that the minority community had the right to\nestablish a college as happened thereafter with the creation of the\nJamia Milia Islamia without government interference.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_688\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

It was argued that the muslim community approached the\nGovernment since they wanted governmental recognition of their\ndegrees which was possible only if university was established by\nthe Government. He gave examples of certain colleges to show\nhow such colleges were given legal recognition as Universities\nthrough Acts of Legislature. By contrast the MAO college was\ninstead dissolved by the 1920 Act and a new entity created in its\nplace.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_655\">74.      Further, it was argued that the inclusion of the AMU as a\nspecific entry in List I of the Constitution is a clear indication of\nits All-India character. Even if the university once had the\ntrappings of a minority institution, such inclusion crystallises the\nsecular nature of the university and erases all vestiges of control\nby one specific community.

On this\nbasis he argues that the AMU is an open and public university. It\nwas argued that the AMU itself never raised any questions about\nits character from 1950 until 2005, when for the first time it\nenacted reservations for Muslims. Until 2005, the AMU was\ngoverned by the non-discrimination requirement under <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1334\">Article\n29(2)</a> since AMU is under the financial and administrative\ncontrol of the Government, it is ‘State’ within the meaning of\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1335\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_662\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_696\">80.

It is further urged that the minorities have been recognized\nin India even before the Constitution came into force and\ntherefore, to say that Muslim community had no minority ‘group’\nrights before 1950 is fallacious. It is argued that there exists a\nconstitutional premium, as well as a statutory premium (for e.g.,\n<a href=\"/doc/170384168/\" id=\"a_1351\">Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act,\n2006</a>) which is attached to minority exceptions and the minority\ndispensation. Therefore, it is not just <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1352\">Article 30</a> which recognizes\nthe minority rights, but if the whole statutory dispensation\nanalysed, it is clear that Parliament has excepted the minorities\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/5282155/\" id=\"a_1353\">Articles 15(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180923419/\" id=\"a_1354\">15(6).</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_672\">89.

Page 73 of 193</span>\n\f       learned counsel for the State of Kerala. He contends\n       that there are three conditions which must be\n       fulfilled before the protection and privileges of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1442\">Article 30(1)</a> may be claimed, namely, (1) there\n       must be a minority community, (2) one or more of\n       the members of that community should, after the\n       commencement of the Constitution, seek to exercise\n       the right to establish an educational institution of\n       his or their choice, and (3) the educational\n       institution must be established for the members of\n       his or their own community. We have already\n       determined, according to the test referred to above,\n       that the Anglo-Indians, Christians and Muslims are\n       minority communities in the State of Kerala. We do\n       not think that the protection and privilege of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1443\">Article\n       30(1)</a> extend only to the educational institutions\n       established after the date our Constitution came\n       into operation or which may hereafter be\n       established. On this hypothesis the educational\n       institutions established by one or more members of\n       any of these communities prior to the\n       commencement of the Constitution would not be\n       entitled to the benefits of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1444\">Article 30(1).</a> The fallacy\n       of this argument becomes discernible as soon as we\n       direct our attention to <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_1445\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> which,\n       clearly enough, applies alike to a business,\n       occupation or profession already started and\n       carried on as to those that may be started and\n       carried on after the commencement of the\n       Constitution. There is no reason why the benefit of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1446\">Article 30(1)</a> should be limited only to educational\n       institutions established after the commencement\n       of the Constitution. The language employed in\n       <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1447\">Article 30(1)</a> is wide enough to cover both pre-\n       Constitution and post-Constitution institutions. It\n       must not be overlooked that <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1448\">Article 30(1)</a> gives the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_784\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

The second right clearly covers pre-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_727\">       Constitution schools just as <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1449\">Article 26</a> covers the\n       right to maintain pre-Constitution religious\n       institutions. As to the third condition mentioned\n       above, the argument carried to its logical\n       conclusion comes to this that if a single member of\n       any other community is admitted into a school\n       established for the members of a particular minority\n       community, then the educational institution ceases\n       to be an educational institution established by the\n       particular minority community. The argument is\n       sought to be reinforced by a reference to <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1450\">Article\n       29(2).</a> It is said that an educational institution\n       established by a minority community which does not\n       seek any aid from the funds of the State need not\n       admit a single scholar belonging to a community\n       other than that for whose benefit it was established\n       but that as soon as such an educational institution\n       seeks and gets aid from the State coffers <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1451\">Article\n       29(2)</a> will preclude it from denying admission to\n       members of the other communities on grounds only\n       of religion, race, caste, language or any of them and\n       consequently it will cease to be an educational\n       institution of the choice of the minority community\n       which established it. This argument does not appear\n       to us to be warranted by the language of the article\n       itself. There is no such limitation in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1452\">Article 30(1)</a>\n       and to accept this limitation will necessarily involve\n       the addition of the words “for their own\n       community” in the article which is ordinarily not\n       permissible according to well established rules of\n       interpretation. Nor is it reasonable to assume that\n       the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1453\">Article 29(2)</a> was to deprive minority\n       educational institutions of the aid they receive from\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_785\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                Page 75 of 193</span>\n\f       the State. To say that an institution which receives\n       aid on account of its being a minority educational\n       institution must not refuse to admit any member of\n       any other community only on the grounds therein\n       mentioned and then to say that as soon as such\n       institution admits such an outsider it will cease to\n       be a minority institution is tantamount to saying that\n       minority institutions will not, as minority\n       institutions, be entitled to any aid. The real import\n       of <a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_1454\">Article 29(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1455\">Article 30(1)</a> seems to us to be\n       that they clearly contemplate a minority institution\n       with a sprinkling of outsiders admitted into it.

Without referring to those cases it is\n       sufficient to say that the clause contemplates two\n       rights which are separated in point of time. The\n       first right is the initial right to establish institutions\n       of the minority&#x27;s choice. Establishment here\n       means the bringing into being of an institution and\n       it must be by a minority community. It matters not\n       if a single philanthropic individual with his own\n       means, founds the institution or the community at\n       large contributes the funds. The position in law is\n       the same and the intention in either case must be to\n       found an institution for the benefit of a minority\n       community by a member of that community.

The next part of the right relates to the\n       administration of such institutions. Administration\n       means “management of the affairs” of the\n       institution. This management must be free of control\n       so that the founders or their nominees can mould\n       the institution as they think fit, and in accordance\n       with their ideas of how the interests of the\n       community in general and the institution in\n       particular will be best served.

In\nthe formalised education sector, the majority of educational\ninstitutions operating through private means are registered as\nsocieties under various Acts. This encompasses a significant\nnumber of secular/non-minority institutions established as such.\nSuch institutions, whether aided or unaided, in contrast to\nminority institutions, whether aided or unaided, are subjected to\na significantly higher degree of regulation by the State in various\naspects, including curriculum, admissions, teacher appointments,\nand other factors. Consequently, it is evident that private entities\nadministering minority institutions enjoy a notably higher degree\nof freedom from such regulation. Hence, there exists a\npronounced inclination on the part of non-minority institutions to\nseek minority status.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_744\">138. In the backdrop of this clamour for minority status, if\nminority status is deemed attainable without necessitating the\nfactum of establishment of an institution by the minority at its\ninception, it may result in a widespread proliferation of\ninstitutions claiming to be minority institutions despite not being\nestablished as minority institutions. This could be easily achieved\nby merely amending the rules or Articles of Association of the\nsociety to create a semblance of minority control.

There is by now, fairly abundant case law on\n      the questions as to “minority”; the minority&#x27;s right\n      to “establish”, and their right to “administer”\n      educational institutions. These questions have\n      arisen in regard to a variety of institutions all over\n      the country. They have arisen in regard to\n      Christians, Muslims and in regard to certain sects\n      of Hindus and linguistic groups. The courts in\n      certain cases have accepted without much scrutiny\n      the version of the claimant that the institution in\n      question was founded by a minority community\n      while in some cases the courts have examined very\n      minutely the proof of the establishment of the\n      institution. It should be borne in mind that the\n      words “establish” and “administer” used in <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1506\">Article\n      30(1)</a> are to be read conjunctively. The right\n      claimed by a minority community to administer the\n      educational institution depends upon the proof of\n      establishment of the institution. The proof of\n      establishment of the institution, is thus a condition\n      precedent for claiming the right to administer the\n      institution. Prior to the commencement of the\n      Constitution of India, there was no settled concept\n      of Indian citizenship.

Page 87 of 193</span>\n\f      Delhi in collaboration with the Society for the\n      Propagation of the Gospel [SPG] whose members\n      were residents in India. The College was founded in\n      order to impart Christian religious instruction and\n      education based on Christian values to Christian\n      students as well as others who may opt for the said\n      education. The Cambridge Brotherhood with plans\n      of establishing the Christian College in Delhi sent\n      the Cambridge Mission whose members were: Rev.\n      J.D. Murray, Rev. E. Bickarsteth, Rev. G.A. Lefroy,\n      Rev. H.T. Blackett, Rev. H.C. Carlyon and Rev. S.S.\n      Allnutt. Of the said members of the Cambridge\n      Mission, Rev. Allnutt, Rev. Blackett and Rev. Lefroy\n      teamed up with Rev. R.R. Winter of the SPG to\n      establish the College. It will be seen that Cambridge\n      Mission alone did not establish the College. The\n      Cambridge Mission with the assistance of the\n      members of the SPG who were residents in India\n      established the College. The contention to the\n      contrary urged by Mr Gupta, counsel for the\n      petitioner in T.C. No. 3 of 1980 is, therefore,\n      incorrect. The purpose of starting the College\n      could be seen from the Report of 1878 to the\n      Cambridge Brotherhood and it states “the students\n      after leaving St. Stephen&#x27;s Mission School joined\n      non-Christian Colleges and lost touch with\n      Christian teachings … the case would be otherwise\n      if we were able to send them from our school to a\n      College, where the teachings would be given by\n      Christian professors and be permeated with\n      Christian ideas.” (F.F. Monk in A History of St.\n      Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi, Calcutta, 1935, p. 3). In\n      October 1879 the Cambridge Committee expressed\n      the desirability of imparting instruction also in\n      secular subjects. “It was also felt that the influence\n      of the missionaries would be greatly increased if\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_817\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

A new\n      building was eventually constructed by the Society\n      for the Propagation of the Gospel wherein the\n      foundation stone bore the following inscription:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_362\">              To the Glory of God\n              And the Advancement of Sound\n              Learning\n              And Religious Education\n      The new building of the College was eventually\n      opened on December 8, 1881, by Rev. Allnutt. On\n      the said building on the front of the porch, at the top\n      of the parapet, a ‘cross’ in bas-relief was placed and\n      immediately under the bracket the words “Ad Dei\n      Gloriam” had been inscribed which have since been\n      adopted as the College motto.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_752\">      32. Today the new College building in the\n      University campus has also a large ‘cross’ at the top\n      of the main tower and in the front porch is inscribed\n      the St. Stephen&#x27;s motto “Ad Dei Gloriam” to\n      perpetuate and remind the students the motive and\n      objective of the College, namely, “The Glory of\n      God”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_753\">      33.

It is said that during the early part of the\n      College history, it was managed by the Mission\n      Council — a totally Christian body. Late in 1913 it\n      was registered as a society and a constitution was\n      formulated on November 6, 1913 which was adopted\n      by the SPG Standing Committee and by the\n      Cambridge Committee. The Constitution as it stands\n      today again maintains the essential character of the\n      College as a Christian College without\n      compromising the right to administer it as an\n      educational institution of its choice. The\n      Constitution of the College consists of Memorandum\n      of the Society and Rules. Clause 2 of Memorandum\n      states that “the object is to prepare students of the\n      College for University degrees and examinations\n      and to offer instruction in doctrines of christianity\n      which instruction must be in accordance with the\n      teachings of the Church of North India”. Clause 4\n      sets out the original members of the Society who\n      were mostly Christians. The composition of the\n      Society also reflects its Christian character\n      inasmuch as the Bishop of the Diocese of Delhi is\n      the Chairman of the Society [Rule 1(a)]. Further,\n      two persons appointed by the Bishop of the Diocese\n      of Delhi, one of whom shall be a senior Presbyter of\n      the Diocese, shall be members of the Society [Rule\n      1(b)]. One person to be appointed by the Church of\n      North India Synodical Board of Higher Education\n      shall also be a member of the Society [Rule 1(g)].\n      Similar is the position of a person to be appointed\n      by the Diocesan Board of Education [Rule 1(h)].\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_756\">      Two persons to be appointed by the Executive\n      Committee of the Diocese, one of whom shall be a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_819\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

They are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_363\">              (a) The Bishop of the Diocese of Delhi,\n             who shall be the Chairman.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_364\">              (b) Two persons appointed by the Bishop\n             of the Diocese [under Rule 1(b)].\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">              (c) The person appointed by the Church\n              of North India Synodical Board of\n              Higher Education [under Rule 1(g)].\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">              (d) The person appointed by the Diocese\n             Board of Education [under Rule 1(h)].\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">              (e) The Principal of the College\n             (Member-Secretary).”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_759\">      37. Rule 3 of the Society provides that the\n      Supreme Council mostly looks after the religious\n      and moral instruction to students and matters\n      affecting the religious character of the College. The\n      Principal of the College is the Member-Secretary of\n      the Supreme Council. Rule 4 provides that the\n      Principal shall be a member of the Church of North\n      India or of a Church that is in communion with the\n      Church of India. The Vice-Principal shall be\n      appointed annually by the Principal. He shall also\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_820\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

True, Rule 5 provides that the Supreme\n      Council of the College has no jurisdiction over the\n      administration of the College and it shall be looked\n      after by the Governing Body. But the Governing\n      Body is not a secular body as argued by learned\n      counsel for the University. Rule 6 provides that the\n      Chairman of the Society (Bishop of Diocese of\n      Delhi) shall be the Chairman of the Governing\n      Body. The members of the Society as set out in\n      categories, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j),\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_761\">      (k), (l) and (m) of clause (1) shall be the members of\n      the Governing Body. The Chairman and the Vice-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_762\">      Chairman of the Governing Body shall be the\n      members of the Church of North India. Out of\n      categories (a) and (m) in clause (1), only category\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_763\">      (k) may be a member of the teaching staff who may\n      not be a Christian. Two members referred under\n      category (l) to be appointed by the Delhi University\n      may not be Christian and likewise, under the\n      category (n) may not be Christian. But the\n      remaining members shall be Christians. Out of\n      thirteen categories, only three categories might be\n      non-Christians and therefore, it makes little\n      difference in the Christian character of the\n      Governing Body of the College. A comparison of\n      Statute 30(c) of the Delhi University at pages 127-\n      28 of Calendar Volume I will show the difference\n      between the Governing Body of other colleges under\n      the Statute as contrasted with St. Stephen&#x27;s College.\n      Principal\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_764\">      39. It is again significant to note the difference\n      between the method of appointment of the\n      Principal of St. Stephen&#x27;s College and all other\n      colleges. The Principal of St. Stephen&#x27;s College is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_821\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

He will exercise control, and maintain\n      discipline and regulation of the College. He will be\n      in complete charge of the admissions in the College\n      assisted by admission committee. But the Principals\n      of other affiliated colleges under Ordinance XVIII\n      clause 7(2) [page 335 Calendar Volume I] are to be\n      appointed by the Governing Body of the College.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_765\">      40. The immovable property of the College shall\n      be vested in the Indian Church trustees, who shall\n      merely act as Trustees, and shall have no power of\n      management whatsoever. All other property\n      connected with the College shall be vested in the\n      Society (Rule 21).”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_766\">142. During the examination of the particular college under\nconsideration, the Court observes that the institution was\nestablished by missionaries with the primary purpose of\nproviding Christian religious education - as per paragraph 30. It\nalso observes that the assets and property of the college are\nlegally owned by the church - as described in paragraph 40. The\nCourt also notes that at the time of its inception, the college was\nunder the exclusive management of a body composed entirely of\nChristians - as outlined in paragraph 35. The Court notices that\nthe rules of the institution&#x27;s society stipulate that all members\nmust be appointed by Christian organizations - as mentioned in\nparagraph 35. The Court lays specific emphasis on the fact that\nthe administration of the college is also entrusted to a body\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_822\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

As far as historical factors are concerned, the Court\nnotes that the construction of the college building was\ncommissioned by a minority community and funded by them - as\ndetailed in paragraphs 31-34. In governance, the Court notes that\nboth the Supreme Council and the Governing Body of the college\nare predominantly constituted of Christians, with 10 out of 13\nmembers belonging to this religious group - as per paragraphs\n37-38.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_767\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545248\" id=\"span_823\">143.

Commerce,\n         Literature, Arts and Sciences and\n         Management colleges and colleges in other\n         subjects and to promote allied activities for\n         diffusion of useful knowledge and training.”\n      Other objects were also mentioned in the\n      memorandum of association. All that is necessary\n      to mention here is that none of the objects, apart\n      from the first extracted object, had anything to do\n      with any minority. Even the first mentioned object\n      did not specify or elucidate what was meant by the\n      statement that education and training at all stages\n      was proposed to be imparted in the institutions of\n      that society “as Christian Minorities&#x27; Educational\n      Institution”. Apparently the words “as a Christian\n      Minorities&#x27; Educational Institutions” were added in\n      order to enable the society to claim the rights\n      guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1517\">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution and\n      for no other purpose.

We do not have any doubt\n      that the claim of the petitioner to start a minority\n      educational institution was no more than the\n      merest pretence. Except the words, “as the\n      Christian Minorities’ Educational Institutions”\n      occurring in one of the objects of the society, as\n      mentioned in the memorandum of association, there\n      is nothing whatever to justify the claim of the society\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_829\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Every letter\n       written by the society whether to the Central\n       Government, the State Government or the\n       University contained false and misleading\n       statements. As we had already mentioned the\n       petitioner had the temerity to admit or pretend to\n       admit students in the first year MBBS course without\n       any permission being granted by the government for\n       the starting of the medical college and without any\n       affiliation being granted by the University. The\n       society did this despite the strong protest voiced by\n       the University and the several warnings issued by\n       the University. The society acted in defiance of the\n       University and the government, in disregard of the\n       provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Education Act,\n       the Osmania University Act and the regulations of\n       the Osmania University and with total indifference\n       to the interest and welfare of the students. The\n       society has played havoc with the careers of several\n       score students and jeopardised their future\n       irretrievably. Obviously the so-called establishment\n       of a medical college was in the nature of a financial\n       adventure for the so-called society and its office\n       bearers, but an educational misadventure for the\n       students.

No one could have imagined\n       that a medical college could function without a\n       teaching hospital, without the necessary scientific\n       equipment, without the necessary staff, without the\n       necessary buildings and without the necessary\n       funds.

It was nothing but a daring\n       imposture and sculduggery.

It was seriously contended before us that any\n       minority, even a single individual belonging to a\n       minority, could found a minority institution and had\n       the right so to do under the Constitution and neither\n       the government nor the University could deny the\n       society’s right to establish a minority institution, at\n       the very threshold as it were, howsoever, they may\n       impose regulatory measures in the interests of\n       uniformity, efficiency and excellence of education.\n       The fallacy of the argument insofar as the instant\n       case is concerned lies in thinking that neither the\n       government nor the University has the right to go\n       behind the claim that the institution is a minority\n       institution and to investigate and satisfy itself\n       whether the claim is well-founded or ill-founded.\n       The government, the University and ultimately the\n       court have the undoubted right to pierce the\n       ‘minority veil’ — with due apologies to the\n       corporate lawyers — and discover whether there is\n       lurking behind it no minority at all and in any case,\n       no minority institution. The object of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1519\">Article 30(1)</a>\n       is not to allow bogies to be raised by pretenders but\n       to give the minorities ‘a sense of security and a\n       feeling of confidence’ not merely by guaranteeing\n       the right to profess, practise and propagate religion\n       to religious minorities and the right to conserve\n       their language, script and culture to linguistic\n       minorities, but also to enable all minorities,\n       religious or linguistic, to establish and administer\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_831\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

These\n       institutions must be educational institutions of the\n       minorities in truth and reality and not mere\n       masked phantoms. They may be institutions\n       intended to give the children of the minorities the\n       best general and professional education, to make\n       them complete men and women of the country and\n       to enable them to go out into the world fully\n       prepared and equipped. They may be institutions\n       where special provision is made to the advantage\n       and for the advancement of the minority children.\n       They may be institutions where the parents of the\n       children of the minority community may expect that\n       education in accordance with the basic tenets of\n       their religion would be imparted by or under the\n       guidance of teachers, learned and steeped in the\n       faith. They may be institutions where the parents\n       expect their children to grow in a pervasive\n       atmosphere which is in harmony with their religion\n       or conducive to the pursuit of it. What is important\n       and what is imperative is that there must exist some\n       real positive index to enable the institution to be\n       identified as an educational institution of the\n       minorities. We have already said that in the present\n       case apart from the half a dozen words ‘as a\n       Christian minorities’ institution&#x27; occurring in one\n       of the objects recited in the memorandum of\n       association, there is nothing whatever, in the\n       memorandum or the articles of association or in\n       the actions of the society to indicate that the\n       institution was intended to be a minority\n       educational institution.

In order to arrive at a finding that\nan institution was established by the minority for the purposes of\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1550\">Article 30</a>, it has been held that such institution must principally\nembody a minority character and be instituted to safeguard the\nminority language, culture, or religion. In some situations, there\nhas also been a specific emphasis on the source of funding being\nfrom the minority community or the fact that the management of\nlands should eventually vest with the minority. Further, the\npresence of some non-minorities in administration has not been\nheld detrimental if the actual authority rests with the minority\ncommunity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_860\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

The Appellants have argued that the word “establish” is to\nbe interpreted broadly and would include the parallels drawn with\ngeneric phrases such as “genesis of the institution” or the\n“founding moment of the institution”. With regard to the claim\nthat the word “establish” and “found” can be used\ninterchangeably thereby according it with a wider and more\ngeneralised meaning, it can be noticed that the Court as a matter\nlexical variation may have used the terms interchangeably,\nhowever, the constitutional meaning of the term cannot be diluted\non that count. This is because the word “establish” as used in the\nConstitution carries a specific meaning. The meaning of the\nterms occurring in the Constitution ought to have a specific\nmeaning especially when the same occurs under Part III of the\nConstitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_784\">154. This Court has consistently held that when the words of a\nprovision are clear and there exists no ambiguity, the same ought\nto be given their plain and simple meaning. The assertion on part\nof the Appellant that “establish” ought to be given a wider\nmeaning owing to the context in which it occurs is also unmerited\non the same count. It must be noted that the right under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1551\">Article\n30</a> is an important and exceptional right/protection extended by\nthe Constitution to a specific class, for a specific purpose, in a\nparticular circumstance. The extension of the same over and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_861\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

As held by this Court, the objective of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1552\">Article 30</a> is not to\nafford a false sense of security and confidence to pretenders\nposing as minorities. It was for this reason that this Court in <a href=\"/doc/197490/\" id=\"a_1553\">A.P.\nChristian Medical Educational Society</a> [supra] cautioned\nagainst what it referred to as masked phantoms. It is imperative\nto interpret the Constitution in a manner that ensures the sacred\nprotection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1554\">Article 30</a> is extended only to institutions\ngenuinely representing the minority community, in substance and\nnot merely in appearance.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_786\">156. From the above it is amply clear that the meaning of the\nword “establish” under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1555\">Article 30</a> has indeed been understood by\nthis Court consistently to mean ‘to bring into existence’. The\nmeaning of “establish” in Black’s Law Dictionary 6th Edn. is as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_388\">         “xxx\n         (3) To found, to create, to regulate; as: “Congress\n         shall have power to establish post-roads and post-\n         offices.”\n         (4) To found, recognize, confirm, or admit; as:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_389\">         “Congress shall make no law respecting an\n         establishment of religion.”\n         (5) To create, to ratify, or confirm; as: “We, the\n         people,” etc., “do ordain and establish this\n         constitution.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_863\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Similarly, the Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary defines “establish” as – “To bring into existence,\ncreate, make, start, originate, found or build as permanent or with\npermanence in view”. The P.Ramanatha Aiyer’s Law Lexicon\ndefines it as – “To found, recognize, confirm or admit, to make\nor form”. The Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th edition defines it as –\n“to settle, make or fix firmly, to enact permanently, to make, form\nor bring into existence.” The Bouvier Law Dictionary defines it\nas – “Creation or authorization of an operation or institution.\nEstablishment is the act of creating or recognizing in law or in\nfact any institution, office, place or person so that the person or\nthing established has an authority or certain privileges that are\nrecognized by others”. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines\nit as – “To set up on a firm or permanent basis, initiate or bring\nabout.” The Collins English Dictionary and Thesaurus defines it\nas – “To create or set up”. The common thread amongst all the\nsaid definition is that “establish” refers to the creation or bringing\nin to being of a body/institution. It refers to the action or process\nwhich involves creation of a new entity. In light of these\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_864\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                Page 110 of 193</span>\n\fconsiderations, a minority community seeking to assert rights\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1556\">Article 30</a> must substantiate that the institution in question\nwas indeed physically, demonstrably, and conclusively brought\ninto existence by the minority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_790\">158. The Appellants urged that the establishment is equivalent\nto a ‘founding moment’ in order to further their stance on the\nfacts surrounding MAO College and AMU. This fundamentally\nignores the understanding of “establishment” as establishment is\nnot a moment rather establishment is a process. A process\nconsists of various factors and forces at play, the culmination of\nwhich result in the creation of the institution. A moment connotes\na singular act or just an idea which, in the opinion of this Court,\nwould not suffice the enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1557\">Article 30.</a> A process is a\ncomplex sequences of events and actions/inactions on part of\nvarious stakeholders which were relevant in the history of the\ninstitution at the point of establishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_791\">159. Further, in cases wherein there are multitude of forces and\nmultiple stakeholders involved during establishment of an\ninstitution, the judicial inquiry would have to be suitably\ncalibrated. The Court, in such situations, ought to take a holistic\nview of the matter and decide the question on totality of factors.\nThe Court needs to weigh the factors and contributory forces in\nthe balance in order to ascertain whether the minority community\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_865\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

At this juncture, it is necessary to understand the meaning\nof the term “choice” occurring in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1558\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.\nThe term choice, is representative of the decision of minority\ncommunity as to the nature of the institution it seeks to establish.\nThe choice therefore could be to establish a technical institution,\nan arts institution, an institution for religious teaching or even a\nminority institution with largely secular teaching. The “choice”\nis therefore operationalised by the decision of the minority as to\nthe kind of institution that the minority seeks to establish.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_794\">161. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703393\" id=\"span_866\">In <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_1559\">Ahmedabad St. Xavier&#x27;s College Society and Ors. v.\nState of Gujarat and Ors.</a>, (1974) 1 SCC 717, this Court refers\nto this aspect of “choice” as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_390\">       “96. xxx\n       Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1560\">Article 30</a> also contains the words “of\n       their choice”. These words which qualify\n       “educational institutions” show the vast discretion\n       and option which the minorities have in selecting\n       the type of institutions which they want to\n       establish. In case an educational institution is\n       established by a minority to conserve its distinct\n       language, script or culture, the right to establish\n       and administer such institution would fall both\n       under <a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_1561\">Article 29(1)</a> as well as under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1562\">Article 30(1).</a>\n       The minorities can, however, choose to establish an\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_867\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 112 of 193</span>\n\f       educational institution which is purely of a general\n       secular character and is not designed to conserve\n       their distinct language, script or culture. The right\n       to establish and administer such an institution is\n       guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1563\">Article 30(1)</a> and the fact that such\n       an institution does not conserve the distinct\n       language, script or culture of a minority would not\n       take it out of the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1564\">Article 30(1)</a>.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_795\">162. The “choice” therefore, is with regard to the type of the\ninstitution and cannot be conflated with the “administration” of\nan institution. The assertion that once the choice includes having\nsecular education in the institution, it would be necessary that\nnon-minority persons are appointed for the purposes of teaching\nand administration is only partially correct. Indeed, when a\nminority seeks to provide secular education it would have to\nappoint non-minority teachers and some administration from\noutside the community, however, the same cannot mean that even\nthe   major     decision-making,         managerial   and   superior\nadministrative setup can be “outsourced” by the minority. The\nlower rungs of administration and the teaching staff may\ncertainly be of a non-minority character however, the higher\nechelons of administration and policy decision making of the\ninstitution ought to be in the hands of the minority community to\nclaim minority status. Further, the “intent” of the minority\ncommunity unless expressed and actually exercised as the\n“choice”, cannot govern the question of establishment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_868\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

The constitutionally sustainable approach qua the question\nof &quot;establishment&quot; therefore, cannot hinge only upon the &quot;intent&quot;\nor &quot;choice&quot; of the minority at the time. The intent and choice may\nbe relevant only to a limited extent and cannot be the controlling\nfactors in the judicial enquiry for determining the question of\nestablishment. The question of establishment is to be adjudicated\nfrom a multitude of factors as noticed above and cannot be\ninferred from bald assertions regarding the &quot;wishes&quot; or &quot;choices&quot;\nor &quot;efforts&quot; of a minority community.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_797\">164.

The primary character of the institution\nand the predominant efforts in its establishment ought to\noriginate from the minority community and must culminate\n[come in to being] through the said community. The “choice” and\n“wishes” during the process of establishment – if not accepted,\nwould clearly indicate that the concerned minority community\nwas not the predominant force behind the institution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_798\">G.4    The nature of administration at the time of establishment\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_799\">165.

The judgment of this Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/703393/\" id=\"a_1566\">Ahmedabad St. Xavier&#x27;s College Society</a> [supra], provides\nsome assistance in this regard.

The entire controversy centres round the extent\n       of the right of the religious and linguistic minorities\n       to administer their educational institutions. The\n       right to administer is said to consist of four\n       principal matters. First is the right to choose its\n       managing or governing body. It is said that the\n       founders of the minority institution have faith and\n       confidence in their own committee or body\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_871\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

It is said that\n       minority institutions want teachers to have\n       compatibility with the ideals, aims and aspirations\n       of the institution. Third is the right not to be\n       compelled to refuse admission to students. In other\n       words, the minority institutions want to have the\n       right to admit students of their choice subject to\n       reasonable      regulations     about    academic\n       qualifications. Fourth is the right to use its\n       properties and assets for the benefit of its own\n       institution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_392\">       40. ….. The right to administer is the right to\n       conduct and manage the affairs of the institution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_801\">       This right is exercised through a body of persons in\n       whom the founders of the institution have faith and\n       confidence and who have full autonomy in that\n       sphere. The right to administer is subject to\n       permissible regulatory measures. Permissible\n       regulatory measures are those which do not restrict\n       the right of administration but facilitate it and\n       ensure better and more effective exercise of the\n       right for the benefit of the institution and through\n       the instrumentality of the management of the\n       educational institutions and without displacing the\n       management. If the administration has to be\n       improved it should be done through the agency or\n       instrumentality of the existing management and not\n       by displacing it. Restrictions on the right of\n       administration imposed in the interest of the\n       general public alone and not in the interests of and\n       for the benefit of minority educational institutions\n       concerned will affect the autonomy in\n       administration.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_872\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Therefore, “administration” and its link with the question\nof establishment is to be ascertained by locating who exercised\nthe “choice” with regard the crucial aspects of an institution and\nto what extent was the minority’s decision making expressed in\nthe tangible outcomes at the time of establishment. It is at this\npoint that the “choice” of the minority marries itself with the\n“administration” by the minority community. As stated above,\nthe choice can be said to have been exercised by the minority\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_874\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.              Page 117 of 193</span>\n\fcommunity, if the minority community is present in some higher\nechelons of the administrative setup. Such positioning of the\nminority community would, in fact, enable the community to\nexercise its “choice” as the said choice is a function of the\ndecision making of the minority community. If the minority\ncommunity is not the decision maker in offices of prominence in\nthe institution, the offices which hold the keys to giving character\nto the institution, the claim of administration or establishment by\nthe minority community would fall flat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_805\">G.5    Locating the real positive indicia\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_806\">169. In light of the above, in discerning real positive indicia for\nadjudging the question of establishment, there cannot be a rigid\nformula; rather, it would rely on various factors depending on the\nera, type, and nature of the institution under consideration. The\nfollowing broad parameters can be culled out from the judgments\nand may be considered by the Court while adjudicating the\nquestion of establishment :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_399\"> i.   Firstly, to claim “establishment”, the minority community\n      must actually and tangibly bring the entirety of the\n      institution into existence. The role played by the minority\n      community must be predominant, in fact almost complete\n      to the point of exclusion of all other forces. The indicia\n      which may be illustrative and exhaustive in this regard\n      may be nature of the institution, the legal/statutory basis\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_875\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 118 of 193</span>\n\f      required for establishing the institution, whether the\n      establishment required any “negotiation” with outside\n      forces, the role in acquiring lands, obtaining funds,\n      constructing buildings, and other related matters must have\n      been held completely minority community. Similarly,\n      while teachers, curriculum, medium of instruction, etc. can\n      be on secular lines, however, the decision-making\n      authority regarding hiring teachers, curriculum decisions,\n      medium of instruction, admission criteria, and similar\n      matters must be the minority community. The choice of\n      having secular education in the institution must be made\n      expressly by the minority community, demonstrating the\n      link between institution and the persons claiming to\n      establish it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_400\">ii.   Secondly, the purpose of the institution must have been to\n      predominantly serve the interests of the minority\n      community or the sole betterment of the minority\n      community, irrespective of the form of education provided\n      and the mode of admission adopted. Therefore, as per the\n      choice of the minority community, an institution may have\n      secular education, but such secular education and the\n      resultant institution, must be predominantly meant for the\n      overall betterment of the minority community.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_876\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.            Page 119 of 193</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_401\">\fiii.   Thirdly,    the   institution     must   be   predominantly\n       administered as a minority institution with the actual\n       functional, executive and policy administration vested\n       with the minority. The minority community should\n       determine the selection, removal criteria, and procedures\n       for hiring teaching, administrative staff, and other\n       personnel. The authority to hire and fire staff must be from\n       the minority community. Further, even if teaching or\n       administrative staff may include non-minority persons, the\n       final authority exercising functional, directional, and\n       policy control over these authorities must be from the\n       minority community. This ensures that the thoughts,\n       beliefs, and ideas of the minority community regarding\n       administration are implemented. This represents the real\n       decision-making authority of the institution being the\n       minority community.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_807\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"197490\" id=\"span_877\">170. In ascertaining the aforesaid, it would be open for the\nCourt look at the true purpose behind each of the above factors.\nThe apprehensions expressed in <a href=\"/doc/197490/\" id=\"a_1568\">A.P. Christian Medical\nEducational Society</a> [supra], enable the Court to pierce the veil\nto determine answers to the factors mentioned above.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_808\">171. It is reiterated that the factors mentioned above are not a\nstraight-jacket formula rather illustrative for the Court to develop\non a case-to-case basis. Additionally, factors such as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_878\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 120 of 193</span>\n\fincorporation under a statute as opposed to establishment under\na statute would be relevant.

Before adverting the countering versions, it is necessary to\nstudy the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1581\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra]. The judgement can\nbe divided in ten parts. In the first part, the Court notes the broad\nparameters of challenge before it and the principal arguments by\nboth sides. The Court notes that amendments made to the AMU\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_888\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                Page 122 of 193</span>\n\fAct, 1920 in the years 1951 and specifically 1965, were\nimpugned before it. The Court noted assertion of the Petitioners\ntherein, to the effect that, the AMU was established by the\nMuslim minority. It was claimed that therefore, the Muslim\nminority possess the right to administer it, and any provisions\nwithin the Acts of 1951 and 1965 that diminish or curtail this\nright are beyond the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1582\">Article 30(1)</a> and hence, invalid.\nThe argument of the Union of India at the said time was that the\nAMU was established by the 1920 Act and therefore, the\nParliament possessed the authority to amend that statute as\ndeemed necessary for the advancement of education. It was\nargued that the minority did not establish the AMU and thus\ncannot assert the right to administer it. Furthermore, it was\ncontended that the provision in the 1920 Act, stipulating that the\nCourt of the AMU was to be composed entirely of Muslims, did\nnot confer any administration rights upon the Muslim community\nand the administration remained under the jurisdiction of the\nsecular authorities established by the 1920 Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_812\">175. The next part of the judgment notes in some detail the\nhistory prior to the AMU coming in to being. The said portion is\nrelevant as it represents a specific, fact-based enquiry that the\nCourt carried out. The Court noted that it was “necessary to refer\nto the history” prior to the establishment of the AMU in 1920 in\norder to “understand the contentions raised on either side”. The\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_889\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.             Page 123 of 193</span>\n\fCourt notes the establishment of the MAO College by efforts of\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan. The Court notes that the at the end of the\n19th century, the idea of establishing a Muslim University\ngathered strength and by 1911 some funds were collected and a\nMuslim University Association was established. The Court\nreferred to the parleys that took place between the Association\nand the Government of India, the condition to collect funds by\nthe Government, and the MAO College and its properties being\nvested in the proposed university. The Court notes a variety of\nfactors which led to the establishment of the Aligarh University\nin 1920 by the 1920 Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_813\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_890\">176. In the next part, the Court refers to the provisions of the\n1920 Act to ascertain the character of the AMU when it was\nestablished in 1920. The Court refers to a large number of\nsections, including <a href=\"/doc/1652564/\" id=\"a_1583\">Section 23</a>, which provided for the ‘Court’ to\nbe a minority body [along with the comment of the Select\nCommittee on the same]. After a detailed analysis of the\nprovisions, <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1584\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra] concludes that the ‘final power\nin almost every matter of importance’ was not with the minority\ncommunity.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_814\">177. Thereafter, the Court discusses the amendments made to\nthe 1920 Act in 1951 and 1965. It specifically notes the\namendments made to <a href=\"/doc/100351/\" id=\"a_1585\">Section 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1652564/\" id=\"a_1586\">Section 23</a> which deal with\nIslamic education and the all-Muslim member ‘Court’, wherein\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_891\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.            Page 124 of 193</span>\n\fthe provisions were altered. It noted that the amendments were\nmade in 1951 to specifically bring the 1920 Act in conformity\nwith the provisions of the Constitution and for the benefit of the\nUniversity so that it could continue to receive aid from the\nGovernment. For the 1965 amendments, it was noted that the\n‘Court’ under <a href=\"/doc/1652564/\" id=\"a_1587\">Section 23</a>, ceased to be the supreme governing\nbody and the powers of the Executive Council were\ncorrespondingly increased. The constitution of the ‘Court’ was\ndrastically changed making it largely a nominated body.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_815\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1262157\" id=\"span_892\">178. In the next portion, the Court discussed the legal challenge\nand the position of law under the Constitution. The Court\nsquarely rejects the argument that even though the religious\nminority may not have established the educational institution, it\nwill have the right to administer it, if by some process it had\nbeen administering the same before the Constitution came into\nforce. It held that the ‘minority will have the right to administer\neducational institutions of their choice provided they have\nestablished them, but not otherwise’ and that ‘words &quot;establish\nand administer&quot; in the Article must be read conjunctively’. The\nCourt then referred to certain observations <a href=\"/doc/1262157/\" id=\"a_1588\">Durgah Committee,\nAjmer v. Syed Hussain Ali</a>, (1962) 1 SCR 383, wherein it was\nheld that even if it be assumed that a certain religious institution\nwas established by a minority community it may lose the right to\nadminister it in certain circumstances.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_893\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 125 of 193</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_816\">\f179. In the next part of the judgment, the Court contextualised\nthe position of educational institutions and specifically\nUniversities in the pre-Constitution and pre-UGC era. The Court\nnotes that a University and a college are different institutions and\nwhat distinguishes a university from any other educational\ninstitution is that a university grants degrees of its own while\nother educational institutions cannot. Most critically, the Court\nnoted that at the said time, there was no prohibition against\nestablishment of universities privately however, the degrees of\nsuch a “University” would not be recognised by the then British\nIndian Government. The non-recognition was non-justiciable as\nestablishment of a Government recognised was only through a\nlegislation and there existed no <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1589\">Article 30</a> or fundamental rights\nbefore 1950. The Court emphasized the importance of the\nrecognition from the then Government as it made the value of\ndegree being awarded by such an institution higher. The Court\nnoted that it was only in the year 1956, that the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1590\">University Grants\nCommission Act, 1956</a>, prohibited establishment of a University\nwithout a statute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_817\">180. In essence, in this critical part of the judgement, the Court\nnoted the two important considerations as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_402\"> i.   There was no law prohibiting establishment of a private\n      institution which grants degree without Government\n      intervention or legislation prior to 1956;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_894\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 126 of 193</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_403\">\fii.   The educational institution established with Government\n      intervention and legislation had a significant advantage of\n      British Government’s recognition to the degree granted by\n      the institution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_404\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_895\">It was this simple understanding of facts as prevalent in pre-\nConstitution India, that formed the fulcrum of the judgment in\n<a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1591\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra].</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_818\">181. On the basis of the said observations, the Court held that\nthe minority community was not prevented in any manner in\n1920 from establishing a university if it was not interested in\nhaving such University and its degrees recognised by the British\nIndian Government. The Court also noted that in such a situation,\nthe minority community could not insist that degrees granted by\nsuch a university should be recognised by Government.\nTherefore, on the said basis the Court remarked that when the\nAMU was established, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/23509/\" id=\"a_1592\">Section 6</a> of the 1920 Act, its\ndegrees were recognised by Government and in that manner, an\ninstitution was brought into existence which could not be brought\ninto existence by any private individual or body.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_819\">182. In the next portion, the Court referred to the MAO College\nas the ‘nucleus’ of AMU – an expression which has caused\nconsiderable controversy in the present proceedings. The Court\nthereafter notes that the Central Legislature established the AMU\nthrough the 1920 Act as the minority could not establish a\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_896\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.              Page 127 of 193</span>\n\funiversity whose degrees were bound to be recognised by\nGovernment and that one circumstance was critical. The Court\nnotes that the 1920 Act was passed as a result of the efforts of the\nMuslim minority but it would not mean that the AMU, as a\nUniversity granting government recognised degrees in 1920, was\nestablished by the Muslim minority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_820\">183. In the next part, the Court renders its opinion on the\nmeaning of the word ‘establish’ to mean &quot;to bring into existence&quot;.\nOn the basis of the said meaning, the Court thereafter again\nventured into the history surrounding the establishment of the\nAMU. The Court notes through a historical analysis that the\nminority community approached the Government to bring into\nexistence a university whose degrees would be recognised by\nGovernment. It was thereafter that the British Government took\nthe decision to establish the university, whose degrees it would\nrecognise, in the only manner known to law for establishing such\na university at the said time – by passing a legislation. The Court\nnotes that the 1920 Act was then passed by the Central\nLegislature and the university of that type was established.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_821\">184. Thus, the Court held that the University was brought into\nexistence by the 1920 Act for it could not have been brought into\nexistence otherwise. Thus, the Court held that since AMU was\nnot established by the minority, and therefore, the amendments\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_897\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 128 of 193</span>\n\fof 1951 and 1965 cannot be struck down as being\nunconstitutional under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_1593\">Art. 30(1).</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_822\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_898\">185. Finally, the Court in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1594\">Azeez Basha</a> [supra], analyses\nvarious provisions of the Act as it then existed and held that\nadministration was also not vested in the Muslim minority rather\nit was vested in the statutory bodies created by the 1920 Act. It\nnoted that only the ‘Court’ was minority only body in 1920\n[amended in 1951], but the electors for some of the members\nincluded non-minorities. On the totality of the factors, the Court\nheld that AMU was neither established nor administered by the\nminority. The remaining part of the judgment considers the attack\non other fundamental rights like <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_1595\">Article 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1596\">Article 19</a>, which\nmay not be germane to the present enquiry.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_823\">H.2    The rationale behind the findings\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_824\">186.

The Appellants delineated the historical trajectory of\nAMU into three distinct phases:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_407\">A.     The period spanning from 1870 to 1877 witnessed the\n       inception of the idea among the Muslim community to\n       establish a university for the upliftment and progress of\n       Muslims, leading to the establishment of MAO College.\nB.     From 1877 to 1910, the Muslim community fervently\n       advocated for the conversion of MAO College into a\n       university, eventually securing tentative agreement from\n       the Government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_408\">C.     The period from 1910 to 1920 saw concerted efforts by the\n       founders of the Muslim University to engage with the\n       Government, culminating in the successful conversion and\n       incorporation of MAO College into Aligarh Muslim\n       University.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_834\">195.

Consequently, the idea of an educational\n       institution managed by and for Muslims with religious\n       instruction gained traction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_410\"> ii.   In 1871, Sir Syed established the Mohammadan Anglo-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_411\">       Oriental College Fund Committee to raise funds for the\n       educational institution. The committee&#x27;s objective was\n       explicitly stated as collecting funds for establishing a\n       college, particularly for the education of Muslims.\niii.   The committee resolved to establish Madrasatul Uloom\n       (an Arabic term for educational institution) in Aligarh,\n       which was inaugurated on May 24, 1875.

The said institutions did\nnot aspire to attain “university” status and were content with\noperating as affiliated colleges to the Universities established by\nlegislation by legislative bodies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_853\">207. Parallelly, prior to the prohibition contained in the <a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1619\">UGC\nAct, 1956</a>, there existed a period wherein the legal landscape\nlacked statutory constraints preventing the establishment of\nuniversities without specific legislative enactments. During this\ntime, it was within the prerogative of any collective body or\nindividuals to establish educational institutions in the nature of\nuniversities without legislative intervention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_854\">208. In fact, in the absence of a provision like <a href=\"/doc/248832/\" id=\"a_1620\">Section 23</a> of the\nUGC Act, 1956, it was open to such institutions to even adopt the\ntitles such as &quot;university&quot; or in some cases &quot;vidyapeeth&quot; or\n&quot;jamia&quot; asserting their capability to grant degrees. This era\nwitnessed the emergence of numerous universities, predating\nindependence, whose degrees did not carry recognition from the\nBritish Government for eligibility in employment within Crown\nservices. Despite this absence of official recognition, many of\nthese institutions rose to prominence, eventually becoming\nleading national educational establishments.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_855\">209.

THE QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE 1920 ACT\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_858\">211. As stated above, “administration” and its link with the\nquestion of establishment is to be ascertained by locating who\nexercised the “choice” with regard the crucial aspects of an\ninstitution and to what extent was the minority’s decision making\nexpressed in the tangible outcomes at the time of establishment.\nAs stated above, it is at this point that the “choice” of the minority\nmarries itself with the “administration” by the minority\ncommunity. As stated above, the choice can be said to have been\nexercised by the minority community, if the minority community\nis present in some higher echelons of the administrative setup.\nSuch positioning of the minority community would, in fact,\nenable the community to exercise its “choice” as the said choice\nis a function of the decision making of the minority community.\nIf the minority community is not the decision maker in offices of\nprominence in the institution, the offices which hold the keys to\ngiving character to the institution, the claim of administration or\nestablishment by the minority community would fall flat.

It was pointed out that any references to MAO\nCollege or its affiliate bodies in previous enactments or\ndocuments are construed as references to AMU. It was pointed\nout that all employees and staff of MAO College were\nautomatically deemed as employees of AMU with the same\ntenure, terms, rights, and privileges.

It was pointed out that the First Statutes\nmandated that the Register of registered graduates include those\nwho had been educated for at least two years at MAO College.\nAdditionally, the Central Legislature incorporated provisions in\nthe AMU Act specifically benefiting the Muslim community,\nsuch as the promotion of Oriental and Islamic studies, instruction\nin Muslim theology and religion, and furtherance of arts, science,\nand other branches of learning.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_862\">215. It was pointed out that the Act allowed for the\nestablishment of intermediate colleges and schools within the\nvicinity of MAO College to provide instruction in Muslim\nreligion and theology. It was pointed out that regarding\nadministration, the Muslim community had both de jure and de\nfacto control over the management of AMU.

It was\npointed out that additionally, the Act did not require the\nsubmission and approval of certain statutes dealing with Muslim\neducation. It was pointed out that the presence of non-Muslims\nin governing bodies does not diminish the minority character of\nthe university, citing legal precedents. It was pointed out that\npowers vested in the Lord Rector and the Visiting Board under\nthe Act do not affect the university&#x27;s minority character and are\nmerely ‘regulatory’ or ‘supervisory’ in nature as would be in case\nof even present-day Universities and their ‘Chancellors’.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_864\">217. The parties defending the judgment of the High Court\npointed out that the 1920 Act provides for government control\nover the AMU by controlling, inter alia, the appointment of\nimportant office holders, the composition of administrative\nbodies, the rule making power of the university etc. It was\npointed out that the Governor General-in-Counsel was\nappointing authority at the time of inception for the high\npositions of Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor, and Vice-Chancellor. It\nwas pointed out that powers of the University had 12 sub-clauses,\nall of which were secular expect for one. It was pointed out that\nthe admissions in the University at the time of inception were\nmade on secular lines. It was pointed out that First Statutes of the\nUniversity were framed not by the ‘Court’ but by the British\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_946\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

It is critical to note that the 1920 Act and the nature thereof,\nalso bestows the AMU with its character at the time of inception.\nThe said character at the time of inception would be useful in\nascertaining if the institution was predominantly established for\nthe minority community with a ‘sprinkling of outsiders’ or not. It\nmay be noted that merely having a faculty or a portion thereof\ndedicated to a religious discipline would not bestow a larger\npublic entity like a University, with its character. The leading\nUniversities of the world today have faculties for religious\nstudies and enquiry5. The said faculties are genuine centres of\nintellectual and theological enquiry and would also interest\npersons from other religions in numerous cases. Therefore,\nhaving a specific portion carved out in a larger University set-up\nwould not be the defining characteristic of the University.

At this stage, this Court has to adjudicate another issue that\ntouches upon the question of establishment. It has been argued\nthat the 1920 Act was a mere legislative “veneer” or a token\nrecognition to an already existing entity. On the other hand, it\nwas countered by the argument that there is a difference between\na body which is created under a statute as opposed to a body\nwhich the statute claims to itself ‘establish’. On the basis of the\nsame, it is urged that since the AMU owed its very existence to a\nstatute, it was established by the statute only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_869\">220. In this regard, the Court needs to clarify that a legislation\n[more so a legislation in the pre-independence era] can never be\nconsidered to be an inconsequential veneer or a mere\nrecognition/token. A legislation is the will of the sovereign\nreflected and enacted through a dedicated body. A legislation is\nalways of some consequence and cannot be presumed to be of\ntertiary importance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_870\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"472954\" id=\"span_949\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_950\">221.

For example,\nin the <a href=\"/doc/189282098/\" id=\"a_1635\">North East Adventist University Act, 2015</a>, in the\nPreamble, provides as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_452\">       “<a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1636\">An Act</a> to establish and incorporate an University\n       in the State, with emphasis on providing high\n       quality education, training and research in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_958\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Similarly, the preamble of The Teerthanker Mahaveer\nUniversity Act, 2008 reads as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_454\">       “<a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1637\">An Act</a> to establish and incorporate a Jain\n       Minority Teaching University sponsored by\n       Teerthanker Mahaveer Institute of Management &amp;\n       Technology, Society, Moradabad Uttar Pradesh\n       and to provide for matters connected therewith or\n       incidental thereto.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_455\">227. Therefore, the use of the phrase ‘establish and incorporate’\nby the Legislature may be relevant in the larger enquiry but\ncannot be said to be determinative of the factum of establishment\nor not by the minority community. The question of establishment\nis to be ascertained by a multitude of factors, and especially in\ncase of Universities – the history of the establishment, the nature\nof the Act, the nature of the University, etc. and the phrase\n‘establish and incorporate’ would be of limited importance only.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_959\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.              Page 162 of 193</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_456\">\f228. Separately, it is noteworthy that there exist alternative\nparadigms of universities established by legislative bodies7,\nwhich may claim to be minority institutions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_457\">229. The legislative frameworks of statute-based minority\nUniversities were highlighted before this Court, wherein the\npredominant character of the University is minority-oriented with\nonly peripheral non-minority elements. Therefore, if the intention\nwas to establish or incorporate or recognise a minority\nUniversity,    the   Legislatures     have    incorporated     suitable\nprovisions to colour the University with a minority identity.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_458\">230. Furthermore, the abovementioned enactments and a\nperusal of the same underscores that a considerable degree of\nautonomy was retained by the sponsoring entity, with pivotal\ndecision-making powers vested therein and further in some cases,\nspecific provisions for providing religion-based reservations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_459\">231. The Court may notice another aspect that the 1920 Act in\nits Preamble provided that it was “<a href=\"/doc/535576/\" id=\"a_1638\">An Act</a> to establish and\nincorporate a teaching and residential Muslim University at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_960\">7</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/181051474/\" id=\"a_1639\">The Integral University Act, 2004</a> ; The Teerthanker Mahaveer University,\nUttar Pradesh Act, 2008 ; <a href=\"/doc/189282098/\" id=\"a_1640\">The North East Adventist University Act, 2015</a> ;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_873\">Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences,\nUttar Pradesh Act, 2016 ; The Era University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh Act,\n2016 ; The Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, 2005 ; The Aliah\nUniversity Act, 2007 ; The Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University Act,\n2008 ; <a href=\"/doc/115503472/\" id=\"a_1641\">The Spicer Adventist University Act, 2014</a> ; <a href=\"/doc/34064026/\" id=\"a_1642\">The Khaja Bandanawaz\nUniversity Act, 2018</a> ; The Khangchendzonga Buddhist University, Sikkim\nAct, 2020 ; The Enteral University (Establishment And Regulation) Act,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_961\">2008</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_962\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

A Legislature speaks through the\nenactment and not merely the Preamble, therefore, the contents\nof the legislation would be primordial source of information for\nthe enquiry. The amendment made to the 1920 Act in 1981, and\nthe deletion of the words ‘establish and’ from the Preamble,\ncannot therefore alter the pre-existing, pre-occurred factual\nsituation. The regular bench, would therefore, have to analyse the\nfactual situation and arrive at a finding.\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_13\">M.

The statute enacted in 1920 has gone through its own\njourney and evolution. As far as the evolution of the 1920 Act is\nconcerned, both sides have illustrated the amendments made over\nthe years. The 1951 Amendment Act introduced notable\nalterations, including the omission of <a href=\"/doc/471398/\" id=\"a_1643\">Section 9</a> from the original\n1920 Act, which had sanctioned compulsory instruction in\nMuslim religion for Muslim students. Further, an amendment to\n<a href=\"/doc/816290/\" id=\"a_1644\">Section 8</a> allowed for religious instruction for consenting\nstudents, aligning with <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_1645\">Article 28(3)</a> of the Constitution, which\nprohibits such instruction in aided institutions. In <a href=\"/doc/1261645/\" id=\"a_1646\">Section 5(12)</a>,\nwhich was the residuary clause, the portion dealing with Islamic\nlearning and Muslim theology, along with another portion, was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_964\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Importantly, the lynchpin of the case of the parties\nchallenging the judgment of the High Court and <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1647\">Azeez Basha</a>\n[supra], the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/248832/\" id=\"a_1648\">Section 23(1)</a> of the 1920 Act [as it then\nwas], which limited ‘Court’ membership to Muslims, was deleted\nby the 1951 Amendment Act.

The amendment in 1965, more than its content and\nchanges, becomes relevant because of the unusual sparring\nbetween two giants of their respective fields – Retd. J. M.C.\nChagla [the well-known Retd. Chief Justice of the Bombay High\nCourt and the Education Minister in 1965] and Mr. Frank\nAnthony [a well-known educationist and Senior Counsel before\nthis Court]. The Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on 16.08.1965.\nOn 27.08.1965, Mr. J. Chagla presented the reasons behind the\namendments. The amendments were thereafter described and\nwere sought to be justified in the context of the occurrences at the\nUniversity. It was stated that the amendment, to at least some\nportions, was a temporary measure. Critically, Mr. J. Chagla\ndiscussed the ‘character of the University’ during the said debate.\nHe asserted that the AMU was a ‘national institution’ of ‘national\nimportance’ along the lines of the four Central Universities as per\nEntry 63 of List I of Seventh Schedule. While emphasizing the\nimportance of intellectual enquiry qua Muslim culture in India at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_965\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 165 of 193</span>\n\fthe institution, Mr. J. Chagla highlighted that it was in the context\nof national and secular India. He referred to the history of the\nAMU in 1920 and the amendments made in 1951.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_876\">234. In response, on the same day, Mr. Anthony raised the issue\nhow the Government had on affidavit claimed that the <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1650\">Article 30</a>\nwould not apply to the AMU in the proceedings before the\nSupreme Court [purportedly in a petition challenging the\nOrdinance preceding the 1965 amendment]. Mr. Anthony, on\n01.09.1965, made a detailed speech claiming that the right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1651\">Article 30</a> has two elements – establish and administer – which\ncan be used disjunctively. In his opinion, establishment was not\na necessary pre-condition. Mr. Anthony thereafter refers to his\nown understanding of history of the AMU and refers to the MAO\nCollege as the ‘nucleus’ and asserted that the 1920 Act vested\nadministration with the minority community.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_877\">235. Mr. J. Chagla responded to this on 02.09.1965 quippingly\nclaiming that he was ‘no longer a practicing lawyer and perhaps\nmy law has become rather rusty. But still I know a little bit of\nlaw, particularly constitutional law. I entirely disagree with him\n[Mr. Anthony]’. Mr. J. Chagla stated that the AMU was neither\nestablished nor administered by the Muslim community. He\nstated that the AMU was created by a statute, the 1951\namendments and the presence of the AMU in Entry 63, List I of\nSeventh Schedule makes the same crystal clear. He further gave\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_966\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.                Page 166 of 193</span>\n\fnumerous examples of how the administration of the institution\nwas not technically with the minority community. He again\nclaimed that the AMU was a national institution and the\nsovereign legislature had the right to amend the clause. He also\nremarked that through history, the British ensured that the\ninstitution which was financed by Indian money, was open to all\ncommunities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_878\">236. The sparring between the two continued on 03.09.1965 as\nwell. Mr. Anthony clearly claimed that he equated establishment\nwith foundation and with ‘who founded it. If the minority\ncommunity founded it, then giving legislative recognition will\nmerely be as I said and I repeat, giving legislative sanction’. Mr.\nJ. Chagla stated that in law the Parliament cannot make a\nclassification on the basis of religion and therefore, both the\nAMU and the BHU enactments were amended in 1951. Finally,\non 06.09.1965, after short closing speech by Mr. J. Chagla, the\namendment was passed. The 1965 <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_1652\">Amending Act</a> effected a\nnotable amendment by demoting the Court from its status as the\n&#x27;supreme governing body&#x27; of the University to a consultative\nbody for the Visitor of the University, namely, the President of\nIndia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_879\">237. The 1972 amendment made additions to the definition\nclause. Critically, it added a clause to <a href=\"/doc/1261645/\" id=\"a_1653\">Section 5</a> which provides\nthe University with the power to promote the study of religion,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_967\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

It amended <a href=\"/doc/984125/\" id=\"a_1654\">Section 17</a> to\nprovide that the Chancellor shall be appointed by the Visitor in\nsuch manner as may be prescribed by the Statutes and amended\n<a href=\"/doc/1553414/\" id=\"a_1655\">Section 19</a> made him the principal executive and academic\nofficer of the University, and shall exercise general supervision\nand control over the affairs of the University and give effect to\nthe decisions of all the authorities of the University. The powers\nof the ‘Court’ were revised but remained significantly curtailed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_880\">238.    The amendment in 1981 rescinded <a href=\"/doc/248832/\" id=\"a_1656\">Section 23</a> to its\nposition prior to 1965, which had resulted in the ‘Court’ being\ndemoted to a consultative body. It amended <a href=\"/doc/984125/\" id=\"a_1657\">Section 17</a> to provide\nthat the Chancellor to be elected by the ‘Court’. The 1981\namendment deleted the portion in <a href=\"/doc/816290/\" id=\"a_1658\">Section 8</a> which restricted the\nUniversity from adopting or imposing any test of religious belief\nor profession for admissions or appointments as teacher or other\noffice.

It erroneously assumes that there existed any right\nin the decade of 1910-1920 when the events concerning\nestablishment of the AMU took place. There is no question of\nsurrendering any right as no such right, even in context of MAO\nCollege, ever existed as the British Indian Government was a\nsupreme Imperial power in the country and no person living in\nIndia had any constitution-based rights nor was there any such\nconcept. The entirety of the landscape was a function of the\nlargesse of the Executive or the Legislative powers of the British\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_980\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Indeed, fundamental rights could not have been\nsurrendered after 26.01.1950 however, if some events have\nalready happened prior to the same, it is not possible to re-\ninterpret such factual events in a different or a purportedly\nconstitutionally compliant manner. The facts of history cannot be\nchanged by the advent of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_894\">246. It is important to clarify at this stage that the said\nproposition does not entail that pre-Constitution enactments,\neven enactments providing for taking over of institutions\n[religious or educational] by the then Legislatures, would be free\nfrom the vice of unconstitutionality. The said statutes would\nalways be subject to the overarching constitutional rights and\nsubject to the rigours of <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_1674\">Article 13.</a> The present case therefore,\ndoes not concern surrender of “rights” rather involves a holistic\nsurvey of events leading up to the 1920 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_895\">N.     THE DE-FACTO AND SAFE HAVEN ARGUMENT\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_896\">247. It has also been argued by the parties challenging the\njudgment of the High Court that de-facto, the important\nauthorities like the members of the ‘Court’ and the Vice-\nChancellors of the University have been from the minority\ncommunity. On the basis of the same, it is asserted that the while\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_981\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.              Page 174 of 193</span>\n\fafter 1951, there may not have been a specific requirement for\nthe ‘Court’ to be consisting of the minority community, in reality,\nthe members from the minority community have been appointed\nin most cases. The same has been read to be a pointer towards the\nminority character of the institution. On the other hand, the\nparties defending the judgment of the High Court highlighted that\nonce there exists no such requirement in law, it would be\nerroneous to base a conclusion on the basis of practice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_897\">248. As a matter of law, a practice or a chance occurrence\nwould not be a factor in deciding the nature of the institution and\ncertainly not relevant to decide the question of establishment. If\nthe institution is not held to have been established by a minority,\nif by some reason, persons of one community have manned the\npositions in the administration in an institution, the same would\nnot ascribe character to the institution. For example, if a secular\ninstitution was established by a group of persons [which were not\npredominantly of the minority community], if for some reasons,\nthe Principal/Director of the institution has been from one\nminority community, the said occurrence could not be said to be\nenough to declare the institution to be a minority institution. The\nde-facto position of the AMU, with regard to the electors in the\n‘Court’, the ‘Court’ or the Vice-Chancellors, would therefore not\nbe the deciding factor for the purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1675\">Article 30</a> question.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_982\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.              Page 175 of 193</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_898\">\f249. Apart from the above, it was also asserted that the AMU\nhas, over the years, provided the minorities a haven to gain\nknowledge in the country, and declaration as a non-minority\ninstitution, would be highly detrimental to the same. The said\nargument, apart from being constricted in approach, is evidently\ncontradictory.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_899\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801897\" id=\"span_983\">250. The AMU, from the time of its establishment, has never\nhad any sort reservations on the basis of religion all the way up\ntill 2005, which was the first time the said exercise was sought to\nbe carried out. Further, the AMU, after the declaration in <a href=\"/doc/1801897/\" id=\"a_1676\">Azeez\nBasha</a> [supra], at least till 1981 and arguably even thereafter,\nwas always considered to be a non-minority institution. The\ncontention that the AMU serves the interests of the minority\ncommunity and denial of the protection under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1677\">Article 30</a> would\njeopardise the same, ignores the fact that the AMU, without being\nrecognized as a minority institution or implementing religion-\nbased reservations for an entire century, has served such a\npurpose. Therefore, asserting minority status and advocating for\nreligious reservations based on the university&#x27;s historical\ncontributions to the minority community, appears to be self-\ncontradictory.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_900\">251.

It was asserted that since such neutral institutions\ntend to be driven by the assumptions, leanings, and priorities of\nthe majoritarian groups/cultures, <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1678\">Article 30</a> contemplates\nconstitutionally protecting certain educational spaces from such\n‘majoritarianism-by-default’, guarding their minority character\nand priorities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_902\">252. The said assertion completely misconstrues the purpose of\n<a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1679\">Article 30</a> and the nature of non-minority or neutral institutions\nin the country. The purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1680\">Article 30</a> is not to create ‘minority\nonly’ ghettos rather provide positive rights to the minorities to\nestablish educational institutions of their choice and kind. <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1681\">Article\n30</a>, as a feature of the Constitution, provides important rights\nwhich function within the larger penumbra of fundamental rights.\nThere is substantial interplay, intermixing and balancing of rights\ninter se within the fundamental rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_903\">253.

The term “establish” in <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_1751\">Article 30</a> means “to bring into\n       existence or to create” and cannot be conflated with\n       generic phrases such as “genesis of the institution” or the\n       “founding moment of the institution”.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_472\">iv.    The real positive indicia for determining the question of\n       establishment of an institution would have to be developed\n       on a case to case basis with the following broad parameters\n       in mind :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_473\">       i.    Firstly, to claim “establishment”, the minority\n             community must actually and tangibly bring the\n             entirety of the institution into existence. The role\n             played by the minority community must be\n             predominant, in fact almost complete to the point of\n             exclusion of all other forces. The indicia which may\n             be illustrative and exhaustive in this regard may be\n             the nature of the institution, the legal/statutory basis\n             required for establishing the institution, whether the\n             establishment required any “negotiation” with\n             outside forces, the role in acquiring lands, obtaining\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1015\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.               Page 187 of 193</span>\n\f             funds, constructing buildings, and other related\n             matters must have been held completely by the\n             minority community. Similarly, while teachers,\n             curriculum, medium of instruction, etc. can be on\n             secular    lines,   however,   the    decision-making\n             authority regarding hiring teachers, curriculum\n             decisions, medium of instruction, admission criteria,\n             and    similar matters      must     be the minority\n             community. The choice of having secular education\n             in the institution must be made expressly by the\n             minority community, demonstrating           the link\n             between institution and the persons claiming to\n             establish it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_474\">      ii.    Secondly, the purpose of the institution must have\n             been to predominantly serve the interests of the\n             minority community or the sole betterment of the\n             minority community, irrespective of the form of\n             education provided and the mode of admission\n             adopted. Therefore, as per the choice of the minority\n             community, an institution may have secular\n             education, but such secular education and the\n             resultant institution, must be predominantly meant\n             for the overall betterment of the minority\n             community.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1016\">Civil Appeal No. 2286 of 2006 and Ors.

Thirdly, the institution must be predominantly\n              administered as a minority institution with the actual\n              functional, executive and policy administration\n              vested with the minority. The minority community\n              should determine the selection, removal criteria, and\n              procedures for hiring teaching, administrative staff,\n              and other personnel. The authority to hire and fire\n              staff must be from the minority community. Further,\n              even if teaching or administrative staff may include\n              non-minority persons, the final authority exercising\n              functional, directional, and policy control over these\n              authorities must be from the minority community.\n              This ensures that the thoughts, beliefs, and ideas of\n              the minority community regarding administration\n              are implemented in reality.

In the pre-independence and pre-UGC era, in the absence\n       of a provision like <a href=\"/doc/248832/\" id=\"a_1755\">Section 23</a> of the UGC Act, 1956, it was\n       open for any institutions to adopt the titles such as\n       &quot;university&quot; or in some cases &quot;vidyapeeth&quot; or &quot;jamia&quot;\n       asserting their capability to grant degrees.

There were no rights, fundamental or otherwise, prior to\n        the Constitution coming into force and therefore, there is\n        no question of surrendering any right. The British Indian\n        Government was a supreme Imperial power in the country,\n        and the question of surrender is illusionary and does not\n        arise in the present case. The coming into force of the\n        Constitution and fundamental right after 1950, cannot alter\n        the events that occurred during the decade of 1910-1920\n        which led to the establishment of the AMU.\n ix.    There is no legal requirement for the AMU ‘Court’ to be\n        manned by the people from the minority community ever\n        since 1951 and therefore, merely because de facto the\n        persons from the minority community may have manned\n        the posts in the institution, would not be relevant to\n        adjudicate the question.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_482\">  x.
