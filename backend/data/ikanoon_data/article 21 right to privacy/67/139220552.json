The cash sales has been duly admitted by the MD and\n      accountant of M/s. Pragati Glass Private Limited at the time of\n      recording statement. Copy of the relevant extract of the statement\n      recorded of MD and accountant of M/s Pragati Glass Private Limited\n      have been confronted to the assessee and he has failed to provide any\n      documentary evidence in contradiction of the same. The assessee in\n      his reply has admitted that he has made purchases from stated party\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                         6</span>\n                                                    ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n      which are recorded in his books which proves that the assessee knows\n      the above stated party. The assessee has submitted that the stated party\n      has filed bogus recovery case against the assessee. However he has\n      failed to provide any documentary evidence/petition copy in this\n      regard. Further, the assessee has also failed to explain the nature of\n      suit filed, reason for the suit filed, how the same is related to cash\n      purchase. The assessee has requested to cross examine the MD and\n      accountant of M/s Pragati Glass Limited with the only objective to\n      delay the proceedings as the assessee knows the stated person and has\n      admitted to purchase goods from it. The copy of statement of M.D.\n      was duly given and assessee failed to furnish any evidence/proof to\n      support his version.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">      In view of the above, it is evident that the assessee has made cash\n      purchase amounting to Rs. 2,49,26,243/- from M/s Pragati Glass\n      Private Limited in the year under consideration for which the assessee\n      has failed to provide any documentary evidence for source of expense.\n      Therefore, the same is added to the income of the assessee as\n      unexplained expenditure under section 69C of the income <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_3\">Tax Act,\n      1961</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5     At the time of hearing, Ld AR submitted that in respect of Ground 1 of\ngrounds of appeal is the issue of assumption of jurisdiction<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s 153C</a> of the Act\nand, framing of assessment<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_5\"> u/s 153C</a>/<a href=\"/doc/144280341/\" id=\"a_6\">143(3)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.1   It is submitted that Assessment Years 2014-15 and 2015-16 is beyond the\nperiod of six assessment years immediately preceding the assessment year\nrelevant to the previous year in which search is conducted in the case of\nassessee herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">5.2   It is submitted that as per proviso to <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_7\">section 153C</a> for taking action<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_8\"> u/s\n153C</a> the date of search would be substituted by the date of receiving the books\nof account or documents or the assets allegedly pertaining or information\ncontained therein relates to the assessee by the Assessing Officer of assessee i.e.\n10.3.2021, which were seized in the course of search of the searched person i.e.\n12.5.2019.

It is evident on a plain interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/51644587/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 153C(1)</a> that\n            the Parliamentary intent to enact the proviso was to cater not\n            merely to the question of abatement but also with regard to the\n            date from which the six year period was to be reckoned, in\n            respect of which the returns were to be filed by the third party\n            (whose premises are not searched and in respect of whom the\n            specific provision under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 153-C</a> was enacted. The\n            revenue argued that the proviso [to <a href=\"/doc/581124/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 153(c)(1)</a>] is\n            confined in its application to the question of abatement.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">            10. This Court is of the opinion that the revenue&#x27;s argument is\n            insubstantial and without merit. It is quite plausible that without\n            the kind of interpretation which SSP Aviation adopted, the A.O.\n            seized of the materials- of the search party, under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_14\">section 132</a> -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">            would take his own time to forward the papers and materials\n            belonging to the third party, to the concerned A.O. In that event\n            if the date would virtually &quot;relate back&quot; as is sought to be\n            contended by the revenue, (to the date of the seizure), the\n            prejudice caused to the third party, who would be drawn into\n            proceedings as it were unwittingly (and in many cases have no\n            concern with it at all), is dis-proportionate. For instance, if the\n            papers are in fact assigned under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 153-C</a> after a period\n            of four years, the third party assessee&#x27;s prejudice is writ large as\n            it would have to virtually preserve the records for at latest 10\n            years which is not the requirement in law. Such disastrous and\n            harsh consequences cannot beat tributed to Parliament. On the\n            other hand, a plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_16\">section 153-C</a> supports the\n            interpretation which this Court adopts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">            11.

We find that from perusal of the records, there is no evidence\nto prove that the &quot;amounts sent‟ shown in the hard disk is\nactually amounts sent by assessee company in hawala route which\nhad ultimately found its way in the form of share capital and\nshare premium under FDI route. The revenue had completely\naddressed this issue and made an addition purely on suspicion\nand surmise without any basis thereby making the addition totally\nunsustainable in the eyes of law. On the contrary, the assessee had\nstated that LGF had sent 19500000 USD from Cyprus and after\ndeduction of LC charges and other overseas bank charges , the\nassessee could ultimately receive only 18621973.93 USD\nequivalent to Rs 100 crores in India under FDI route as share\ncapital and share premium. In support of this, the assessee had\nduly provided all the necessary documents as listed above. The\nassessee from the inception had always taken the stand that it had\nnot sent any monies abroad in hawala route. The assessee cannot\nbe asked to prove the negative. It is for the revenue to prove the\nsame with cogent evidences, which is not done in the instant case.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">We find that the revenue had merely proceeded to make the\naddition on suspicion. It is trite law that suspicion howsoever\nstrong would not partake the character of legal evidence and\nhence a greater onus is casted on the revenue to bring on record\ncogent evidences to justify its suspicion, which is conspicuously\nabsent in the instant case. The only material that is relied upon by\nthe revenue is the hard disk seized during search which only\ncontained the details of „amounts sent‟ and &quot;amounts received‟.\nNowhere the said material even suggested that the amounts were\nsent by assessee company in illegal route which in turn had\nsurfaced back in the form of share capital and premium under\nFDI route from Cyprus. Though the presumption<a href=\"/doc/105713020/\" id=\"a_48\"> u/s 292C</a> of the\nAct would go in favour of the revenue, it cannot be brushed aside\nthat the said presumption is a rebuttable presumption and\nassessee had duly discharged its onus on the same. Moreover, the\npresent assessee herein is an assessee proceeded<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_49\"> u/s 153C</a> of the\nAct and hence it is all the more necessary for the revenue to arrive\nat the satisfaction that income or materials or documents does not\nbelong or pertain to the searched person and indeed belongs to\nthird person (i.e 153C presumption<a href=\"/doc/105713020/\" id=\"a_50\"> u/s 292C</a> of the Act would\napply only to the person proceeded<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_51\"> u/s 153A</a> of the Act and not\nfor the assessee<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_52\"> u/s 153C</a> of the Act.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">                                                   ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n7     Further Ld AR Submitted that no satisfaction has been recorded by AO of\nassessee that the seized documents have any bearing on income of assessee:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">7.1   It is submitted that learned Assessing Officer of assessee has recorded the\nsatisfaction as under: (pages 41-54 of Paper Book at page 54)\n      &quot;4.

When we turn our\ngaze upon <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 153A</a>, it becomes apparent that where a\nsearch is initiated or documents and books requisitioned, the\nAO is mandated to issue notice calling upon the searched\nperson to submit a ROI in respect of each AY falling within the\nsix AYs&#x27; and for the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;. Upon\nsubmission of that ROI, the AO stands empowered statutorily\nto assess or reassess the total income of six AYs&#x27; immediately\npreceding the assessment year corresponding to the year of\nsearch and for the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;. The expression\n&quot;relevant assessment year&quot; has been duly defined by\nExplanation 1 placed in <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 153A</a> and is explained to\ninclude those years which fall beyond the six AYs&#x27; spoken of\nearlier but not later than ten AYs&#x27; from the end of the AY\nrelevant to the FY in which the search was conducted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"163979461\" id=\"span_20\">38. As was held in <a href=\"/doc/163979461/\" id=\"a_69\">SSP Aviation Ltd v. Deputy\nCommissioner of Income Tax</a>[17], the AO of the searched\nperson while proceeding to transmit the material gathered in the\ncourse of the search to the AO of the &quot;other person&quot; is not\nobliged to form any opinion with respect to escapement of\nincome or for that matter the material likely to have an impact\non the total income of the non-searched entity. At the stage of\ntransmission of material, the AO of the searched person is only\nrequired to be satisfied that the material or documents\nunearthed pertain to a person or entity other than the one\nsearched. The relevant extracts of the decision in SSP Aviation\nLtd are reproduced hereinbelow:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">39. The principle that the AO of the searched person is only\nrequired to be satisfied that the documents or materials pertain\nto the &quot;other person&quot; at the stage of transmission of material or\ndocuments to the jurisdictional AO of the non-searched entity\nwas reiterated in RRJ Securities. We deem it apposite to extract\nthe following passages from that decision:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">40. It is thus apparent that it is only when the transmitted\ndocuments and material reaches the desk of the jurisdictional\nAO that it becomes empowered to initiate action under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_70\">Section\n153C</a> of the Act. This is evident from a plain textual reading of\nthat provision and which speaks of the commencement point\nbeing the handing over of documents or assets seized or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                           15</span>\n                                      ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nrequisitioned to the AO of the &quot;other person&quot; and it in turn\nproceeding to issue notice to assess or reassess the income of\nthe non-searched entity in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 153A</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">However, the initiation of action under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 153C</a> is\nsignificantly premised upon the AO being satisfied that the\nbooks of account or documents and assets seized or\nrequisitioned having &quot;a bearing on the determination of the\ntotal income of such other person&quot;. This is manifest from the\nprovision employing the expression &quot;if, that Assessing\nOfficer is satisfied.....&quot;. It would therefore necessarily follow\nthat the issuance of a notice under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 153C</a> is clearly\nnot intended to be an inevitable consequence to the receipt\nof material by the jurisdictional AO. That the AO before\ncommencement of action under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 153C</a> is also obliged\nto be satisfied that the material so received would &quot;have a\nbearing on the determination of the total income of such other\nperson&quot; is an aspect of significance and constitutes a\nfundamental point of distinction between <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 153A</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 153C</a>.

It was consequent to the passing of the aforesaid Act that\n<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 153C</a> came to incorporate provisions relating to the AO\nbeing satisfied that the books of accounts, documents or assets\nseized or requisitioned must &quot;have a bearing on the\ndetermination of the total income of such other person&quot; for\nthe six preceding AYs&#x27; or the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot; as\nreferred to in Explanation 1 to <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 153A</a>. Prior to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                           18</span>\n                                      ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\npromulgation of these amendments, the AO of the non-searched\nparty was not obliged to form an opinion that the material\nreceived by it was likely to impact the estimation of income of\nthat person. Significantly, although this prerequisite came to be\nincorporated in <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 153C</a>, no such corresponding\nprecondition was included in <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 153A</a>. This, although the\nlegislative history of the search assessment provisions placed in\nthe Act would indicate that they were amended from time to\ntime in order to constitute a complete and homogeneous code.\nThis becomes apparent from the legislative mandate of those\ntwo provisions being applicable to searches undertaken in a\nparticular time period, the principles of abatement being\nreplicated and the search assessment power being available to\nbe invoked for the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;, and which\nextended the power to be exercised over a ten year block, being\nsimultaneously introduced in those provisions. The Legislature\nclearly intended both these provisions to form part of a\ncohesive scheme and to be complementary to each other.\nHowever, the aspects of satisfaction and of the material likely\nto implicate or influence were not added in <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 153A</a>. The\nfact that any additions that may be ultimately made upon a\nculmination of assessment under <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 153A</a> being indelibly\nfounded on the material gathered in the course of the search is a\nseparate issue all together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">44. The usage of the expression &quot;have a bearing&quot; would\nnecessarily lead one to conclude that the mere discovery of\nbooks, documents or assets would not justify the initiation of\nproceedings under that provision. Upon receipt of that material,\nthe jurisdictional AO must additionally be satisfied that those\nare likely to have an impact on &quot;the determination of the total\nincome&quot;.

This too speaks of &quot;relevancy&quot; as one of the meanings one\nmay gather where that particular expression is used. This leads\nus to the inevitable conclusion that the initiation of action under\n<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 153C</a> would have to be founded on a formation of\nopinion by the jurisdictional AO that the material handed over\nand received pursuant to a search is likely to influence the\n&quot;determination of the total income&quot; and would be of relevancy\nfor the purposes of assessment or reassessment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">F. INCRIMINATING MATERIAL- CASCADING EFFECT?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">48. In terms of the Second Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 153A</a>, all\nassessment or reassessment proceedings relating to the six\nAYs&#x27; or the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot; pending on the date of\nsearch are statutorily envisaged to abate. Abatement is\nenvisioned to be an inevitable consequence of the initiation of\naction under <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 153A</a>. Neither issuance of notice nor\nabatement are predicated upon a formation of opinion by the\nAO of the searched person that the material is likely to impact\nthe total income of that assessee. However, the spectre of\nabatement insofar as the &quot;other person&quot; is concerned would\narise only after the jurisdictional AO has formed the requisite\nsatisfaction of the material having &quot;a bearing on the\ndetermination of the total income of such other person&quot; and\nhaving formed the opinion that proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 153C</a>\nare liable to be initiated. It would be pertinent to bear in mind\nthat Kabul Chawla was a decision rendered in the context of\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 153A</a>. It was in the aforesaid backdrop that the Court\nsignificantly observed that once a search takes place under\n<a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 132</a> of the Act, notice under <a href=\"/doc/190884993/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 153A(1)</a> would\nmandatorily issue. The abatement of assessment and\nreassessment pending on that date would, in the case of a\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 153A</a> assessment, be a preordained consequence.\nHowever, and in light of what has been observed hereinabove,\nit is apparent that <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 153C</a> constructs a subtle and yet\nsignificant distinction insofar as the question of commencement\nof proceedings or assumption of jurisdiction is concerned.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                            21</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">49. That takes us to the principal question and which pertains to\nthe nature of the incriminating material that may be obtained\nand the years forming part of the block which would merit\nbeing thrown open. Regard must be had to the fact that while\n<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 153C</a> enables and empowers the jurisdictional AO to\ncommence assessment or reassessment for a block of six AYs&#x27;\nor the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;, that action is founded on\nsatisfaction being reached that the books of accounts,\ndocuments or assets seized &quot;have a bearing on the\ndetermination of the total income of such other person&quot;. We in\nthis regard bear in mind the well settled distinction which the\nlaw recognizes between the existence of power and the exercise\nthereof. <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 153C</a> enables and empowers the jurisdictional\nAO to assess or reassess the six AYs&#x27; or the &quot;relevant\nassessment year&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_134\">The Act</a> thus sanctions and confers an\nauthority upon the AO to exercise the power placed in its hands\nfor up to a maximum of ten AYs&#x27;. Despite the conferral of that\npower, the question which would remain is whether the facts\nand circumstances of a particular case warrant or justify the\ninvocation of that power. It is the aforesaid aspect which bids\nus to reiterate the distinction between the existence and exercise\nof power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">50. What we seek to emphasise is that merely because <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_135\">Section\n153C</a> confers jurisdiction upon the AO to commence an\nexercise of assessment or reassessment for the block of years\nwhich are mentioned in that provision, the same alone would\nnot be sufficient to justify steps in that direction being taken,\nunless the incriminating material so found is likely to have an\nimpact on the total income of a particular AY forming part of\nthe six AYs&#x27; immediately preceding the AY pertaining to the\nsearch year or for the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">51. Ultimately <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 153C</a> is concerned with books,\ndocuments or articles seized in the course of a search and which\nare found to have the potential to impact or have a bearing on\nan assessment which may be undergoing or which may have\nbeen completed. The words &quot;have a bearing on the\ndetermination of the total income of such other person&quot; as\nappearing in <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 153C</a> would necessarily have to be\nconferred pre-eminence. Therefore, and unless the AO is\nsatisfied that the material gathered could potentially impact the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                           22</span>\n                                      ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\ndetermination of total income, it would be unjustified in\nmechanically reopening or assessing all over again all the ten\nAYs&#x27; that could possibly form part of the block of ten years.\n....\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">G. CONCLUSIONS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">63. On an overall consideration of the structure of <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_138\">Sections\n153A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_139\">153C</a>, we thus find that a reopening or abatement\nwould be triggered only upon the discovery of material which is\nlikely to &quot;have a bearing on the determination of the total\nincome&quot; and would have to be examined bearing in mind the\nAYs&#x27; which are likely to be impacted. It would thus be incorrect\nto either interpret or construe <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 153C</a> as envisaging\nincriminating material pertaining to a particular AY having a\ncascading effect and which would warrant a mechanical and\ninevitable assessment or reassessment for the entire block of the\n&quot;relevant assessment year&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">64. In our considered view, abatement of the six AYs&#x27; or the\n&quot;relevant assessment year&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 153C</a> would follow\nthe formation of opinion and satisfaction being reached that the\nmaterial received is likely to impact the computation of income\nfor a particular AY or AYs&#x27; that may form part of the block of\nten AYs&#x27;. Abatement would be triggered by the formation of\nthat opinion rather than the other way around. This, in light of\nthe discernibly distinguishable statutory regime underlying\n<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_142\">Sections 153A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_143\">153C</a> as explained above. While in the case\nof the former, a notice would inevitably be issued the moment a\nsearch is undertaken or documents requisitioned, whereas in the\ncase of the latter, the proceedings would be liable to be\ncommenced only upon the AO having formed the opinion that\nthe material gathered is likely to inculpate the assessee. While\nin the case of a <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 153A</a> assessment, the issue of whether\nadditions are liable to be made based upon the material\nrecovered is an aspect which would merit consideration in the\ncourse of the assessment proceedings, under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 153C</a>, the\nAO would have to be prima facie satisfied that the documents,\ndata or asset recovered is likely to &quot;have a bearing on the\ndetermination of the total income&quot;. It is only once an opinion in\nthat regard is formed that the AO would be legally justified in\nissuing a notice under that provision and which in turn would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                            23</span>\n                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nculminate in the abatement of pending assessments or\nreassessments as the case may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">65. We would thus recognize the flow of events contemplated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 153C</a> being firstly the receipt of books, accounts,\ndocuments or assets by the jurisdictional AO, an evaluation and\nexamination of their contents and an assessment of the potential\nimpact that they may have on the total income for the six AYs&#x27;\nimmediately preceding the AY pertaining to the year of search\nand the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;. It is only once the AO of\nthe non-searched entity is satisfied that the material coming into\nits possession is likely to &quot;have a bearing on the determination\nof the total income&quot; that a notice under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 153C</a> would be\nissued. Abatement would thus be a necessary corollary of that\nnotice. However, both the issuance of notice as well as\nabatement would have to necessarily be preceded by the\nsatisfaction spoken of above being reached by the jurisdictional\nAO of the non-searched entity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">66. Therefore, and in our opinion, abatement of the six AYs&#x27; or\nthe &quot;relevant assessment year&quot; would follow the formation of\nthat opinion and satisfaction in that respect being reached.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">67. On an overall consideration of the aforesaid, we come to the\nfirm conclusion that the &quot;incriminating material&quot; which is\nspoken of would have to be identified with respect to the AY to\nwhich it relates or may be likely to impact before the initiation\nof proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 153C</a> of the Act. A material,\ndocument or asset recovered in the course of a search or on the\nbasis of a requisition made would justify abatement of only\nthose pending assessments or reopening of such concluded\nassessments to which alone it relates or is likely to have a\nbearing on the estimation of income. The mere existence of a\npower to assess or reassess the six AYs&#x27; immediately preceding\nthe AY corresponding to the year of search or the &quot;relevant\nassessment year&quot; would not justify a sweeping or indiscriminate\ninvocation of <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 153C</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">68. The jurisdictional AO would have to firstly be satisfied that\nthe material received is likely to have a bearing on or impact the\ntotal income of years or years which may form part of the block\nof six or ten AYs&#x27; and thereafter proceed to place the assessee\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                    24</span>\n                                               ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n       on notice under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 153C</a>. The power to undertake such an\n       assessment would stand confined to those years to which the\n       material may relate or is likely to influence. Absent any\n       material that may either cast a doubt on the estimation of total\n       income for a particular year or years, the AO would not be\n       justified in invoking its powers conferred by <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 153C</a>. It\n       would only be consequent to such satisfaction being reached\n       that a notice would be liable to be issued and thus resulting in\n       the abatement of pending proceedings and reopening of\n       concluded assessments.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27985438\" id=\"span_31\"><a href=\"/doc/27985438/\" id=\"a_152\">iii)   386 ITR 680 (Del) Pr.

It is apparent from the above that the first step for initiation\n       of proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 153C</a> of the Act is for the\n       assessing officer of the searched person to be satisfied that the\n       assets or documents seized do not belong to the searched person\n       but to the assessee sought to be assessed under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 153C</a> of\n       the Act. Once the assessing officer of the searched person is so\n       satisfied, he is required to transfer the assets or documents,\n       which he believes belongs to the assessee, to the assessing\n       officer having jurisdiction over that assessee. The assessing\n       officer of the assessee on receipt of such asset or document\n       seized would have jurisdiction to commence proceedings\n       under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 153C</a> of the Act. The assessing officer has,\n       thereafter, to apply his mind as to whether the assets and\n       documents received have a bearing on the determination of\n       the total income of the Assessee and if he is so satisfied that\n       the same have a bearing on the determination of the income\n       of the assessee, he has to issue notice and assess or reassess\n       the income of the assessee in accordance with the provisions\n       of <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 153A</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 153A</a> of the Act requires\n       that a notice be issued to the person sought to be assessed,\n       calling upon the said assessee to file his return of income in\n       respect of each year falling within the specified six AYs. It is\n       further specified that the provisions of the Act shall, so far as\n       may be, applied as if such returns were returns required to be\n       furnished under <a href=\"/doc/43144358/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 139</a> of the Act. Thus, the assessing\n       officer     has     to,    thereafter,    proceed       with      the\n       assessment/reassessment in accordance with the provisions of\n       the Act; that is, accept the return with or without such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                 25</span>\n                                           ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n      adjustments as permissible under <a href=\"/doc/184741818/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 143(1)</a> of the Act or if\n      the claims made by the assessee are considered as inadmissible\n      and/or it is considered necessary and expedient to subject the\n      returns to further scrutiny, issue the requisite notice under\n      <a href=\"/doc/95929751/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 143(2)</a> of the Act and frame the assessment in\n      accordance with the Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92407622\" id=\"span_33\"><a href=\"/doc/92407622/\" id=\"a_161\">iv) 380 ITR 612 (Del) CIT v.

The record slip belongs to the Assessee and, therefore,\n     the action of the AO of the searched persons recording that the\n     same belongs to the Assessee cannot be faulted. However, the\n     question then arises is whether the AO of the Assessee was\n     justified in taking further steps for reassessing the income\n     of the Assessee in respect of the assessment years for which\n     the assessments were concluded and in respect of which the\n     seized document had no bearing. In our view, the same\n     would be clearly impermissible as the seized material now\n     available with the AO, admittedly, had no nexus with those\n     assessments and was wholly irrelevant for the purpose of\n     assessing the income of the Assessee for the years in\n     question. Merely because a valuable article or document\n     belonging to an Assessee is seized from the possession of a\n     person searched under <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 132</a> of the Act, does not mean\n     that the concluded assessments of the Assessee are necessarily\n     to be re-opened under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 153C</a> of the Act. In our view,\n     the concluded assessments cannot be interfered with\n     mechanically and solely for the reason that a document\n     belonging to the Assessee, which has no bearing on the\n     assessments of the Assessee for the years preceding the\n     search, was seized from the possession of the searched\n     persons.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">      37.

The Tribunal also felt difficulty in gathering the\n       details of fixed deposits for Rs. 27,50,000/-from the seized paper;\n       there was no date or signature therein. On these facts the Tribunal\n       has drawn the conclusion that the addition is without any basis.

The Tribunal has properly taken note of the\n       evidence; it has not ignored any relevant piece of evidence. Its\n       conclusion cannot therefore be said to be perverse.

In setting aside the order of the trial court, the High Court\n            accepted the contention of the respondents that the documents were\n            not admissible in evidence under <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 34</a> with the following\n            words: &quot;An account presupposes the existence of two persons such\n            as a seller and a purchaser, creditor and debtor. Admittedly, the\n            alleged diaries in the present case are not records of the entries\n            arising out of a contract. They do not contain the debits and credits.\n            They can at the most be described as a memorandum kept by a\n            person for his own benefit which will enable him to look into the\n            same whenever the need arises to do so for his future purpose.\n            Admittedly the said diaries were not being maintained on day-to-\n            day basis in the course of business. There is no mention of the\n            dates on which the alleged payments were made. In fact the entries\n            there in are on monthly basis. Even the names of the persons whom\n            the alleged payments were made do not find a mention in full.\n            They have been shown in abbreviated form. Only certain &#x27;letters&#x27;\n            have been written against their names which are within the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                            33</span>\n                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nknowledge of only the scribe of the said diaries as to what they\nstand for and whom they refer to.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">x xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">17. From a plain reading of the Section it is manifest that to make\nan entry relevant thereunder it must be shown that it has been made\nin a book, that book is a book of account and that book of account\nhas been regularly kept in the course of business. From the above\nSection it is also manifest that even if the above requirements are\nfulfilled and the entry becomes admissible as relevant evidence,\nstill, the statement made therein shall not alone be sufficient\nevidence to charge any person with liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">It is thus seen that while the first part of the section speaks of the\nrelevancy of the entry as evidence, the second part speaks, in a\nnegative way, of its evidentiary value for charging a person with a\nliability. It will, therefore, be necessary for us to first ascertain\nwhether the entries in the documents, with which we are\nconcerned, fulfill the requirements of the above section so as to be\nadmissible in evidence and if this question is answered in the\naffirmative then only its probative value need be assessed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">18. &quot;Book&quot; ordinarily means a collection of sheets of paper or other\nmaterial, blank, written, or printed, fastened or bound together so\nas to form a material whole. Loose sheets or scraps of paper cannot\nbe termed as &quot;book&quot; for they can be easily detached and replaced.\nIn dealing with the word &quot;book&quot; appearing in <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 34</a> in\nMukundram v. Dayaram1 a decision on which both sides have\nplaced reliance, the Court observed:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">&quot;In its ordinary sense it signifies a collection of sheets of paper\nbound together in a manner which cannot be disturbed or altered\nexcept by tearing apart. The binding is of a kind which is not\nintended to the moveable in the sense of being undone and put\ntogether again. A collection of papers in a portfolio, or clip, or\nstrung together on a piece of twine which is intended to be untied\nat will, would not, in ordinary English, be called a book. ... I think\nthe term &#x27;book&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 34</a> aforesaid may properly be taken to\nsignify, ordinarily, a collection of sheets of paper bound together\nwith the intention that such binding shall be permanent and the\npapers used collectively in one volume. It is easier however to say\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                            34</span>\n                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nwhat is not a book for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 34</a>, and I have no\nhesitation in holding that unbound sheets of paper, in whatever\nquantity, though filled up with one continuous account, are not a\nbook of account within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 34</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">We must observe that the aforesaid approach is in accord with\ngood reasoning and we are in full agreement with it. Applying the\nabove tests it must be held that the two spiral note books (MR\n68/91 and MR 71/91) and the two spiral pads (MR 69/91 and MR\n70/91) are &quot;books&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 34</a>, but not the\nloose sheets of papers contained in the two files (MRs 72/91 and\n73/91).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">x xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">20. Mr. Sibal, the learned counsel for the Jains, did not dispute that\nthe spiral note books and the small pads are &quot;books&quot; within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 34</a>. He, however, strongly disputed the\nadmissibility of those books in evidence under the aforesaid section\non the ground that they were neither books of account nor they\nwere regularly kept in the course of business. he submitted that at\nbest it could be said that those books were memoranda kept by a\nperson for his own benefit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">According to Mr. Sibal, in business parlance &quot;account&quot; means a\nformal statement of money transactions between parties arising out\nof contractual or fiduciary relationship. Since the books in question\ndid not reflect any such relationship and, on the contrary, only\ncontained entries of monies received from one set of persons and\npayment thereof to another set of persons it could not be said, by\nany stretch of imagination that they were books of account, argued\nMr Sibal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">He next contended that even if it was assumed for argument&#x27;s sake\nthat the above books were books of account relating to a business\nstill they would not be admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 34</a> as they were\nnot regularly kept. It was urged by him that the words &quot;regularly\nkept&quot; mean that the entries in the books were contemporaneously\nmade at the time the transactions took place but a cursory glance of\nthe books would show that the entries were made therein long after\nthe purported transactions took place. In support of his contentions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                           35</span>\n                                      ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nhe also relied upon the dictionary meanings of the words &#x27;account&#x27;\nand &#x27;regularly kept&#x27;.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">(Emphasis added by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">19. With respect to evidentiary value of regular account book, this\nCourt has laid down in V.C. Shukla, thus;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">&quot;37. In Beni v. BisanDayal it was observed that entries in books of\naccount are not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with\nliability, the reason being that a man cannot be allowed to make\nevidence for himself by what he chooses to write in his own books\nbehind the back of the parties. There must be independent evidence\nof the transaction to which the entries relate and in absence of such\nevidence no relief can be given to the party who relies upon such\nentries to support his claim against another.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">In Hira Lal v. Ram Rakha the High Court, while negativing a\ncontention that it having been proved that the books of account\nwere regularly kept in the ordinary course of business and that,\ntherefore, all entries therein should be considered to be relevant\nand to have been proved, said that the rule as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_221\">Section\n34</a> of the Act that entries in the books of account regularly kept in\nthe course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter\nin which the Court has to enquire was subject to the salient proviso\nthat such entries shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge\nany person with liability.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">It is not, therefore, enough merely to prove that the books have\nbeen regularly kept in the course of business and the entries therein\nare correct. It is further incumbent upon the person relying upon\nthose entries to prove that they were in accordance with facts.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">20. It is apparent from the aforesaid discussion that loose sheets of\npapers are wholly irrelevant as evidence being not admissible\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1306401/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 34</a> so as to constitute evidence with respect to the\ntransactions mentioned therein being of no evidentiary value. The\nentire prosecution based upon such entries which led to the\ninvestigation was quashed by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">21. We are constrained to observe that the Court has to be on guard\nwhile ordering investigation against any important constitutional\nfunctionary, officers or any person in the absence of some cogent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                            36</span>\n                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nlegally cognizable material. When the material on the basis of\nwhich investigation is sought is itself irrelevant to constitute\nevidence and not admissible in evidence, we have apprehension\nwhether it would be safe to even initiate investigation. In case we\ndo so, the investigation can be ordered as against any person\nwhosoever high in integrity on the basis of irrelevant or\ninadmissible entry falsely made, by any unscrupulous person or\nbusiness house that too not kept in regular books of accounts but\non random papers at any given point of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">There has to be some relevant and admissible evidence and some\ncogent reason, which is prima facie reliable and that too, supported\nby some other circumstances pointing out that the particular third\nperson against whom the allegations have been levelled was in fact\ninvolved in the matter or he has done some act during that period,\nwhich may have co-relations with the random entries.\nIn case we do not insist for all these, the process of law can be\nabused against all and sundry very easily to achieve ulterior goals\nand then no democracy can survive in case investigations are\nlightly set in motion against important constitutional functionaries\non the basis of fictitious entries, in absence of cogent and\nadmissible material on record, lest liberty of an individual be\ncompromised unnecessarily. We find the materials which have\nbeen placed on record either in the case of Birla or in the case of\nSahara are not maintained in regular course of business and thus\nlack in required reliability to be made the foundation of a police\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">22. In case of Sahara, in addition we have the adjudication by the\nIncome Tax Settlement Commission. The order has been placed on\nrecord along with I.A.No.4. The Settlement Commission has\nobserved that the scrutiny of entries on loose papers, computer\nprints, hard disk, pen drives etc. have revealed that the transactions\nnoted on documents were not genuine and have no evidentiary\nvalue and that details in these loose papers, computer print outs,\nhard disk and pen drive etc. do not comply with the requirement of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_223\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and are not admissible evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">It further observed that the department has no evidence to prove\nthat entries in these loose papers and electronic data were kept\nregularly during the course of business of the concerned business\nhouse and the fact that these entries were fabricated, non-genuine\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                   37</span>\n                                              ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n       was proved. It held as well that the PCIT/DR have not been able to\n       show and substantiate the nature and source of receipts as well as\n       nature and reason of payments and have failed to prove evidentiary\n       value of loose papers and electronic documents within the legal\n       parameters. The Commission has also observed that Department\n       has not been able to make out a clear case of taxing such income in\n       the hands of the applicant firm on the basis of these documents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">       23. It is apparent that the Commission has recorded a finding that\n       transactions noted in the documents were not genuine and thus has\n       not attached any evidentiary value to the pen drive, hard disk,\n       computer loose papers, computer printouts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">       24. Since it is not disputed that for entries relied on in these loose\n       papers and electronic data were not regularly kept during course of\n       business, such entries were discussed in the order dated 11.11.2016\n       passed in Sahara&#x27;s case by the Settlement Commission and the\n       documents have not been relied upon by the Commission against\n       assessee, and thus such documents have no evidentiary value\n       against third parties. On the basis of the materials which have been\n       placed on record, we are of the considered opinion that no case is\n       made out to direct investigation against any of the persons named\n       in the Birla&#x27;s documents or in the documents A-8, A-9 and A- 10\n       etc. of Sahara.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1929968\" id=\"span_69\">ii)    39 STC 478.

We have given our careful thought to the submission of the\n       parties and perused the records. The facts are not in dispute. During\n       assessment proceedings the common plea of the assessee in both\n       the AY(s) was that merely entries found in the Hajir Johri ledger of\n       M/s. JBL supposedly in the name of M/s. S.K. Impex, the\n       proprietary concern of the assessee does not tantamount to actual\n       transactions having taken place in the absence of any corroborative\n       evidence such as bills, invoices, challans etc. There is no linking in\n       the order of the Ld.

No specific questions in this\n            regard were asked from her.

JBL, the Ld. CIT(A) was in a fix. So he confirmed the\n            impugned addition in AY 2016-17 under <a href=\"/doc/851964/\" id=\"a_236\">section 69C</a> as\n            unexplained expenditure and in AY 2017-18 under <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_237\">section 69A</a> as\n            unexplained money. In our view the impugned addition made by\n            the Ld. AO in both the AY(|s) is not sustainable because it is based\n            on mere suspicion, surmise and conjectures and not on legally\n            sound footing and the Ld.

According to us, not allowing the assessee to cross-examine the\n      witnesses by the Adjudicating Authority though the statements of\n      those witnesses were made the basis of the impugned order is a\n      serious flaw which makes the order nullity inasmuch as it\n      amounted to violation of principles of natural justice because of\n      which the assessee was adversely affected. It is to be borne in mind\n      that the order of the Commissioner was based upon the statements\n      given by the aforesaid two witnesses. Even when the assessee\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                  41</span>\n                                             ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n       disputed the correctness of the statements and wanted to cross-\n       examine, the Adjudicating Authority did not grant this opportunity\n       to the assessee. It would be pertinent to note that in the impugned\n       order passed by the Adjudicating Authority he has specifically\n       mentioned that such an opportunity was sought by the assessee.\n       However, no such opportunity was granted and the aforesaid plea\n       is not even dealt with by the Adjudicating Authority. As far as the\n       Tribunal is concerned, we find that rejection of this plea is totally\n       untenable. The Tribunal has simply stated that cross-examination\n       of the said dealers could not have brought out any material which\n       would not be in possession of the appellant themselves to explain\n       as to why their ex-factory prices remain static. It was not for the\n       Tribunal to have guesswork as to for what purposes the appellant\n       wanted to cross-examine those dealers and what extraction the\n       appellant wanted from them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">       7. As mentioned above, the appellant had contested the truthfulness\n       of the statements of these two witnesses and wanted to discredit\n       their testimony for which purpose it wanted to avail the\n       opportunity of cross-examination. That apart, the Adjudicating\n       Authority simply relied upon the price-list as maintained at the\n       depot to determine the price for the purpose of levy of excise duty.\n       Whether the goods were, in fact, sold to the said dealers/witnesses\n       at the price which is mentioned in the price-list itself could be the\n       subject matter of cross-examination. Therefore, it was not for the\n       Adjudicating Authority to presuppose as to what could be the\n       subject matter of the cross-examination and make the remarks as\n       mentioned above. We may also point out that on an earlier\n       occasion when the matter came before this Court in Civil Appeal\n       No. 2216 of 2000, order dated 17.03.2005 was passed remitting the\n       case back to the Tribunal with the directions to decide the appeal\n       on merits giving its reasons for accepting or rejecting the\n       submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">       8. In view the above, we are of the opinion that if the testimony of\n       these two witnesses is discredited, there was no material with the\n       Department on the basis of which it could justify its action, as the\n       statement of the aforesaid two witnesses was the only basis of\n       issuing the Show-Cause Notice.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1591175\" id=\"span_84\"><a href=\"/doc/1591175/\" id=\"a_240\">iii)   125 ITR 713 (SC) Kishnichand Chellaram vs. CIT</a></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"475863\" id=\"span_85\">iv)    288 ITR 345 (Del.) <a href=\"/doc/475863/\" id=\"a_241\">CIT vs. SMC Share Broker Limited\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                        42</span>\n                                                   ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023</a></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72774999\" id=\"span_87\"><a href=\"/doc/72774999/\" id=\"a_242\">v)     293 ITR 43 (Del) CIT vs. S.M.

However, if it is\n        retracted by the person from whom it was recorded, totally\n        different considerations altogether, ensue. The situation resembles\n        the one, which arises on retraction from the statement recorded\n        under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. The evidentiary value of a retracted\n        statement becomes diluted and it loses the strength, to stand on its\n        own.

The Assessing Officer made an effort to depict that the\n         withdrawal or retraction on the part of the appellants is not\n         genuine. We do not hesitate to observe that an Assessing Officer\n         does not have any power, right or jurisdiction to tell, much less to\n         decide, upon the nature of withdrawal or retraction. His duty\n         ends where the statement is recorded. If the statements are\n         retracted, the fate thereof must be decided by law meaning\n         thereby, a superior forum and not by the very authority, who is\n         alleged to have exerted force.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">         It is not as if the retraction from a statement by an assessee would put\n         an end to the procedure that ensued on account of survey or search.\n         The Assessing Officer can very well support his findings on the basis\n         of other material. If he did not have any other material, in a way, it\n         reflects upon the very perfunctory nature of the survey. We find that\n         the appellate authority and the Tribunal did not apply the correct\n         parameters, while adjudicating the appeals filed before them. On the\n         undisputed facts of the case, there was absolutely no basis for the\n         Assessing Officer to fasten the liability upon the appellants. Our\n         conclusion find support from the Circular dated 10.03.2003 issued by\n         the Central Board of Direct Taxes, which took exception to the\n         initiation of the proceedings on the basis of retracted statements.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"205478\" id=\"span_98\">14.2 The Hon&#x27;ble Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/205478/\" id=\"a_257\">CIT vs. Naresh\nKumar Aggarwal</a> reported in 369 ITR 171 has held that a statement is not a\nlimited licence to script the financial obituary of an assessee.

He is virtually put under pressure and is denied of access to\n         external advice or opportunity to think independently. A battalion of\n         officers, who hardly feel any limits on their power, pounce upon the\n         assessee, as though he is a hardcore criminal. The nature of steps,\n         taken during the course of search are sometimes frightening. Locks\n         are broken, seats of sofas are mercilessly cut and opened. Every\n         possible item is forcibly dissected.

The objective may be genuine, and the exercise may\nbe legal. However, the freedom of a citizen that transcends, even the\nConstitution cannot be treated as non- existent.\nAt the cost of repetition, we observe that if the statement made\nduring the course of search remains the same, it can constitute the\nbasis for proceeding further under the Act, even if there is no\nother material. If, on the other hand, the statement is retracted,\nthe Assessing Officer has to establish his own case. The statement\nthat too, which is retracted from the assessee, cannot constitute\nthe basis for an order under <a href=\"/doc/1418518/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 158BC</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">This, in turn, is referable to a time-tested right of an individual which\nis recognised under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_261\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India which\nmandates no person, accused of any offence, shall be compelled to be\na witness against himself.

Thus, the question of examining any person by the authorised\n     officer arises only when he found such person to be in possession of\n     any undisclosed money or books of account. But, in this case, it is\n     admitted by the Revenue that on the dates of search, the Department\n     was not able to find any unaccounted money, unaccounted bullion nor\n     any other valuable articles or things, nor any unaccounted documents\n     nor any other valuable articles or things, nor any unaccounted\n     documents nor any such incriminating material either from the\n     premises of the company or from the residential houses of the\n     managing director and other directors.

Commissioner of Income-Tax</a>), dealing with the\n      scope of <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_269\">Section 132(4A)</a>, the Supreme Court considered the\n      conclusive character of the statement made in a search\n      operation. The Apex Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_270\">Section 132</a> is a complete\n      code by itself. Under <a href=\"/doc/1006941/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 132(4)</a>, in the case of search, the\n      authorised officer can examine any person who is found to be in\n      possession or control of any books of accounts, documents,\n      money, jewellery or other valuable article and any statement\n      made by such person during the examination may thereafter be\n      used in evidence in any proceedings. Sub section (4A) enables\n      an Assessing Officer to raise a rebuttable presumption that such\n      books of accounts, money, jewellery, etc., belonged to such\n      person that the contents of books of accounts and the\n      documents are true and the signature found therein are in the\n      handwriting of the particular person. The Supreme Court held\n      that the presumption is rebuttable and is available only in\n      regard to the proceedings for search and seizure and for the\n      purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1498345/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 132(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1230088/\" id=\"a_273\">132B</a>. However, the presumption\n      under sub-section (4A) to <a href=\"/doc/1277726/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 132</a> of the Income Tax Act\n      would not be available for the purpose of framing a regular\n      assessment. However, retention of books etc., can be used as a\n      piece of evidence for the purposes of framing of the regular\n      assessment. Thus going by the above-said decision, while the\n      statement rendered at the time of search under <a href=\"/doc/1006941/\" id=\"a_275\">Section\n      132(4)</a> may be used in evidence in any proceeding, yet, that\n      by itself, does not become the sole material to rest the\n      assessment more so when the assessee seeks to withdraw the\n      same by producing material evidence in support of such\n      retraction.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1269026\" id=\"span_105\">13.

The assessee\n     appellant has not made any surrender, in respect of income\n     from job work and no document has been adduced by the\n     revenue, to support its finding that assessee has earned\n     income from job work, in the past asst. years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1422053\" id=\"span_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"987\" id=\"span_116\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"305298\" id=\"span_117\">9. It is categorically held by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in a\n     plethora of decisions, that it is a well settled principle of law\n     that revenue cannot decide, an issue, without proper facts and\n     law, supporting its decision. A decision based on mere\n     surmises, guess work or conjectures or irrelevant material and\n     evidence is liable to be quashed. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, in\n     plethora of decisions has often frowned upon the tendency of\n     Assessing Officers, to frame assessment orders or make\n     additions purely on surmises. In the present case, a bare perusal\n     of the finding of the AO and the CIT (Appeals), as reproduced\n     above, clearly reveals that no material has been brought on\n     record, to support the impugned additions. The AO as well as\n     CIT (Appeals), being quasi-judicial authority must not base\n     their findings, on no-material or no-evidence. This is a\n     fundamental rule of justice and established legal proposition\n     that there may be something more than bare suspicion, to\n     support the findings, in the assessment order, as held by the\n     Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/305298/\" id=\"a_291\">Dhirajlal\n     Girdharilal v.

Thus when the assessee had\n      explained his statement as not correct in the context of the\n      materials produced, as held by the Apex Court in the decision\n      in <a href=\"/doc/1269026/\" id=\"a_295\">Pullangode Rubber Produce Co.

Quite apart from that, the case of the assessee also\n      stands supported by the Circular dated 10-3-2003 of the Central\n      Board of Direct Taxes, which has given categorical directions\n      to the officers, who are entrusted with the job of assessment\n      that undue emphasis should not be placed on the statements\n      recorded. In fact, it had given a mandate not to obtain\n      confession as to the undisclosed income. Thus applying the\n      Circular dated 10-3-2003 to the facts of the case, which is\n      binding on the revenue, we have no hesitation in setting aside\n      the order of the Tribunal. As already pointed out that except for\n      the statements referred to by the Tribunal, it had not adverted its\n      attention to the materials produced by the assessee before the\n      Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) explaining the claim\n      that the said amount could not be included in the hands of the\n      assessee.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">vi)   148 taxman 35 (Ahd.)

The assessee\nhad retracted from the said disclosure which has not been\naccepted by the Department. It is true that simple denial\ncannot be considered as a denial in the eyes of law but at the\nsame time, it is also to be seen (that) the material and\nvaluable and other assets are found at the time of search.\nThe evidence ought to have been collected by the Revenue\nduring the search in support of the disclosure statement.\nThe decision cited by learned Departmental Representative is\ndistinguishable on facts. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1362493\" id=\"span_122\">In the said case, the disclosure was of\nRs. 7 lakhs which was supported by investment in house\nproperty, unaccounted cash, unaccounted investment in\nfurniture and unaccounted in gold ornaments, etc., whereas in\nthe case under consideration no such assets or valuables were\nsupported to the disclosure. It is settled position of the law\nthat authorities under the Act are under an obligation to act\nin accordance with law. Tax can be collected only as\nprovided under the Act.

There\n       is no evidence found and seized that assessee has carried out\n       speculation trading during the relevant period. No\n       document in this regard was seized from the premises of the\n       assessee. The documents seized from the residence of Shri\n       Prem Arora was related to the financial year 2003-04 and the\n       income earned in those transactions has been received by the\n       assessee through banking channels and not by cash and the\n       same has been duly accounted for. In such a situation, the\n       presumption that assessee might have carried out speculation\n       business during the year on the basis of such document seized is\n       completely untenable and unsustainable and additions based on\n       such presumption cannot be sustained. The inference that Shri\n       Prem Arora was in possession of the cash and being the close\n       person of the assessee, assessee might have been indulging in\n       the speculation business of the commodity trading is also\n       unsustainable presumption. No adverse inference can be drawn\n       about the assessee on such presumption. The Assessing\n       Officer&#x27;s reliance that assessee has also narrated about the\n       investment of the undisclosed speculative income in the\n       purchase of gold and jarau jewellery, investment in shares and\n       investment in vaida bazaar and advances given to the parties\n       trading in agricultural field is also not supported by any\n       document. Nothing has been found during the search and no\n       such assets had been recovered. Therefore, such additions made\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                      55</span>\n                                                 ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n           only on the basis of a statement which has been retracted\n           immediately thereafter are not sustainable. The pattern of the\n           questions put to the assessee during the search of the premises\n           shows that whatever recorded in these statements is not true.\n           Only on the basis of presumption that large scale construction\n           was going on at the school building of the trust and hospital of\n           the trust cannot be made a basis for addition. The Assessing\n           Officer should have ascertained the investment by way of\n           referring the case to the DVO if he has any doubt in this regard.\n           No evidence regarding any anonymous donation by the trust\n           was found and seized and nothing has been made out by the\n           Assessing Officer in the assessment.

Thus, in\n           our considered view, no incriminating evidence was found\n           against the assessee which could suggest or show that\n           unexplained investment has been made to the tune of Rs.15\n           crores and such income has been utilized or invested as stated\n           by the assessee in the retracted statement. Nothing of such sort\n           borne out of the facts. In our considered view, no addition\n           can be made merely on the basis of surrender without\n           existence of any corroborative evidence found against the\n           assessee\n\n15   THAT ADDITION MADE MECHANICALLY IN DISREGARD OF\n     THE MATERIAL ON RECORD BY FOLLOWING DIKTATS OF\n     INVESTIGATION REPORT IS OTHERWISE TOO UNTENABLE:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">     Reliance is placed on the following judicial pronouncements:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">     i)    178 ITD 823 (Delhi - Trib.)

On 15th\n             November, 1967, she had purchased 16 cents of land in\n             Ernakulam and the amount spent by her, inclusive of stamp and\n             registration charges, for this purchase of Rs. 34,628.

Considered the rival submissions and material placed on record.              We\nobserved from the record that the proceedings initiated in the case of the\nassessee on the basis of documents found during search in the case of PGPL\n(Annexure A), statement of Sh. Dinesh S Gupta and statement of Sh. Hari Om\nGoel (during Survey proceedings). By relying on the above statements, AO\nproceeded to make additions in the hands of the assessee. The Ld AR has\nsubmitted before us with regard to AY 2014-15 and 2015-16 that the assessment\norders passed by AO is beyond the period of 6 assessment years immediately\npreceding AY relevant to the previous year in which search is conducted in the\ncase of the assessee. After considering the submission of the rival parties, in\norder to initiate the proceedings<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_337\"> u/s 153C</a>, as per the provisions of the Act, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                         64</span>\n                                                    ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\npreceding assessment year for the other person in whose hand proceedings<a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_338\"> u/s\n153A</a> to be initiated depends upon the receipt of books of account or\ndocuments or the assets allegedly pertain to the other person by the AO of the\nother person. It is fact on record that the AO of the assessee received the seized\nmaterial only on 10.03.2021. Therefore, the relevant searched AY for the\nassessee is AY 2021-22. The six years prior to the AY 2021-22 starts from AY\n2015-16. Therefore, the relevant period for reassessment would be from AY\n2015-16 to AY 2020-21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92407622\" id=\"span_155\">Therefore, the AY outside the jurisdiction would be\nAY 2014-15. Hence, the assessment made for AY 2014-15 is outside the\njurisdiction . Accordingly, the grounds raised by the assessee in this regard is\npartly allowed and the AY 2015-16 is within the jurisdiction. The above\nfindings is determined based on the following ratio of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court\ndecision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/92407622/\" id=\"a_339\">RRJ Securities Ltd</a> (supra), for the sake of brevity, the\nratio of the decision is reproduced below:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">      &quot;24. As discussed hereinbefore, in terms of proviso to <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 153C</a>\n      of the Act, a reference to the date of the search under the second\n      proviso to <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 153A</a> of the Act has to be construed as the date of\n      handing over of assets/documents belonging to the Assessee (being\n      the person other than the one searched) to the AO having jurisdiction\n      to assess the said Assessee. Further proceedings, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/51644587/\" id=\"a_342\">Section\n      153C(1)</a> of the Act, would have to be in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_343\">Section\n      153A</a> of the Act and the reference to the date of search would have to\n      be construed as the reference to the date of recording of satisfaction. It\n      would follow that the six assessment years for which\n      assessments/reassessments could be made under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_344\">Section 153C</a> of the\n      Act would also have to be construed with reference to the date of\n      handing over of assets/documents to the AO of the Assessee. In this\n      case, it would be the date of the recording of satisfaction under\n      <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_345\">Section 153C</a> of the Act, i.e., 8th September, 2010. In this view, the\n      assessments made in respect of assessment year 2003-04 and 2004-05\n      would be beyond the period of six assessment years as reckoned with\n      reference to the date of recording of satisfaction by the AO of the\n      searched person. It is contended by the Revenue that the relevant six\n      assessment years would be the assessment years prior to the\n      assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the search was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                        65</span>\n                                                   ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n      conducted. If this interpretation as canvassed by the Revenue is\n      accepted, it would mean that whereas in case of a person searched,\n      assessments in relation to six previous years preceding the year in\n      which the search takes place can be reopened but in case of any other\n      person, who is not searched but his assets are seized from the searched\n      person, the period for which the assessments could be reopened would\n      be much beyond the period of six years. This is so because the date of\n      handing over of assets/documents of a person, other than the searched\n      person, to the AO would be subsequent to the date of the search. This,\n      in our view, would be contrary to the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/51644587/\" id=\"a_346\">Section 153C(1)</a> of\n      the Act, which construes the date of receipt of assets and documents\n      by the AO of the Assessee (other than one searched) as the date of the\n      search on the Assessee. The rationale appears to be that whereas in the\n      case of a searched person the AO of the searched person assumes\n      possession of seized assets/documents on search of the Assessee; the\n      seized assets/documents belonging to a person other than a searched\n      person come into possession of the AO of that person only after the\n      AO of the searched person is satisfied that the assets/documents do\n      not belong to the searched person. Thus, the date on which the AO of\n      the person other than the one searched assumes the possession of the\n      seized assets would be the relevant date for applying the provisions of\n      <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_347\">Section 153A</a> of the Act. We, therefore, accept the contention that in\n      any view of the matter, assessment for AY 2003-04 and AY 2004-05\n      were outside the scope of <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 153C</a> of the Act and the AO had no\n      jurisdiction to make an assessment of the Assessee&#x27;s income for that\n      year.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_193\">Respectfully, following the above decisions, we hold that the assessment\ncompleted<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_349\"> u/s 153C</a> in AY 2014-15 is beyond jurisdiction and accordingly, the\nground raised by the assessee is partly allowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_194\">22.

It clearly shows that the satisfaction\nnote recorded are not as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_355\">section 153C</a> of the Act. We\nobserve from the decision of <a href=\"/doc/5993898/\" id=\"a_356\">Saksham Commodities Ltd (Delhi</a>) (Supra), in\nwhich it is held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">      &quot;63. On an overall consideration of the structure of <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_357\">Sections 153A</a>\n      and <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_358\">153C</a>, we thus find that a reopening or abatement would be\n      triggered only upon the discovery of material which is likely to &quot;have\n      a bearing on the determination of the total income&quot; and would have to\n      be examined bearing in mind the AYs&#x27; which are likely to be\n      impacted. It would thus be incorrect to either interpret or construe\n      <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 153C</a> as envisaging incriminating material pertaining to a\n      particular AY having a cascading effect and which would warrant a\n      mechanical and inevitable assessment or reassessment for the entire\n      block of the &quot;relevant assessment year&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                   67</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_197\">                                              ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">64. In our considered view, abatement of the six AYs&#x27; or the\n&quot;relevant assessment year&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 153C</a> would follow the\nformation of opinion and satisfaction being reached that the material\nreceived is likely to impact the computation of income for a particular\nAY or AYs&#x27; that may form part of the block of ten AYs&#x27;. Abatement\nwould be triggered by the formation of that opinion rather than the\nother way around. This, in light of the discernibly distinguishable\nstatutory regime underlying <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_361\">Sections 153A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_362\">153C</a> as explained\nabove. While in the case of the former, a notice would inevitably be\nissued the moment a search is undertaken or documents requisitioned,\nwhereas in the case of the latter, the proceedings would be liable to be\ncommenced only upon the AO having formed the opinion that the\nmaterial gathered is likely to inculpate the assessee. While in the case\nof a <a href=\"/doc/196180631/\" id=\"a_363\">Section 153A</a> assessment, the issue of whether additions are\nliable to be made based upon the material recovered is an aspect\nwhich would merit consideration in the course of the assessment\nproceedings, under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_364\">Section 153C</a>, the AO would have to be prima\nfacie satisfied that the documents, data or asset recovered is likely to\n&quot;have a bearing on the determination of the total income&quot;. It is only\nonce an opinion in that regard is formed that the AO would be legally\njustified in issuing a notice under that provision and which in turn\nwould culminate in the abatement of pending assessments or\nreassessments as the case may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">65. We would thus recognize the flow of events contemplated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_365\">Section 153C</a> being firstly the receipt of books, accounts,\ndocuments or assets by the jurisdictional AO, an evaluation and\nexamination of their contents and an assessment of the potential\nimpact that they may have on the total income for the six AYs&#x27;\nimmediately preceding the AY pertaining to the year of search and the\n&quot;relevant assessment year&quot;. It is only once the AO of the non-searched\nentity is satisfied that the material coming into its possession is likely\nto &quot;have a bearing on the determination of the total income&quot; that a\nnotice under <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_366\">Section 153C</a> would be issued. Abatement would thus be\na necessary corollary of that notice. However, both the issuance of\nnotice as well as abatement would have to necessarily be preceded by\nthe satisfaction spoken of above being reached by the jurisdictional\nAO of the non-searched entity.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                         68</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_200\">                                                    ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_201\">      66. Therefore, and in our opinion, abatement of the six AYs&#x27; or the\n      &quot;relevant assessment year&quot; would follow the formation of that opinion\n      and satisfaction in that respect being reached.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">      67. On an overall consideration of the aforesaid, we come to the\n      firm conclusion that the &quot;incriminating material&quot; which is spoken of\n      would have to be identified with respect to the AY to which it relates\n      or may be likely to impact before the initiation of proceedings under\n      <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_367\">Section 153C</a> of the Act. A material, document or asset recovered in\n      the course of a search or on the basis of a requisition made would\n      justify abatement of only those pending assessments or reopening of\n      such concluded assessments to which alone it relates or is likely to\n      have a bearing on the estimation of income. The mere existence of a\n      power to assess or reassess the six AYs&#x27; immediately preceding the\n      AY corresponding to the year of search or the &quot;relevant assessment\n      year&quot; would not justify a sweeping or indiscriminate invocation of\n      <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_368\">Section 153C</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">      68. The jurisdictional AO would have to firstly be satisfied that the\n      material received is likely to have a bearing on or impact the total\n      income of years or years which may form part of the block of six or\n      ten AYs&#x27; and thereafter proceed to place the assessee on notice under\n      <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_369\">Section 153C</a>. The power to undertake such an assessment would\n      stand confined to those years to which the material may relate or is\n      likely to influence. Absent any material that may either cast a doubt\n      on the estimation of total income for a particular year or years, the AO\n      would not be justified in invoking its powers conferred by <a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_370\">Section\n      153C</a>. It would only be consequent to such satisfaction being reached\n      that a notice would be liable to be issued and thus resulting in the\n      abatement of pending proceedings and reopening of concluded\n      assessments.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_204\">24. Respectfully following <a href=\"/doc/5993898/\" id=\"a_371\">the above decision</a> and we observe from the\nsatisfaction recorded in this case, the AO failed to record the satisfaction as per\nthe provisions of the Act and failed to record the assessment of the potential\nimpact on the income not declared by the assessee earlier and the impact that\nmay have on the total income for the six AYs immediately preceding the AY, in\nthis case AY 2021-22. Therefore, non recording of proper satisfaction to initiate\nthe proceedings<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_372\"> u/s 153C</a> of the Act, the proceeding initiated in the present case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                            69</span>\n                                                       ITA Nos.2935 to 2940/DEL/2023\n\nis without proper jurisdiction. Accordingly, the ground raised by the assessee is\nallowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">25. We observe that the assessee also raised several issue relating the\njurisdictional issues on initiation of proceedings<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_373\"> u/s 153C</a> of the Act, since we\nalready decided the issue on non recording the satisfaction on the basis of\nbearing on or impact on the total income of years or block of years to initiate the\nproceedings<a href=\"/doc/159286607/\" id=\"a_374\"> u/s 153C</a> is bad in law. Hence other jurisdictional issues are not\nadjudicated and also the assessee has elaborately submitted the issues on merit,\nsince we already decided the issue on the improper recording of satisfaction, we\nhave not adjudicated the same on merits also. These issues are kept open at this\nstage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_206\">25.1 Accordingly, the grounds raised by the assessee are partly allowed and set\naside other assessment years viz, AY 2014-15 to 2019-20.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_207\">26.
