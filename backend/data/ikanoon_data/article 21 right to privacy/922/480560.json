He has further submitted that disputed place is not the\n\nbirth place of Lord Ram and under false notion recently people have\n\nstarted   considering it as a    sacred place and and there is no\n\nevidence worth the name that the property in suit was used by\n\nHindus as a place of worship immediately prior to the construction\n\nof the building in question. Sri Z. Jillani, Advocate has further\n\nsubmitted that assertion of the defendant no. 13 is incorrect that\n\nthe deities continued to exist on the property in suit even after\n\nconstruction of the building. Thus, the question of vesting of\n\nproperty in deities does not arise and there is no material worth the\n\nname before this Court to presume that Babri mosque was\n\nconstructed at the site of the Janm Bhumi of Ram Chandra Ji.\n\nAccordingly the claim as set up by the Hindus is not correct.\n\nPlaintiffs submitted that idols and object of worship were placed\n\ninside the building in the intervening night of 22/23 December,\n\n1949, as alleged in para 11 of the plaint. Prior to it the place was\n\nused as a mosque and Muslims used to offer prayer inside the\n\ndisputed structure. The Hindus have no right to retain the property\n\nand the assertion of the defendant no.3 that the deity continued to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                  3</span>\n\nexist   is incorrect. No body was allowed to worship inside the\n\nmosque. Hence question of vesting of property in deities does\n\nnot arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">        Sri P.N. Mishra Advocate        on behalf of    Hindus has\n\nsubmitted that the disputed structure right from the birth of Lord\n\nRam was being considered as a sacred place of pilgrims and people\n\nwere offering prayer and worshipping there. He has also submitted\n\nthat the property in suit is the site of Janam Bhumi of Lord Ram.\n\nHe has further contended that Hindus in general and defendants in\n\nparticular had right to worship Charan Paduka and Sita Rasoi and\n\nother idols. Even after the construction of the building in suit\n\nHindus used to offer prayer and there was          no mosque like\n\nstructure. It always remained a structure under the control of\n\nHindus and place of worship of Hindus. As regards identity of\n\nland, it has been submitted that historian suggests that the place of\n\nbirth of Lord Ram is the place where the disputed structure existed.\n\nHe has further submitted that on the basis of scriptures         like\n\nValmiki Ramayan, Srimad Bhagwat and other religious books, it\n\nis absolutely clear that the property in suit is site of Ram Janam\n\nBhumi. He has further referred religious books to establish his\n\nversion. On the assertion of Muslims, Sri P.N.Mishra has further\n\nsubmitted that Ayodhya is the holy place where Lord Ram took\n\nbirth, Who is incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The archeological\n\nevidence completely supports         the claim of Hindus that Ram\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  4</span>\n\nJanamsthan is the place where previously a temple used to exist\n\nand this place is being worshipped from time immemorial .\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">      Sri P.N.Mishra submits that existence of Sri Ram Janam\n\nBhumi is evident from holy scriptures .

It testifies that only by seeing\n\n  the place of birth one attains the merit of performing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                               9</span>\n\n   penance, of thousands of Rajasuya sacrifices and Agnihotra\n\n   sacrifices.

Relevant extracts containing\n\n  translation of Tieffenthaler&#x27;s account from pages 312, 313,\n\n  314, 316 and 317 read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">              &quot;Its appearance, in 1770, is thus described by Tieffen\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                   21</span>\n\ntheler: &quot;Avad, called Adjudea by the Learned\nHindoos is a city of the highest antiquity. Its houses\nare, for the most part, only on mud, covered with\nstraw or with tiles; many, however, are of brick. The\nprincipal street, running from S. to N., is about a\nleague (mille) in length; and the breadth of the city is\nsomewhat less. Its western part, as well as the\nnorthern, is situated on a hill; the north-eastern\nquarter rests upon eminences; but towards Bangla, it\nis level. This town has now but a scanty population,\nsince the foundation of Bangla or Fesabad; a new\ntown where the Governor has established his\nresidence, and to which a great number of\ninhabitants of Oude have removed. On the southern\nbank of Deva (or Goggrah), are found various\nbuildings erected by the Gentoos in memory of Ram,\nextending from east to west. The more remarkable\nplace is that which is called Sorgodoari, that is to\nsay, the heavenly temple; because they say, that Ram\ncarried away from thence to heaven all the\ninhabitants of the city. The deserted town was\nrepeopled and restored to its former condition by\nBikaramajit, the famous King of Oojain. There was\na temple here on the high bank of the river; but\nAurangzebe, ever attentive to the propagation of the\nfaith of Mohammed, and holding the heathen in\nabhorrence, caused it to be demolished, and replaced\nit with a mosque with minarets, in order to abolish\nthe very memory of the Hindoo superstition.\nAnother mosque has been built by the Moors, to the\neast of this. Near the Sargodoari in an edifice erected\nby Nabalroy a former Hindoo governor. But a place\nmore particularly famous is that which is called\nSitha Rassoee, the table of Sitha (Seeta), wife of\nRam; situated on an eminence to the south of the\ncity. The emperor Aurangzebe demolished the\nfortress called Ramcote, and erected on the site, a\nMohammedan temple with a triple dome. According\nto others, it was erected by Baber. There are to be\nseen fourteen columns of black stone, five spans in\nheight, which occupied the site of the fortress.\nTwelve of these columns now support the interior\narcades of the mosque: the two other form part of the\ntomb of a certain Moor. They tell us, that these\ncolumns, or rather these remains of skilfully wrought\ncolumns, were brought from Isle of Lanca or\nSelendip (Ceylon) by Hanuman, king the of\nmonkeys. On the left is seen a square chest, raised,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                22</span>\n\n            five inches from the ground covered with lime,\n            about 5 ells in length by not more than four in\n            breadth. The Hindoos call it Bedi, the cradle; and\n            the reason is, that there formerly stood here the\n            house in which Beshan (Vishnoo) was born in the\n            form of Ram and were also, they say, his three\n            brothers were born. Afterwards, Aurangzebe, or,\n            according to others, Baber, caused the place to be\n            destroyed, in order to deprive the heathen of the\n            opportunity of practicing there their superstitions.\n            Nevertheless, they still pay a superstitious reverence\n            to both these places; namely, to that on which the\n            natal dwelling of Ram stood, by going three times\n            round it, prostrate on the earth. The two places are\n            surrounded with a low wall adorned with\n            battlements.

Jain is that place of birth of\n\nLord Ram was previously Janamsthan temple              which was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                 23</span>\n\ndemolished and Babri mosque was constructed at the site which is\n\nalso reflected from the gazetteers,prepared by P. Carnegi, Millet,\n\nFuhror, Newill and E.B.Joshi. They are Exts. O.O.S. -57, Ext. 7,\n\nExt.8, Ext.9, Ext.10, Ext. 11, Ext. 12 and Ext. 13 in O.O.<a href=\"/doc/1363154/\" id=\"a_10\">S. 5-7</a>. He\n\nhas further submitted that Encyclopedia of India and Eastern and\n\nSouthern India by Surgeon General Edward Balfour referred\n\nJanmsthan which shows that      Muslims destroyed Hindu temple\n\nand converted into a mosque. He has further urged that according\n\nto Tiffen Thaler at the site of Ram Janam       Bhumi, mosque was\n\nconstructed after demolishing Hindu temple. He has also referred\n\nAyodhya by Hans Bakker which reveals that place of birth of Lord\n\nRam is identifiable and was used to be a place of worship and old\n\ntemple was renovated which was demolished at the command of\n\nBabur in the year 1528 by Mir Baki at the behest of Muslim Saint\n\nKwaja Fazal Abbas. Mr Jain has further submitted that Tiffen\n\nThaler had not given reference of Babur but of Aurangzeb. He has\n\nalso pointed out that in O.S.No. 280 of 1885 Mahant Raghubar\n\nDas Vs. Secretary of State the place was identified as birth spot of\n\nLord Ram and in view of historical background it is crystal clear\n\nRam Janam bhumi temple was demolished by Muslims. There is\n\nclinching evidence that Ram Janam Bhumi is the place where the\n\ntemple was built by King Govind Chandra but the same was\n\ndemolished at the command of         Babur by    Mir Baki. 12 line\n\ninscription in dev nagri script written in 11th and 12th century was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                 24</span>\n\nalso recovered. This is fully established by Paleography (Science\n\nof of old writing). He has further submitted that besides the above\n\ninscription even from the ruins of the disputed structure certain\n\narchaeological remains of pre Babri Hindu temple were recovered\n\nand they establish that there was a Janamstan temple prior to\n\nconstruction of Babri mosque and 14 black stone pillars were\n\nrecovered   in the construction      of the mosque and they are\n\nembellished with different Hindu Iconography,repeatedly found in\n\nall Hindu temples. He has further argued that different objects of\n\narcheological importance were recovered from the debris of the\n\ndemolished disputed structure. Sri Jain has further stressed that\n\nHindu temple of 12th century constructed during the reign of\n\nGovind Chand was destroyed at the command of Babur and\n\nmosque was erected on it , which was site of Ram Janam Bhumi.\n\nParts of the temple were re-used in the construction of Babri\n\nmosque. Accordingly at the time of demolition of disputed\n\nstructure 260 artifacts were recovered. They denote Aamlak, part\n\nof Hindu temple, lotus, part of Shikhar, dorgem etc. Further Shvi\n\nParti images were also found. Inscription of Hindu Vishnu temple\n\nestablishes that disputed place is Ram Janam bhumi and there\n\nused to be temple. Thus, on the basis of descriptions gazetteers\n\nand other historical accounts, it is established that the mosque was\n\nconstructed at the site of Ram Janambhumi. It was considered as\n\nsacred place of Hindus and it was worshipped like a deity and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                 25</span>\n\nincarnation of birth place of Lord Ram Chandra . Thus, this pious\n\nplace was all the time worshipped and kept in high esteem by\n\nHindus even after the construction of the disputed structure. Thus,\n\nHindus have always attached sacred character of birth spot of Lord\n\nRam. The defendants have proved the existence of Ram\n\nJanambhumi temple at the place of birth of Lord Ram .\n\nAccordingly they have discharged their duties and this fact should\n\nbe admitted in evidence and now burden lies on the plaintiffs to\n\nshow otherwise that it was not a Hindu temple. He has heavily\n\nrelied over the conclusion of archeological team consisting of 14\n\nmembers which transparently worked under the control of this\n\nCourt as two Judicial Officers were the observers and team was\n\ncomposed of officers of both communities . The scientific report\n\nof experts which is data base fully establishes the existence of\n\nRam    Janambhumi      and   accordingly   the   defendants   have\n\nsuccessfully established the prior construction of temple which\n\nwas demolished for the construction of the mosque by Muslim\n\nunder the command of Babur which was prevalent practice among\n\nMuslims to destroy Hindu temples and       the numerous instances\n\nfor the destruction of the Hindu temples which was the order of the\n\nday during those days are established from historical records.\n\nThus, looking to the    place from any angle even prior to the\n\nconstruction of Babri mosque it transpires from archeological\n\nevidence that there was a Ram Janambhumi temple .\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                    26</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"37494799\" id=\"span_30\">Sri Jain has relied upon para 78 of <a href=\"/doc/37494799/\" id=\"a_11\">Dr. M.

It is expedient to say that prior to 12th century there is\n\nevidence that earlier temples were also constructed at the site .Thus,\n\naccording to Sri H.S.Jain, Advocate there is overwhelming evidence\n\nto establish the site of Ram Janambhumi and the Court has to\n\nrecognize the same.

Mukherji- a very renowned and\n\noutstanding jurist of the country who is an authority on the subject\n\nand is widely quoted. It may be relevant to refer to few pages of the\n\nsaid book, fifth edition, by A.C. Sen, a former judge of Calcutta\n\nHigh Court. The first edition which in fact was a compendium of\n\nTagore Law Lectures series was published in the year 1952 and at\n\nPage 75 of the book there is a very significant paragraph which\n\nthrows light on the interpretation of issues in the present suit:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">      &quot;2.27. These observations, if I may say so, apply with full\n\nforce to trusts created by Hindus for religious purposes.\n\nUndoubtedly the court and not the donor is the judge, of whether\n\nan object is charitable or not, but the court cannot enter into the\n\nmerits of particular religious doctrine, and therefore must remain\n\nneutral. The divine service of a particular religion is defined by the\n\ndoctrines of the religion itself and no court can appreciate their\n\nspiritual efficacy, unless it knows there doctrines and hypothetically\n\nadmits them to be true. In controversial matters the court cannot\n\npossibly decide whether the doctrines are beneficial to the\n\ncommunity or not. It has got to act upon the belief of the\n\nmembers of the community concerned, and unless these beliefs\n\nare per se immoral or opposed to public policy, it cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                   30</span>\n\nexclude those who profess any lawful creed from the benefit of\n\ncharitable gifts...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">THE CONCEPT OF DEITY IN HINDU FAITH\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">1.    As the Hindus have since times immemorial and for many\n\ngenerations consistently held in great esteem and reverence the\n\nRama Janmasthan in Ayodhya where they believe Sri Ram was\n\nborn, this at once requires an understanding and recognition of the\n\nHindu concept of deity as recognized by law and whether the Rama\n\nJanmasthan where Ram Lala is Virajman is in accordance with the\n\nsaid concept of deity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">2.    The concept of deity which is a very distinguishing feature of\n\nthe Hindu faith is one that is eternal, permanent and omnipresent\n\nwherein the deity is the image of the Supreme Being. The temple is\n\nthe home of the deity and to constitute a temple it is enough if the\n\npeople believe in its religious efficacy, i.e., there is some supreme\n\nsuper human power existing there whom they need to worship and\n\ninvoke its blessings. As a result, the existence of an idol, though\n\ndesirable, is not a legal precondition.     The worship of such a\n\ndivinity can also be formless or without any image, the only criteria\n\nbeing that people must believe in its divinity and seek its blessings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">3.    There are many examples of this concept, Hindu worships\n\nAgni, Vayu and many sacred rivers like Ganga which do not\n\nresemble the traditional image of a deity yet the Hindus believe in\n\ntheir power of divinity. If such experience and the invocation of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                    31</span>\n\nblessings are possible even in the case of a log of wood or a simple\n\nstone, it acquirees the sacred character of divinity. The Sangam\n\n(confluence) at Prayag is another example which is supposed to be a\n\nholy place where three rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati (which\n\nis invisible) meet and for the last thousands of years its sacred\n\ncharacter remains intact where millions of people believe that by\n\ntaking a bath there they wash off their sins. The recent Kumbha\n\nMela    in Haridwar where nearly 8 crore people visited further\n\nreinforces the divine character of the river Ganga at Haridwar\n\nwhich is highly sacred and its blessing is sought. The famous\n\nVishnupad Mandir in Gaya again has no image at all except a small\n\nimage of two &#x27;Charan&quot; only which is being worshipped for the last\n\nhundreds of years as Vishnupad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">4.     The traditional and classical legal literature relating to Hindus\n\nhas also duly sanctified     such belief and faith which has been\n\nexalted to a juristic status requiring legal recognition. In this\n\nconnection, &quot;the Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trusts&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">by B.K. Mukherjea lays down some of the relevant concepts\n\nrelating to deity and the temple along with concerned page number\n\nwhich are consistently being recognized as judicial authorities, not\n\nonly in India but also abroad. The concept mentioned therein along\n\nwith concerned page numbers are being quoted below:\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Page 26-27 - Para &quot;1.33: Idols representing same divinity - One\n\nthing you should bear in mind in connection with image worship\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    32</span>\n\nviz. That the different images do not represent separate divinities;\n\nthey are really symbols of the one Supreme Being, and in\n\nwhichever name and form the deity might be invoked, he is to the\n\ndevotee the Supreme God to whom all the functions of creation,\n\npreservation and destruction are attributed. In worshipping        the\n\nimage therefore the Hindu purports to worship the Supreme Deity\n\nand none else. The rationale of image worship is thus given in a\n\nverse which is quoted by Raghunandan:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">         &quot;Chinmayasyaadwitiiyasya Naskalashariirina\n\n         Saadhakaanaam Hinaathayi Brahmanii Roopakalpanaa.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">         &quot;It is for the benefit of the worshippers that there is\n\nconception of images of Supreme Being which is bodiless, has no\n\nattribute, which consists of pure spirit and has got no second.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">         Temples and mutts are the two principal religious institutions\n\nof the Hindus. There are numerous texts extolling the merits of\n\nfounding such institutions. In Sri Hari Bhaktibilash a passage is\n\nquoted from Narsingha Purana which says that &quot;whoever conceives\n\nthe idea of erecting a divine temple, that very day his carnal sins are\n\nannihilated; what then shall be said of finishing the structure\n\naccording to rule ............ He who dies after making the first brick\n\nobtains the religious merits of a competed Jagna.&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">&quot;1.34.         Other     kinds    of    religious    and    charitable\n\nbenefactions.- &quot;A person consecrating a temple&quot;, says Agastya,\n\n&quot;also one establishing an asylum for ascetics also, one consecrating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                    33</span>\n\nan alms house for distributing food at all times ascend to the highest\n\nheaven.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">      Besides temples and mutts the other forms of religious and\n\ncharitable endowments which are popular among the Hindus are\n\nexcavation and consecration of tanks, wells and other reservoirs of\n\nwater, planting of shady trees for the benefit of travellers,\n\nestablishment of Choultries, satras or alms houses and Dharamsala\n\nfor the neefit     of mendicants and wayfarers, Arogyasalas or\n\nhospitals, and the last though not the least, Pathshalas or schools for\n\ngiving free education. Excavation of tanks and planting of trees are\n\nPurtta works well known from the earliest times. I have already\n\nmentioned that there is a mention of rest houses for travellers even\n\nin the hymns of the Rigveda. The Propatha of the Vedas is the same\n\nthing as Choultrie or sarai and the name given to it by subsequent\n\nwriters is Pratishraygrih. They were very popular during the\n\nBuddhist tie. In Dana Kamalakara, a passage is quoted from\n\nMarkandeya Puran which says that one should make a house of\n\nshelter for the benefit of travellers; and inexhaustible is his religious\n\nmerit which secures for him heaven and liberation. There are more\n\npassages than one in the Puranas recommending the establishment\n\nof hospitals. &quot;One must establish a hospital furnished with valuable\n\nmedicines and necessary utensils placed under an experienced\n\nphysician and having servants and rooms for the shelter of patients.\n\nThis text says further that a man, by the gift of the means of freeing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                   34</span>\n\nothers from disease, becomes the giver of everything. The founding\n\nof educational institutions has been praised in the highest language\n\nby Hindu writers. Hemadri in his Dankhanda has quoted a passage\n\nfrom Upanishad according to which gifts of cows, land and learning\n\nare said to constitute Atihaan or gifts of surpassing merit. In\n\nanother text cited by the same author, it is said that those excluded\n\nfrom education do not know the lawful and the unlawful; therefore\n\nno effort should be spared to cause dissemination of education by\n\ngift of property to meet its expenses&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">      Page 38-Para &quot;1.50. The idol as a symbol and\n\nembodiment of the spiritual purpose is the juristic person in\n\nwhom the dedicated property vests:- As you shall see later on the\n\ndecision of the Courts of India as well as of the Privy Council have\n\nheld uniformly that the Hindu idol is a juristic person in whom the\n\ndedicated property vests. &quot;A Hindu idol&quot;, the Judicial Committee\n\nobserved in one of its recent pronouncements, &quot;is according to long\n\nestablished authority founded upon the religious customs of the\n\nHindus and the recognition thereof by Courts of Law, a juristic\n\nentity. It has a juridical status with the power of suing and being\n\nsued.&quot; You should remember, however, that the juridical person in\n\nthe idol is not the material image, and it is an exploded theory that\n\nthe image itself develops into a legal person as soon as it is\n\nconsecrated by the Pran Pratistha ceremony. It is not also correct\n\nthat the Supreme Being of which the idol is a symbol or image is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                  35</span>\n\nthe recipient and owner of the dedicated property.

Deity owner in a secondary sense.-\n\nThe discussions of several Hindu sages and commentators point to\n\nthe conclusion that in case of dedicated property the deity is to be\n\nregarded as owner not in the primary but in the secondary sense. All\n\nthe relevant texts on this point have been referred to by Sir Asutosh\n\nMookerjee in his judgment in Bhupati v Ramlal and I will\n\nreproduce such portions of them as are necessary for my present\n\npurpose.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      Sulapani, a reputed Brahminical Jurist, in his discourse on\n\nSraddha thus expresses his views regarding the proper significance\n\nof gift to God:- &quot;in &#x27;Donation&#x27; having for its dative case, the Gods\n\nlike the Sun, etc., the term &#x27;donation&#x27; has a secondary sense. The\n\nobject of this figurative use being extension to it of the inseparable\n\naccompaniment of that (gift in its primary sense), viz., the offer of\n\nthe sacrifical fee etc. it has already beeb remarked in the chapter on\n\nthe Bratis that such usage as Devagram, Hastigram, etc., are\n\nsecondary&quot;. Sree Krishna in commenting on this passage thus\n\nexplains the meaning of the expression Devgram: &quot;Moreover, the\n\nexpression cannot be used here in its primary sense. The relation of\n\none&#x27;s ownership being excluded, the possessive case affix (in Devas\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                   36</span>\n\nin the term Devagram) figuratively means abandonment for them\n\n(the Gods)&quot;. Therefore, the expression is used in the sense of &quot;a\n\nvillage which is the object of abandonment intended for the Gods&quot;.\n\nThis is the purport. According to Savar Swami, the well-known\n\ncommentator on Purba Mimansa, Devagram and Devakhetra are\n\nfigurative expressions. What one is able to employ according to\n\none&#x27;s desire is one&#x27;s property. The Gods however do not employ a\n\nvillage or land according to their use.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">      Page 39-Para &quot;1.52. These discussions are not free from\n\nobscurity but the following conclusions I think can be safely drawn\n\nfrom them:-(1) According to these sages the deity or idol is the\n\nowner of the dedicated property but in a secondary sense. The\n\nownership in its primary sense connotes the capacity to enjoy and\n\ndeal with the property at one&#x27;s pleasure. A deity cannot hold or\n\nenjoy property like a man, hence the deity is not the owner in its\n\nprimary sense. (2) Ownership is however attributed to the deity in a\n\nsecondary or ideal sense. This is a fiction (Upchaar) but not a mere\n\nfigure of speech, it is a legal fact; otherwise the deity could not be\n\ndescribed as owner even in the secondary sense. (3) The fictitious\n\nownership which is imputed to the deity is determined by the\n\nexpressed intentions of the founder; the debutter property cannot be\n\napplied or used for any purpose other than that indicated by the\n\nfounder. The deity as owner therefore represents nothing else but\n\nthe intentions of the founder. Although the discussions of the Hindu\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                   37</span>\n\nJurists are somewhat cryptic in their nature, it is clear that they did\n\nappreciate the distinction between the spiritual and legal aspects of\n\nan idol. From the spiritual standpoint the idol might be to the\n\ndevotee the very embodiment of Supreme God but that is a matter\n\nbeyond the reach of law altogether.          Neither God nor any\n\nsupernatural being could be a person in law. So far as the deity\n\nstands as the representative and symbol of the particular purpose\n\nwhich is indicated by the donor, it can figure as a legal person and\n\nthe correct view is that in the capacity alone the dedicated property\n\nvests in it.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">       Page 152-153-Para &quot;4.3B. Sources of Puranas.- It is said\n\nsometimes that the Vedic mythology was merely elaborated in the\n\nPuranas. This is not wholly or even substantially true. The sources\n\nof some of the legendary stories occurring in the Puranas can, no\n\ndoubt, be traced in the Vedas but it would not be correct to say that\n\nthe Pouranic gods were mere reproductions of the Vedic gods.\n\nThere is nothing in the Vedas corresponding to the Pouranic Trinity\n\nof Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. Brahma in the Vedic text signified the\n\nSun, or was a synonym of prayer. Vishnu in the Rigveda occupied a\n\nrather subordinate position. He was also identified with the Sun,\n\nand his three strides encompassing the three spheres of existence, as\n\nsuggestive of all pervasiveness constituted the foundation of the\n\nPouranic legend of the three steps of Vishnu in his incarnation of\n\nthe &quot;Dwarf.&quot; Siva hardly appears as the name of any deity in Vedic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                  38</span>\n\ntime. The expression &quot;Siva&quot; means propitious or benignant. Rudra,\n\none of the Vedic deities, was in all probability, another name of\n\nAgni or fire, and the Puranas identified Siva with Rudra. We hear\n\nvery little of Ganpati or Kartikeya in the Vedas. Kali, who is\n\ndescribed in the Puranas as a consort of Siva, was spoken of in\n\nMandukopanishad as one of the seven tongues of fire, while the\n\nname of &quot;Uma occurs in the Kenopanishad, where she is described\n\nas a resplendent lady who gave lessons in divine knowledge to the\n\ngods. Sri Krishna, who looms so large in the Pouranic literature, is\n\nmentioned only as a scholar and not as a deity in the Vedas, though\n\nmany of the legendary stories attributed to him in the Puranas are\n\ntraceable to similar legends associated with Indra in the Vedic\n\nliterature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">       It is not necessary for our present purpose to pursue these\n\ndiscussions any further. Though the Puranas are by no means\n\nuniform, the legends associated with the various gods are fairly well\n\nknown and have been the basis of a considerable mass of poetic\n\nliterature in later times. One cardinal principle underlying idol\n\nworship you would always bear in mind - and this has some\n\nbearing on the law relating to gift of property to idols - that\n\nwhichever god the devotee might chose for purposes of worship\n\nand whatever image he might est up and consecrate with that\n\nobject, the image represents the Supreme God and none else.\n\nThere is no superiority or inferiority amongst the different\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   39</span>\n\ngods. Siva, Vishnu, Ganapati or Surya is extolled each in its\n\nturn as the creator, preserver and supreme lord of the universe.\n\nThe image simply gives a name and form to the formless God\n\nand the orthodox Hindu idea is that conception of form is only\n\nfor the benefit of the worshipper and nothing else.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">      Page 153-Para &quot;4.4. Building and consecration of\n\ntemples.-Along with the establishment of idol worship, in Hindu\n\nreligion, elaborate rites and ceremonies, it seems, were introduced\n\nby Brahminical writers in regard to building of temples and\n\nconsecration and purification of idols. I will touch these matters\n\nvery briefly. A temple is the house of the deity and many of the\n\nrules of construction of a temple are practically the same as are\n\nprescribed for construction of a dwelling house, the additional rules\n\nbeing laid down to ensure greater sanctity of the structure that is\n\nmeant for the abode of a deity. One who wants to build a temple has\n\ngot to select the proper time for building with reference to\n\nastrological calculations. There are detailed rules relating to\n\nselection of the site which include examination of the nature and\n\ncolour of the soil, its odour, taste, solidity, etc. after the site is\n\nselected, it is ploughed up and seeds are sown in it. As soon as the\n\nseeds germinate, the crop is allowed to be grazed over by cows. The\n\ncardinal points are then to be ascertained for giving this structure an\n\nauspicious aspect and there are rules to be observed regarding the\n\nmaterial to be used and the location of doors, windows, etc. the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                  40</span>\n\nimportant religious ceremony is the Vastu Jaga in honour of Vastu\n\nPurusha or Vastu Debta who presides over dwelling house, with\n\noblations of milk, rice and sugar. This Vastu Gaja is a very ancient\n\nceremony which dates from the Grihya Sutras of Aswalayan and\n\nGoville. The Puranas, however, contain a mythological legend\n\nregarding the Vastu Purusha and the modern form of the sacrifice\n\nin honour of this deity is described among others in Matsya Purana,\n\nBrihat Samhita and Devi Purana. All these ceremonies in\n\nconnection with the building of a temple have been described with\n\nelaborate by Pandit Prana Nath Saraswati in his Tagore Lectures on\n\nthe Hindu Law of Endowment. They are of little importance to a\n\nlawyer, as no question of law could possibly turn upon the manner\n\nin which a temple has been consecrated. Even if the rules prescribed\n\nby the Smriti writers are not obeyed, the founder of the temple may\n\nincur sin but the legal rights over or in respect of the temple cannot\n\nin any way be affected by thee omissions.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">      Page 154-Para &quot;4.5. Images - their description.- Image,\n\naccording to Hindu authorities, are of two kinds: the first is known\n\nas Swayambhu or self-existent or self-revealed, while the other is\n\nPratisthita or established. The Padma Puran says: &quot;The image of\n\nHari (God) prepared of stone, earth, wood, metal or the like and\n\nestablished according to the rites laid down in the Vedas,\n\nSmritis and Tantras is called the established; ......... where the\n\nself possessed Vishnu has placed himself on earth in stone or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                   41</span>\n\nwood for the benefit of mankind, that is styled the self\n\nrevealed.&quot; A Swyamhu or self-revealed image is a product of\n\nnature, it is Anadi or without any beginning and the worshippers\n\nsimply discover its existence. Such image does not require\n\nconsecration of Pratistha. All artificial or man-made images require\n\nconsecration. An image according to Matsya Purana may properly\n\nbe made of gold, silver, copper, iron, brass or bell metal or any kind\n\nof gem, stone or wood, conch shell, crystal or even earth.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">      Some persons worship images painted on wall or canvas,\n\nsays the Brihata Purana and some worship the spheroidical\n\nstones known as Salgram. Generally speaking, the Pouranic\n\nwriters classify artificial images under two heads: viz. (1) Lepya\n\nand (2) Lekhya. Lepya images are moulded figures of mental or\n\nclay, while Lekhyas denote all kinds of pictorial images\n\nincluding chiselled figures of wood or stone not made by\n\nmoulds. In the case of Goswami Geeridhariji v. Ramanlalji\n\nwhich went up to the Privy Council, the subject matter of\n\ndispute was the pictorial image of the head of the Ballavacharya\n\nSect and not of any deity. Images again may be permanent or\n\ntemporary. Temporary images which are set up for periodical Pujas\n\nlike Durga, Saraswati, etc. are generally made of clay and are\n\nimmersed in a river or tank after the puja is over.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">      Page 156 - Para &quot;4.7. Worship of the Idol.-After a deity is\n\ninstalled, it should be worshipped daily according to Hindu Sastras.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                   42</span>\n\nThe person founding a deity becomes morally responsible for the\n\nworship of the deity even if no property is dedicated to it. This\n\nresponsibility is always carried out by a pious Hindu either by\n\npersonal performance of the religious rites or, in the case of Sudras,\n\nby the employment of a Brahmin priest. The daily worship of a\n\nconsecrated image includes the sweeping of the temple, the process\n\nof smearing, the removal of the previous day&#x27;s offerings of flowers,\n\nthe presentation of fresh flowers, the respectful oblation of rice with\n\nsweets and water and other practices.&quot; The deity in short is\n\nconceived of as a living being and is treated in the same way as\n\nthe master of the house would be treated by his humble servant.\n\nThe daily routine of life is gone through, with minute accuracy, the\n\nvivified image is regaled with necessaries and luxuries of life in due\n\nsuccession even to the changing of clothes, the offering of cooked\n\nand uncooked food and the retirement to rest.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">      Page 156-157 - Para &quot;4.8. Reconstruction or purification\n\nof idols in case of defilement or destructions.-According to Hindu\n\nsages, an image becomes defiled if it is not worshipped regularly.\n\nReconstruction or purification of the image is ordained in cases\n\nwhere the image is mutilated, broken, burnt, fallen down or\n\nremoved from its place or is defiled by a beast or the touch of an\n\nout-caste or even when hymns appropriate to other gods are recited\n\nbefore it. The rules for reconstruction or replacement of an idol are\n\nthus laid down in Hayasirsha Pancharatram. &quot;Whatever is the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                   43</span>\n\nmaterial and whatever the size, of the image of Hari (God), that is to\n\nbe renewed; of the same material and of the same size, an image is\n\nto be caused to be made; of the same size, of the same form and of\n\nthe same material, should be placed, there, either on the second or\n\nthe third day (the image of) Hari should be established; if it be\n\nestablished after that, even in the prescsribed mode, there would be\n\nblame.&quot; The destruction of an image, as you will see presently,\n\ndoes not cause an extinction of the religious trust that is created\n\nin its favour; the rules of construction or replaacement of an\n\nidol as set out above are most liberally construed. It is enough if\n\nan image is established substantially representing the old or is\n\ntreated as such, and the fact that the replacement was not made\n\nwithin the prescribed time, though blamable from the orthodox\n\npoint of view, does not affect the validity of replacement. When\n\nthe settler had provided for Puja being performed in a specified\n\nBhajana Matam, and subsequently that building was lost to the\n\ntrust, it was held that did not extinguish the trust, as a new Bhajana\n\nMatam could be constructed and Puja performed there.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">      Page 158 - Para &quot;4.10. Dedicated property vests in the idol\n\nas a juristic person.-When property is given absolutely by a pious\n\nHindu for worship of an idol, the property vests in the idol itself as\n\na juristic person. This view, as I have explained in the first lecture,\n\nis quite in accordance with Hindu ideas and has been uniformly\n\naccepted in a long series of decisions of the different High Courts in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                  44</span>\n\nIndia as well as by the Judicial Committee. As West, J. observed in\n\nManohar Ganesh v. Lakshmi Ram: &quot;The Hindu law recognises not\n\nonly corporate bodies with rights of property vested in the\n\ncorporation apart from its individual members, but also juridical\n\nsubjects or persons called foundations.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">      The Hindu idol is juridical subject, and the pious idea that it\n\nembodies is given the status of a legal person and is deemed\n\ncapable in law of holding property in the same way as a natural\n\nperson.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      &quot;The idol, deity or religious object,&quot; observed West and\n\nBuhler in their Digest on Hindu Law, &quot;is looked upon as a kind of\n\nhuman entity.&quot; It is a sacred entity and ideal personality possessing\n\nproprietary rights. The Judicial Committee has pointed out on more\n\noccasions than one that it is only an ideal sense that property can be\n\nsaid to belong to an idol and the possession and management of it\n\nmust, in the nature of things, be entrusted to some persons as\n\nShebait or manager. The legal principle has thus been summed up in\n\none of the pronouncements of the Judicial Committee:\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      &quot;A Hindu idol is, according to long-established authority,\n\nfounded upon the religious customs of the Hindus, and the\n\nrecognition thereof by courts of law, a &#x27;juristic entity&#x27;. It has a\n\njuridical status, with the power of suing and being sued. Its\n\ninterests are attended to by the person who has the deity in his\n\ncharge and who in law is its manager, with all the powers which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                  45</span>\n\nwould, in such circumstances, on analogy, be given to the\n\nmanager of the estate of an infant heir. It is unnecessary to\n\nquote the authorities; for this doctrine, thus simply stated, is\n\nfirmly established.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_80\">Page 158-159 - Para &quot;4.10A. Existence of idol is necessary for\ntemple.-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">While usually an idol is instituted in a temple, it does not appear\n\nto be an essential condition of a temple as such. In an Andhra\n\ncase, it was held that to constitute a temple, it is enough if it is a\n\nplace of public religious worship and if the people believe in its\n\nreligious efficacy, irrespective of the fact whether there is an\n\nidol or a structure or other paraphernalia. It is enough if the\n\ndevotees or the pilgrims feel that there is one superhuman\n\npower which they should worship and invoke its blessings.\n\nHowever, in almost all cases the temple does possess an idol.&quot;\n\nPage 160-162. Para &quot;4.13. The principle of Hindu Law that a\n\ndonee must be in existence at the time of gift whether applicable\n\nto the creation of a Dubutter endowment? In a Debutter\n\nendowment, as you have seen, the deity or idol is the recipient or\n\ndonee of the endowed property which vests in it as a juridical\n\nperson. To constitute a valid gift under Hindu law it is necessary\n\nthat it must be accepted by a sentient being who is in existence at\n\nthe time of the gift. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188376487\" id=\"span_51\">This rule which was authoritatively laid down\n\nby the judicial Committee in the case of <a href=\"/doc/188376487/\" id=\"a_15\">Tagore v. Tagore</a> has been\n\nscrupulously followed ever since by all the High Courts in India. An\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                    46</span>\n\nattempt was made however in some of the decisions of the Calcutta\n\nHigh Court to carry the rule too far, and to hold that a gift to an idol\n\nwhich is not consecrated or in existence at the time of dedication is\n\nnot valid.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"626945\" id=\"span_53\">Thus, in <a href=\"/doc/626945/\" id=\"a_16\">Upendra Lal Boral v. Hem Chandra</a> where one of\n\nthe question raised related to the validity of a bequest in favour of a\n\nnon-existent idol, it was held by the learned Judges that &quot;if there\n\nwas a gift to the idol, it was bad, because there was no idol in\n\nexistence at the time of his death, and further if there was a oer to\n\nmake such a gift the power was ineffective because on the authority\n\nof Bai Malivahu v. Mamubai we think that &quot; a power must be to\n\nconvey to a person who was in existence either actually or in\n\ncontemplation of law at the death of the testator and the idol to\n\nwhich the dedication is sought to have been made was not then in\n\nexistence.&quot; the learned Judges proceeded to say, &quot;the deity no doubt\n\nis always in existence but there could be no gift to the deity as such\n\nand there was no personification of the deity to whom the gift\n\ncould have been made, or who was capable of taking it.&quot;</span> The same\n\nview was taken by Stanley, J. in Rojomoyi v. Troylukho and it was\n\nheld that a direction in the will of a testator to establish a &#x27;thakur&#x27; to\n\nwhom the entire residuary estate was to go was invalid. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188376487\" id=\"span_54\">&quot;Whether a\n\ngift be in presenti or in futuro&quot;, thus observed the learned Judge,\n\n&quot;it is settled that the donee must be a person in existence and\n\ncapable of accepting the gift at the time it takes effect - <a href=\"/doc/188376487/\" id=\"a_17\">Tagore v.\n\nTagore</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1855638\" id=\"span_55\">That which cannot be done directly by gift cannot be done\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                   47</span>\n\nby the intervention of a trustee; Krishna Ramani v. Ananda;\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1855638/\" id=\"a_18\">Rajendra Dutt v. Sham Chand</a>. An idol cannot be said to have\n\njuridical existence unless it has been consecrated by the appropriate\n\nceremonies, and so has become spiritualised. Before this, the deity\n\nof which the idol is the visible image does not reside in the idol:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">Doorga Pershad v. Sheo Pershad. In Nagendra Nandini v. Binoy\n\nKrishna, Stephen, J. took it to be a settled law that a bequest to a\n\nthankur not in existence at the date of the death of the testator was\n\nnot valid. It may be noticed here that the case of Doorga Pershad v.\n\nSheo Pershad, to which reference was made by Stanley, J., is of a\n\ndifferent type altogether. In that case an image of Vishnu, as also the\n\nDebotter property dedicated to it, were sold in execution of a money\n\ndecree against the Shebait, and the purchaser brought the image to\n\nhis house and continued to conduct its worship. The Shebait&#x27;s son\n\nset up another image of the god, and instituted a suit against the\n\npurchaser to recover the property but not the original image. It was\n\ncontended on his behalf that the removal of the original image\n\ndestroyed its sanctity and justified its replacement by another\n\nimage, and in any event the property should be devoted to the\n\nworship    of the second image also. The first contention was\n\nnegatived and with it the second contention fell also. It was held by\n\nthe learned judges and quite rightly that no second image could be\n\nset up when an existing image continues fit for worship, the deity\n\nbeing intended by the founder to be worshipped by one image and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                   48</span>\n\nnot simultaneously by two. No doubt the learned judges observe in\n\nthe course of their judgment that according to Hindu rites when an\n\nidol has been consecrated by appropriate ceremonies and\n\npronunciation of Mantras, then and then only the deity of which the\n\nidol is the visible image could reside in it. But there is nothing in\n\nthe decision which might be taken to lay down that a dedication is\n\nnot valid unless a consecrated image is in existence at the date of\n\ndedication. This question was neither considered nor decided by the\n\nlearned Judges. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"403124\" id=\"span_58\">The authority of the cases referred to above has\n\nbeen overruled by the pronouncement of Full Bench of the Calcutta\n\nHigh Court in <a href=\"/doc/403124/\" id=\"a_19\">Bhupati Smrititirtha v. Ram Lal</a>. The main question\n\nreferred to the Bull Bench was: &quot;Does the principle of Hindu Law\n\nwhich invalidates a gift other than to sentient being capable of\n\naccepting it, apply to a bequest to trustees for the establishment of\n\nan image and the worship of a Hindu deity after the testator&#x27;s death,\n\nand make such a bequest void?&quot; The Full Bench answered the\n\nquestion in the negative. Sir Lawrence Jenkins who presided over\n\nthe Full Bench in the course of his judgment observed that the &quot;rule\n\nwhich requires relinquishment should be to a sentient person does\n\nnot forbid the gift of property to trustees for a religious purpose\n\nthough that purpose cannot in strictness be called a &#x27;sentient person&#x27;.\n\nIt would seem that the rule propounded by Jinutabahan had regard\n\nrather to the general proposition for he was contending, i.e., the act\n\nof the giver is the cause of property, than to its application to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                  49</span>\n\nparticular objects of benevolence. The fiction that an idol is a\n\nperson capable of holding property must be kept within its proper\n\nlimits, and were we to accede to the argument that has been\n\nadvanced before us, we should be allowing fiction to be built on\n\nfiction to the hindrance and not for the furtherance of justice.&quot;\n\nMookerjee, J. in the same case held on a review of all the relevant\n\ntexts that according to Hindu law the rule about the acceptance of a\n\ngift as a necessary condition for its validity was applicable to\n\nsecular gifts only. There is no foundation for the assumption that the\n\ndedication to deity or for religious purpose stands on the same\n\nfooting. In summing up       the legal position the learned Judge\n\nobserved as follows: &quot;The view that no valid dedication of property\n\ncan be made by a will to a deity the image of which is not in\n\nexistence at the time of the death of the testator is based upon a\n\ndouble fiction, namely, first that the Hindu deity is for all purposes\n\na juridical person and secondly that a dedication to the deity has the\n\nsame characteristics and is subject to the same restrictions as a gift\n\nto a human being. The first of these propositions is too broadly\n\nstated, and the second is inconsistent with the first principles of\n\nHindu Jurisprudence.&quot; The provisions of Hindu law relating to\n\nsecular gifts are therefore not applicable when the dedication is to\n\nthe idol. Moreover,-and this was pointed out by Chatterjee, J., who\n\nwas a member of the Full Bench-the conception of Hindu jurists\n\nwas not that the image of clay or stone constituted the juristic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                  50</span>\n\nperson. The Smriti writers have laid down that if an image is\n\nbroken or lost another may be substituted in its place; when so\n\nsubstituted it is not a new personality but the same deity, and\n\nproperties vested in the lost or mutilated thakur become vested\n\nin the substituted thakur. Thus, a dedication to an idol is really\n\na dedication to the deity who is ever-present and ever-existent,\n\nthe idol being no more than the visible image through which the\n\ndeity is supposed specially to manifest itself by reason of the\n\nceremony of consecration.</span> The decision in Bhupati Smrititirtha\n\nv. Ramlal has been followed by other High Courts in India, and\n\nit has been held by the Allahabad High Court in Mohor Singh v.\n\nHet Singh that a bequest to complete the building of a temple\n\nwhich was commenced by the testator and to install and\n\nmaintain an idol therein was a valid bequest under the Hindu\n\nLaw. The fact that the gift is made by a deed inter vivos and not\n\nby a will does not make any difference.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      I may quote relevant case law;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39110328\" id=\"span_61\">(i) 1999 (5) SCC Page 50 (<a href=\"/doc/39110328/\" id=\"a_20\">Ram-Janki Deity Vs.

While it is true that the\n\nlearned Single Judge has quoted some eminent authors but\n\nin our view the same does not however, lend any assistance\n\nto the matter in issue and the Principles of Hindu Law seems\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                            53</span>\n\n to have been totally misread by the learned Single Judge.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_89\">(ii)   2000 (4) SCC, Page 146 - Shiromani Gurudwara\n\nPrabandhak Committee Vs.

Now, we proceed to examine the judgment of the High\n\nCourt which had held to the contrary. There was difference of\n\nopinion between the two Judges and finally the third Judge\n\nagreed with one of the differing Judges, who held Guru\n\nGranth Sahib to be not a &quot;Juristic Person&quot;. Now, we proceed\n\nto examine the reasonings for their holdings so. They first\n\nerred, in holding that such an endowment is void as there\n\ncould not be such a juristic person without appointment of a\n\nManager. In other words, they held that a juristic person\n\ncould only act through some one, a human agency and as in\n\nthe ease of an Idol, the Guru Granth Sahib also could not act\n\nwithout a manager. In our view no endowment or a juristic\n\nperson depends on the appointment of a Manager, It may be\n\nproper or advisable to appoint such a manager while making\n\nany endowment but in its absence, it may be done either by\n\nthe trustees or Courts in accordance with law. Mere absence\n\nof a-manager (does not) negative the existence of a juristic\n\nperson. As pointed out in Manohar Ganesh v. (approved in\n\nYogendra Nath Naskar&#x27;s case ) referred to above, if no\n\nmanager is appointed by the founder, the ruler would give\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                            54</span>\n\neffect to the bounty. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1280506\" id=\"span_66\">As pointed in <a href=\"/doc/1280506/\" id=\"a_21\">Vidyapurna Tirtha Swami\n\nv.

This section\n\nis also inappropriate in the case of a private trust, the obvious\n\nreason being that any and every Hindu cannot be interested in\n\na private trust so as to give him a locus standi to make the\n\napplication. Further, it is difficult to visualise that a Hindu\n\nprivate debutter will fail, for a deity is immortal.

The question which arises is, can the grant made to the\n\nappellant be said to attract the operation of rule 5 ? Rule 5\n\nprescribes for the levy of Matmi in respect of State grants and\n\nif the said rule applies, the appellant would have no case. In\n\ndeciding the question as to whether the appellant&#x27;s estate is\n\nliable to pay Matmi under r. 5 it is necessary to examine the\n\nnature of this Matmi, and find out whether a claim in respect\n\nof it can be made against the appellant. We have already\n\nnoticed that Matmi means mutation of the name of the\n\nsuccessor to a State grant on the death of the last holder. It is\n\nobvious that in the case of a grant to the Idol or temple as\n\nsuch there would be no question about the death of the\n\ngrantee and, therefore, no question about its successor. An\n\nIdol which is a juridical person is not subject to death,\n\nbecause the Hindu concept is that the Idol lives for ever,\n\nand so, it is plainly impossible to predicate about the Idol\n\nwhich is the grantee in the present case that it has died at\n\na certain time and the claims of a successor fall to be\n\ndetermined. That being so, it seems difficult to hold that any\n\nclaim for Matmi can be made against the appellant, and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                             59</span>\n\nthat must clearly lead to the inference that no amount can be\n\nrecovered from the properties belonging to the Idol on the\n\nground that Matmi is claimable against a person who claims\n\nto be the successor of the Shebait of the appellant.\n\nIt is next contended by Mr. Muthiah Mudaliar that there is no\n\n&quot;institution&#x27; in this case so as to attract the operation of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/386905/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 84 (1)</a>, the institution, according to him, coming into\n\nexistence only if and when the building is completed and the\n\nidol installed and consecrated in the manner prescribed by the\n\nAgama Sastras, and described by Satyanarayana Rao J. in his\n\njudgment.

It cannot itself make use of\n\n them; it cannot enjoy them or dispose of them, or even\n\n protect them. In short, the idol can have no beneficial interest\n\n in the endowment.

Kane appeared, and in the course of his\n\n        argument, he stated as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">            &quot;According to the Pratishtha-Mayukha of Nilkantha\n\n            and other ancient works an image is to be removed\n\n            permanently only in case of unavoidable necessity,\n\n            such as where the current of a river carries away the\n\n            image. Here the image is intact. It is only the temple\n\n            that is dilapidated. For repairing it, the image need not\n\n            necessarily be removed. Even if it may be necessary to\n\n            remove the image, that will be only temporarily. The\n\n            manager has under Hindu law no power to effect\n\n            permanent removal of an image in the teeth of\n\n            opposition from a large number of the worshippers. In\n\n            the instances cited by the appellant, worshippers had\n\n            consented to the removal. Permanent removal of an\n\n            image without unavoidable necessity is against Hindu\n\n            sentiment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">    (Italics hereto supplied)\n\nShah, J.

Still the question is whether the\n\ndefendant as manager is entitled to remove the image\n\nwith a view to its installation in another building which is\n\nnear the existing building. Taking the most liberal view of\n\nthe powers of the manager, I do not think that as the\n\nmanager of a public temple he can do what he claims the\n\npower to do, viz., to remove the image from its present\n\nposition and to instal it in the new building. The image is\n\nconsecrated in its present position for a number of years\n\nand there is the existing temple. To remove the image\n\nfrom that temple and to instal it in another building\n\nwould be practically putting a new temple in place of the\n\nexisting temple. Whatever may be the occasions on\n\nwhich the installation of a new image as a substitute for\n\nthe old may be allowable according to the Hindu law, it is\n\nnot shown on behalf of the defendant that the ruinous\n\ncondition of the existing building is a ground for\n\npractically removing the image from its present place to a\n\nnew place permanently.

It cannot also be\n\n         disputed that under the Hindu law religious or charitable\n\n         purposes are not confined to purposes which are\n\n         productive of actual or assumed public benefit. The\n\n         acquisition of religious merit is also an important criterion.\n\n         This is illustrated by the series of cases which recognize\n\n         the validity of perpetual endowment for the maintenance\n\n         and worship of family idols or for the continued\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                         86</span>\n\nperformance of annual sradhs of an individual and his\n\nancestors. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1527262\" id=\"span_122\">See <a href=\"/doc/1527262/\" id=\"a_65\">Dwarkanath Bysack and another v.

So far as\n\nthe textual Hindu law is concerned what acts conduce to\n\nreligious merit and justify a perpetual dedication of\n\nproperty therefore is fairly definite.

Thiruvengada Pillai and others . These lists\n\nare no doubt not exhaustive but they indicate that what\n\nconduces to religious merit in Hindu law is primarily a\n\nmatter of Shastraic injunction. To the extent, therefore, any\n\npurpose is claimed to be a valid one for perpetual\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                         87</span>\n\ndedication on the ground of religious merit though lacking\n\nin public benefit, it must be shown to have a Shastraic\n\nbasis so far as Hindus are concerned. No doubt since then\n\nother religious practices and beliefs may have grown up\n\nand obtained recognition from certain classes, as\n\nconstituting purposes conducive to religious merit. If such\n\nbeliefs are to be accepted by courts as being sufficient for\n\nvalid perpetual dedication of property therefore without the\n\nelement of actual or presumed public benefit it must at\n\nleast be shown that they have obtained wide recognition\n\nand constitute the religious practice of a substantial and\n\nlarge class of persons. That is a question which does not\n\narise for direct decision in this case. But is cannot be\n\nmaintained that the belief in this behalf of one or more\n\nindividuals is sufficient to enable them to make a valid\n\nsettlement permanently tying up property. The heads of\n\nreligious purposes determined by belief in acquisition of\n\nreligious merit cannot be allowed to be widely enlarged\n\nconsistently with public policy and needs of modern\n\nsociety.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184660633\" id=\"span_124\">(ii)   AIR 1952 Supreme Court - <a href=\"/doc/184660633/\" id=\"a_66\">Page 75 - The State\n\nof West Bengal Vs.

The\n\ncommon law of England grew up in that way. It was\n\ngradually added to as each concrete case arose and a\n\ndecision, was given ad hoc on the facts of that particular\n\ncase. It is true the judges who thus contributed to its\n\ngrowth were not importing personal predilections into the\n\nresult and merely stated what was the law applicable to that\n\nparticular case. But though they did not purport to make\n\nthe law and merely applied what according to them, had\n\nalways been the law handed down by custom and tradition,\n\nthey nevertheless had to draw for their material on a\n\nnebulous mass of undefined rules which though they\n\nexisted in fact and left a vague a awareness in man&#x27;s minds,\n\nnevertheless were neither clearly definable not even\n\nnecessarily identificable, until crystalised into concrete\n\nexistence by a judicial decision; not indeed is it necessary\n\nto travel as far afield.

The same principle is\n\napplicable in English law as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">16.   &quot;The matter may be considered upon broader\n\nprinciples. According to English law, Englishmen carry\n\nEnglish law with them in countries which were\n\nformerly uninhabited and are peopled by them. English\n\ncommon law as well as Statute law brought into force\n\nup to the date of the settlement is applicable to such\n\ncolony to the extent to which such laws are suitable to\n\nthe   conditions     of    the   colony.   Statutes   passed\n\nsubsequently apply to the colony only if they are made\n\nexpressly applicable to it. In an inhabited country,\n\nhowever, obtained by conquest or cessation, law\n\nalready prevalent therein continues to prevail except to\n\nthe extent to which English law has been introduced\n\nand also except to the extent to which such law is not\n\ncivilised law at all, vide Yeap Cheah Neo v. Ong Cheng\n\nNeo (1875) 6 p. c. 381. India fell in the category of\n\nconquered or ceded country because it was already\n\ninhabited and civilised law prevailed therein before the\n\nadvent of the British and, therefore, prima facie there\n\ncan be no presumption that English law applied to\n\nIndians in India.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                       94</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"862566\" id=\"span_132\">(VI) 84 Ind.

Now coming down to first principles, British\n\nGovernment brings to its subjects, as a general rule,\n\nliberty of the person, liberty of conscience, liberty of\n\nspeech, liberty to own property, and last, but perhaps\n\nnot least, equality of man in the sight of the law. But\n\nthe liberty granted to one subject must not be used to\n\nthe detriment of another subject. The principle sic utere\n\ntuo ut alienum non loedas is applicable to rights as well\n\nas property. In other words, liberty must not degenerate\n\ninto license. Hence the law has to impose restraints on\n\nthose who misuse the privileges of a free citizen. The\n\nslanderer, for instance, is restrained by the law of libel,\n\nthe thief by the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_68\">Indian Penal Code</a>. But the fact that\n\nsuch restraints exist and apply to all citizens alike is not\n\na slur upon the honest citizen. It is unthinkable that His\n\nGrace the Archbishop of Canterbury, for instance,\n\nwould commit a criminal offence, but he is subject to\n\nthe Criminal Law all the same, and this act involves no\n\nslur. So, too, in theory the Mullaji Saheb is amenable to\n\nthe Criminal and Civil Law of this country, through it is\n\nunthinkable that he would commit any offence. A\n\nstriking instance of his is the attempt made by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                        95</span>\n\n Dawoodi Borah Priest to put the 49th Dai into prison\n\n for failure to pay a judgment debt, and which I have\n\n already referred to. (See Ex. B. E5)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">96.   Similar principles apply, I think, to trustees. The\n\nfoundation of the law of trusts is that the trustee is\n\ntrusted. Hence the greater the trust, the more unthinkable\n\ndoes it become that the trustee will violate it. And yet the\n\nlaw has to impose restraints on the guilty or negligent\n\ntrustee and to give its assistance to any honest trustee\n\nwho requires it. But the existence of these civil restraints\n\nis no more a slur upon the honest trustee, than the\n\nexistence of criminal restraints is upon the honest\n\ncitizen. Hence in my judgment the infallibility of any\n\nparticular individual does not affect his theoretical legal\n\nposition in the slightest. In short the test of a trust is not\n\nwhether the alleged trustee can ever commit a breach of\n\ntrust, which is what the defendants contention in effect\n\namounts to. His Holiness the Pope of Rome claims to be\n\ninfallible and immaculate, and Iris followers are\n\nnumbered by the million and are found in ail parts of the\n\nglobe. And yet in Moore v. The Pope (1919) 1 Ir. R.\n\n316, His Holiness submitted to the jurisdiction of the\n\nIrish Courts and contented that a bequest to him to be\n\napplied at his sole, discretion in carrying out the duties\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                        96</span>\n\nof his sacred office was a valid charitable bequest. If the\n\ndefendants are correct, the Holy Father ought to have\n\nstrongly protested against any suggestion that he could\n\nbe a trustee of a charitable fund. He was held to be a\n\ntrustee but that the trust was invalid.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">97.   In 1 Blackstone&#x27;s Commantaries 112 (which is\n\nquoted in Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, Volume 11, page\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">717), I find the following passage:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">      In respect of these lands the King as supreme\n\nEcclesiastical head         was      entitled      to     the\n\nEcclesiastical emoluments in trust that he should\n\n      distribute the same for the good of the Church.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">98.

I would like here to say that so far as I am\n\nconcerned, I have scarcely ever come across a case in a\n\nCourt in another country bearing closer resemblance to\n\nfacts and contentions of a case before our Courts than the\n\ncase of O&#x27;Hanlon v. Logue (1861) 30 Beav. 360 at p. 362\n\nbears to the present case. It must be remembered that it is\n\ndecided by the tribunal having the highest jurisdiction in\n\na country in which religious matters bear remarkable\n\nanalogy to this country-- Ireland like India having no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                           104</span>\n\n   established Church, no State religion, and where the\n\n   doctrine of superstitious uses has no application. It is\n\n   decided as recently as 1906, its pronouncements are clear\n\n   and emphatic; there is no element of doubt or a note of\n\n   uncertainty in the judgments pronounced; every case of\n\n   importance on the subject, ancient or modern, is carefully\n\n   considered and the question before the Court finally and\n\n   definitely settled. Judgments such as those pronounced in\n\n   this case must command the respectful attention of other\n\n   Courts deciding similar questions. This case alone is\n\n   sufficient to set at rest all doubts and remove all\n\n   difficulties in the decision of this case, and enables me to\n\n   answer the question before me-:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">   Whether the Trust declared in respect of the Government\n\n   Promissory Notes for 15,000 Rupees mentioned in the\n\n   plaint are valid in the affirmative with considerable\n\n   confidence.

We find no force\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                       117</span>\n\nin the contention, It is seen that the Gazette of the\n\nBombay Presidency, Vol. Ill published in 1879 is\n\nadmissible under<a href=\"/doc/1034981/\" id=\"a_78\"> s.35</a> read with<a href=\"/doc/492182/\" id=\"a_79\"> s.81</a> of the Evidence Act,\n\n1872. The Gazette is admissible being official record\n\nevidencing public affairs and the court may presume their\n\ncontents as genuine. The statement contained therein can\n\nbe taken into account to discover the historical material\n\ncon-tained therein and the facts stated therein is evidence\n\nunder<a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_80\"> s.45</a> and the court may inconjunction with other\n\nevidence and circumstance take into consideration in\n\nadjuding the dispute in question though may not be\n\ntreated as conclusive evidence. The recitals in the Gazette\n\ndo establish that Kalika Mataji is onlhe lop of the hill.\n\nMahakali temple and Bachra Mataji on the right and left\n\nto the Kalika Mataji. During Moughal rule another Syed\n\nSadar Peer was also installed there, but Kalika Mataji was\n\nthe chief temple. Hollies and Bills are the main\n\nworshipers. Oh full Moon of Chaitra (April) and\n\nDussehra (in the month of October), large number of\n\nHindus of all classes gather there and worship Kalika\n\nMataji, Mahakali, etc. After the downfall of Moughal\n\nempire, Marathas took over and His Highness Scindias\n\nattached great importance to the temple. One of the\n\ndevotees in 1700 offered silver doors. The British\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                       118</span>\n\nannexed the territory pursuant to the treaty between Her\n\nMajesty&#x27;s Government of India and His Highness Scindia\n\non the 12th December, I860, A condition was imposed in\n\nthe treaty for continued payment of fixed cash grants to\n\nall the temples from the Treasury and that British\n\nemperors accepted the condition. Regular cash grants of\n\nfixed sums were given to all the temples by Scindias and\n\nBritish rulers, as evidence by exhibits 27, 29 and 30. The\n\nhistorical statement of noted historian, stated by the High\n\nCourt, by name M.S. Commissionaria in his Vol. I of\n\n1938 Edition corroborates the Gazette on the material\n\nparticulars, which would established that the temple was\n\nconstructed on the top of the hill around 14th century and\n\nthe people congregate in thousands and worship, as of\n\nright, to Kalika Mataji and other deities. R.N. Jogelkar&#x27;s\n\nAlienation manual brought up in 1921 in the Chapter 5\n\nDevas-tbana also corroborates the historical evidence. It\n\nis true that Bai Diwali in her Will, Ex.22 treated the\n\ntemple and the properties to be private property and\n\nbequeathed to her brother and the litigation ensued in that\n\nbehalf. At that time, as rightly pointed out by the High\n\nCourt, the concept of public trust and public temple was\n\nnot very much in vogue. Therefore, the treatment meted\n\nout to these properties at that time is not conclusive. On\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                        119</span>\n\nthe other hand the fixed cash grants given by a Rulers\n\nScindias and the successor British emperors, the large\n\nendowment of lands given to Kalika Mataji temple by the\n\ndevotees do indicate that the temple was treated as public\n\ntemple. The appropriation of the income and the inter se\n\ndisputes in that behalf are self serving evidence without\n\nany probative value. Admit-tedly, at no point of time, the\n\ncharacter of the temple was an issue in any civil\n\nproceedings. All the lands gifted to the deity stand in the\n\nname of the deities, in particular large extent of\n\nagricultural lands belong to Kalika Mataji. The entries in\n\nRevenue records corroborated it. The Gazette and the\n\nhistorical evidence of the temple would show that the\n\nvillage is the pilgrimage centre. Situation of the temples\n\non the top of the hill away from the village and worshiped\n\nby the people of Hindus Community at large congregated\n\nin thousand without any let or hindrance and as of right;\n\ndevotees giving their offerings in large sums in discharge\n\nof their vows, do establish that it is a public temple. It is\n\ntrue that there is ho proof of dedication to the public. It is\n\nseen that it was lost in antiquity and no documentary\n\nevidence in that behalf is available. Therefore, from the\n\ntreatment meted out to the temple and aforesaid evidence\n\nin our considered view an irresistible inference would be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                       120</span>\n\ndrawn that the temple was dedicated to the Hindu public\n\nor a section thereof and the public treat the temple as\n\npublic temple and worship thereat as of right. It is true\n\nthat there is evidence on record to show that there was a\n\nboard with inscription thereon that &quot;no entry without\n\npermission&quot; and that only Darshan was being had and\n\ninside pooja was no permitted. But that is only internal\n\nregulation arranged for the orderly Darshan and that is\n\nnot a circumstance to g o against the conclusion that it is\n\na public temple. Enjoyment of the properties and non-\n\ninterference by the public in the management are not\n\nsufficient to conclude mat the temple is a private temple.\n\nIt is found by the District Court and the High Court that\n\nthe appellants are hereditary priests and when the public\n\nfound that they are in the management of the properties,\n\nthey obviously felt it not expedient to interfere with the\n\nmanagement of the temples. It is seen that the High Court\n\nconsidered the evidence placed on record and has drawn\n\nthe necessary conclusions and inferences from the proved\n\nfacts that kalika Mataji temple is a public temple. It is a\n\nfinding of fact. As regard the oral evidence the High\n\nCourt rightly appreciated the evidence and it being a\n\nquestion of fact, we find no error in the assessment of the\n\nevidence by the High Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                   121</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">             (c)   AIR 1967 Supreme Court, 256, Srinivas Das Vs.\n\n            Suraj Narayan Das, Para 26 - The Gazetteer can be\n\n            consulted as providing historical material and the practice\n\n            followed by the Math and its head.

The moot point for consideration, therefore, is where\n\nis the line to be drawn between what are matters of\n\nreligion and what are not ? Our Constitution-makers have\n\nmade no attempt to define what &#x27;religion&#x27; is and it is\n\ncertainly not possible to frame an exhaustive definition of\n\nthe word &#x27;religion&#x27; which would be applicable to all\n\nclasses of persons. As has been indicated in the Madras\n\ncase referred to above, the definition of the &#x27;religion&#x27;\n\ngiven by Fields J. in the American case of Davis v.\n\nBeason , does not seem to us adequate or precise. &quot;The\n\nterm &#x27;religion&#x27;&quot;, thus to observed the learned Judge in the\n\ncase mentioned above, &quot;has reference to one&#x27;s views of\n\nhis relations to his Creator and to the obligations they\n\nimpose of reverence for His Being and character and of\n\nobedience to His Will. It is often confounded with cults\n\nor form of worship of a particular sect, but is\n\ndistinguishable from the latter&quot;. It may be noted that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                       127</span>\n\n&#x27;religion is not necessarily theistic and in fact there are\n\nwell known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism\n\nwhich do not believe in the existence of God or of any\n\nIntelligent First Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its\n\nbasis in a system of beliefs and doctrines which are\n\nregarded by those who profess that religion to be\n\nconducive to their spiritual well being, but it would not\n\nbe correct to say, as seems to have been suggested by one\n\nof the learned Judges of the Bombay High Court, that\n\nmatters of religion are nothing but matters of religious\n\nfaith and religious belief. A religion is not merely an\n\nopinion, doctrine for belief. It has its outward expression\n\nin acts as well. We may quote in this connection the\n\nobservations of Latham C.J. of the High Court of\n\nAustralia in the case of Adelaide Company v. The\n\nCommonwealth , 124.), where the extent of protection\n\ngiven to religious freedom by <a href=\"/doc/20238/\" id=\"a_99\">section 116</a> of the\n\nAustralian Constitution came up for consideration.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">&quot;It is sometimes suggested in discussion on the subject of\n\nfreedom of religion that, though the civil Government\n\nshould   not   interfere    with   religious   opinions,   it\n\nnevertheless may deal as it pleases with any acts which\n\nare done in pursuance of religious belief without\n\ninfringing the principle of freedom of religion. It appears\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                        128</span>\n\nto me to be difficult to maintain this distinction as\n\nrelevant to the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/20238/\" id=\"a_100\">section 116</a>. The section\n\nrefers in express terms to the exercise of religion, and\n\ntherefore it is intended to protect from the operation of\n\nany Commonwealth laws acts which are done in the\n\nexercise of religion. Thus the section goes far beyond\n\nprotecting liberty of opinion. It protects also acts done in\n\npursuance of religious belief as part of religion.&quot;\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">      In our opinion, as we have already said in the\n\nMadras case, these observations apply fully to the\n\nprovision regarding religious freedom that is embodied in\n\nour Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_222\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1961036\" id=\"span_172\">13. Religious practices or performances of acts in\n\npursuance of religious belief are as much a part of\n\nreligion as faith or belief in particular doctrines. Thus if\n\nthe tenets of the Jain or the Parsi religion lay down that\n\ncertain rites and ceremonies are to be performed as\n\ncertain times and in a particular manner, it cannot be said\n\nthat these are secular activities partaking of commercial\n\nor economic character simply because they involve\n\nexpenditure of money or employment of priests or the use\n\nof marketable commodities. No outside authorities has\n\nany right to say that these are not essential parts of\n\nreligion and it is not open to the secular authority of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                        129</span>\n\nState to restrict or prohibit them in any manner they like\n\nunder the guise of administering the trust estate. Of\n\ncourse, the scale of expenses to be incurred in connection\n\nwith these religious observances may be and is a matter\n\nof administration of property belonging to religious\n\ninstitutions; and if the expenses on&#x27; these heads are likely\n\nto deplete the endowed properties or affect the stability of\n\nthe institution, proper control can certainly be exercised\n\nby State agencies as the law provides. We may refer in\n\nthis connection to the observation of Davar J. in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1961036/\" id=\"a_101\">Jamshedji v. Soonabai</a> , and although they were made\n\nin a case where the question was whether the bequest of\n\nproperty by a Parsi testator for the purpose of perpetual\n\ncelebration of ceremonies like Muktad baj, Vyezashni,\n\netc., which are sanctioned by the Zoroastrian religion\n\nwere valid charitable gifts, the observations, we think, are\n\nquite appropriate for our present purpose. &quot;If this the\n\nbelief of the community&quot; thus observed the learned\n\nJudge, &quot;and it is proved undoubtedly to be the belief of\n\nthe Zoroastrian community, - a secular Judge is bound to\n\naccept that belief - it is not for him to sit in judgment on\n\nthat belief, he has no right to interfere with the\n\nconscience of a donor who makes a gift in favour of what\n\nhe believes to be the advancement of his religion and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                           130</span>\n\nwelfare     of   his   community     or     mankind&quot;.   These\n\nobservations do, in our opinion, afford an indication of\n\nthe measure of protection that is given by <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_102\">article 26(b)</a> of\n\nour Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_223\">(iii)    AIR     (1954)    Supreme        Court   282   (The\n\nCommissioner Hindu Religious Endowments Vs.

Let us consider first whether the impugned Act\n\ncontravenes the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 26(b).</a> It is\n\nunnecessary for the purpose of the present case to enter\n\ninto the difficult question weather every case of\n\nexcommunication by the Dai on whatever grounds\n\ninflicted is a matter of religion. What appears however to\n\nbe clear is that where an excommunication is itself based\n\non religious grounds such as lapse from the orthodox\n\nreligious creed or doctrine (similar to what is considered\n\nheresy, apostasy or schism under the Cannon Law) or\n\nbreach of some practice considered as an essential part of\n\nthe religion by the Dawoodi Bohras in general,\n\nexcommunication cannot but be held to be for the purpose\n\nof maintaining the strength of the religion. It necessarily\n\nfollows    that    the    exercise   of   this   power   of\n\nexcommunication on religious grounds forms part of the\n\nmanagement by the community, through its religious\n\nhead, &quot;of its own affairs in matters of religion.&quot; The\n\nimpugned Act makes even such excommunications\n\ninvalid and takes away the power of the Dai as the head\n\nof the community to excommunicate even on religious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                        134</span>\n\ngrounds. It therefore, clearly interferes with the right of\n\nthe Dawoodi Bohra community under clause (b) of\n\nArticle26 of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">41.   That      excommunication     of   a member      of   a\n\ncommunity will affect many of his civil rights is\n\nundoubtedly true. This particular religious denomination\n\nis possessed of properties and the necessary consequence\n\nof excommunication will be that the excommunicated\n\nmember will lose his rights of enjoyment of such\n\nproperty. It might be thought undesirable that the head of\n\na religious community would have the power to take\n\naway in this manner the civil right of any person. The\n\nright given under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 26(b)</a> has not however been\n\nmade subject to preservation of civil rights. The express\n\nlimitation in <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 26</a> itself is that this right under the\n\nseveral clauses of the article will exist subject to public\n\norder, morality and health. It has been held by this Court\n\nin Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. The State of Mysore :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">[1958]1SCR895 , that the right under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 26(b)</a> is\n\nsubject further to clause 2 of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 25</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_228\">42.

It is clear however that\n\napart form these limitations the Constitution has not\n\nimposed any limit on the right of a religious community\n\nto manage its own affairs in matters of religion. The fact\n\nthat civil rights of a person are affected by the exercise of\n\nthis fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1759799/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 26(b)</a> is therefore of\n\nno consequence.

When once it\n\nis conceded that the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 25(1)</a> is\n\nnot confined to freedom of conscience in the sense of the\n\nright to hold a belief and to propagate that belief, but\n\nincludes the right to the practice of religion, the\n\nconsequences of that practice must also bear the same\n\ncomplexion and be the subject of a like guarantee.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">(vi)   AIR 1962 SC 1106, Dalbir Singh Vs.

What is meant by &#x27;an\n\nessential part or practices of a religion&#x27; is now the matter\n\nfor elucidation. Essential part of a religion means the core\n\nbeliefs upon which a religion is founded. Essential\n\npractice means those practices that are fundamental to\n\nfollow a religious belief. It is upon the cornerstone of\n\nessential parts or practices the superstructure of religion\n\nis built. Without which, a religion will be no religion. Test\n\nto determine whether a part or practice is essential to the\n\nreligion is - to find out whether the nature of religion will\n\nbe changed without that part or practice. If the taking\n\naway of that part or practice could result in a fundamental\n\nchange in the character of that religion or in its belief,\n\nthen such part could be treated as an essential or integral\n\npart. There cannot be additions or subtractions to such\n\npart. Because it is the very essence of that religion and\n\nalterations will change its fundamental character. It is\n\nsuch permanent essential parts is what is protected by the\n\nConstitution. No body can say that essential part or\n\npractice of one&#x27;s religion has changed from a particular\n\ndate or by an event.

Hindusim cannot be defined in terms of Polytheism\n\nor Henotheism or Monotheism. The nature of Hindu\n\nreligion ultimately is Monisim/Advaita, This is in\n\ncontradistinction to Monotheism which means only one\n\nGod to the exclusion of all others. Polytheism is a belief\n\nof multiplicity of Gods. On the contrary, Monism is a\n\nspiritual belief of one Ultimate Supreme and manifests\n\nHimself as many. This multiplicity is not contrary to on-\n\ndualism.

In Sehsammal case on which\n\ngreat reliance was placed and stress was laid by counsel\n\non either side, this Court while reiterating the importance\n\nof performing rituals in temples for the idol to sustain the\n\nfaith of the people, insisted upon the need for\n\nperformance of elaborate ritual ceremonies accompanied\n\nby chanting of mantras appropriate to the Deity. This\n\nCourt also recognised the place of an archaka and had\n\nheld that the priest would occupy place of importance in\n\nthe performance of ceremonial rituals by a qualified\n\narchaka who would observe daily discipline imposed\n\nupon him by the Agamas according to tradition, usage and\n\ncustoms obtained in the temple.

Religion as used in those Articles requires\n\nrestricted interpretation in etymological sense.

The right to observe and practise rituals\n\nand right to manage in matters of religion are protected\n\nunder these Articles.

Thus, his one\n\nmistake about mentioning of the name could not make his\n\ndescription in this account    useless. He has referred that   Ram\n\nNaumi was birth day of Lord Ram and it was celebrated by Hindus\n\nas a festival day.

For\n\nconvenience I am reproducing the same:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">      &quot;The most conspicuous fact with respect to the textual\n\nevidence relating to the tirtha Rama-janmasthana (Janmabhumi) is\n\nthat on the one hand a description of this principle holy place is\n\nfound in all MSS of the AM used for this edition, and on the other\n\nhand that the tirtha is not mentioned in other classical sources (e.g.\n\nPuranas, Laksmidhara&#x27;s TVK, Nrsimhapurana MS, Jinaprabhasuri&#x27;s\n\nTK, Bhusram., and Mitra Misra&#x27;s TP). Such a silence is all the more\n\nsurprising in view of the fact that archaeological evidence indicates\n\nthe existence of a temple at this tirtha in the eleventh century. A\n\nreason for the omission of this holy place in the Bhusram and TP\n\nmight be that at the time these texts were written the site was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                  163</span>\n\noccupied by a mosque (built by Babur in AD 1528).&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_267\">        The DA recension, which presumably also dates from after\n\nthe destruction of the original Janmabhumi temple, has merely\n\ntaken over the description of the place as found in s and B, without\n\nadding more details and praise, yet it has connected the\n\nJanmasthana with an elaborate description of Ramanavami (OA 22,\n\nOA 23).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_268\">        This chapter is interesting for text-criticism in that it\n\nillustrates the relationship between OA, B,and S. The analysis of\n\nthis relationship in II, XXIXF.leads to the conclusion that, since OA\n\nis not directly based on B and S but goes back to an a-type-of-text\n\nwhich comprised the textual materials of B and S, both agreement\n\nbetween B and S against OA (AM 21. 2d), as well as agreement\n\nbetween OA and B against S (AM 21, 1cd/4cd,2b,7b,9/15), are\n\nlikely to occur. Since B rests on a later version of the 1-type-of-text\n\nthan S, a version that stands nearer to the OA recension, a greater\n\naffinity of B with OA than with S can be expected, especially in\n\nregard to the sequence and the occurrence of verses (see 21.1cd/4cd\n\nand 21.9/15 (sequence of OAB vs. S), and 21.3-4, 8-11 (occurring\n\nin OAB missing in S) vs. 21.13ab (occurring in BS missing in\n\nOA)).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_269\">        The fact that B represents the most direct or crudest version\n\nof the a-type-of-text, which was edited in S and in OA, while the\n\nlatter has not extended the description of the birthplace (possibly for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                  164</span>\n\nreasons advanced above), accounts for the given evidence that MS\n\nB actually contains the most complete version of this section of the\n\nMahatmya. The incongruity of S with the a-type-of-text may have\n\nprompted the author of B(P), at variance with his normal procedure,\n\nto include the entire description of the Janmasthana, thus rewriting a\n\npassage of S that was felt to be insufficient. The omission in S of\n\nDAB 21.8-11 may have been caused by homoeoteleuton (OABS\n\n21.7cd=OAB 21.11cd).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">      MS P, which omits several slokas ocurring in B (B 21.2-4)\n\nand replaces B 21.8 by another sloka, contains a hiatus after B 21.9\n\nwhich is indicated by a sign .... truti. Slokas 11 and 12 are corrupt\n\nand rendered incompletely in Mss O1 and O2, and BS 21.12abcd\n\nseems to be an anacoluthon.     Obviously this passage had become\n\ncorrupt in an early stage of its transmission and the clumsiness of\n\nthe Sanskrit that remained my have led the editor of A to delete it\n\naltogether.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">      Page 147 further deals about Janam Bhumi.

Be that\n\nas it may it is well that the essence of the work should be made\n\navailable to the public, and in this view Mr. Woodburn c.s. Has been\n\ngood enough to make a connected abstract for me, from a literal\n\ntranslation which I had made some years ago. This abstract is given\n\nas Appendix B.\n\n         Limits of Oudh.- It is not always easy to comprehend what is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">                                 173</span>\n\nmeant by the Oudh or Ajudhia of ancient times, for that territory has\n\nbeen subjected to many changes. So far as these are known to me,\n\nI give them below-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">       The Oudh of Rama.- Such intelligent natives as Maharaja\n\nMan Singh have informed me that at this period Oudh was divided\n\ninto five portions, thus:- (1) Kosal or Utar Kosala, which included\n\nthe present Trans-Gogra districts of Gorakhpur, Busti, Gondah and\n\nBaraich. (2) Pachhamrath, which included the country between the\n\nrivers Gogra dnd Gomti, extending westwards from ajudhia to\n\nNimkhar in Sitapur, (3) Purabrath, or the territory between the\n\nsame rivers, extending eastwards towards Jaunpur, the limit not\n\nbeing traceable. (4) Arbar being the country around Pertabgurh,\n\nlying between the rivers Gomti and Son, probably the same that is\n\nstill known as Aror or Arwar: and (5) Silliana, which incoluded\n\nsome portion of the Nepal hills running along the then Oudh\n\nfrontier.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">       The Oudh of Akbar.- Mention is made of the title of Subadar\n\nof Oudh as early as A.D. 1280, and it was one of the 15 subas or\n\nGovernorships into which Akbar subdivided the empire in 1590\n\nA.D. The Mahamadan attempt to change the name from Oudh to\n\nAkhtarnagar, never seems to have succeeded fully.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">       The boundaries of the old Suba differed materially from those\n\nof the present day, and a large part of what is now the eastern\n\nportion of the Province, including tanda, Aldemau, Manikpur, &amp;c.,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                 174</span>\n\nwas not in those days included in Suba Oudh, but in Allahabad.\n\nAccording to the Ain-i-Akbari the Suba then extended from and\n\ninclusive of Sirkar Gorakhpur, to Kanouj, and from the Himalayas\n\nto Suba Allahabad, 135 kos by 115 kos.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">      Suba Oudh contained five Sirkars, viz., (1) Oudh ; (2)\n\nLucknow : (3) Baraich ; (4) Khyrabad ; and (5) Gorakhpur.       The\n\ndetails of these are given below, but they are only approximately\n\ncorrect, and in regard to some places my information is incomplete.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">      The Janmasthan and other temples.- It is locally affirmed that\n\nat the Mahomedan conquest there were three important Hindu\n\nshrines, with but few devotees attached, at Ajudhia which was then\n\nlittle other than a wilderness. These were the &quot;Janmasthan,&quot; the\n\n&quot;Sargadwar mandir&quot; also known as &quot;Ram Darbar&quot; and the &quot;Tareta-\n\nke-Thakur.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_277\">      On the first of these the emperor Babar built the mosque\n\nwhich still bears his name, A.D. 1528. On the second Aurangzeb\n\ndid the same A.D. 1658-1707; and on the third that sovereign, or\n\nhis predecessor, built a mosque, according to the well known\n\nMahomedan principle of enforcing their religion on all those whom\n\nthey conquered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">      The Janmasthan marks the place where Ram Chandr was\n\nborn. The Sargadwar is the gate through which he passed into\n\nparadise, possibly the spot where his body was burned. The Tareta-\n\nke-Thakur was famous ad the place where Rama performed a great\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                 175</span>\n\nsacrifice, and which he commemorated by setting up there images\n\nof himself add Sita.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_279\">      Babar&#x27;s mosque- According to Leyden&#x27;s memoirs of Babar\n\nthat emperor encamped at the junction of the Serwa and Gogra\n\nrivers two orthree kos east from Ajudhia, on the 28th March 1528,\n\nand there he halted 7 or 8 days settling the surrounding country. A\n\nwell known hunting ground is spoken of in that work, 7 or 8 kos\n\nabove Oudh, on the banks of the Surju. It is remarkable that in all\n\nthe copies of Babar&#x27;s life now known, the pages that relate to his\n\ndoings at Ajudhia are wanting. In two places in the Babari mosque\n\nthe year in which it was built 935 H., corresponding with 1528 A.D.\n\nis carved in stone, along with inscriptions dedicated to the glory of\n\nthat emperor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_280\">      If Ajudhia was then little other than a wild, it must at least\n\nhave possessed a fine temple in the Janmasthan; for many of its\n\ncolumns are still in existence and in good preservation, having been\n\nused by the Musalmans in the construction of the Babari Mosque.\n\nThese are of strong close-grained dark slate-colored or black stone,\n\ncalled by the natives Kasoti (literally touch-stone,) and carved with\n\ndifferent devices. To my thinking these strongly resemble Budhist\n\npillars that I have seen at Benares and elsewhere. They are from\n\nseven to eight feet long, square at the base, centre and capital, and\n\nround or octagonal intermediately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_281\">      Hindu and Musalman differences.- The Janmasthan is within\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                                    176</span>\n\na few hundred paces of the Hanuman Garhi. In 1855 when a great\n\nrupture took place between the Hindus and Mahomedans, the\n\nformer occupied the Hanuman Garhi in force, while the Musalmans\n\ntook possession of the Janmastham.        The Mahomedans on that\n\noccasion actually charged up the steps of the Hanuman Garhi, but\n\nwere driven back with considerable loss. The Hindus then followed\n\nup this success, and at the third attempt, took the Janmasthan, at the\n\ngate of which 75 Mahomedans are buried in the &quot;Martyrs&#x27; grave&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">(ganj-shahid.) Several of the King&#x27;s Regiments were looking on all\n\nthe time, but their orders were not to interfere. It is said that up to\n\nthat time the Hindus and Mahomedans alike used to worship in the\n\nmosque-temple. Since British rule a railing has been put up to\n\nprevent disputes, within which in the mosque the Mahomedans\n\npray, while outside the fence the Hindus have raised a platform on\n\nwhich they make their offerings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">      The two other old mosques to which allusion has been made\n\n(known by the common people by the same of Nourang Shah, by\n\nwhom they mean Aurangzeb,) are now mere picturesque ruins.\n\nNothing has been done by the Hindus to restore the old Mandir of\n\n&quot;Ram Darbar.&quot; The &quot;Tareta-ke-Thakur&quot; was reproduced near the\n\nold ruin by the Raja of Kalu, whose estate is said to be in the\n\nPunjab, more than two centuries ago; and it was improved upon\n\nafterwards by Hilla Bai, Marathin, who also built the adjoining ghat\n\nA.D. 1784. She was the widow of Jaswant Rai, Holkar, of Indore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                                  177</span>\n\nfrom which family Rs. 231 are still annually received at this shrine.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">      Thus, on the basis of convincing epigraphical evidence the\n\nbelief of Hindus and the arguments advanced by Hindus, I am of the\n\nview that the city of Ayodhya undeniably is city of great antiquity\n\nand sacred spot to the Hindus for a long time. Valmiki Ramayan,\n\nSrimad Bhagwat, Mahabhart and Raghuvansham recognised the\n\nidentity of Ayodhya.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">      On the basis of record it transpired that on the basis of\n\nhistorical account given by William Finch, William Foster and\n\nTieffen Thaler, it is crystal clear that Hindus were worshipping the\n\nsite as birth place of Lord Ram as a deity. The aforesaid assertions\n\ncorroborate that Hindu temple used to exist at the birth place of\n\nLord Ram at Ram Kot. Encyclopaedia            Britannica    India by\n\nSurgeon    J.A. Balfour , gazetteer      of P. Carnegy and other\n\ngazetteers reveal the location of Babri mosque as the site of Ram\n\nJanam Bhumi and corroborate the version of William Finch that\n\nthe pilgrims were offering prayers with a belief that site was the\n\nbirth place of Lord Ram. Hans Bakker in hi s research work also\n\ncorroborated the historical version. He also consulted religious\n\nbooks of Hindus and other historical books. I have already referred\n\nimportant extracts of his thesis on the subject . Thus, from the\n\nmaterial on record it transpires that site was used to be a temple on\n\nRam Janam Bhumi which was reconstructed in 12th century and the\n\nsame was demolished. A.S.I. also confirms ruins of 12th century\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">                                  178</span>\n\ntemple. Even the debris of the Babri mosque which were collected\n\non 6.12.1992 proves the existence of Ram Janam Bhumi temple\n\nwhich was considered at the birth spot of Lord Ram. Fourteen\n\nKasauti pillars were taken from the old temple and were used in the\n\nconstruction of the mosque by Muslim on which images of Hindu\n\nGods and Goddesses were engraved.

Places of worship of any\n\nreligion having particular significance for that religion, to make it\n\nan essential or integral part of the religion, stand on a different\n\nfooting and have to be treated differently and more reverentially.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_282\">      Thus, there is overwhelming evidence that the property in\n\nsuit is site of Ram Janambhumi.It is corroborated by religious\n\nrecords, religious books, judicial records and relevant scriptures .\n\nThe fact of destruction of Ram Janambhumi temple is also\n\nestablished. This fact is also established that Hindus were\n\nworshipping Ram Janambhumi. Revenue records also show entry of\n\nJanambhumi, which was not objected by the parties at any point of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">                                 179</span>\n\ntime. The first revenue record also refers the place as Janambhumi,\n\nprobably for the reason that     Britishers after investigation and\n\nresearch work of P. Carnegy were satisfied that the place of birth of\n\nLord Ram is site of Babri mosque. William Finch and others also\n\ncorroborated the version that Hindus were worshipping the site as\n\nRam Janambhumi. Version of William Finch is more acceptable for\n\nthe reason that according to Muslims the mosque was constructed in\n\nthe year 1528 while William Finch visited Ayodhya in the early 17th\n\ncentury, that is, about 70 years after the demolition of the temple.\n\nThus, his information and description about the place was based on\n\ncorrect appreciation of facts and on the basis of information based\n\non faith and belief of Hindus, P. Carnegy also acknowledged the\n\nwork of William Finch and others .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_283\">      On the basis of the statements of parties it further transpires\n\nthat there is no dispute between the parties that Lord Ram took\n\nbirth at Ayodhya. The only dispute is with regard to birth spot. The\n\nparties admit the existence of Ram Kot ,i.e. fort of Lord Ram. There\n\nis overwhelming evidence that after the destruction of old temple\n\ncelebration of Ram Naumi was going on at Ayodhya. Even in those\n\ndays five lakh people used to assemble to celebrate the festival of\n\nRam Naumi. Thus, the circumstantial evidence available on record\n\nfully corroborate the report of the ASI and if read in the light of\n\nhistorical account given by William Finch and others leaves no\n\nroom for doubt that Janambhumi was worshipped along with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                                  180</span>\n\nCharan Paduka and Sita Rasoi by Hindus. I may further clarify that\n\naccording to Hindus place of worship may be deemed to be a deity\n\nitself with or without any idol. Ritually among Hindus this is\n\nconsidered as a deity     at other religious place like    Gangotri,\n\nYamnotri,Gaya, Kedar Nath Amaranath etc. Even at Jagannathpuri\n\nthe deities are changed after    12 years. Even then the place is\n\nworshipped like a deity. Thus, without any form or shape the place\n\ncan also be worshipped without idols. The deities were installed in\n\nthe inner courtyard on 22/23.12.1949. They are being\n\nworshipped by devotees. Thus, the Hindus are worshipping the\n\nplace in dispute as Ram Janambhumi as a sacred place of\n\npilgrims from time immemorial and idols were also worshipped,\n\nfirstly at Ram Chabutra and thereafter idols were shifted on\n\n22/23. 12.1949 at birth spot of Lord Rama inside the disputed\n\nstructure. Thus from Hindu side overwhelming evidence has been\n\nproduced to establish that the property in suit is site of Janambhumi\n\nof Lord Ram. It is also established from record that idols and\n\nobjects of worship were placed inside the disputed building in the\n\nnight intervening 22/23-12.1949. Hindus in general and defendants\n\nin particular were worshipping     Charan Paduka, Sita Rasoi and\n\nother idols even after the construction of Babri mosque in the outer\n\ncourtyard. Hindus were worshipping the place in dispute as a sacred\n\nplace of birth of Lord Rama in the inner courtyard from times\n\nimmemorial.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">                                  181</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_284\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_285\">      Hindus have proved the existence of temple construed in 12 th\n\ncentury at the site of Ram Janambhumi. They have also proved\n\ntheir belief that the place was worshipped like a deity and further\n\nproved the fact that after demolition of the temple the mosque was\n\nconstructed after re-using material and broken part of the temple\n\nand the deities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\">           Lastly, against the tenets of Islam, no mosque can be\n\nconstructed after demolishing a temple. Further according to the\n\nMuslims, inside the mosque there cannot be two spots of worship,\n\none for Hindus and another for Muslims. Thus, temple and mosque\n\ncannot co-exist at the disputed spot. Accordingly it is established\n\nthat even prior to the destruction of Hindu temple which was\n\nconstructed in 12th century, no mosque can come into existence\n\nagainst the tenets of Islam at the site of birth place of Lord Ram.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_287\">      It     is manifestly established by public record, gazetteers,\n\nhistory accounts and oral evidence that the premises, in dispute, is\n\nthe place where Lord Ram was born as son of Emperor Dashrath of\n\nsolar dynasty. According to the traditions and faith of devotees of\n\nLord Ram, the place where He manifested Himself has ever been\n\ncalled as Sri Ram Janmbhumi by all and sundry through ages. Thus,\n\nthe Asthan, Ram Janambhumi has been an object of worship as a\n\ndeity by the devotees of Lord Ram as it personifies the spirit of\n\ndivine worshipped in the form of Ram Lala or Lord Ram, the child.\n\nRam Janmbhumi is also a deity and a juridical person. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                                 182</span>\n\nestablished from evidence that the Hindus worship the divine place\n\nin the form of God. The Hindus can mediate upon the formless and\n\nshapeless divine. The spirit of Divine is indestructible. Birth place\n\nis   sacred place for Hindus and Lord Ram, who is said to be\n\nincarnation of God, was born at this place. The Hindus since times\n\nimmemorial and for many generations constantly hold in great\n\nesteem and reverence the Ram Janmbhumi where they believe that\n\nLord Ram was born. It is established by tradition and classical legal\n\nliterature relating to the Hindus and according to their belief and\n\nfaith that the place is regarded as a deity. This place, according to\n\nHindu religion, is symbol and embodiment of spiritual purpose and\n\nthe property is dedicated and vested with the Asthan, Janmbhumi.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39110328\" id=\"span_242\">This place being worshipped as idol from times immemorial and\n\ndedicated property vests in idol as juristic person. Thus, the place\n\naccording to the Smirit have to be considered as a deity like Agni\n\nand Vayu being worshipped. They are shapeless and formless but\n\nthey attain the divinity.

It has been contended that a mosque enjoys a\n      particular position in Muslim Law and once a mosque\n      is established and prayers are offered in such a\n      mosque, the same remains for all time to come a\n      property of Allah and the same never reverts back to\n      the donor or founder of the mosque and any person\n      professing Islamic faith can offer prayer in such a\n      mosque and even if the structure is demolished, the\n      place remains the same where the namaz can be\n      offered. As indicated hereinbefore, in British India, no\n      such protection was given to a mosque and the mosque\n      was subjected to the provisions of statute of limitation\n      thereby extinguishing the right of Muslims to offer\n      prayers in a particular mosque lost by adverse\n      possession over that property.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">      81. <a href=\"/doc/98778199/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 3(26)</a> of the General Clauses Act\n      comprehends the categories of properties known to\n      Indian Law. <a href=\"/doc/579323/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 367</a> of the Constitution adopts\n           this secular concept of property for purposes of\n      our Constitution. A temple, church or mosque etc. are\n      essentially immovable properties and subject to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">                     191</span>\n\nprotection under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_205\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_206\">26.</a> Every immovable\nproperty is liable to be acquired. Viewed in the proper\nperspective, a mosque does not enjoy any additional\nprotection which is not available to religious places of\nworship of other religions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035515\" id=\"span_264\">82. The correct position may be summarised thus.\nUnder the Mahomedan Law applicable in India, title to\na mosque can be lost by adverse possession (See\nMulla&#x27;s Principles of Mahomedan Law, 19th Edn., by\nM. Hidayatullah -- Section 217; and <a href=\"/doc/1035515/\" id=\"a_207\">Shahid Ganj v.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">                      3</span>\nShiromani Gurdwara</a> 13). If that is the position in law,\nthere can be no reason to hold that a mosque has a\nunique or special status, higher than that of the places\nof worship of other religions in secular India to make it\nimmune from acquisition by exercise of the sovereign\nor prerogative power of the State. A mosque is not an\nessential part of the practice of the religion of Islam\nand namaz (prayer) by Muslims can be offered\nanywhere, even in open. Accordingly, its acquisition is\nnot prohibited by the provisions in the Constitution of\nIndia. Irrespective of the status of a mosque in an\nIslamic country for the purpose of immunity from\nacquisition by the State in exercise of the sovereign\npower, its status and immunity from acquisition in the\nsecular ethos of India under the Constitution is the\nsame and equal to that of the places of worship of the\nother religions, namely, church, temple etc. It is neither\nmore nor less than that of the places of worship of the\nother religions. Obviously, the acquisition of any\nreligious place is to be made only in unusual and\nextraordinary situations for a larger national purpose\nkeeping in view that such acquisition should not result\nin extinction of the right to practise the religion, if the\nsignificance of that place be such. Subject to this\ncondition, the power of acquisition is available for a\nmosque like any other place of worship of any religion.\nThe right to worship is not at any and every place, so\nlong as it can be practised effectively, unless the right\nto worship at a particular place is itself an integral part\nof that right.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">Maintainability of the Reference\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">83. In the view that we have taken on the question of\nvalidity of the statute (Act No. 33 of 1993) and as a\nresult of upholding the validity of the entire statute,\nexcept <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 4(3)</a> thereof, resulting in revival of the\npending suits and legal proceedings wherein the\ndispute between the parties has to be adjudicated, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_266\">                    192</span>\n\nReference made under <a href=\"/doc/4015076/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 143(1)</a> becomes\nsuperfluous and unnecessary. For this reason, it is\nunnecessary for us to examine the merits of the\nsubmissions made on the maintainability of this\nReference. We, accordingly, very respectfully decline\nto answer the Reference and return the same.\n\nResult\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">84. The result is that all the pending suits and legal\nproceedings stand revived, and they shall be proceeded\nwith, and decided, in accordance with           law. It\nfollows further as a result of the remaining enactment\nbeing upheld as valid that the disputed area has vested\nin the Central Government as a statutory receiver with\na duty to manage and administer it in the manner\nprovided in the Act maintaining status quo therein by\nvirtue of the freeze enacted in <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 7(2)</a>; and the\nCentral Government would exercise its power of\nvesting that property further in another authority or\nbody or trust in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 8(1)</a> of the\nAct in terms of the final adjudication in the pending\nsuits. The power of the courts in the pending legal\nproceedings to give directions to the Central\nGovernment as a statutory receiver would be\ncircumscribed and limited to the extent of the area left\nopen by the provisions of the Act. The Central\nGovernment would be bound to take all necessary\nsteps to implement the decision in the suits and other\nlegal proceedings and to hand over the disputed area to\nthe party found entitled to the same on the final\nadjudication made in the suits. The parties to the suits\nwould be entitled to amend their pleadings suitably in\nthe light of our decision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">85. Before we end, we would like to indicate the\nconsequence if the entire Act had been held to be\ninvalid and then we had declined to answer the\nReference on that conclusion. It would then result in\nrevival of the abated suits along with all the interim\norders made therein. It would also then result\nautomatically in revival of the worship of the idols by\nHindu devotees, which too has been stopped from\nDecember 1992 with all its ramifications without\ngranting any benefit to the Muslim community whose\npractice of worship in the mosque (demolished on 6-\n12-1992) had come to a stop, for whatever reason,\nsince at least December 1949. This situation, unless\naltered subsequently by any court order in the revived\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">                              193</span>\n\n         suits, would, therefore, continue during the pendency\n         of the litigation. This result could be no solace to the\n         Muslims whose feelings of hurt as a result of the\n         demolition of mosque, must be assuaged in the manner\n         best possible without giving cause for any legitimate\n         grievance to the other community leading to the\n         possibility of reigniting communal passions\n         detrimental to the spirit of communal harmony in a\n         secular State.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">         86. The best solution in the circumstances, on revival\n         of suits is, therefore, to maintain status quo as on 7-1-\n         1993 when the law came into force modifying the\n         interim orders in the suits to that extent by curtailing\n         the practice of worship by Hindus in the disputed area\n         to the extent it stands reduced under the Act instead of\n         conferring on them the larger right available under the\n         court orders till intervention was made by legislation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">         87. <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 7(2)</a> achieves this purpose by freezing the\n         interim arrangement for worship by Hindu devotees\n         reduced to this extent and curtails the larger right they\n         enjoyed under the court orders, ensuring that it cannot\n         be enlarged till final adjudication of the dispute and\n         consequent transfer of the disputed area to the party\n         found entitled to the same. This being the purpose and\n         true effect of <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 7(2)</a>, it promotes and strengthens\n         the commitment of the nation to secularism instead of\n         negating it. To hold this provision as anti-secular and\n         slanted in favour of the Hindu community           would\n         be to frustrate an attempt to thwart anti-secularism and\n         unwittingly support the forces which were responsible\n         for the events of 6-12-1992.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_301\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"76728840\" id=\"span_268\">4.

A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                   197</span>\n\nof beliefs and doctrine which are regarded by those\nwho profess religion to be conducive to their\nspiritual well-being. A religion is not merely an\nopinion, doctrine or belief. It has outward expression\nin acts as well. It is not every aspect of religion that\nhas been safeguarded by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_221\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_222\">26</a> nor has\nthe Constitution provided that every religious\nactivity cannot be interfered with. Religion,\ntherefore, be construed in the context of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_223\">Articles 25</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_224\">26</a> in its strict and etymological sense. Every\nreligion must believe in a conscience and ethical and\nmoral precepts. Therefore, whatever binds a man to\nhis own conscience and whatever moral or ethical\nprinciple regulate the lives of men believing in that\ntheistic, conscience or religious belief that alone can\nconstitute religion as understood in the Constitution\nwhich fosters feeling of brotherhood, amenity,\nfraternity and equality of all persons which find their\nfoot-hold in secular aspect of the Constitution.\nSecular activities and aspects do not constitute\nreligion which brings under its own cloak every\nhuman activity. There is nothing which a man can\ndo, whether in the way of wearing clothes or food or\ndrink, which is not considered a religious activity.\nEvery mundane or human activity was not intended\nto be protected by the Constitution under the guise\nof religion. The approach to construe the protection\nof religion or matters of religion or religious\npractices guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_225\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_226\">26</a> must be\nviewed with pragmatism since by the very nature of\nthings, it would be extremely difficult, if not\nimpossible, to define the expression religion of\nmatters or religion or religious belief or practice.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">90. In pluralistic society like India, as stated earlier,\nthere are numerous religious groups who practise\ndiverse forms of worship or practise religions,\nrituals, rites etc, even among Hindus, different\ndenominates and sects residing within the country or\nabroad profess different religious faiths, beliefs,\npractices. They seek to identify religion with what\nmay in substance be mere facets of religion. It\nwould, therefore, be difficult to devise a definition of\nreligion which would be regarded as applicable to all\nreligions or matters of religious practices. To one\nclass of persons a mere dogma or precept or a\ndoctrine may be pre-dominant in the matter of\nreligion; to others, rituals or ceremonies may be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                   198</span>\n\npredominant facets of religion; and to yet another\nclass of persons a code of conduct or a mode of life\nmay constitute religion. Even to different persons\nprofessing the same religious faith some of the facets\nof religion may have varying significance. It may\nnot be possible, therefore, to devise a precise\ndefinition of universal application as to what is\nreligion and what are matters of religious belief or\nreligious practice. That is far from saying that it is\nnot possible to State with reasonable certainty the\nlimits within which the Constitution conferred a\nright to profess religion. Therefore, the right to\nreligion guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 25</a> or 26 is not an\nabsolute or unfettered right to propagating religion\nwhich is subject to legislation by the State limiting\nor regulating any activity - economic, financial,\npolitical or secular which are associated with\nreligious belief, faith, practice or custom. They are\nsubject to reform on social welfare by appropriate\nlegislation by the State. Though religious practices\nand performances of acts pursuance of religious\nbelief are as much a part of religion as faith or belief\nin a particular doctrine, that by itself is not\nconclusive or decisive. What are essential parts of\nreligion or religious belief or matters of religion and\nreligious practice is essentially a question of fact to\nbe considered in the context in which the question\nhas arisen and the evidence - factual or legislative or\nhistoric - presented in that context is required to be\nconsidered and a decision reached.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">93. The religious freedom guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_228\">Articles 25</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_229\">26</a>, therefore, is intended to be a guide to a\ncommunity-life and ordain every religion to act\naccording to its cultural and social demands to\nestablish an egalitarian social order. <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_230\">Articles 25</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_231\">26</a>, therefore, strike a balance between the rigidity of\nright to religious belief and faith and their intrinsic\nrestrictions in matters of religion, religious beliefs\nand religious practices and guaranteed freedom of\nconscience to commune with his Cosmos, Creator\nand realise his spiritual self. Sometimes, practices\nreligious or secular, are intricably mixed up. This is\nmore particularly so in regard to Hindu religion\nbecause under the provisions of ancient Samriti,\nhuman actions from birth to death and most of the\nindividual actions from day to day are regarded as\nreligious in character in one facet or the other. They\nsometimes claim the religious system or sanctuary\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                   199</span>\n\nand seek the cloak of constitutional protection\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_232\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_233\">26.</a> One, hinges upon\nconstitutional religious model and another\ndiametrically more on traditional point of view. The\nlegitimacy of the true categories is required to be\nadjudged strictly within the parameters of the right\nof the individual and the legitimacy of the State for\nsocial progress, well-being and reforms, social\nintensification and national unity. Law is a social\nengineering and an instrument of social change\nevolved by a gradual and continuous process. As\nBanjamin Cardozo has put it in his &quot;Judicial\nProcess,&quot; life is not a logic but experience. History\nand customs, utility and the accepted standards of\nright conduct are the forms which singly or in\ncombination shall be the progress of law. Which of\nthese forces shall dominate in any case depends\nlargely upon the comparative importance or value of\nthe social interest that will be, thereby, impaired.\nThere shall be symmetrical development with\nhistory or custom when history or custom has been\nthe motive force or the chief one in giving shape to\nthe existing rules and with logic or philosophy when\nthe motive power has been theirs. One must get the\nknowledge just as the legislature gets it from\nexperience and study and reflection in proof from\nlife itself. All secular activities which may be\nassociated with religion but which do not relate or\nconstitute an essential part of it may be amenable to\nState regulations but what constitutes the essential\npart of religion may be ascertained primarily from\nthe doctrines of that religion itself according to its\ntenets, historical background and change in evolved\nprocess etc. The concept of essentially is not itself a\ndeterminative factor. It is one of the circumstances to\nbe considered in adjudging whether the particular\nmatters of religion or religious practices or belief are\nan integral part of the religion.

The\n          English language having had no parallel word to\n          dharma, the word religion was used in these two\n          articles. it is a different matter that the word dharma\n          has now been accepted even in English language, as\n          would appear from Webster&#x27;s New Collegiate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                   201</span>\n\nDictionary which has defined it to mean : Dharma :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">n (Skt. fr. dharayati he holds:) akin to L firmus\nfirm : custom or law regarded as duty : he basic\nprinciples of cosmic or individual existence : nature :\nconformity to one&#x27;s duty and nature&quot;.

Some critics say that\nReligion interfered with Science and Faith. They say\nthat religion led to the growth of blind faith, magic,\nsorcery, human sacrifices etc. No doubt, history of\nreligion shows some indications in this direction but\nboth Science and Religion believe in faith. Faith in\nReligion influences the temperament and attitude of\nthe thinker. Ancient civilization viz., the Indus\nValley Civilization shows faith of people in Siva and\nSakthi. The period of Indus Valley Civilization was\nfundamental religion and was as old as at least\nEgyptian and Mesopotamian Culture. People\nworship Siva and the Trishul (Trident), the emblem\nof Siva which was engraved on several seals. People\nalso worshipped stones, trees, animals and Fire.\nBesides, worship of stones, trees, animals etc. by the\nprimitive religious tribes shows that animism viz.,\nworship of trees, stones, animals was practiced on\nthe strong belief that they were abodes of spirits,\ngood or evil. Modern Hinduism is to some extent\nincludes Indus Valley Civilization Culture and\nreligious faith. Lord Siva is worshipped in the form\nof Linga. Many symbols have been used in Hindu\nLiterature. Different kinds of symbols and images\nhave different sanctity. Brading of chest, arms and\nother parts of body represent to the weapons of\nsymbols of Siva.

No doubt, this right\nis subject to public order related to health and\nmorality and other provisions relating to\nFundamental Right. Religion includes worship, faith\nand extends to even rituals.

While <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_288\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_289\">26</a> granted\n              religious freedom to minority religions like Islam,\n              Christianity and Judaism, they do not intend to deny\n              the same guarantee to Hindus. Therefore, protection\n              under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_290\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_291\">26</a> is available to the people\n              professing Hindu religion subject to the law therein.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_334\">              The right to establish a religious and charitable\n              institution is a part of religious belief or faith and,\n              though law made under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 25</a> may\n              impose restrictions on the exercise of that right, the\n              right to administer and maintain such institution\n              cannot altogether be taken away and vested in other\n              party; more particularly, in the officers of a secular\n              Government. The administration of religious\n              institution or endowment or specific endowment\n              being a secular activity, it is not an essential part of\n              religion and, therefore, the legislature is competent\n              to enact law, as in <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_293\">Part III of the Act</a>, regulating the\n              administration and governance of the religious or\n              charitable institutions       or endowment. They are\n              not part of religious practices or customs. The State\n              does not directly undertake their administration and\n              expend any public money for maintenance and\n              governance thereof. Law regulates appropriately for\n              efficient management or administration or\n              governance of charitable and Hindu religious\n              institutions or endowments or specific endowments,\n              through its officers or officers appointed under the\n              Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_335\">              27. The question then is whether legislative\n              declaration of the need for maintenance,\n              administration and governance of all charitable and\n              Hindu religious institutions or endowments or\n              specific endowments and taking over the same and\n              vesting the management in a trustee or board of\n              trustees is valid in law. It is true, as rightly\n              contended by Shri P.P. Rao, that the legislature\n              acting on the material collected by Justice Challa\n              Kondaiah Commission amended and repealed the\n              predecessor Act of 1966 and brought the Act on\n              statute. <a href=\"/doc/430855/\" id=\"a_294\">Section 17</a> of the predecessor Act of 1966\n              had given power to a hereditary trustee to be the\n              chairman of the board of non-hereditary trustees.\n              Though abolition of hereditary right in trusteeship\n              under <a href=\"/doc/1073892/\" id=\"a_295\">Section 16</a> has already been upheld, the\n              charitable and religious institution or endowment\n              owes its existence to the founder or members of the\n              family who would resultantly evince greater and\n              keener responsibility and interest in its proper and\n              efficient management and governance. The\n              autonomy in this behalf is an assurance to achieve\n              due fulfilment of the objective with which it was\n              founded unless, in due course, foul in its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                                     219</span>\n\n                  management is proved. Therefore, so long as it is\n                  properly and efficiently managed, he is entitled to\n                  due freedom of management in terms of the deed of\n                  endowment or established practice or usage. In case\n                  a board of trustees is constituted, the right to preside\n                  over the board given to the founder or any member\n                  of his family would generate feelings to actively\n                  participate, not only as a true representative of the\n                  source, but the same would also generate greater\n                  influence in proper and efficient management of the\n                  charitable or religious institution or endowment.\n                  Equally, it enables him to persuade other members to\n                  follow the principles, practices, tenets, customs and\n                  sampradayams of the founder of the charitable or\n                  religious institution or endowment or specific\n                  endowment. Mere membership along with others,\n                  many a times, may diminish the personality of the\n                  member of the family. Even in case some funds are\n                  needed for repairs, improvement, expansion etc., the\n                  board headed by the founder or his family member\n                  may raise funds from the public to do the needful,\n                  while the executive officer, being a government\n                  servant, would be handicapped or in some cases may\n                  not even show interest or inclination in that behalf.\n                  With a view, therefore, to effectuate the object of the\n                  religious or charitable institution or endowment or\n                  specific endowment and to encourage establishment\n                  of such institutions in future, making the founder or\n                  in his absence a member of his family to be a\n                  chairperson and to accord him major say in the\n                  management and governance would be salutary and\n                  effective. The founder or a member of his family\n                  would, thereby, enable to effectuate the proper,\n                  efficient and effective management and governance\n                  of charitable or religious institution or endowments\n                  or specific endowment thereof in future. It would\n                  add incentive to establish similar institutions.\n         Thus, in view of my findings on issues<a href=\"/doc/1494202/\" id=\"a_296\">, <a href=\"/doc/1494202/\" id=\"a_297\">referred to above</a></a>,\n\nplaintiffs are not entitled for the relief claimed and the suit is liable\n\nto be dismissed, but defendants have failed to point out the\n\ncircumstances under which they are entitled for special costs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_336\">                      Order\n\n         The suit is dismissed but the parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_337\">\nTripathi/Tanveer\nAkhilesh/Raghvendra\n </p>","numcites":97,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Allahabad High Court","citetid":480560,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"tagore v tagore","formInput":"tagore%20v%20tagore"},{"value":"superstition","formInput":"superstition"},{"value":"juristic person","formInput":"juristic%20person"},{"value":"judicial notice ","formInput":"judicial%20notice%20"},{"value":"\"legal person\"","formInput":"%22legal%20person%22"},{"value":"indian evidence act","formInput":"indian%20evidence%20act"},{"value":"religious practices","formInput":"religious%20practices"},{"value":"customary rites","formInput":"customary%20rites"},{"value":"religion","formInput":"religion"},{"value":"place of  birth","formInput":"place%20of%20%20birth"},{"value":"secularism","formInput":"secularism"},{"value":"religious place","formInput":"religious%20place"},{"value":"shebait","formInput":"shebait"},{"value":"deity","formInput":"deity"},{"value":"mutt","formInput":"mutt"},{"value":"dedication of property","formInput":"dedication%20of%20property"},{"value":"temple","formInput":"temple"},{"value":"any religious trust","formInput":"any%20religious%20trust"},{"value":"hindu idol ","formInput":"hindu%20idol%20"},{"value":"  idol worship","formInput":"%20%20idol%20worship"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
