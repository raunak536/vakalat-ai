The stand of\n\nthe borrowers was to the effect that publication of\n\nphotograph(s) of the defaulting borrower(s)/guarantor(s)\n\nas a measure for recovery of loans has no legislative\n\nsanction,   therefore,   the   secured   creditors   must     be\n\nrestrained from proceeding in that direction. According to\n\nthem, the proposed act to publish photographs, names\n\nand addresses of the defaulting borrowers is a coercive\n\nstep and it would fall within the meaning of mischief as\n\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/894399/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 15</a> of the Contract Act 1872. They\n further   contend   that    proposed   action   attracts   the\n\ndefinition of &quot;defamation&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">    So far as the stand of the respondent Bank/Appellant\n\nwas that once the debtor defaulted in repayment of\n\namounts borrowed by him, the consequence is, loan\n\naccount being treated as non-performing assets (generally\n\nknown as NPA). According to them the expression &#x27;public\n\ngood&#x27; and &#x27;public interest&#x27; as defined in the dictionaries\n\nwould mean that an authority can act for public\n\ngood/public interest for good reasons by publication of\n\nphotographs, names and addresses of the defaulting\n\nborrower(s)/guarantor(s).     According   to    the   secured\n\ncreditor, subsequent to taking over of the Imperial Bank\n\nof India by the Government, it is re-named as State Bank\n\nof India. Since Reserve Bank of India acquired substantial\n\nholding of shares, it is nothing but emergence of public\n\nownership in the field of commercial Banks. The objective\n\nbehind nationalization of Banks would clearly indicate, it\n was with the intention to serve better the needs of\n\ndevelopment of the economy. Therefore, if NPAs become\n\nmore and more there would be frustration and the very\n\nobjectivity of nationalization of Banks is lost.\n\nThey further contended that after observation of the Apex\n\nCourt in AIR 2007 SCC 712 that non-performing asset\n\nbeing a cost to the economy, it became an obligation on\n\nthe part of public sector banks to formulate different\n\npossible legal means and the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_4\">SARFAESI&#x27; Act</a> is one of\n\nsuch mechanism. Therefore, the effective and quicker\n\nprocedure under the act for recovery of dues of the\n\nsecured creditor, once borrowers account has been\n\nclassified as non-performing asset has to be looked from\n\nan angle of public faith, public good and public interest.\n\nThe proposal to publish photographs according to them\n\nwas only to alert public so that they can refrain from\n\nextending credit facilities to such defaulting borrowers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"163797995\" id=\"span_1\">The appellant Bank placed reliance on AIR 2007\n\nMadhya Pradesh 45 (<a href=\"/doc/163797995/\" id=\"a_5\">Kumari Archana Chauhan Vs.\n\nState Bank of India</a>) and so also 2007 136 Company\n\nCases 568 (Madrass) in the case of K.J.

One is required to follow the\n\nprocedure if such procedure is envisaged.

Apparently, there is no\n\nmentioning       of    publication      of     photographs            of\n\nborrowers/guarantors        along    with    the        publication   of\n\nnames, assets etc.\n\nReading of the aforesaid Rule indicates no positive\n\nprohibition regarding publication of photographs of the\n\ndefaulters. However, while publishing notice under Sub-\n\nRule 1 of Rule 8 regarding possession of property,\n\ncertainly   it   has   to   be   published         in     two   leading\n\nnewspapers, one in vernacular language having sufficient\n\ncirculation in that locality. Subsequent provisions refer to\n\nwhat is the procedure to be complied with in the event of\n\ntaking possession of the property, whether to keep in the\n\ncustody of the authorized officer or anyone appointed by\n him, after obtaining valuation of the property etc. It also\n\nstates, notice of sale shall be affixed on a conspicuous\n\npart of the immovable property which not only cautions\n\nthe borrower the consequences of such notice but also\n\nalerts public if public has interest in acquiring such\n\nproperty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"765187\" id=\"span_2\">The intention and purpose of such Rule, is the Bank\n\ncan publish the names of the defaulters by giving their\n\nnames and addresses to make public aware of details of\n\nthe defaulters thereby cautioning prospective buyers that\n\nthe property is not only secured to the Bank but the\n\nborrowers have become defaulters.        There can be an\n\nargument that a borrower himself can arrange purchaser\n\nfor the secured property without adhering to the above\n\nprocedure but it may amount to violation of the conditions\n\nof mortgage or the contract between the borrower and the\n\ncreditor Bank if the creditor Bank objects. If creditor Bank\n has no objection for the sale of property through\n\ndefaulter/borrower, it is altogether a different situation.\n\nMany a time the creation of equitable mortgage by\n\ndeposit of title deeds do not get reflected in the\n\nencumbrance certificate obtained from the Sub-Registrar&#x27;s\n\nOffice unless such mortgage is followed by a registered\n\nmemoranda. This may lead to serious consequences i.e.\n\ninnocent public believing that the property is not\n\nencumbered may acquire interest in such property by\n\nparting with their money. In order to overcome difficulties\n\nof delay in realizing dues, through a long process of\n\nlitigation in the Courts, the Securitization Act has come\n\ninto force which has the approval of highest Court of the\n\nland.   It would be apt to refer to <a href=\"/doc/765187/\" id=\"a_8\">V.T. Khandoze Vs.\n\nReserve Bank of India</a> (1982 (2) Supreme Court Cases</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">7), where it was held Central Board of Directors of the\n\nReserve Bank are empowered to make regulations in order\n\nto provide for all matters for which provision is necessary\n or convenient for the purpose of giving effect to the\n\nprovisions of the Act. Reference was made to Attorney-\n\nGeneral Vs. Great Eastern Rly. Co. (1880 (5) ACT 473\n\n(HL) ) in the above case wherein        it was held that\n\nwhatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or\n\nconsequential upon, those things which the legislature\n\nhas authorized ought not to be held            by judicial\n\nconstruction as ultra vires (unless expressly prohibited)\n\ncould be laid down as procedure. One has to see whether\n\nthere is express legal bar either in the statute or rules\n\nthereunder or any other guidelines, directions or norms\n\nwhich expressly prohibit the Bank from publication of\n\nphotograph.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">So far as dues to the Bank, the entitlement of the creditor\n\nBank is, they are entitled to file a suit or initiate\n\nproceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_9\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a> for realization\n\nof its dues.   They can also resort to other proceedings\n\nunder the respective statutes of the State for recovery of\n dues as revenue dues.        The notice contemplated under\n\nRule 8 of the <a href=\"/doc/190229/\" id=\"a_10\">Security Act</a> as stated above is not only\n\nintended to notify the details of the property secured but\n\nalso to caution the public from entering into any kind of\n\ntransaction with the defaulters in respect of the property\n\nnotified. Of course this would also be a precaution to\n\navoid multiplicity of legal battles if third party interest is\n\ncreated by the defaulters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">Definitely Court has to see the right of the defaulter so far\n\nas his privacy, that is whether the creditor Bank can\n\nresort to any course of action as it chooses only with the\n\nsole purpose of recovering its dues.       There has to be\n\nreasonableness in the said        purpose in resorting to a\n\nparticular course of action. It cannot be done recklessly\n\nor in a manner which would prejudice privacy rights of\n\nthe individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\"><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution envisages and protects the\n\ninterest of citizens of this country by which he has right to\n live with dignity. By mere default of repayment of loan\n\nwhich may not be on account of intentional default but on\n\naccount of various reasons which may be beyond the\n\ncontrol of the default/borrower, accounts of the borrowers\n\ncan become non-performing as per the guidelines of the\n\nRBI or respective Banks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">So far as guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),\n\nthey have to be followed by every Banking Company. We\n\nhave to see whether there is approval of Reserve Bank of\n\nIndia to resort to this procedure of publishing photograph\n\nof the defaulters/guarantors before resorting to further\n\ncourse of action by the secured creditor/Bank for recovery\n\nof its dues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\"> Reserve Bank of India by a master circular (DBOD No.\n\nCID.BC 10/20.16.003/2012-13 dated 02.07.2012) has\n\nnotified all the scheduled/commercial Banks with regard\n\nto the procedure to be followed against willful defaulters\n\nand the penal measures to be adopted in the course of\n realization of the dues.    This provides for reporting the\n\ndetails of accounts of willful defaulters to the Reserve\n\nBank of India as also the Credit Information Companies.\n\nThe Credit Information Companies are like the Credit\n\nInformation Bureau (India) Ltd. and (CIBIL) have been\n\nregistered   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/946659/\" id=\"a_12\">Credit   Information   Companies\n\n(Regulation) Act</a> of 2005. As per this provision the Credit\n\nInformation Companies have to disseminate information\n\npertaining to the account of willful defaulters and the\n\nrecovery steps initiated on their respective websites. This\n\nis only with a purpose to enable any Bank to log on into\n\nthe website of credit Information Companies to verify the\n\nreputation and credential of the prospective borrower who\n\nintends to apply for fresh loan on the security of the\n\nproperty already secured to another Bank or financial\n\ninstitution. Such circulars are issued by RBI by virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1612073/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 21(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/587034/\" id=\"a_14\">35-A</a> of the Banking Regulation Act,\n\n1949.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\"> One   cannot    ignore     the    duty    of   Banks/Financial\n\nCompanies to disclose necessary information to the public\n\nabout the borrower if such information has effect of\n\ncreating economical imbalance. Right of privacy no doubt\n\nis an essential component of right to live with dignity as\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> as a Fundamental Right. This\n\nRight of privacy however cannot be absolute but can be\n\nlawfully   restricted    for     the   prevention   of   crime,\n\nsafeguarding the interest of innocent people, disorder or\n\nprotection of health or morals or protection of rights and\n\nfreedom of others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"251249\" id=\"span_3\">The above mentioned circular positively does not empower\n\nthe Bank/financial institutions to publish photographs of\n\nborrowers/guarantors in newspapers though are entitled\n\nto provide information in the website of Credit Information\n\nCompanies. One cannot close eyes to the other side of the\n\nproblem.    Such        publication      of    photographs   if\n\nborrower/guarantor does not come under the category of\n a person who is not an intentional/willful defaulter by\n\ncommitting certain acts of dishonest like siphoning of\n\nstocks hypothecated to Bank or siphoning of funds\n\ntowards other purpose other than for which it was lent,\n\nmay lead to disastrous, consequences by disturbing his\n\nmind leading to psychological problems because of stigma\n\nor taboo not only upon the borrower but also entire family\n\nfor years to come. One has to balance the situation and\n\nact depending upon the factual situation.\n\nSo far as above controversy several High Courts have\n\ngiven different opinions.

The Assistant General Manager State\n\nBank of India</a> opined that interest of Bank requiring\n\ndisclosure of information supersedes duty of secrecy\n\nbecause once a matter becomes public record and it\n\nbecomes legitimate object of covenant and Right of privacy\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> is not an absolute Right or inviolable\n\nRight. It was further opined that Banks are entitled to\n invent novel methods to recover dues if borrower finds\n\nnew method to avoid repayment of loans. This definitely\n\nindicates that under special circumstances where the\n\nborrower invents new methods to evade or avoid payment\n\nthe Bank can also resort to new methods of recovery.\n\nTherefore, Madras High Court opined, there is no violation\n\nof   any   Right   or   legal   proposition   by   publishing\n\nphotographs of the borrower.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">In Kumari Archana Chauhan Vs. State Bank of India\n\nJablpur AIR 2007 MP 45, Madhya Pradesh High Court\n\nOpined that publication of photographs of borrowers\n\ncannot be said to be impermissible and held that the said\n\naction was neither arbitrary nor illegal in any manner.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"176333521\" id=\"span_4\">In ILR 2013 (3) Kerala 638 (<a href=\"/doc/176333521/\" id=\"a_18\">Venu Vs. State Bank of\n\nIndia</a>) notice was issued by Banks calling upon the\n\nborrower to make payment due to the Bank failing which\n\nthe Bank expressed intention to publish photographs of\n\nborrowers with names and address. This was challenged\n and the High Court opined that there is nothing immoral\n\nin being unable to pay the loans availed of owing to the\n\nfloundering of business or due to some other unavoidable\n\nreason which cannot enable the Bank to infringe the Right\n\nto privacy of loanees. It further opined that unless there is\n\ncompelling public interest to publish photographs of the\n\nborrowers in newspapers exist, it cannot be resorted to in\n\nevery default case since routine procedure to publish\n\nphotographs of every other defaulter may affect Right of\n\nprivacy of an individual.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">The High Court of judicature of Bombay had occasion to\n\ndeal on this subject and the unreported decision in\n\nW.P.2808 of 2013 in D.J. Exim (India) Private Limited\n\nand others Vs. State Bank of India and others is placed\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">In this case writ petitioners sought quashing of letter\n\ndated   10.10.2013    issued   by   the   respondent   Bank\n\nintimating the borrowers the intention of the Bank to\n publish the photographs of the petitioner. The stand of\n\nthe Bank was the Board of the Bank took a decision\n\nregarding publication of photograph only on conclusion\n\nand satisfaction that the material placed before it\n\nindicated that the borrower had committed various acts of\n\nmisfeasance and tried to divert the funds which was\n\nreceived by them. The High Court at Bombay Judicature\n\nheld there was no legal bar either in the rule or under any\n\nprovisions   of   the   Act   prohibiting   the   Bank   from\n\npublication photographs of the defaulters in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of said case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">This was challenged in special leave to appeal 37726 of\n\n2013 before the Apex Court by the borrowers. But the\n\nsame was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">It would be just and proper to refer to the opinion of the\n\nRBI who was impleaded as a party to the proceedings in\n\norder to     know its stand so far as publication of\n\nphotographs of the borrowers of the Bank. The stand of\n the Reserve Bank of India is reflected before this Court by\n\nway of affidavit. It is well established that the Reserve\n\nBank of India regulates and supervises Commercial\n\nBanks and Co-Operative Banks in the country in\n\naccordance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_19\">Banking Regulations\n\nAct</a> of 1949. It also exercises control over the volume of\n\ncredit in order to ensure economic stability. So far as the\n\npolicy it gives directions under <a href=\"/doc/171392698/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 35\n\nA </a>of the Act.    According to RBI it has not issued any\n\ndirection in exercise of its statutory powers under the\n\nabove Act on the issue of publication of names and\n\nphotographs      of     willful   defaulters/guarantors        in\n\nnewspapers    etc.      It   further   places   on   record   the\n\ncorrespondence        between the Head Office of the State\n\nBank of India and its offices situated in various parts of\n\nthe country and so also between the Reserve Bank of\n\nIndia addressed to the Chairman State Bank of India\n\nCredit Policy and Procedures Department, Mumbai as also\n opinion of Indian Bank Associations.                They have also\n\nplaced      on    record   master   circular        dated   1.7.2014\n\nconsolidated instruction/guidelines issued to all Banks\n\nand Financial Institutions till 30th June, 2014 and\n\nupdated on 7.1.2015.          Important    guidelines of 2015\n\nissued by RBI are at para 2.1.3 the definition of willful\n\ndefault.

In order to ensure that directors are correctly\n\nidentified and in no case, persons whose names appear to\n\nbe similar to the names of directors appearing in the list of\n\nwillful defaulters, are wrongfully denied credit facilities on\n\nsuch grounds, banks/Fls have been advised to include the\n\nDirector Identification Number (DIN) as one of the fields in\n\nthe   data   submitted   by    them    to   Credit   Information\n\nCompanies.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">It is reiterated that while carrying out the credit appraisal,\n\nbanks should verify as to whether the names of any of the\n\ndirectors of the companies appear in the list of defaulter\n\n/willful defaulters by way of reference to DIN/PAN etc.\n\nFurther, in case of any doubt arising on account of identical\n\nnames,   banks    should      use   independent      sources   for\n confirmation of the identity of directors rather than seeking\n\ndeclaration from the borrowing company.&quot;\n\n    From the above discussion and information it is very\n\nclear so far as the Act and the rules, there is neither\n\npositive direction nor negative indication so far as\n\npublication of photographs. Definitely rule 8 is intended to\n\nalert the public that the property is encumbered and one\n\nshould know such encumbrance if anyone intends to deal\n\nwith such property. Correspondence between the Indian\n\nBank Associations to Reserve Bank of India, and Reserve\n\nBank of India to the chairman State Bank of India Credit\n\nPolicy and Procedures Department Mumbai in 2007 and\n\nthe guidelines issued by RBI as updated on 07.01.2015\n\nclearly indicate how and under what circumstances a\n\nborrower could be categorized as a willful defaulter and\n\nhow the information has to be disseminated to the credit\n\ninformation companies. This clarifies the position that as\n\na matter of routine procedure, one should not resort to\n publication of photographs of defaulters unless and until\n\nthere are special circumstances where the borrower with\n\nmala fide intention is committing any of the Acts\n\nenvisaged in the guidelines of RBI which would categorize\n\nhim as a willful defaulter. In those circumstances the\n\nauthority can act for public good/public interest for good\n\nreasons by publication of photographs, names and\n\naddresses   of   defaulting   borrower(s)/guarantor(s).   If\n\npublication of photographs is otherwise implemented as a\n\nroutine, there is bound to be serious impact on economy\n\nbecause if a genuine borrower becomes defaulter for\n\nvarious reasons other than the reasons to treat him as\n\n&quot;willful defaulter&quot; in terms of guidelines of RBI, such\n\ngenuine defaulter would be faced with a situation where\n\nno one would come forward to assist him to come out of\n\nthe financial crisis. There should not be publication of\n\nphotograph before proceeding with further course of\n\naction under <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_24\">SARFAESI Act</a> only with a view to pressurize\n the defaulter/guarantor to repay the loan.
