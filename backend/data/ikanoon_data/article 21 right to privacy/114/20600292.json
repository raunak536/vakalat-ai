However,   the   proviso   was   applied   in   the   facts   that   were \n\n    prevailing in the said case. The facts in the said case was that the Petitioner \n            \n\n\n    Surup Singh Naik was a Minister in the State Government at the relevant time \n         \n\n\n\n    who was punished for contempt of court by the Apex Court by judgment dated \n\n    10-05-2006 and was to undergo imprisonment for one month.   It seems that \n\n\n\n\n\n    the Petitioner surrendered to the police in Mumbai on 12-05-2006.  On 14-05-\n\n    2006 the Petitioner was shifted to one of the Government Hospitals i.e. the Sir \n\n\n\n\n\n    J J Hospital on account of suspected heart problem as well as low sugar and \n\n    blood pressure. The Respondent No.5 in the said Petition who was a private \n\n    citizen had by his application dated 27-05-2006 sought information from the \n\n    CPIO of the said Sir J J Hospital of the medical reports of the Petitioner.

The CPIO did not furnish the necessary information. The Respondent \n\n\n\n\n                                                                 \n    No.5 thereafter filed an Appeal before the Respondent No.3 which also did not \n\n    meet with any success.   The Respondent No.5 therefore preferred a Second \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    Appeal   before   the   Respondent   No.2.   The   Respondent   No.2   i.e.   Second \n                                  \n    Appellate   Authority   allowed   the   Appeal   and   directed   the   information   to   be \n\n    provided   to   the   Respondent   No.5   which   order   was   challenged   before   the \n                                 \n    Division  Bench of  this Court by way of the  said Writ Petition. The Division \n\n    Bench crystallized the question that it was required to answer namely the right \n            \n\n\n    of an individual to keep certain matters confidential on the one hand and right \n         \n\n\n\n    of the public to be informed on the other considering the provisions of the said \n\n    Act.  The Division Bench observed that it was concerned with a case where a \n\n\n\n\n\n    person convicted for contempt of court, does such a person during the period \n\n    of   incarceration,   claim   privilege   or   confidentially   in   respect   of   the   medical \n\n\n\n\n\n    records maintained by a public authority.   The Division Bench considered the \n\n    issue   on   the   touchstone   of   the   proviso   and   recorded   a   finding   that   such \n\n    information normally cannot be denied to Parliament or the State Legislature \n\n    unless the person who opposes the release of the information makes out a case \n\n    that such information is not available to Parliament or the State Legislation \n\n\n    mmj                                                                                        37 of 40\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 11/06/2015 23:59:55 :::</span>\n                                                                               wp-8753-13-(reserve)\n\n    under the Act.  The Division Bench went on to observe that having regard to \n\n    the plenary powers which the legislature enjoys, such information cannot be \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                           \n    denied to Parliament or State legislature by any public authority.  The Division \n\n\n\n\n                                                                   \n    Bench   concluded   that   the   records   of   the   institution   i.e.   Sir   J   J   Group   of \n\n    Hospitals, therefore,, ought to be made available to Parliament or the State \n\n\n\n\n                                                                  \n    Legislature. The Parliament/Legislature and/or its Committees are entitled to \n\n    the records even if they be confidential or personal records of a patient.  Hence \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court was revolving around the \n                                   \n    facts in the said case, where a Minister in Office was punished for Contempt of \n\n    Court   and   was   admitted   to   a   Government   Hospital   and   was   being   treated \n                                  \n    therein   and   the   suspicion   was   that   he   had   got   himself   admitted   to   avoid \n\n    incarceration.   The said judgment, in my view, cannot be extended to mean \n            \n\n\n    that any and every information is to be provided to the Parliament or the State \n         \n\n\n\n    Legislature.  This has to be viewed in the context of the facts of Surup Singh \n\n    Naik&#x27;s case (supra) wherein the Division Bench of this Court was of the view \n\n\n\n\n\n    that the information relating to the patient Surup Singh Naik could not have \n\n    been denied to the Parliament or State Legislature. In my view, therefore, the \n\n\n\n\n\n    judgment of the Division Bench of this Court does not in any manner further \n\n    the case of the Petitioner based on the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/185912055/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the said \n\n    Act.  </p><pre id=\"pre_11\">\n\n\n\n    24             The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/185912055/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> had also come up for consideration \n\n\n    mmj                                                                                         38 of 40\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 11/06/2015 23:59:55 :::</span>\n                                                                             wp-8753-13-(reserve)\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_74\">before a Learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_107\">Vijay Prakash</a>&#x27;s case \n\n    (supra).   Before   The   Learned   Single   Judge   of   the   Delhi   High   Court   the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         \n    Judgment of the Division Bench of this Court was cited. The Learned Single \n\n\n\n\n                                                                 \n    Judge observed that he is unpersuaded by the reasoning of this Court which \n\n    appears to have given undue, even overwhelming deference to Parliamentary \n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n    privilege. The Learned Single Judge observed that were that the true position, \n\n    the enactment of <a href=\"/doc/185912055/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> would itself be rendered meaningless and the \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    basic   safeguard   bereft  of  content.   The   Learned  Judge  concluded   that   if  the \n                                  \n    proviso is to be interpreted in a manner that the Parliament has the right to \n\n    demand   any   information   then   there   would   be   nothing   left   to   the   right   to \n                                 \n    privacy which has been elevated to the status of a fundamental right by several \n\n    judgments of the Supreme Court.</span>\n</p>            \n         \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">    25            In   my   view   therefore,   the   proviso   cannot   be   sought   to   be \n\n    interpreted in the manner which the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner seeks \n\n\n\n\n\n    to do.   There is also a basic fallacy in the contention raised on behalf of the \n\n    Petitioner.   The   Petitioner   wants   to   proceed   on   the   hypothesis   that   the \n\n\n\n\n\n    information sought by him cannot be denied to the Parliament. In so far as the \n\n    Parliament is concerned, the Parliament has its own rules of business and it \n\n    therefore cannot be presumed that the information in respect of the Income \n\n    Tax Returns of a Member of Legislature  would be sought. The same  would \n\n    undoubtedly   be   in   the   discretion   of   the   Honourable   Speaker.
