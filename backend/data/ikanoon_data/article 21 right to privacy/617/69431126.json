The petitioner/husband filed H.M.O.P.No.126 of 2009 on the file of\nFamily Court, Madurai against the first respondent/wife and second respondent\nfor decree of divorce under Section 13(1) (i a) of <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_2\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>\non the ground of adultery committed by the first respondent/wife with the\nsecond respondent.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\t3. According to the petitioner, the petitioner and the first respondent\ngot married on 22.05.1988.  In the wed lock, in the year 1996, male child was\nborn and died immediately. The other two sons were born on 27.03.1997 and\n29.06.1998. The petitioner, first respondent and two sons were living\ntogether till 2008 and they are separated in the year 2009. According to the\npetitioner, the first respondent had developed illicit relationship with\nsecond respondent from the year 1992. The petitioner found out the illicit\nrelationship between the respondents and confronted. The first respondent on\n20.10.2008, admitted her illicit relationship with the second respondent. She\nalso stated that all the three sons were born only to second respondent and\ntwo sons, who are living are not the sons of petitioner. The first respondent\nleft the matrimonial home along with two sons and she is living in the house\nof her parents from the year 2009 onwards. Under these circumstances, the\npetitioner has filed the above said H.M.O.P. for a judgment and decree of\ndivorce dissolving the marriage solemnised between the petitioner and the\nfirst respondent. The petitioner filed an application in I.A.No.374 of 2011\nin the H.M.O.P. to order for D.N.A Medical test for himself, first respondent\nand two children i.e., P.K.N.Karuppasamy and P.K.N.Jeyarajan, on the same\nallegation made in the H.M.O.P. The first respondent denied all the\nallegations made by the petitioner. She specifically denied that she is\nhaving illicit relationship with second respondent. On these pleadings, the\nlearned Judge considered the issue and also judgments relied on by the\ncounsel for parties, dismissed the application for D.N.A Medical test on\n22.08.2013. Against the said order of dismissal, this Civil Revision Petition\nis filed.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel\nfor the first respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t5. Though notice was served on the second respondent and his name is\nprinted in the cause list, he has not chosen to appear either in person or\nthrough the counsel.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_1\">6. The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the first\nrespondent has admitted her illicit relationship with the second respondent;\nthe father of the first respondent also encouraged the said relationship and\nthe petitioner himself has seen the respondents in a compromising situation.\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner also argued that the first respondent\navoided having sexual relationship with the petitioner on one ground or\nother. Therefore, on the admission of first respondent herself it is just and\nnecessary for D.N.A Medical test must be conducted to the petitioner, first\nrespondent and two children. According to the petitioner, the learned Judge\ndid not consider the case and law on these aspects and on erroneous\nconsideration dismissed the application. The learned counsel for the\npetitioner has submitted that ordering medical test is necessary to arrive at\nthe paternity of children and that will not cause any stigma on the children.\nThe Courts can order medical test to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the\nallegations made by a spouse against other spouse seeking divorce on such a\nground is correct or not. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied on a\njudgment  reported in 2003 (2) CTC 760 (<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_3\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>), wherein it has\nbeen held as follows:</span>\n</p>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t&quot;72.

The Court passes an appropriate order, the\nquestion of such action being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia would not arise. The Court having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India must also see to it that the right of a person to\ndefend himself must be adequately protected.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t73. It is, however, axiomatic that a Court shall not order a roving\ninquiry. It must have sufficient materials before it to enable it to exercise\nits discretion. Exercise of such discretion would be subjected to the\nsupervisory jurisdiction of the High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 115</a> of the\nCode of Civil Procedure and or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India.\nAbuse of the discretionary power at the hands of a Court is not expected. The\nCourt must arrive at a finding that the applicant has established a strong\nprima facie case before passing such an order.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\t7. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130058\" id=\"span_2\">In another judgment reported in 2009(3) CTC 672 (<a href=\"/doc/130058/\" id=\"a_8\">M.Karthika v.\nR.Manohar</a>) this Court has held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t21.

The burden of proof is on\nthe respondent, who alleges illegal legitimacy. He has to establish the fact\nwhich requires positive proof of negative plea that he has not fathered the\nSecond child. This Court is of the considered view that circumstances\nnecessitate issuing of directions for DNA test. Ordering DNA test would not\nin any way violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India nor prejudice\nthe individual of his right of privacy and the legal consequences of refusal\nto submit oneself for such examination would entail drawing of the adverse\ninterference against that person.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\t8. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"825778\" id=\"span_3\">In another judgment reported in 2011 (2) CTC 635 (<a href=\"/doc/825778/\" id=\"a_11\">Muniappan v.\nPonni</a>) it is stated as follows:</span>\n</p>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_5\">&quot;17.

The Full Bench of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_15\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>, 2003(2) CTC\n760, differs from the <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_16\">Goutam Kuntu</a>&#x27;s case as far as the direction No.5 above\nthat no one can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_8\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_17\">Sharda</a>&#x27;s case it has been held by the Apex Court that directing medical\nexamination of a party to a matrimonial litigation cannot be held to be\nviolative of one&#x27;s right to privacy, so also is not in violation of right of\npersonal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In both the decisions\nof the Honourable Supreme Court, it has been consistently held that the party\nwho seeks direction for conducting D.N.A. Test shall not be ordered as a\nmatter of course. The Supreme Court has not put complete prohibition on the\npower of the Court to order for D.N.A. test. It is the view of the Supreme\nCourt that as a routine practice, in all the cases such direction shall not\nbe granted.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"103985066\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"140941923\" id=\"span_10\">9. Per contra, the learned counsel for the first respondent contended\nthat the first respondent at no point of time had illicit relationship with\nthe second respondent and therefore, question of admitting her adulterous\nlife does not arise. The two children were born only to the petitioner and\nshe never stated that two children were born to the second respondent. The\nlearned counsel for the first respondent pointed out that the petitioner had\nmade the allegations after 21 years of marriage and disputing the paternity\nof two children after 16 years and 17 years of their birth. The petitioner\nhas made wild, frivolous and vexatious allegations against the first\nrespondent and there is no iota of proof for the same. The learned counsel\nfor the first respondent pointed out that only when there is strong evidence\nabout the adultery and doubt the paternity of child, D.N.A. medical test can\nbe ordered. He also submitted that privacy of a child must be protected. For\nthese principles, he relied on the order dated 10.04.2012 made in\nC.R.P.No.9221 of 2012 in <a href=\"/doc/140941923/\" id=\"a_19\">P.R.Balaji vs. The Registrar of Birth</a> and Death,\nPandicherry Municipality, Pandicherry and in <a href=\"/doc/103985066/\" id=\"a_20\">Kalyani v.

The presumption\nunder <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act can be rebutted by evidence that the\nhusband and wife had no access to each other at any time when the child could\nhave been begotten. Such a evidence must be strong, distinct, clear,\nsatisfactory and conclusive, as has been held by the Honourable Supreme Court\nin the decision reported in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_23\">Goutam Gundu v. State of West Bengal and another</a>,\n1993 (3) SCC 418,&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"531404\" id=\"span_12\">and he also relied on a judgment reported in AIR 2005 Madras 106\n(<a href=\"/doc/531404/\" id=\"a_24\">S.Thangavelu vs. S.Kannammal</a>), wherein it is stated as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t6. It is true that in the HMOP., the respondent as R.W.1 has expressed\nher willingness to undergo DNA Test. Equally, the petitioner in his chief\nexamination has stated that he is ready and willing to undergo DNA Test and\nmeet the entire expenses. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for\nthe respondent, it is not in dispute that she filed a suit for partition\nclaiming a share for her minor son even in the year 1997 i.e., well prior to\nthe filing of divorce petition, namely HMOP.No.140 of 2002 on 09.06.1998.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">Again, as rightly pointed out, in order to get over the claim made in the\nsaid partition suit, the petitioner has raised a defence disputing the\npaternity of the child. It is relevant to note that the marriage between the\npetitioner and the respondent was solemnised in 1984 and according to the\nrespondent her minor son was born in the year 1988. The present petition was\nfiled only in the year 1998 i.e., after 14 years of marriage alleging that\nthe minor son was not born to the petitioner. Though the Court has ample\npower to direct the parties to undergo medical tests or give sample of blood\nfor DNA Test, as observed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, the party who sought\nfor such a relief must have a strong and prima facie case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">\t10. The learned counsel for the first respondent argued that ordering\nD.N.A Test will cause stigma on the children and they will be mentally and\npsychologically affected.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_13\">11. I have carefully perused the materials on record, judgments relied\non by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the first respondent and\nheard the arguments. From the judgments relied on by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner and the first respondent, it is held by the Apex Court and\nthis Court that when the parties are living together, the presumption is\nchildren were born in the wedlock. But it is open to the parties to rebut the\nsaid presumption through medical test. It is well settled that with\nadvancement of scientific method it is possible to find out the paternity of\na child. The Apex Court in the judgment reported in 1993 (3) SCC 418 (<a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_25\">Goutam\nKundu v. State of West Bengal and another</a>) extracted by this Court in para 17\nand 18 of the judgment reported in 2011 (2) CTC 635, has formulated the\nguidelines for ordering D.N.A. Medical test. These guidelines were followed\nby this Court, while considering the relief of ordering D.N.A Medical test.\nIn <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_26\">the said judgment</a>, it has been held that the blood test cannot be ordered\nas a matter of course, it cannot be ordered to have roving inquiry. The\nhusband must establish strong prima facie case and he did not have access to\nthe wife to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 112</a> of Evidence Act.\nThe fourth guideline is very important as it has been held that the Court\nmust carefully examined whether consequence of ordering blood test will have\nthe effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an unchaste\nwoman. The Apex Court has also held that no one can be compelled to give\nsample of blood for analysis. From the decisions <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_28\">referred to above</a>, the\nCourts can order blood test only when strong and a prima facie case made out\nby husband.</span>\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">\t12. In the present case, the petition has been filed after 13 years of\nbirth of first child and 14 years of birth of second child. In the main\npetition, the petitioner has to prove by cogent and valid reasons  the\nadulterous life of first respondent. By mere allegations of adultery and\nalleged admission by first respondent which has been denied by her in the\ncounter statement in H.M.O.P. and counter affidavit in the I.A. for D.N.A\nMedical test, the petitioner is not entitled to the relief of D.N.A Medical\ntest. From the materials on record, I am of the view that the petitioner has\nnot made out any strong prima facie case to rebut the presumption as\ncontemplated in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. Further, the petition has\nbeen filed after 14 years of birth of first child and 13 years of birth of\nsecond child, even though the petitioner alleges that first respondent is\nhaving illicit relationship from December 1992 onwards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">\t13. For the above reasons, I hold that the petitioner has not made out\nstrong prima facie case for ordering D.N.A Medical test. The learned Judge\nhas properly appreciated the facts of the case and the law  on this aspect\nand dismissed the application. There is no material irregularity or\nillegality in the impugned order warranting interference by this Court.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">\t\t14. In the result, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed confirming\nthe order of learned Judge. No costs. Consequently, the connected\nMiscellaneous Petitions are closed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">To\n\nThe Family Court,\nMadurai.\u001a</p>","numcites":12,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":69431126,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"illicit relationship","formInput":"illicit%20relationship"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"adultery","formInput":"adultery"},{"value":"family court","formInput":"family%20court"},{"value":"civil revision","formInput":"civil%20revision"},{"value":"civil revision petition","formInput":"civil%20revision%20petition"},{"value":"dna","formInput":"dna"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"\"strong prima facie case\" ","formInput":"%22strong%20prima%20facie%20case%22%20"},{"value":"d.n.a.test","formInput":"d.n.a.test"},{"value":"\"prima facie case\"","formInput":"%22prima%20facie%20case%22"},{"value":"ctc","formInput":"ctc"},{"value":"paternity","formInput":"paternity"},{"value":"madurai","formInput":"madurai"},{"value":"Blood test","formInput":"Blood%20test"},{"value":"prima facie case","formInput":"prima%20facie%20case"},{"value":"\"article 21\"","formInput":"%22article%2021%22"},{"value":"374","formInput":"374"},{"value":"birth ","formInput":"birth%20"},{"value":"112","formInput":"112"}],"cats":[{"value":"birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy","formInput":"tag:birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"court-superintendence","formInput":"tag:court-superintendence"},{"value":"power-to-summon-persons-for-evidence","formInput":"tag:power-to-summon-persons-for-evidence"},{"value":"law-for-hindu-marriages","formInput":"tag:law-for-hindu-marriages"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
