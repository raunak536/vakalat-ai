Poverty has been and remains a\nconstructed social and economic reality.      The poor are not poor\nsimply because they are less human or because they are\nphysiologically or mentally inferior to others whose conditions are\nbetter off. On the contrary, their poverty is often a direct or indirect\nconsequence of society&#x27;s failure to establish equity and fairness as\nthe basis of its social and economic relations. Extreme poverty is\ndenial of human rights.\n\n      In a large number of cases, our Supreme Court has considered\nthe scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">article 21</a> of the Constitution, which assures right to life.\nTo make right to life meaningful and effective, the Supreme Court put\nup expansive interpretation and brought within its ambit a myriad of\nrights.\n\n       Various laws have been enacted to eradicate poverty: some of\nthem directly deal with them and some of them indirectly.\nNevertheless, their tardy implementation makes us lag behind in\neffectively dealing with the problem.\n\n      In spite of the constitutional safeguards and State legislative\nintervention in favour of the poor and the needy, their socio-economic\ncondition is deteriorating. Social and economic equality still remains\na mirage for them.\n\n                                  7\n       We are of the view that the Union and the State Governments should\naccord top priority to implementation of the judgments rendered by our\nSupreme Court in their letter and spirit in order that the lot of the have-nots\nis ameliorated.\n\n\n       With warm regards,\n\n                                                            Yours sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      (Dr AR.

Poverty has been and remains a\nconstructed social and economic reality.                            The poor are not poor\nsimply because they are less human or because they are\nphysiologically or mentally inferior to others whose conditions are\nbetter off.        On the contrary, their poverty is often a direct or indirect\nconsequence of society&#x27;s failure to establish equity and fairness as\nthe basis of its social and economic relations.1\n\n\n1.2       The Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims2 that\neveryone is entitled to a standard of living adequate to provide for the\nhealth and well-being of oneself and one&#x27;s family. Moreover, in\n1\n Voice of Justice by Dr Justice AR. Lakshmanan, Universal Law Publishing Co. Pvt. Ltd., Delhi (2006),\npage 121\n2\n    Statement to the 49th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights\n\n\n                                                 10\n accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nInternational Covenants recognize that freedom from fear and want\ncan be achieved only if everyone enjoys economic, social and\ncultural rights, in addition to civil and political rights. The increasing\ndisparity between the rich and the poor is a major destabilizing\ninfluence in the world. It produces or exacerbates regional and\nnational conflicts, environmental degradation, crime and violence,\nand the increasing use of illicit drugs. These consequences of\nextreme poverty affect all individuals and nations. Increasingly we are\nbecoming aware that we are all members of a single human family. In\na family the suffering of any member is felt by all, and until that\nsuffering is alleviated, no member of the family can be fully happy or\nat ease. Few are able to look at starvation and extreme poverty\nwithout feeling a sense of failure.\n\n\n1.3   Every man and woman has the human right to a standard of\nliving adequate for health and well-being, to food, clothing, housing,\nmedical care and social services.          These fundamental human rights\nare defined in our Constitution.       On 10 December 1948, the United\nNations General Assembly adopted and proclaimed the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights &quot;as a common standard of achievement\nfor all peoples and all nations&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1406924/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 1</a> of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights reads thus:\n      &quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n      They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards\n      one another in spirit of brotherhood.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n                                      11\n 1.4        The human right to live in dignity, free from want, is itself a\nfundamental right, and is also essential to the realization of all other\nhuman rights - rights that are universal, indivisible, interconnected\nand interdependent.               The right to be free from poverty includes the\nhuman right to an adequate standard of living.              Poverty is a human\nrights violation. The right to be free from poverty includes:\n\n\n           The human right to an adequate standard of living;\n           The human right to work and receive wages that contribute to\n           an adequate standard of living;\n           The human right to a healthy and safe environment;\n           The human right to live in adequate housing;\n           The human right to be free from hunger;\n           The human right to safe drinking water;\n           The human right to primary health care and medical attention in\n           case of illness;\n           The human right to access to basic social services;\n           The human right to education;\n           The human right to be free from gender or racial discrimination;\n           The human right to participate in shaping decisions which affect\n           oneself and one&#x27;s community.3\n\n\n1.5        The human right for children includes their development in an\nenvironment appropriate for their physical, mental, spiritual, moral\nand social development.4\n\n\n3\n    Supra note 1, pages 121-122\n4\n    Ibid.\n\n\n                                            12\n 1.6     Very little attention has been paid to poverty and the extreme\npoverty in the logic of human rights; the explanation for this is\nunhappily simple.      A poor person hardly exists and can only lay\nclaim, modestly, to &#x27;poor&#x27; rights.         We have gradually become\naccustomed to consider the poor person as having exhausted his\nentitlements. As for the extremely poor, they do not exist at all, at\nbest they may benefit from charity. Even the help they receive is, in\nmost cases, an additional token of exclusion from a society that\nmakes them feel guilty. The public authorities ignore them.\n\n\n1.7     Poverty and extreme poverty are not peripheral phenomena\nconfined to this country alone.         They are universal.     Poverty is\nincreasing everywhere. The phenomenon occurs on a more massive\nscale in the Least Developed Countries and in countries undergoing\nrapid    structural   transformation,    but   it   has   equally   serious\nconsequences for the victims in rich countries. As we said earlier,\npoverty is increasing everywhere: Increasing wealth is accompanied\nby increasing poverty. Poverty renders all human rights inoperative.\nThe violation of right to a reasonable standard of living entails the\nviolation of all the other human rights, since their observance are\nsimply made materially and structurally impossible.                 Poverty\naggravates discrimination since it particularly affects women, the\nelderly and the disabled. Moreover, the very poor are, in most cases,\nunable even to discover their own rights and this violation not only\naffects individuals through and within their precarious day-to-day\nexistence, but it entraps their entire social world over several\ngenerations in a spiral from which it is virtually impossible to escape.\n\n\n                                   13\n Poverty is, undoubtedly, a general phenomenon, a social relation,\nwhich as such is subject to law, and whose overall logic needs to be\nunderstood. Poverty is a situation of uncertainty, whereas extreme\npoverty is a spiral of different kinds of uncertainty with each kind\naggravating the effects of the others in a circular process that hems\nthe individual completely.\n\n\n1.8   Fundamentally, a human rights approach to poverty is about\nthe empowerment of the poor, extending their freedom of choice and\naction to structure their own lives.        The international normative\nframework empowers the poor by granting them human rights and\nimposing the legal obligations on others.     Rights and obligations are\nrequired to be supported by a system of accountability, or else they\nbecome no more than window dressing.            Accordingly, the human\nrights approach to poverty reduction emphasizes obligations and\nrequires that all duty-holders, including States and intergovernmental\norganizations, be held to account for their conduct in relation to\ninternational human rights. The enjoyment of the right to participate\nis deeply dependent on the realization of other human rights.     If the\npoor are to participate meaningfully, they must be free to organize\nwithout restriction (right to association), to meet without impediment\n(right to assembly) and to say what they want without intimidation\n(freedom of expression), they must know the relative facts (right to\ninformation) and they must enjoy an elementary level of economic\nsecurity and the well-being (right to a reasonable standard of living\nand associated rights).      It is less openly recognized that the poor\nalso suffer from a lack of information.      Over and over again poor\n\n\n                                   14\n people mention their isolation from information, information about the\nprogrammes of assistance, their rights, contacts about work that\naffect their lives directly.\n\n\n1.9   Poverty is indisputably the most potent violation of all human\nrights, and constitutes a threat to the survival of the greatest\nnumbers of the human population. As poverty has intensified in both\nrich and poor nations alike, the view of poverty as a human rights\nand social justice issue has gained increased recognition. The United\nNations General Assembly has resolved that extreme poverty and\nexclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity\n(General Assembly Resolution 53/146 on Human Rights and\nExtreme Poverty adopted December 18 1992). The existence of\nwidespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment\nof human rights and might, in some situations, constitute a threat to\nthe right to life. A human rights-based approach to poverty views the\npoor as holding inalienable fundamental rights that must be\nrespected, protected and fulfilled.\n\n\n1.10 If injustices and discriminations in society are the main reasons\nfor poverty, then as an effective operational mechanism, the human\nrights-based approach to development demands:\n\n\n\n\n                                  15\n    -      Participation and transparency in decision-making - this\n          implies making participation throughout the development\n          process a right and the obligation of the State and other\n          actors to create an enabling environment for participation of\n          all stakeholders;\n   -      Non-discrimination - this implies that equity and equality cut\n          across all rights and are the key ingredients for development\n          and poverty reduction;\n   -      Empowerment - this implies empowering people to exercise\n          their human rights through the use of tools such as legal and\n          political action to make progress in more conventional\n          development areas;\n   -      Accountability of actors - this implies accountability of public\n          and private institutions and actors to promote, protect and\n          fulfill human rights and to be held accountable if these are\n          not enforced.\n\n\n1.11 Human rights are for everyone, as much for people living in\npoverty and social isolation as for the rich and educated.\nInternational law prohibits discrimination in the enjoyment of human\nrights on any ground, such as ethnicity, colour, sex, language,\nreligion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property,\nbirth or other status.    The term &quot;or other status&quot; is interpreted to\ninclude   personal    circumstances,     occupation,   lifestyle,   sexual\norientation and health status.     People living with HIV and AIDS, for\ninstance, are entitled to the enjoyment of their fundamental human\nrights and freedoms without any unjustified restriction.\n\n\n                                   16\n 1.12 Equality also requires that all persons within a society enjoy\nequal access to the available goods and services that are necessary\nto fulfill basic human needs.      It prohibits discrimination in law or in\npractice in any field regulated and protected by public authorities.\nThus, the principle of non-discrimination applies to all State policies\nand practices, including those concerning health care, education,\naccess to services, travel regulations, entry requirements and\nimmigration.\n\n\n1.13 An essential principle of the international human rights\nframework is that every person and all peoples are entitled to\nparticipate in, contribute to, and enjoy civil, economic, social, cultural\nand political development in which human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms can be realized. This means that participation is not simply\nsomething desirable from the point of view of ownership and\nsustainability, but rather a right with profound consequences for the\ndesign and implementation of development activities.                 It is\nconcerned with access to decision-making, and is critical in the\nexercise of power.        The principles of participation and inclusion\nmean that all people are entitled to participate in society to the\nmaximum of their potential.       This in turn necessitates provision of a\nsupportive environment to enable people to develop and express\ntheir full potential and creativity.\n\n\n1.14 States have the primary responsibility to create the enabling\nenvironment in which all people can enjoy their human rights, and\n\n\n                                       17\n have the obligation to ensure that respect for human rights norms\nand principles is integrated into all levels of governance and policy-\nmaking.    The principle of accountability is essential for securing an\nenabling environment for development.           Human rights do not simply\ndefine the needs of people, but recognize people as active subjects\nand claim-holders, thus establishing the duties and obligations of\nthose responsible for ensuring that the needs are met.               As a\nconsequence, the identification of duty-holders has to feature as an\nintegral part of programme development.\n\n\n1.15 Law must protect rights. Any dispute about them is not to be\nresolved through the exercise of some arbitrary discretion, but\nthrough the adjudication by competent, impartial and independent\nprocesses. These procedures will ensure full equality and fairness to\nall parties, and determine the questions in accordance with clear,\nspecific and pre-existing laws, known and openly proclaimed.           All\npersons are equal before the law, and are entitled to equal\nprotection.   The rule of law ensures that no one is above the law,\nand that there will be no impunity for human rights violations.\n\n\n1.16 From the human development perspective, good governance is\ndemocratic governance, meaning:\n\n\n   -      People&#x27;s rights and fundamental freedoms are respected,\n          allowing them to live with dignity;\n   -      People have a say in decisions that affect their lives;\n   -      People can hold decision-makers accountable;\n\n\n                                   18\n    -     Inclusive and fair rules, institutions and practices govern\n         social interactions;\n   -     Women are equal partners with men in public spheres of life\n         and decision-making;\n   -     People are free from discrimination based on ethnicity,\n         gender, or any other attribute;\n   -     The needs of future generations are reflected in current\n         policies;\n   -     Economic and social policies are responsive to people&#x27;s\n         needs and aspirations.\n\n\n1.17 The importance of discrimination in reaching the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals - based on ethnicity, colour, sex, language,\nreligion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property,\nbirth or other status - cannot be overstated. Discrimination is a form\nof social exclusion, and often a cause of poverty. In extreme cases,\ndiscrimination and exclusion may lead to conflict.              Systemic\ndiscrimination reduces the ability of individuals to benefit from and\ncontribute to human development.\n\n\n\n\n                                   19\n                                CHAPTER II\n              A PETITION ON BEGGARS&#x27; HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n\n2.1   A civil writ petition (No. 117/2000) under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_4\">article 32</a> of the\nConstitution filed by way of public interest litigation challenging the\nalleged action of the Union of India, Government of NCT of Delhi and\nthe Commissioner of Police, New Delhi, in violating the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_5\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act</a> 1959, as extended to Delhi, is\npending before the Supreme Court. The writ petitioner (Ms Karnika\nSawhney), who happened to be a law student of the University of\nDelhi, undertook a research project on the subject of &quot;Problem of\nbeggars in Delhi&quot;. She saw the plight of beggars housed in Beggar\nHomes who were being deprived of the basic essentials and\namenities of life like adequate food, clean water, proper shelter and\npersonal hygiene.     According to her, the inmates were leading a\nmere animal existence with no proper provision of adequate drinking\nwater, bathing, sanitation, food, clothing and clean bedding or\nhygienic surroundings in the shelter.    The inmates also complained\nof extremely poor medical facilities.\n\n\n2.2   The writ petition has pointed out that the concept of the right to\nlife and livelihood is a part of the overall constitutional structure and\nis recognized also by various articles of the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights that, inter alia, declare the right of every member of\nsociety to social security and protection against unemployment and\n\n\n                                  20\n economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for the dignity and\nfree development of his personality.          It is also of significance to\nhighlight here that to combat the problem of beggary a scheme for\nbeggary prevention was formulated and introduced during 1992-93\nfor the care, treatment and rehabilitation of beggars by the Union\nMinistry of Social Justice and Empowerment. It is essential to briefly\nset out its primary objectives which are as follows:\n\n\n   1.     Providing facilities for the technical education and vocational\n          training of beggars;\n   2.     To encourage beggars in productive work so as to facilitate\n          their reintegration in the society;\n   3.     Involving voluntary welfare organizations;\n   4.     Mobilizing     community        resources   for     training   and\n          employment.\n\n\n2.3     Another scheme of assistance was to provide for establishment\nof work centres in the existing Beggar Homes for providing vocational\ntraining and technical education to the beggars.            It is pertinent to\nnote that since the main objective in case of Beggar Homes is the\neconomic rehabilitation together with the physical, psychological and\nsocial rehabilitation, it is expected that the allocation of expenditure\nwould reflect the relative importance of these objectives, but when\nthe expenditure pattern of these bodies is examined in this light, it is\nfound that the administrative expenses form predominantly part of\nthe total expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n                                     21\n 2.4   The writ petition also states that there is an attitude of\nindifference, laxity and lack of commitment towards the assigned\nroles among the officials statutorily empowered with the duty to arrest\nbeggars for protective and corrective custody.        The un-arrested\nfemale beggars are deprived of access to rehabilitation which the\nState is required to ensure through the special institutions\nestablished under the Act.    This degree of laxity nullifies in effect,\nthe presence of the laudatory, rehabilitative provisions in the welfare\nlegislation.   As a result, while the institutions exist they hardly\nserve/cater to the needs of the destitute who continue to beg on the\nstreets.\n\n\n2.5   The writ petition further states that there is a lack of\ntransparency due to lapse on the part of governmental authorities in\nobserving statutory provisions. There is dire need to establish more\nbeggar institutions in Delhi and other big cities in order to provide\nproper and clean accommodation, adequate essential facilities and\nmeaningful rehabilitation to the beggars.\n\n\n\n\n                                 22\n                              CHAPTER III\n       EXPANSE OF <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">ARTICLE 21</a> OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n\n3.1   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution deals with protection of life and\npersonal liberty and reads thus:\n      &quot;No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty\n      except according to procedure established by law.&quot;\n\n\n3.2   This article, drafted in clear and simple language, has been the\nsubject matter of extensive litigation.   Its scope has been expanded\nover the last 50 years and life and liberty now include education,\nhealth and even roads in hilly areas.            The article prohibits\ndeprivation of life or personal liberty except according to procedure\nestablished by law.     In a sense, it corresponds to the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the\nrelevant portions of which read:\n\n\n\n\n                                   23\n         &quot;Nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process\n        of law...&quot; and &quot;... nor shall any State deprive any person of life,\n        liberty or property without due process of law.&quot;\n\n\n3.3     In A. K. Gopalan v. State of Madras5, the Supreme Court had\ngiven a literal and narrow interpretation to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">article 21</a> and refused to\ninfuse the procedure with the principles of natural justice.              Three\ndecades later, this view was overruled and it was held that the\nprocedure contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">article 21</a> must answer the test of\nreasonableness.6 Such a procedure should be in conformity with the\nprinciples of natural justice.               This is an example of the expansive\ninterpretation of the fundamental right.\n\n\n3.4     Thus, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">article 21</a> not only protects life and personal liberty but\nalso envisages a fair procedure.\n\n\n3.5     The initial view was that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">article 21</a> did not include the right to\nlivelihood.      The later decisions have categorically held that the right\nto life includes the right to livelihood.              In Olga Tellis v. Bombay\nMunicipal Corporation7, it was held that the sweep of the right to life\nconferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">article 21</a> is wide and far-reaching.              It does not mean\nmerely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as, for\nexample, by the imposition and execution of the death sentence,\nexcept according to procedure established by law. That is but one\naspect of the right to life. An equally important facet of that right is\nthe right to livelihood because no person can live without the means\n5\n  AIR 1950 SC 27\n6\n  Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248\n7\n  AIR 1986 SC 180\n\n\n                                               24\n of living, that is, the means of livelihood. If the right to livelihood is\nnot treated as a part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way\nof depriving a person of his right to life would be to deprive him of his\nmeans of livelihood to the point of abrogation. That, which alone\nmakes it possible to live, leave aside what makes life livable, must be\ndeemed to be an integral component of the right to life.\n\n\n3.6     The right to reputation is a facet of right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">article 21.</a>\nAdverse remarks by a Commission of Inquiry about a person without\nhearing him violates principles of natural justice and renders the\naction non est as well as the consequences thereof.8\n\n\n3.7     Economic empowerment through distributive justice for the\npoor, dalits and tribes is an integral part of the right to life, equality\nand of status and dignity to the poor, weaker sections, dalits and\ntribes.

This is an area where the Court has been most\nstrict and scrupulous in ensuring observance of the requirements of\nthe law, and even where a requirement of the law is breached in the\nslightest measure, the Court has not hesitated to strike down the\norder of detention.\n\n\n3.10 The expression &quot;personal liberty&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">article 21</a> is of the widest\namplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the\npersonal liberty of man and some of them have been raised to the status of\ndistinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_22\">article 19</a>\nof the Constitution.

The importance of a\nspeedy trial has been repeatedly emphasized by the Supreme Court\nin many cases. In Abdul Rehman Antulay v. R. S. Nayak16, the\nSupreme Court examined consequences of denial of the right to a\nspeedy trial and laid down 11, but in-exhaustive, propositions to\nserve as guidelines. This decision was held to be correct in P.\nRamachandra Rao v State of Karnataka17.

It is this\nnotion that, in international law, gave rise to the principle of &quot;state\nresponsibility&quot; for pollution emanating from within one&#x27;s own\nterritories. This responsibility is clearly enunciated in the Stockholm\nDeclaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human\nEnvironment (1972), to which India is a party.                         Thus, there is no\ndoubt about the fact that there is a responsibility bestowed upon the\nGovernment to protect and preserve the tanks, which are an\nimportant part of the environment of the area.28 Hygienic environment\nis an integral facet of the right to a healthy life and it would be\nimpossible to live without a humane and healthy environment.29\n\n27\n   (1997) 1 SCC 416\n28\n   Intellectuals Forum v.

In Murli S. Deora v.\nUnion of India31, the Supreme Court after considering the harmful\neffects that smoking has on non-smokers, gave directions to ban\nsmoking in public places, namely, (1) auditoriums, (2) hospital\nbuildings, (3) health institutions, (4) educational institutions, (5)\nlibraries, (6) court buildings, (7) public offices, and (8) public\nconveyances, including railways. The language used gives the\nimpression that the list of places is exhaustive. Airports, for example,\nare not included, although they are impliedly included.\n\n\n3.22 An accused who cannot afford legal assistance is entitled to\nfree legal aid at the cost of the State. This right is part of the fair, just\nand reasonable procedure under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">article 21.</a> The court must inform\nthe accused of his right to be represented by a lawyer through legal\naid and at the expense of the State.                     Failure to do so will vitiate his\ntrial and his conviction can be set aside.32\n\n\n3.23 In Jolly George Varghese v. Bank of Cochin33, the question of\nputting a person in prison in execution of a money decree, who did\nnot have the necessary means to pay the debt, was considered by\nthe Supreme Court.                   The Court while dealing with the issue\nharmonized <a href=\"/doc/40650591/\" id=\"a_46\">section 51</a> of the CPC with the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights. <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 11</a> of the Covenant provides that &quot;no\n\n30\n   C.E.S.C.

The Court held that a simple default to\ndischarge the debt is not enough to detain a person in prison. There\nmust be some element of bad faith beyond mere indifference to pay.\nIf the judgment-debtor once had the means but now has not or if he\nhas money now on which there are other pressing claims, he should\nnot be cast in prison as the same would be violative of the spirit of\n<a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_48\">article 11</a> of the Covenant as well as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n3.24 Public interest litigation is a strategic arm of the legal aid\nmovement, intended to bring justice within the reach of the poor\nmasses, who fall within the low-visibility area of humanity. Public\ninterest litigation is brought before the court not for the purpose of\nenforcing the rights of one individual against another as happens in\nthe case of ordinary litigation, but it is intended to promote and\nvindicate     public   interest   which   demands   that   violations   of\nconstitutional or legal rights of large numbers of people who are poor,\nignorant or in a socially or economically disadvantageous position\nshould not go unnoticed and un-redressed.\n\n\n3.25 In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India34, the Supreme\nCourt held that the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_50\">article 32</a> by way of public\ninterest litigation by a public-spirited organization on behalf of\npersons belonging to socially and economically weaker sections\ncomplaining violation of their human rights on being forced to serve\nas bonded labourers, was maintainable. According to the Court, a\npublic\n34\n       interest litigation is not in the nature of an adversary litigation\n (1984) 3 SCC 161\n\n\n\n                                    32\n but it is a challenge and an opportunity to the government and its\nofficers to make basic human rights meaningful to the deprived and\nvulnerable sections of the community and to assure them social and\neconomic justice which is the signature tune of our Constitution.\nCertain directions were given by the Court to the governments and\nother authorities with a view to improve the life conditions of the poor\nworkers of the stone quarries and ensure social justice to them so\nthat they may be able to breathe the fresh air of social and economic\nfreedom.\n\n\n3.26 Though <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_51\">article 24</a> of the Constitution prohibits employment of\nchildren below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or in any\nother hazardous employment, it is a hard reality that due to poverty\nchild is driven to such employment. The Supreme Court in another\ncase bearing the above title35 directed the Government of India to,\ninter alia, evolve the principles and policies for progressive\nelimination of employment of the children below the age of 14 years\nin all employments.\n\n\n3.27 Conceptually, parens patriae theory is the obligation of the\nState to protect and take into custody the rights and privileges of its\ncitizens for discharging its obligation. The Constitution makes it\nimperative for the State to secure to its citizens the rights guaranteed\nby the Constitution and where the citizens are not in a position to\nassert and secure their rights, the State must come into picture and\nprotect and fight for the rights of the citizens. Therefore, the State\ncan\n35\n    be activated and approached to effectively come on the scene\n Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India, AIR 1997 SC 2218\n\n\n\n                                             33\n and take over the claims of the victims of a disaster to protect their\nhuman rights.36\n\n\n3.28 A newspaper carried a report about the non-payment of wages\nto a large number of employees in different public undertakings. The\nreport also indicated that several employees died due to starvation or\ncommitted suicide owing to acute financial crisis. A writ petition was\nfiled by a lawyer on the basis of the said news. In Kapila Hingorani v.\nState of Bihar37, the Supreme Court interfered with the matter in\npublic interest and held that there is failure to perform the\nconstitutional duties by the State in controlling the functions of the\npublic sector companies. In such circumstances, the Court would not\nhesitate to lift the corporate veil when corporate personality is found\nto be opposed to justice, convenience and interest of the revenue or\nworkman or against public interest.38\n\n\n3.29 To help the poor litigants, <a href=\"/doc/169871995/\" id=\"a_52\">article 39A</a> of the Constitution\nprovides, inter alia, that the State shall provide free legal aid to\nensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any\ncitizen by reason of economic or other disabilities. Invoking the said\narticle and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Supreme\nCourt held that it is the duty of the State to provide amicus curiae to\ndefend an indigent accused. The Court also held that he would be\nmeted out with unequal defence, if, as is common knowledge, a\nyoungster from the Bar who has either a little experience or no\nexperience is assigned to defend him and, therefore, it is high time\n36\n   Charan Lal Sahu v. Union of India, (1990) 1 SCC 613\n37\n   (2003) 6 SCC 1\n38\n   Ibid., pages 19-20\n\n\n                                                34\n that senior counsel practising in the court concerned should\nvolunteer to defend such indigent accused as a part of their\nprofessional duty.39\n\n\n3.30 Poverty is indisputably the most potent violation of all human\nrights and constitutes a threat to the survival of the greatest numbers\nof the human population. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam stated at the\nHuman Rights Day function on 10.12.2002:\n          &quot;People, who are economically or socially in the lower strata,\n          are vulnerable to human rights exploitation by those who are in\n          the higher strata. One way to reduce this exploitation is to\n          narrow this divide. In our country, about 300 million people are\n          below the poverty line. After five decades of progress, the\n          aspirations of people are rightly mounting that India should\n          become a developed country. This is the second vision for the\n          nation.&quot;\n\n\n3.31 Another former President of India, Mr. Zail Singh, had\nsuggested that no person in the country should be allowed to have\nmore than one house, as a measure of reducing economic disparities\nand ensuring proper distribution of prosperity. Permitting one house\nper person, the extra houses could be given to the needy who should\nbe facilitated to pay for them in instalments. Equal protection of the\nlaws is not a formal declaration but a dynamic actualization. So, to\ncreate conditions of life where social and economic disabilities do not\ndeny equal justice in the enjoyment of basic facilities is the task of\nthe legal system. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_53\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_54\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/169871995/\" id=\"a_55\">39A</a>, read together, mean\nnothing less, nothing else. The right to life, preserved in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_56\">article 21</a><a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_57\">,\n\n\n39</a>\n     Kishore Chand v. State of Himachal Pradesh, (1991) 1 SCC 286\n\n\n\n                                              35\n has the same broad élan, viewed in the benign light of the Preamble\nwhich assures to all citizens liberty, equal opportunity, fraternity and\nthe dignity of the individual. There is need to brain-scan <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">article 21</a>\nbecause judicial illusion raises false expectation and the Court,\nviewed as a whole, being stuffed with artists of the Establishment,\nmay give a jolt when the right to life is pressed seriously, disturbing\nthe status quo conscience of the robed brethren.       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21</a> which\nhas incarnated as the last hope of the least and the lost of our\ncountrymen, is a proud heritage of the judicial revolution midwifed by\nthe Supreme Court in all innocence. Its anatomy is in two parts. First,\na basic assumption that everyone has a right to life and personal\nliberty, too fundamental to be negotiable. Second, this basic\npostulate of liberty may be truncated or annihilated if the power to do\nso is duly legislated. No cannibal legislation can do away with life or\npersonal liberty regardless of humanism and realism.\n\n\n3.32 In the words of Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, what is guaranteed by\nthis fundamental right is not mere animal existence nor vegetable\nsurvival but rightful opportunity to unfold the human potential and\nshare in the joy of creative living.\n\n\n3.33 In Veena Sethy v. State of Bihar40, the Supreme Court was\nconsidering the cases of mentally sick prisoners languishing in jail for\nnearly two or three decades. Some of them were acquitted being of\nunsound mind.           Some under-trial prisoners of unsound mind\nregained sanity long before, but no steps were taken to commence\nproceedings against them. In view of the inordinately long\n40\n     (1982) 2 SCC 583\n\n\n                                       36\n incarceration already suffered by them without justification, the\nSupreme Court ordered all of them to be released forthwith by\nproviding necessary funds for meeting expenses of their journey to\ntheir respective native places as also for maintenance for a period of\none week.               The above case was filed by way of public interest\nlitigation by the Free Legal Aid Committee, Bihar, by addressing a\nletter to a Judge of the Supreme Court, drawing the Court&#x27;s attention\nto unjustified and illegal detention of certain prisoners in the Central\nJail, Hazaribagh, for almost two or three decades. Treating this letter\nas a writ petition, the Supreme Court issued notice to the State of\nBihar for the purpose of ascertaining facts and after giving\nopportunity to the State to file the counter affidavit, the Supreme\nCourt held that if the poor are allowed to languish in jails without the\nslightest justification, the rule of law would become meaningless for\nthe rule of law does not exist merely for those who have the means to\nfight for their rights and very often for perpetuation of the status quo\nwhich protects and preserves their dominance and permits them to\nexploit large sections of the community but it exists also for the poor\nand the down-trodden, the ignorant and the illiterate who constitute\nthe large bulk of humanity in this country. 3.34          The    Supreme\nCourt thus held that it is the solemn duty of the Court to protect and\nuphold the basic human rights of the weaker sections of the society.\n\n\n3.35 The case of Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee v. Union of\nIndia41         arose under the <a href=\"/doc/26738839/\" id=\"a_60\">Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987</a>.\n<a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_61\">Chapter III of the Act</a> providing for constitution of High Court Legal\nServices Committee, etc. had not been extended to all the States\n41\n     (1998) 5 SCC 762\n\n\n                                         37\n and Union territories as rules under <a href=\"/doc/74073109/\" id=\"a_62\">section 28</a> of the Act had not\nbeen framed by many States and Union territories nor were made\nregulations under section 29A. The Supreme Court directed the\nStates and Union territories to make rules and regulations as well as\nconstitute various Committees within two months.\n\n\n3.36 The decision in Suthendraraja v. State42 reflects difference of\nopinion amongst Judges in regard to the sentence of death awarded\nto Nalini in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. K. T. Thomas, J.\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_1\">partly dissented from the majority view and altered her sentence to\nlife imprisonment. After referring to the Constitution Bench judgment\nin <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_63\">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab43</a> which narrowed down the scope\nfor awarding death sentence to the extremely restricted radius of\n&quot;rarest of rare cases&quot; in which the alternative lesser sentence of\nimprisonment for life is unquestionably foreclosed, he observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           &#x27;In a case where a Bench of three Judges delivered judgment\n           in which the opinion of at least one Judge is in favour of\n           preferring imprisonment for life to death penalty as for any\n           particular accused, I think it would be a proper premise for the\n           Bench to review the order of sentence of death in respect of\n           that accused. Such an approach is consistent with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 21</a> of\n           the Constitution as it helps saving a human life from the\n           gallows and at the same time putting the guilty accused behind\n           the bars for life. In my opinion, it would be a sound proposition\n           to make a precedent that when one of the three Judges refrains\n           from awarding death penalty to an accused on stated reasons\n           in preference to the sentence of life imprisonment that fact can\n           be regarded sufficient to treat the case as not falling within the\n           narrowed ambit of &quot;rarest of rare cases when the alternative\n           option is unquestionably foreclosed&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">42</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105430\" id=\"span_3\">(1999) 9 SCC 323\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">43</span>\n     (1980) 2 SCC 684\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                       38</span>\n            ... I may add as an explanatory note that the reasoning is not\n           be understood as a suggestion that a minority opinion in the\n           judgment can supersede the majority view therein. In the realm\n           of making a choice between life imprisonment and death\n           penalty the above consideration is germane when the scope for\n           awarding death penalty has now shrunk to the narrowest circle\n           and that too only when the alternative action is &quot;unquestionably\n           foreclosed&quot;.&#x27;\n\n\n3.37 <a href=\"/doc/105430/\" id=\"a_65\">Zahira Habibulla H.

Such rights can be protected\n           effectively when a citizen has recourse to the courts of law. ...\n           Denial of a fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as is to\n           the victim and the society. Fair trial obviously would mean a\n           trial before an impartial judge, a fair prosecutor and\n           atmosphere of judicial calm. Fair trial means a trial in which\n           bias or prejudice for or against the accused, the witnesses, or\n           the cause which is being tried is eliminated. If the witnesses get\n           threatened or are forced to give false evidence that also would\n           not result in a fair trial. The failure to hear material witnesses is\n           certainly denial of fair trial. ... Failure to accord fair hearing\n           either to the accused or the prosecution violates even minimum\n           standards of due process of law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"397071\" id=\"span_6\">3.38 The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/397071/\" id=\"a_66\">Murlidhar Dayandeo Kesekar v.
