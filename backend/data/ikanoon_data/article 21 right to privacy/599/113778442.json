The petitioner is having PAN number and assessed\n\nto   Income    Tax.

The grounds urged by the petitioner is that enrolment for\n\nAadhar is not mandatory, however optional. By virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act, enrolment of Aadhar is made\n\nmandatory. Hence, the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is\n\nexcessive.

The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/157174084/\" id=\"a_12\">Binoy\n\nViswam</a> (supra), has held as under;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          &quot;95. Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar is voluntary.\n           However, it is a moot question as to whether for\n           obtaining benefits as prescribed under Section 7 of\n           the Aadhaar Act, it is mandatory to give Aadhaar\n           number or not is a debatable issue which we are not\n           addressing as this very issue is squarely raised which\n           is the subject-matter of other writ petition filed and\n           pending in this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          96. On the one hand, enrolment under Aadhaar card is\n           voluntary, however, for the purposes of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_13\">Income\n           Tax Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 139-AA</a> makes it compulsory for the\n           assessees to give Aadhaar number which means\n           insofar as income tax assessees are concerned, they\n           have to necessarily enrol themselves under the\n           Aadhaar Act and obtain Aadhaar number which will\n           be their identification number as that has become the\n           requirement under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_15\">Income Tax Act</a>. The\n           contention that since enrolment under the Aadhaar\n           Act is voluntary, it cannot be compulsory under the\n           <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_16\">Income Tax Act</a>, cannot be countenanced. As already\n           mentioned above, purpose for enrolment under the\n           Aadhaar Act is to avail benefits of various welfare\n           schemes, etc. as stipulated in Section 7 of the\n           Aadhaar Act. Purpose behind the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_17\">Income Tax Act</a>, on\n           the other hand, is entirely different which has already\n           been discussed in detail above. For achieving the said\n           purpose viz. to curb black money, money laundering\n           and tax evasion, etc. if Parliament chooses to make\n           the provision mandatory under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_18\">Income Tax Act</a>,\n           the competence of Parliament cannot be questioned\n           on the ground that it is impermissible only because\n           under the Aadhaar Act, the provision is directory in\n           nature. It is the prerogative of Parliament to make a\n           particular provision directory in one statute and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                          -6-</span>\n                                        NC: 2024:KHC:27552\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     WP No. 3912 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n mandatory/compulsory in other. That by itself cannot\n be a ground to question the competence of the\n legislature. After all, the Aadhaar Act is not a mother\n Act. Two laws i.e. the Aadhaar Act, on the one hand,\n and law in the form of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 139-AA</a> of the Income\n Tax Act, on the other hand, are two different\n standalone provisions/laws and validity of one cannot\n be examined in the light of provisions of other Acts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">98. .....we are not impressed by the contention of the\n petitioners that the two enactments are contradictory\n with each other. A harmonious reading of the two\n enactments would clearly suggest that whereas\n enrolment of Aadhaar is voluntary when it comes to\n taking benefits of various welfare schemes even if it\n is presumed that requirement of Section 7 of the\n Aadhaar Act that it is necessary to provide Aadhaar\n number to avail the benefits of schemes and services,\n it is up to a person to avail those benefits or not. On\n the other hand, purpose behind enacting <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n 139-AA</a> of the Act is to check a menace of black\n money as well as money laundering and also to\n widen the income tax net so as to cover those\n persons who are evading the payment of tax.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">132. Therefore, it cannot be denied that there has to\n be some provision stating the consequences for not\n complying with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 139-AA</a>\n of the Act,       more particularly     when these\n requirements are found as not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Articles 14</a>\n and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_23\">19 (of course</a>, eschewing the discussion on\n <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> herein for the reasons already given). If\n Aadhaar number is not given, the aforesaid exercise\n may not be possible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">133. Having said so, it becomes clear from the\n aforesaid discussion that those who are not PAN\n holders, while applying for PAN, they are required to\n give Aadhaar number. This is the stipulation of sub-\n section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 139-AA</a>, which we have already\n upheld. At the same time, as far as existing PAN\n holders are concerned, since the impugned provisions\n are yet to be considered on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article\n 21</a> of the Constitution, including on the debate\n around right to privacy and human dignity, etc. as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                          -7-</span>\n                                        NC: 2024:KHC:27552\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      WP No. 3912 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n limbs of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a>, we are of the opinion that till the\n aforesaid aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> is decided by the\n Constitution Bench a partial stay of the aforesaid\n proviso is necessary. Those who have already\n enrolled themselves under Aadhaar Scheme would\n comply with the requirement of sub-section (2) of\n <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 139-AA</a> of the Act. Those who still want to\n enrol are free to do so. However, those assessees\n who are not Aadhaar card holders and do not comply\n with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/178877346/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 139-AA(2)</a>, their PAN\n cards be not treated as invalid for the time being. It\n is only to facilitate other transactions which are\n mentioned in Rule 114-B of the Rules. We are\n adopting this course of action for more than one\n reason. We are saying so because of very severe\n consequences that entail in not adhering to the\n requirement of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 139-AA</a> of\n the Act. A person who is holder of PAN and if his PAN\n is invalidated, he is bound to suffer immensely in his\n day-to-day dealings, which situation should be\n avoided till the Constitution Bench authoritatively\n determines the argument of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a> of the\n Constitution. Since we are adopting this course of\n action, in the interregnum, it would be permissible for\n Parliament to consider as to whether there is a need\n to tone down the effect of the said proviso by limiting\n the consequences.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">136. Subject to the aforesaid, these writ petitions\n are disposed of in the following manner:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">136.1. We hold that Parliament was fully competent to\n enact <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 139-AA</a> of the Act and its authority to\n make this law was not diluted by the orders of this\n Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">136.2.

Puttaswamy [K.S.\n        Puttaswamy v. Union of India</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1] .\n        Summary and Conclusions\n        508.1. The architecture and structure of the Aadhaar\n        Act reveals that UIDAI is established as a statutory\n        body which is given the task of developing the policy,\n        procedure and system for issuing Aadhaar numbers to\n        individuals and also to perform authentication thereof\n        as per the provisions of the Act. For the purpose of\n        enrolment and assigning Aadhaar numbers, enrolling\n        agencies are recruited by the Authority. All the\n        residents in India are eligible to obtain an Aadhaar\n        number. To enable a resident to get Aadhaar number,\n        he is required to submit demographic as well as\n        biometric    information   i.e.  apart   from   giving\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                  -9-</span>\n                                                NC: 2024:KHC:27552\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                              WP No. 3912 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n\n         information relating to name, date of birth and\n         address, biometric information in the form of\n         photograph, fingerprint, iris scan is also to be\n         provided. Aadhaar number given to a particular\n         person is treated as unique number as it cannot be\n         reassigned to any other individual.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">         508.7. The Court also noticed that the whole\n         architecture of Aadhaar is devised to give unique\n         identity to the citizens of this country. No doubt, a\n         person can have various documents on the basis of\n         which that individual can establish her identify. It may\n         be in the form of a passport, PAN card, Ration Card\n         and so on. For the purpose of enrolment itself number\n         of documents are prescribed which an individual can\n         produce on the basis of which Aadhaar card can be\n         issued. Thus, such documents, in a way, are also\n         proof of identity. However, there is a fundamental\n         difference between the Aadhaar card as a mean of\n         identity and other documents through which identity\n         can be established. Enrolment for Aadhaar card also\n         requires giving of demographic information as well as\n         biometric information which is in the form of iris and\n         fingerprints. This process eliminates any chance of\n         duplication. It is emphasised that an individual can\n         manipulate the system by having more than one or\n         even number of PAN cards, passports, Ration Cards,\n         etc. When it comes to obtaining Aadhaar card, there is\n         no possibility of obtaining duplicate card. Once the\n         biometric information is stored and on that basis\n         Aadhaar card is issued, it remains in the system with\n         the Authority. Wherever there would be a second\n         attempt for enrolling for Aadhaar and for this purpose\n         same person gives his biometric information, it would\n         immediately get matched with the same biometric\n         information already in the system and the second\n         request would stand rejected. It is for this reason the\n         Aadhaar card is known as Unique Identification (UID).\n         Such an identity is unparalleled.]&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110918590\" id=\"span_19\">10.
