Now, the photographs filed on record by the respondent no.1\n                                  are beyond the pale of dispute in as much as they have been taken\n                                  from the instagram account of the petitioner itself. The photographs\n                                  prima facie reveal that there were friendly relations between both\n                                  the families i.e. family of petitioner and family of respondent no.2.\n                                  The photographs also show that the petitioner and respondent no.2\n                                  used to meet frequently with their spouses. Thus, as both the\n                                  families were 1 having such good relations, it is but natural for the\n                                  parties to have exchange of phone calls and in these circumstances,\n                                  the duration of phone calls or time of phone calls cannot in any\n                                  manner show that there were adulterous relationship between\n                                  respondent no. 1 and respondent no.2. Further, their tower location\n                                  would also naturally coincide many a times as the respondents were\n                                  at the same place - partying together with friends and families. I am\n                                  aware of the fact that <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_9\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, 1984\n                                  empowers a family court to receive in evidence any document.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                          CM(M) 2301/2024                                                           Page 2 of 14</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">By:SUNITA KUMARI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signing Date:10.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">19:15:28</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">                                   However, at the same time while ordering for preservation, of call\n                                  records of a party, the right of privacy has to be duly considered\n                                  and directions for preservation of call records cannot be passed on\n                                  purely vague and specious pleas of the petitioner.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the production of\n                          call data records is very much important and imperative to decide the\n                          lis pending adjudication between the parties before the Family Court.\n                          It is further submitted that the Family Court has completely\n                          disregarded the fact that the petitioner has produced the WhatsApp\n                          messages, photographs and police complaints to prima facie prove that\n                          respondent No. 1 is indulging in an adulterous relationship with\n                          respondent No. 2. It is also submitted that petitioner has placed on\n                          record of the Family Court various video and audio recordings,\n                          WhatsApp messages from respondent No. 1 to the petitioner\n                          apologizing and admitting to her illicit and adulterous relationship\n                          with respondent No. 2.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                          CM(M) 2301/2024                                                            Page 3 of 14</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">By:SUNITA KUMARI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Signing Date:10.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">19:15:28</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                           6.      It is argued that the learned Family Court erred in prejudging\n                          lis/issues before it by rendering a finding that the photographs\n                          revealed that there were friendly relations between both the families\n                          and that photographs reveal that petitioner and respondent No. 2 used\n                          to meet frequently with their spouses. The reasoning given by the\n                          learned Family Court that if the respondents are meeting frequently\n                          and were having good relations, then the duration of phone calls\n                          would not show that there was adulterous relationship. It is argued that\n                          the duration of the mobile calls as well as the intensity and talking at\n                          odd hours would lend credence to the factum of an illicit relationship\n                          between the two respondents. It is submitted that a married man\n                          talking to a married lady, not being his wife at odd hours and that too\n                          for long duration lends corroboration to the other evidences of\n                          adultery and the same would be adjudicated upon after a full-fledged\n                          trial, and therefore, to pre-judge the issue now by saying that the\n                          phone calls shall not in any manner prove an adulterous relationship is\n                          travesty of justice and is an attempt on the part of the Family Court to\n                          render a finding without the evidence being on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">                          7.      Learned counsel for petitioner further submits that respondent\n                          No. 1 had also been using the mobile phone registered in the name of\n                          her mother to make calls to respondent No. 2 after the discovery of her\n                          illicit relationship with respondent No. 2. With regard to the right to\n                          privacy, it has been argued that the right of fair trial would supersede\n                          the right of privacy.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                          CM(M) 2301/2024                                                Page 4 of 14</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">By:SUNITA KUMARI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signing Date:10.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">19:15:28</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                           8.

It is submitted that the application filed by the\n                          petitioner fails to prima facie corroborate the allegations with any\n                          proof and just make generic averments. In the absence of proof of\n                          foundational facts alleging adultery, the application for summoning\n                          the CDR is nothing but an abuse of process of law. It is argued that in\n                          his application, petitioner has asked for the blanket relief seeking call\n                          records for the past two years, which is untenable. No specific date,\n                          time and place in respect of call records have been sought which goes\n                          to prove that the CDR application is nothing but a fishing exercise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">                          12.     It is submitted by the learned counsel for respondents that\n                          respondent No. 2 is a close friend of the petitioner. Both the families\n                          were on visiting terms with each other and shared close relationship.\n                          They even used to go together on family holiday trips, and therefore\n                          that being so, there was nothing unnatural that the parties used to have\n                          exchange of phone calls. The duration of the phone calls or the time of\n                          phone calls cannot in any manner show that there was adulterous\n                          relationship between the respondents. According to the learned\n                          counsel, even the tower locations would coincide many a times as\n                          respondents were at the same place partying together with friends and\n                          families. It is submitted that in the photographs, petitioner and\n                          respondent No. 1 can be seen sharing company with respondent No. 2\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                          CM(M) 2301/2024                                                 Page 6 of 14</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">By:SUNITA KUMARI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signing Date:10.03.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">19:15:28</span>\n                           and his wife during good times. The WhatsApp conversations and\n                          recordings do not in any manner show that respondents were having\n                          adulterous relationship with each other. Rather, in one of the\n                          WhatsApp chats, respondent No. 1 has clarified that she has never\n                          crossed the boundary. It is thus submitted that prima facie, there is no\n                          evidence that the respondents were into adulterous relationship.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                          13.     It is argued that the impugned order does not suffer from any\n                          illegality/perversity, and therefore, does not call for any interference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          14.     Learned counsel, appearing for respondent No. 2, submits that it\n                          is basically a dispute between petitioner and respondent No. 1. He is a\n                          stranger to the disputes. His privacy cannot be permitted to be violated\n                          on the specious plea of the petitioner that he wants to prove the illicit\n                          relationship between the respondents. It is further submitted that right\n                          to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

While a litigating party certainly has a right to privacy, that\n                                  right must yield to the right of an opposing party to bring evidence\n                                  it considers relevant to court, to prove its case. It is a critical part of\n                                  the hallowed concept of fair trial that a litigating party gets a fair\n                                  chance to bring relevant evidence before court. It is important to\n                                  appreciate that while the right to privacy is essentially a personal\n                                  right, the right to a fair trial has wider ramifications and impacts\n                                  public justice, which is a larger cause. The cause of public justice\n                                  would suffer if the opportunity of fair trial is denied by shutting-out\n                                  evidence that a litigating party may wish to lead at the very\n                                  threshold.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131068451\" id=\"span_62\">24.

It must not be forgotten that no single value, no matter\n                                  exalted, can bear the full burden of upholding a democratic system\n                                  of government. Underlying our constitutional system are a number\n                                  of important values, all of which help to guarantee our liberties, but\n                                  in ways which sometimes conflict. Under of Constitution, probably,\n                                  no values are absolute. All important values, therefore, must be\n                                  qualified and balanced against other important, and often\n                                  competing, values. This process of definition, qualification and\n                                  balancing is as much required with respect to the value of freedom\n                                  of expression as it is for other values. Consequently, free speech, in\n                                  appropriate cases, has got to correlate with fair trial. It also follows\n                                  that in an appropriate case one right (say freedom of expression)\n                                  may have to yield to the other right like right to a fair trial. Further,\n                                  even <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">21</a> are subject to the test of reasonableness\n                                  after the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_34\">Maneka Gandhi v.

However, the screen-shots of the WhatsApp conversations\n                          do show that the relationship between petitioner and respondent No. 1\n                          was not very cordial and there were some exchange of words on\n                          account of the reasons that respondent wanted to have a tattoo of &quot;S&quot;,\n                          which the petitioner suspects to be the first letter of the name of\n                          respondent No. 2.
