Normally, when an appellate court exercises\n               appellate jurisdiction, the duty of the appellate\n               court is to find out whether the verdict which is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">               under challenge is correct or incorrect in law and\n\n\n\n\n\n               on facts. The appellate court normally ascertains\n               whether the decision under challenge is legal or\n               illegal. But while dealing with an appeal against\n               acquittal, the appellate court cannot examine the\n\n\n\n\n\n               impugned judgment only to find out whether the\n               view taken was correct or incorrect.          After\n               reappreciating the oral and documentary\n               evidence, the appellate court must first decide\n               whether the trial court&#x27;s view was a possible\n\n\n\n\n\n               view.     The appellate court cannot overturn\n               acquittal only on the ground that after\n               reappreciating evidence, it is of the view that the\n               guilt of the accused was established beyond a\n               reasonable doubt.       Only recording such a\n\n               conclusion an order of acquittal cannot be\n               reversed unless the appellate court also\n\n               concludes that it was the only possible\n               conclusion. Thus, the appellate court must see\n               whether the view taken by the trial court while\n               acquitting an accused can be reasonably taken\n               on the basis of the evidence on record. If the\n\n\n               view taken by the trial court is a possible view,\n               the appellate court cannot interfere with the\n               order of acquittal on the ground that another\n               view could have been taken.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">    12.

Further, if two views were possible on\n\n    the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court\n\n    should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the\n\n    Trial Court, merely, because the Appellate Court could have\n\n    arrived at a different conclusion than that of the Trial Court.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 15/07/2024 20:30:21 :::CIS</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                                      11                      ( 2024:HHC:5102 )\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">    13.
