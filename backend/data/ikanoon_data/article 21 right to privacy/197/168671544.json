Introduction\n\n\n      Not for nothing, the great German thinker, Johann Wolfgang\n\nvon Goethe, had said, ―I am what I am, so take me as I am‖ and\n\nsimilarly, Arthur Schopenhauer had pronounced, ―No one can escape\n\nfrom their individuality‖. In this regard, it is profitable to quote a few\n\nlines from John Stuart Mill:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      ―But society has now fairly got the better of individuality;\n      and the danger which threatens human nature is not\n      the excess, but the deficiency of personal impulses\n      and preferences.‖\n\n      The emphasis on the unique being of an individual is the salt of\n\nhis/her life. Denial of self-expression is inviting death. Irreplaceability\n\nof individuality and identity is grant of respect to self. This realization\n\nis one‘s signature and self-determined design. One defines oneself.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">That is the glorious form of individuality. In the present case, our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\ndeliberation and focus on the said concept shall be from various\n\nspectrums.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">2.    Shakespeare through one of his characters in a play says\n\n―What‘s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name\n\nwould smell as sweet‖. The said phrase, in its basic sense, conveys\n\nthat what really matters is the essential qualities of the substance and\n\nthe fundamental characteristics of an entity but not the name by\n\nwhich it or a person is called. Getting further deeper into the meaning,\n\nit is understood that the name may be a convenient concept for\n\nidentification but the essence behind the same is the core of identity.\n\nSans identity, the name only remains a denotative term. Therefore,\n\nthe identity is pivotal to one‘s being. Life bestows honour on it and\n\nfreedom of living, as a facet of life, expresses genuine desire to have\n\nit. The said desire, one is inclined to think, is satisfied by the\n\nconception of constitutional recognition, and hence, emphasis is laid\n\non the identity of an individual which is conceived under the\n\nConstitution. And the sustenance of identity is the filament of life. It is\n\nequivalent to authoring one‘s own life script where freedom broadens\n\neveryday. Identity is equivalent to divinity.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    5</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">3.    The overarching ideals of individual autonomy and liberty,\n\nequality for all sans discrimination of any kind, recognition of identity\n\nwith dignity and privacy of human beings constitute the cardinal four\n\ncorners of our monumental Constitution forming the concrete\n\nsubstratum of our fundamental rights that has eluded certain sections\n\nof our society who are still living in the bondage of dogmatic social\n\nnorms, prejudiced notions, rigid stereotypes, parochial mindset and\n\nbigoted perceptions. Social exclusion, identity seclusion and isolation\n\nfrom the social mainstream are still the stark realities faced by\n\nindividuals today and it is only when each and every individual is\n\nliberated from the shackles of such bondage and is able to work\n\ntowards full development of his/her personality that we can call\n\nourselves a truly free society.    The first step on the long path to\n\nacceptance of the diversity and variegated hues that nature has\n\ncreated has to be taken now by vanquishing the enemies of prejudice\n\nand injustice and undoing the wrongs done so as to make way for a\n\nprogressive and inclusive realisation of social and economic rights\n\nembracing all and to begin a dialogue for ensuring equal rights and\n\nopportunities for the ―less than equal‖ sections of the society. We\n\nhave to bid adieu to the perceptions, stereotypes and prejudices\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                      6</span>\n\n\ndeeply ingrained in the societal mindset so as to usher in inclusivity in\n\nall spheres and empower all citizens alike without any kind of\n\nalienation and discrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">4.        The natural identity of an individual should be treated to be\n\nabsolutely essential to his being. What nature gives is natural. That\n\nis called nature within. Thus, that part of the personality of a person\n\nhas to be respected and not despised or looked down upon. The said\n\ninherent nature and the associated natural impulses in that regard are\n\nto be accepted. Non-acceptance of it by any societal norm or notion\n\nand punishment by law on some obsolete idea and idealism affects\n\nthe kernel of the identity of an individual. Destruction of individual\n\nidentity would tantamount to crushing of intrinsic dignity that\n\ncumulatively encapsulates the values of privacy, choice, freedom of\n\nspeech and other expressions. It can be viewed from another angle.\n\nAn individual in exercise of his choice may feel that he/she should be\n\nleft alone but no one, and we mean, no one, should impose solitude\n\non him/her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_10\">5.        The eminence of identity has been luculently stated in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_6\">National\n\nLegal Services Authority v. Union of India</a> and others1, popularly\n\n\n1   (2014) 5 SCC 438\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\nknown as NALSA case, wherein the Court was dwelling upon the\n\nstatus of identity of the transgenders. Radhakrishnan, J., after\n\nreferring to catena of judgments and certain International Covenants,\n\nopined that gender identity is one of the most fundamental aspects of\n\nlife which refers to a person‘s intrinsic sense of being male, female or\n\ntransgender or transsexual person. A person‘s sex is usually\n\nassigned at birth, but a relatively small group of persons may be born\n\nwith bodies which incorporate both or certain aspects of both male\n\nand female physiology. The learned Judge further observed that at\n\ntimes, genital anatomy problems may arise in certain persons in the\n\nsense that their innate perception of themselves is not in conformity\n\nwith the sex assigned to them at birth and may include pre-and post-\n\noperative transsexual persons and also persons who do not choose\n\nto undergo or do not have access to operation and also include\n\npersons who cannot undergo successful operation. Elaborating\n\nfurther, he said:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      ―Gender identity refers to each person‘s deeply felt\n      internal and individual experience of gender, which\n      may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at\n      birth, including the personal sense of the body which\n      may involve a freely chosen, modification of bodily\n      appearance or functions by medical, surgical or other\n      means and other expressions of gender, including\n      dress, speech and mannerisms. Gender identity,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n\n      therefore, refers to an individual‘s self-identification as\n      a man, woman, transgender or other identified\n      category.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">6.    Adverting to the concept of discrimination, he stated:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      ―The discrimination on the ground of ―sex‖ under\n      <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_7\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_8\">16</a>, therefore, includes discrimination\n      on the ground of gender identity. The expression ―sex‖\n      used in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_10\">16</a> is not just limited to\n      biological sex of male or female, but intended to\n      include people who consider themselves to be neither\n      male nor female.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">7.    Dealing with the legality of transgender identity, Radhakrishnan,\n\nJ. ruled:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      ―The self-identified gender can be either male or\n      female or a third gender. Hijras are identified as\n      persons of third gender and are not identified either as\n      male or female. Gender identity, as already indicated,\n      refers to a person‘s internal sense of being male,\n      female or a transgender, for example hijras do not\n      identify as female because of their lack of female\n      genitalia or lack of reproductive capability. This\n      distinction makes them separate from both male and\n      female genders and they consider themselves neither\n      man nor woman, but a ―third gender‖.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">8.    Sikri, J., in his concurring opinion, dwelling upon the rights of\n\ntransgenders, laid down that gender identification is an essential\n\ncomponent which is required for enjoying civil rights by the\n\ncommunity. It is only with this recognition that many rights attached to\n\nthe sexual recognition as ―third gender‖ would be available to the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                     9</span>\n\n\ncommunity more meaningfully viz. the right to vote, the right to own\n\nproperty, the right to marry, the right to claim a formal identity through\n\na passport and a ration card, a driver‘s licence, the right to education,\n\nemployment, health and so on. Emphasising on the aspect of human\n\nrights, he observed:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      ―…there seems to be no reason why a transgender\n      must be denied of basic human rights which includes\n      right to life and liberty with dignity, right to privacy and\n      freedom of expression, right to education and\n      empowerment, right against violence, right against\n      exploitation and right against discrimination. The\n      Constitution has fulfilled its duty of providing rights to\n      transgenders. Now it is time for us to recognise this\n      and to extend and interpret the Constitution in such a\n      manner to ensure a dignified life for transgender\n      people. All this can be achieved if the beginning is\n      made with the recognition of TG as third gender.‖\n\n      The aforesaid judgment, as is manifest, lays focus on\n\ninalienable ―gender identity‖ and correctly connects with human rights\n\nand the constitutionally guaranteed right to life and liberty with dignity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">It lays stress on the judicial recognition of such rights as an\n\ninextricable component of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and decries\n\nany discrimination as that would offend <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 14</a>, the ―fon juris‖ of\n\nour Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100472805\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_15\">9.    It has to be borne in mind that search for identity as a basic\n\nhuman ideal has reigned the mind of every individual in many a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n\nsphere like success, fame, economic prowess, political assertion,\n\ncelebrity status and social superiority, etc. But search for identity, in\n\norder to have apposite space in law, sans stigmas and sans fear has\n\nto have the freedom of expression about his/her being which is\n\nkeenly associated with the constitutional concept of ―identity with\n\ndignity‖. When we talk about identity from the constitutional spectrum,\n\nit cannot be pigeon-holed singularly to one‘s orientation that may be\n\nassociated with his/her birth and the feelings he/she develops when\n\nhe/she grows up. Such a narrow perception may initially sound to\n\nsubserve the purpose of justice but on a studied scrutiny, it is soon\n\nrealized that the limited recognition keeps the individual choice at\n\nbay. The question that is required to be posed here is whether sexual\n\norientation alone is to be protected or both orientation and choice are\n\nto be accepted as long as the exercise of these rights by an individual\n\ndo not affect another‘s choice or, to put it succinctly, has the consent\n\nof the other where dignity of both is maintained and privacy, as a\n\nseminal facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a>, is not dented. At the core of the concept of\n\nidentity lies self-determination, realization of one‘s own abilities\n\nvisualizing the opportunities and rejection of external views with a\n\nclear conscience that is in accord with constitutional norms and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                      11</span>\n\n\nvalues or principles that are, to put in a capsule, ―constitutionally\n\npermissible‖. As long as it is lawful, one is entitled to determine and\n\nfollow his/her pattern of life. And that is where the distinction between\n\nconstitutional morality and social morality or ethicality assumes a\n\ndistinguished podium, a different objective. Non-recognition in the\n\nfullest sense and denial of expression of choice by a statutory penal\n\nprovision and giving of stamp of approval by a two-Judge Bench of\n\nthis Court to the said penal provision, that is, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 377</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_15\">Suresh Kumar Koushal and another v.

Similarly, though a\n\nprovision on the statute book is not invoked on many occasions, yet it\n\ndoes not fall into the sphere of the doctrine of desuetude. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_27\"><a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_28\">However,\n\nSuresh Koushal</a>&#x27;s case has been guided by the aforesaid doctrine of\n\ndesuetude.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n5   [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                   14</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">12.   Appreciating the said submissions, the three-Judge Bench\n\nstated that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      ―Certain other aspects need to be noted. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 377</a>\n      IPC uses the phraseology ―carnal intercourse against\n      the order of nature‖. The determination of order of\n      nature is not a constant phenomenon. Social morality\n      also changes from age to age. The law copes with life\n      and accordingly change takes place. The morality that\n      public perceives, the Constitution may not conceive of.\n      The individual autonomy and also individual orientation\n      cannot be atrophied unless the restriction is regarded\n      as reasonable to yield to the morality of the\n      Constitution. What is natural to one may not be natural\n      to the other but the said natural orientation and choice\n      cannot be allowed to cross the boundaries of law and\n      as the confines of law cannot tamper or curtail the\n      inherent right embedded in an individual under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article\n      21</a> of the Constitution. A section of people or\n      individuals who exercise their choice should never\n      remain in a state of fear. When we say so, we may not\n      be understood to have stated that there should not be\n      fear of law because fear of law builds civilised society.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">      But that law must have the acceptability of the\n      Constitutional parameters.

As far as the first aspect is\n      concerned, that is absolutely beyond debate. As far as\n      the second aspect is concerned, that needs to be\n      debated.

It is submitted on behalf of the petitioners and the intervenors\n\nthat homosexuality, bisexuality and other sexual orientations are\n\nequally natural and reflective of expression of choice and inclination\n\nfounded on consent of two persons who are eligible in law to express\n\nsuch consent and it is neither a physical nor a mental illness, rather\n\nthey are natural variations of expression and free thinking process\n\nand to make it a criminal offence is offensive of the well established\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                   17</span>\n\n\nprinciples pertaining to individual dignity and decisional autonomy\n\ninherent in the personality of a person, a great discomfort to gender\n\nidentity, destruction of the right to privacy which is a pivotal facet of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, unpalatable to the highly cherished idea\n\nof freedom and a trauma to the conception of expression of biological\n\ndesire which revolves around the pattern of mosaic of true\n\nmanifestation of identity. That apart, the phrase ―order of nature‖ is\n\nlimited to the procreative concept that may have been conceived as\n\nnatural by a systemic conservative approach and such limitations do\n\nnot really take note of inborn traits or developed orientations or, for\n\nthat matter, consensual acts which relate to responses to series of\n\nfree exercise of assertions of one‘s bodily autonomy. It is further\n\nargued that their growth of personality, relation building endeavour to\n\nenter into a live-in relationship or to form an association with a sense\n\nof commonality have become a mirage and the essential desires are\n\ncrippled which violates <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. It is urged\n\nthat the American Psychological Association has opined that sexual\n\norientation is a natural condition and attraction towards the same sex\n\nor opposite sex are both naturally equal, the only difference being\n\nthat the same sex attraction arises in far lesser numbers.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                      18</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192421140\" id=\"span_34\">16.       The petitioners have highlighted that the rights of the lesbian,\n\ngay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, who comprise 7-\n\n8% of the total Indian population, need to be recognized and\n\nprotected, for sexual orientation is an integral and innate facet of\n\nevery individual‘s identity. A person belonging to the said community\n\ndoes not become an alien to the concept of individual and his\n\nindividualism cannot be viewed with a stigma. The impact of sexual\n\norientation on an individual‘s life is not limited to their intimate lives\n\nbut also impacts their family, professional, social and educational life.\n\nAs per the petitioners, such individuals (sexual minorities in societies)\n\nneed protection more than the heterosexuals so as to enable them to\n\nachieve their full potential and to live freely without fear,\n\napprehension or trepidation in such a manner that they are not\n\ndiscriminated against by the society openly or insidiously or by the\n\nState in multifarious ways in matters such as employment, choice of\n\npartner, testamentary rights, insurability, medical treatment in\n\nhospitals and other similar rights arising from live-in relationships\n\nwhich, after the decision in <a href=\"/doc/192421140/\" id=\"a_35\">Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma</a> 6 , is\n\nrecognized even by the ―Protection of Women from Domestic\n\n\n6   (2013) 15 SCC 755\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                  19</span>\n\n\nViolence Act, 2005‖ for various kinds of live-in relationships. The\n\nsame protection, as per the petitioners, must be accorded to same\n\nsex relationships.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">17.   It is urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners that\n\nindividuals belonging to the LGBT group suffer discrimination and\n\nabuse throughout their lives due to the existence of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\nwhich is nothing but a manifestation of a mindset of societal values\n\nprevalent during the Victorian era where sexual activities were\n\nconsidered mainly for procreation. The said community remains in a\n\nconstant state of fear which is not conducive for their growth. It is\n\ncontended that they suffer at the hands of law and are also deprived\n\nof the citizenry rights which are protected under the Constitution. The\n\nlaw should have treated them as natural victims and sensitized the\n\nsociety towards their plight and laid stress on such victimisation,\n\nhowever, the reverse is being done due to which a sense of\n\nestrangement and alienation has developed and continues to prevail\n\namongst the members belonging to the LGBT group. Compulsory\n\nalienation due to stigma and threat is contrary to the fundamental\n\nprinciple of liberty.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                  20</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">18.   The petitioners have referred to the decision of this Court in\n\nNALSA case wherein transgenders have been recognized as a third\n\ngender apart from male and female and have been given certain\n\nrights. Yet, in view of the existence of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 377</a> in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a>,\n\nconsensual activities amongst transgenders would continue to\n\nconstitute an offence. Drawing inspiration from the NALSA case, the\n\npetitioners submit that the rights of the LGBT group are not fully\n\nrealized and they remain incomplete citizens because their\n\nexpression as regards sexuality is not allowed to be pronounced\n\nowing to the criminality attached to the sexual acts between these\n\npersons which deserves to be given a burial and, therefore, the rights\n\nof the LGBT community also need equal, if not more, constitutional\n\nprotection. Accordingly, the petitioners are of the view that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n\n377</a> of the IPC be read down qua the LGBT community so as to\n\nconfine it only to the offence of bestiality and non-consensual acts in\n\nview of the fact that with the coming into force of the <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_40\">Criminal Law\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2013</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_41\">Protection of Children from Sexual\n\nOffences Act, 2012</a> <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_42\">(POCSO Act</a>), the scope of sexual assault has\n\nbeen widened to include non peno-vaginal sexual assault and also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                    21</span>\n\n\ncriminalize non-consensual sexual acts between children thereby\n\nplugging important gaps in the law governing sexual violence in India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">19.   The petitioners have also submitted that Section 377, despite\n\nbeing a pre-constitutional law, was retained post the Constitution\n\ncoming into effect by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 372</a> of the Constitution, but it\n\nmust be noted that the presumption of constitutionality is merely an\n\nevidentiary burden initially on the person seeking to challenge the\n\nvires of a statute and once any violation of fundamental rights or\n\nsuspect classification is prima facie shown, then such presumption\n\nhas no role. In the case at hand, the petitioners face a violation of\n\ntheir fundamental rights to an extent which is manifestly clear and it is\n\na violation which strikes at the very root or substratum of their\n\nexistence. The discrimination suffered at the hands of the majority,\n\nthe onslaught to their dignity and invasion on the right to privacy is\n\ndemonstrably visible and permeates every nook and corner of the\n\nsociety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">20. It is the argument of the petitioners that Section 377, if retained in\n\nits present form, would involve the violation of, not one but, several\n\nfundamental rights of the LGBTs, namely, right to privacy, right to\n\ndignity, equality, liberty and right to freedom of expression. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                   22</span>\n\n\npetitioners contend that sexual orientation which is a natural corollary\n\nof gender identity is protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and\n\nany discrimination meted out to the LGBT community on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation would run counter to the mandate provided under\n\nthe Constitution and the said view has also gained approval of this\n\nCourt in the NALSA case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_39\">21. The petitioners have also relied upon the view in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_45\">K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy</a> (supra) to advance their argument that sexual\n\norientation is also an essential attribute of privacy. Therefore,\n\nprotection of both sexual orientation and right to privacy of an\n\nindividual is extremely important, for without the enjoyment of these\n\nbasic   and   fundamental    rights,    individual   identity   may   lose\n\nsignificance, a sense of trepidation may take over and their existence\n\nwould be reduced to mere survival.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_40\">It is further urged that sexual\n\norientation and privacy lie at the core of the fundamental rights which\n\nare guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_46\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_47\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">21</a> of the Constitution and\n\nin the light of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_49\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra), it has become\n\nimperative that Section 377 be struck down. It is contended that the\n\nright to privacy has to take within its ambit and sweep the right of\n\nevery individual, including LGBTs, to make decisions as per their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                           23</span>\n\n\nchoice without the fear that they may be subjected to humiliation or\n\nshunned by the society merely because of a certain choice or manner\n\nof living.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">22. Having canvassed with vehemence that sexual orientation is an\n\nimportant facet of the right to privacy which has been raised to the\n\npedestal of a cherished right, the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nhave vigorously propounded that sexual autonomy and the right to\n\nchoose a partner of one‘s choice is an inherent aspect of the right to\n\nlife and right to autonomy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"18303067\" id=\"span_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"92846055\" id=\"span_43\">In furtherance of the said view, they have\n\nrelied upon the authorities in <a href=\"/doc/92846055/\" id=\"a_50\">Shakti Vahini v. Union of India and\n\nothers</a> 7 and <a href=\"/doc/18303067/\" id=\"a_51\">Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M.</a> 8 wherein it has been\n\nclearly recognized that an individual‘s exercise of choice in choosing\n\na partner is a feature of dignity and, therefore, it is protected under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_52\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">21</a> of the Constitution.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199141576\" id=\"span_44\">23. According to the petitioners, there is no difference between\n\npersons who defy social conventions to enter into inter-religious and\n\ninter-caste marriages and those who choose a same sex partner in\n\nthe sense that the society may disapprove of inter-caste or inter-\n\nreligious marriages but this Court is for enforcing constitutional rights.\n\n7(2018)  7 SCC 192\n8AIR   2018 SC 1933 : 2018 (5) SCALE 422\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                  24</span>\n\n\nSimilarly, as per the petitioners, even if there is disapproval by the\n\nmajority of the sexual orientation or exercise of choice by the LGBT\n\npersons, the Court as the final arbiter of the constitutional rights,\n\nshould disregard social morality and uphold and protect constitutional\n\nmorality which has been adverted to by this Court in several cases,\n\nincluding <a href=\"/doc/199141576/\" id=\"a_54\">Manoj Narula v. Union of India9</a>, for that is the governing\n\nrule.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_46\">It is argued that the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_55\">Naz Foundation</a> (supra)\n\nhas referred to and analysed the concept of constitutional morality\n\nand ultimately struck down <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 377</a> IPC clearly stating that carnal\n\nintercourse between homosexuals and heterosexuals with consent\n\ncannot be an offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_48\">24. The LGBT persons cannot, according to the petitioners, be\n\npenalized simply for choosing a same sex partner, for the\n\nconstitutional guarantee of choice of partner extends to the LGBT\n\npersons as well. Learned counsel for the petitioners and the\n\nsupporting intervenors have submitted that sexual orientation, being\n\nan innate facet of individual identity, is protected under the right to\n\ndignity. To bolster the said argument, reliance has been placed upon\n\n<a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_57\">Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi</a>\n\n\n9   (2014) 9 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                      25</span>\n\n\nand others10 and <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_58\">Common Cause (A Registered Society) v. Union\n\nof India</a> and another11 wherein it was held that the right to life and\n\nliberty, as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21</a>, is meaningless unless it\n\nencompasses within its sphere individual dignity and right to dignity\n\nincludes the right to carry such functions and activities as would\n\nconstitute the meaningful expression of the human self.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">25.        It is submitted that Section 377 is an anathema to the concept\n\nof fraternity as enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution and the\n\nIndian Constitution mandates that we must promote fraternity\n\namongst the citizens sans which unity shall remain a distant dream.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_50\">26. The petitioners have further contended that Section 377 is\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as the said Section is vague\n\nin the sense that carnal intercourse against the order of nature is\n\nneither defined in the Section nor in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_61\">IPC</a> or, for that matter, any\n\nother law. There is, as per the petitioners, no intelligible differentia or\n\nreasonable classification between natural and unnatural sex as long\n\nas it is consensual in view of the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/845216/\" id=\"a_62\">Anuj Garg\n\nand others v. Hotel Association of India</a> and others12 which lays\n\ndown the principle that classification which may have been treated as\n10(1981) 1 SCC 608\n11(2018) 5 SCC 1\n12(2008) 3 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                        26</span>\n\n\nvalid at the time of its adoption may cease to be so on account of\n\nchanging social norms.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_52\">27. Section 377, as argued by the petitioners, is manifestly arbitrary\n\nand over-broad and for the said purpose, immense inspiration has\n\nbeen drawn from the principles stated in <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_63\">Shayara Bano v. Union of\n\nIndia</a> and others13 , for making consensual relationship a crime on\n\nthe ground that it is against the order of nature suffers from manifest\n\narbitrariness at the fulcrum.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">28.        It is the case of the petitioners that Section 377 violates <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_64\">Article\n\n15</a> of the Constitution since there is discrimination inherent in it based\n\non the sex of a person‘s sexual partner as under Section 376(c) to (e),\n\na person can be prosecuted for acts done with an opposite sex\n\npartner without her consent, whereas the same acts if done with a\n\nsame-sex partner are criminalized even if the partner consents. The\n\npetitioners have drawn the attention of this Court to the Justice J.S\n\nVerma Committee on Amendments to Criminal Law which had\n\nobserved that ‗sex‘ occurring in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 15</a> includes sexual orientation\n\nand, thus, as per the petitioners, Section 377 is also violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution on this count.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">\n13(2017)   9 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                       27</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1327342\" id=\"span_54\">29.        It is argued with astuteness that Section 377 has a chilling\n\neffect on <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution which protects the\n\nfundamental right of freedom of expression including that of LGBT\n\npersons to express their sexual identity and orientation, through\n\nspeech,          choice   of   romantic/sexual   partner,   expression   of\n\nromantic/sexual desire, acknowledgment of relationships or any other\n\nmeans and that Section 377 constitutes an unreasonable exception\n\nand is thereby not covered under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. To\n\nbuttress the said stance, reliance is placed upon the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1327342/\" id=\"a_69\">S.\n\nKhushboo v. Kanniammal</a> and another14 wherein it has been held\n\nthat law should not be used in such a manner that it has a chilling\n\neffect on the freedom of speech and expression.</span> Additionally, the\n\nview in NALSA case has also been strongly pressed into service to\n\nemphasize that the said decision clearly spells out that the right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> includes one‘s right to expression of his/her self-\n\nidentified gender which can be expressed through words, action,\n\nbehaviour or any other form.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">30. The petitioners have also contended that Section 377 violates the\n\nrights of LGBT persons under <a href=\"/doc/445304/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 19(1)(c)</a> and denies them the\n\n\n14(2010)   5 SCC 600\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                     28</span>\n\n\nright to form associations. Similarly, such persons are hesitant to\n\nregister companies to provide benefits to sexual minorities due to the\n\nfear of state action and social stigma. Further, a conviction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 377</a> IPC renders such persons ineligible for appointment as a\n\ndirector of a company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"194914590\" id=\"span_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172073149\" id=\"span_57\">31.        It is averred that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 377</a> IPC, by creating a taint of\n\ncriminality, deprives the LGBT persons of their right to reputation\n\nwhich is a facet of the right to life and liberty of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution as observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/172073149/\" id=\"a_75\">Kishore Samrite v.\n\nState of U.P.</a> and others15 and <a href=\"/doc/194914590/\" id=\"a_76\">Umesh Kumar v. State of Andhra\n\nPradesh</a> and another16 to the effect that reputation is an element of\n\npersonal security and protected by the Constitution with the right to\n\nenjoyment of life and liberty. This right, as per the petitioners, is being\n\ndenied to the LGBT persons because of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 377</a> IPC as it makes\n\nthem apprehensive to speak openly about their sexual orientation and\n\nmakes them vulnerable to extortion, blackmail and denial of State\n\nmachinery for either protection or for enjoyment of other rights and\n\namenities and on certain occasions, the other concomitant rights are\n\naffected.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">15(2013)   2 SCC 398\n16(2013)   10 SCC 591\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                    29</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">32.   The petitioners have advanced their argument that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 377</a>\n\nIPC impedes the ability of the LGBTs to realize the constitutionally\n\nguaranteed right to shelter. To illustrate the same, the petitioners\n\nhave drawn the attention of the Court to the fact that LGBTs seek\n\nassistance of private resources such as Gay Housing Assistance\n\nResources (GHAR) in order to access safe and suitable shelter and\n\nthis is an indication that the members of this community are in need\n\nof immediate care and protection of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_59\">33. The decision in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_79\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra), as per the petitioners,\n\nis per incuriam as the view observed therein has failed to take into\n\naccount the amendment to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 375</a> IPC which has rendered\n\nsexual ‗carnal intercourse against the order of nature‘ between man\n\nand woman as permissible. Section 377, on the other hand, has\n\ncontinued to render same sex carnal intercourse as an offence, even\n\nif it is consensual. Further, the petitioners have assailed the decision\n\nof this Court in Suresh Koushal’s case on the ground that the view\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_81\">the said decision</a> on classification is contrary to the ‗impact or effect\n\ntest‘, for the result, in ultimate eventuality, leads to discrimination.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_62\">Thus, the petitioners have contended that after <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_82\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra),\n\nthe view in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_83\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra) needs to be overruled and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                   30</span>\n\n\nproper test would be whether <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 377</a> IPC can be enacted by the\n\nParliament today after the decisions of this Court in NALSA (supra)\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_85\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra) and other authorities laying immense\n\nemphasis on individual choice.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_64\">34.   It is further contended that LGBT persons are deprived of their\n\nrights due to the presence of Section 377 as they fear prosecution\n\nand persecution upon revealing their sexual identities and, therefore,\n\nthis class of persons never approached this Court as petitioners,\n\nrather they have always relied upon their teachers, parents, mental\n\nhealth professionals and other organizations such as NGOs to speak\n\non their behalf. It is urged that the appellants in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_86\">Suresh Koushal</a>\n\n(supra) led this Court to assume that LGBT persons constitute only a\n\nminuscule fraction whereas most of the studies indicate that they\n\nconstitute at least 7-8% of the population and that apart, rights are\n\nnot determined on the basis of percentage of populace but on a real\n\nscrutiny of the existence of right and denial of the same. It is the\n\nstand of the petitioners that majority perception or view cannot be the\n\nguiding factor for sustaining the constitutionality of a provision or to\n\ndeclare a provision as unconstitutional.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                    31</span><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n\nD.

The respondent, Union of India, has, vide affidavit dated 11th\n\nJuly, 2018, submitted that the matter at hand was referred to a\n\nConstitution Bench to decide as to whether the law <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_87\">laid down in</a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_88\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra) is correct or not and the only question\n\nreferred to this Bench is the question of the constitutional validity of\n\ncriminalizing &#x27;consensual acts of adults in private&#x27; falling under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 377</a> IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">36.    Further, the Union has submitted that so far as the\n\nconstitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 377</a> IPC, to the extent it applies to\n\n&#x27;consensual acts of adults in private&#x27;, is concerned, the respondent\n\nleaves the same to the wisdom of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">37.    The respondent has also contended that in the event <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_91\">Section\n\n377</a> IPC so far as &#x27;consensual acts of adults in private&#x27; is declared\n\nunconstitutional, other ancillary issues or rights which have not been\n\nreferred to this Bench for adjudication may not be dealt with by this\n\nBench as <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_92\">in that case</a>, the Union of India expresses the wish to file\n\ndetailed affidavit in reply, for consideration of other issues and rights\n\nwould have far reaching and wide ramifications under various other\n\nlaws    and   will   also   have   consequences    which   are   neither\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                    32</span>\n\n\ncontemplated in the reference nor required to be answered by this\n\nHon‘ble Bench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">38.   The respondent has submitted that allowing any other issue\n\n(other than the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 377</a> IPC) to be argued\n\nand adjudicating the same without giving an opportunity to the Union\n\nof India to file a counter affidavit may not be in the interest of justice\n\nand would be violative of the principles of natural justice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_68\">39.   Another set of written submissions has been filed by Shri K.\n\nRadhakrishnan, senior counsel, on behalf of intervenor-NGO, Trust\n\nGod Ministries. The said intervenor has submitted that the\n\nobservations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_94\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra), particularly in Para\n\n146, virtually pre-empt and forestall the aforesaid NGO from raising\n\nsubstantial contentions to the effect that there is no uncanalised and\n\nunbridled right to privacy and the said right cannot be abused. Further,\n\nthe intervenor has contended that there is no personal liberty to\n\nabuse one‘s organs and that the offensive acts proscribed by <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_95\">Section\n\n377</a> IPC are committed by abusing the organs. Such acts, as per the\n\nintervenor, are undignified and derogatory to the constitutional\n\nconcept of dignity and if any infraction is caused to the concept of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                   33</span>\n\n\ndignity,   then   it   would   amount   to   constitutional   wrong   and\n\nconstitutional immorality.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">40.   It is also the case of the intervenor that issues pertaining to the\n\nconstitutional and other legal rights of the transgender community,\n\ntheir gender identity and sexual orientation have been exhaustively\n\nconsidered in the light of the various provisions of the Constitution\n\nand, accordingly, reliefs have been granted by this Court in NALSA\n\n(supra). It is contended by the intervenor that no further reliefs can be\n\ngranted to them and the prayers made by them is only to abuse\n\nprivacy and personal liberty by transgressing the concepts of dignity\n\nand public morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">41.   As per the intervenor, Section 377 rightly makes the acts stated\n\ntherein punishable as Section 377 has been incorporated after taking\n\nnote of the legal systems and principles which prevailed in ancient\n\nIndia and now in 2018, the said Section is more relevant legally,\n\nmedically, morally and constitutionally.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">42.   To illustrate this, the intervenor has drawn the attention of this\n\nCourt to W. Friedmann from &#x27;Law in a Changing Society&#x27; wherein he\n\nhas observed that to prohibit a type of conduct which a particular\n\nsociety considers worthy of condemnation by criminal sanctions is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">\f                                    34</span>\n\n\ndeeply influenced by the values governing that society and it,\n\ntherefore, varies from one country to another and one period of\n\nhistory to another.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">43.   Further, it has been contended by the intervenor that persons\n\nindulging in unnatural sexual acts which have been made punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 377</a> IPC are more susceptible and vulnerable to\n\ncontracting HIV/AIDS and the percentage of prevalence of AIDS in\n\nhomosexuals is much greater than heterosexuals and that the right to\n\nprivacy may not be extended in order to enable people to indulge in\n\nunnatural offences and thereby contact AIDS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">44.   It is also the case of the intervenor that if Section 377 is\n\ndeclared unconstitutional, then the family system which is the bulwark\n\nof social culture will be in shambles, the institution of marriage will be\n\ndetrimentally affected and rampant homosexual activities for money\n\nwould tempt and corrupt young Indians into this trade.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">45.   Written submissions have also been filed on behalf of Mr.\n\nSuresh Kumar Koushal, intervenor, submitting therein that the\n\nargument of the petitioners that consensual acts of adults in private\n\nhave been decriminalized in many parts of the world and, therefore, it\n\ndeserves to be decriminalized in India as well does not hold good for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                      35</span>\n\n\nseveral reasons inasmuch as the political, economic and cultural\n\nheritage of those countries are very different from India which is a\n\nmulticultural and multi-linguistic country.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">46.        The intervenor has contended that since fundamental rights are\n\nnot absolute, there is no unreasonableness in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 377</a> IPC and\n\ndecriminalizing the same would run foul to all religions practised in\n\nthe country, and, while deciding the ambit and scope of constitutional\n\nmorality, <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 25</a> also deserves to be given due consideration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"618763\" id=\"span_72\">47.        Another application for intervention, being I.A No. 91250 of\n\n2018, was filed and the same was allowed. It has been contended by\n\nthe said intervenor that in the attempt that Section 377 is struck down,\n\nit would render the victims complaining of forced acts covered under\n\nthe existing <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 377</a> IPC remediless as the said Section not only\n\nimpinges on carnal intercourse against the order of nature between\n\ntwo consenting adults but also applies to forced penile non- vaginal\n\nsexual intercourse between adults. This, as per the intervenor, would\n\nbe contrary to the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/618763/\" id=\"a_100\">Iqbal Singh Marwah and\n\nanother v. Meenakshi Marwah</a> and another17.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n17   (2005) 4 SCC 370\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                    36</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_58\">48.   The applicant has also submitted that in the event consenting\n\nacts between two same sex adults are excluded from the ambit of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 377</a> IPC, then a married woman would be rendered\n\nremediless under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_102\">IPC</a> against her bi-sexual husband and his\n\nconsenting male partner indulging in any sexual acts.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">49.   The intervenor has suggested that the alleged misuse of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 377</a> IPC as highlighted by the petitioners can be curbed by\n\nadding an explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 377</a> IPC defining &#x27;aggrieved person&#x27;\n\nwhich shall include only non-consenting partner or aggrieved person\n\nor wife or husband or any person on their behalf on the lines of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/390486/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 198(1)</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. This, as per\n\nthe applicant, would curb any mala fide complaint lodged by\n\nauthorities and vindictive or mischievous persons when the act\n\ncomplained of is &#x27;consenting act&#x27; between two persons. Further, the\n\napplicant has submitted that this Court may be pleased to identify that\n\nthe courts shall take cognizance of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\nonly on a complaint made by an aggrieved person. Such an approach,\n\nas per the applicant, inherently respects consent and also protects\n\nfrom interference and safeguards the privacy and dignity of an\n\nindividual under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                      37</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1719619\" id=\"span_75\">50.        The applicant has also contended that the constitutionality of\n\nany legislation is always to be presumed and if there is any\n\nvagueness in the definition of any section, the courts have to give\n\nsuch a definition which advances the purpose of the legislation and\n\nthat the courts must make every effort to uphold the constitutional\n\nvalidity of a statute if that requires giving a stretched construction in\n\nview of the decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1719619/\" id=\"a_108\">K.A. Abbas v. Union of India</a>\n\nand another18 and Rt. Rev.

The applicant, through his learned counsel Mr. Harvinder\n\nChowdhury, submits that if the right to privacy as recognized in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_110\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra) is allowed its full scope and swing, then that\n\nitself would rule out prosecution in all cases of consensual\n\nunnatural sex between all couples, whether heterosexual or\n\nhomosexual, and without having to engage in reading down, much\n\nless striking down of, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 377</a> IPC in its\n\npresent form. This is so because the State cannot compel\n\nindividuals engaging in consensual sexual acts from testifying\n\n\n18   (1970) 2 SCC 780\n19   (1979) 1 SCC 23\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">\f                                   38</span>\n\n\n\nagainst one another as it involves a breach of privacy unless the\n\nconsent itself is under challenge and one cannot be a consenting\n\nvictim of a crime so long as the consent is legally valid.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">52.   Submissions have also been advanced on behalf of Raza\n\nAcademy, intervenor, through its learned counsel Mr. R.R Kishore,\n\nwho has contended that homosexuality is against the order of\n\nnature and Section 377 rightly forbids it. Prohibition against carnal\n\nintercourse involving penetration into non-sexual parts of the body\n\ndoes not constitute discrimination as laws based on biological\n\nreality can never be unconstitutional, for if a male is treated as a\n\nmale, a female as a female and a transgender as a transgender, it\n\ndoes not amount to discrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">53.   The applicant has submitted that the purpose of criminal law is\n\nto protect the citizens from something that is injurious and since\n\ncarnal intercourse between two persons is offensive and injurious, it\n\nis well within the State&#x27;s jurisdiction to put reasonable restrictions to\n\nforbid such aberrant human behaviour by means of legislation, for it\n\nis the duty of the State that people with abnormal conduct are\n\nprohibited from imperiling the life, health and security of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                       39</span>\n\n\n\ncommunity. Unrestrained pleasure, and that too of a lascivious\n\nnature, is not conducive for the growth of a civilized society, such\n\ninordinate gratification needs to be curbed and, thus, prohibition\n\nagainst carnal intercourse as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 377</a> IPC does not\n\nviolate the constitutional rights of a person.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">54.        Another application for intervention, being I.A No. 9341 of\n\n2011, was filed and allowed. The applicant, in his written\n\nsubmissions, after delineating the concept of immorality, has\n\nsubmitted that the doctrine of manifest arbitrariness is of no\n\napplication to the present case as the law is not manifestly or\n\notherwise arbitrary, for Section 377 criminalizes an act irrespective of\n\ngender or sexual orientation of the persons involved. The universal\n\napplication of the said provision without any gender bias is the\n\ntouchstone of Part III of the Constitution and is not arbitrary as there\n\nis no intentional or unreasonable discrimination in the provision.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1880919\" id=\"span_80\">55.

In view of\n\nthese aforesaid submissions, the applicant has submitted that\n\nfundamental rights may not be overstretched and the Directive\n\nPrinciples of State Policy which are fundamental in the governance\n\nof the country cannot be neglected, for they are not less significant\n\nthan what is fundamental in the life of an individual as held in\n\nKesavananda Bharati v.

Another application for intervention, being I.A. No. 76790 of\n\n2018, has been filed by Apostolic Alliance of Churches and the Utkal\n\nChristian Council. The applicants have submitted that the Court,\n\nwhile interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 377</a> IPC, has to keep in mind that there can\n\nbe situations where consent is obtained by putting a person in fear of\n\ndeath or hurt or consent can also be obtained under some\n\nmisconception or due to unsoundness of mind, intoxication or\n\ninability to understand the nature and the consequences of the acts\n\nprohibited by <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">58.   The applicant has also advanced the argument that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_119\">Section\n\n377</a> IPC in its present form does not violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution as it merely defines a particular offence and its\n\npunishment and it is well within the power of the State to determine\n\nwho should be regarded as a class for the purpose of a legislation\n\nand this, as per the applicant, is reasonable classification in the\n\ncontext of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">59.   Further, the applicant has contended that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 377</a> IPC is\n\nnot violative of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution as the said Article\n\nprohibits discrimination on the grounds of only religion, race, caste,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                    42</span>\n\n\n\nsex, place of birth or any of them but not sexual orientation. The word\n\n‗sexual orientation‘, as per the applicant, is alien to our Constitution\n\nand the same cannot be imported within it for testing the\n\nconstitutional validity of a provision or legislation. As per the applicant,\n\nif the word &#x27;sex&#x27; has to be replaced by &#x27;sexual orientation&#x27;, it would\n\nrequire a constitutional amendment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">60.     It is also the case of the applicant that the Yogyakarta\n\nprinciples which have been heavily relied upon by the petitioners to\n\nbolster their stand have limited sanctity inasmuch as they do not\n\namount to an international treaty binding on the State parties and\n\nthere     are   no   inter-governmentally      negotiated     international\n\ninstruments or agreed human rights treaties on the issue of LGBTs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_86\">61.     Further, the applicant has submitted that there is no\n\nrequirement to reconsider the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_124\">Suresh\n\nKoushal</a> (supra) wherein it was held that there is a presumption of\n\nconstitutionality of a legislation and the Court must adopt self-\n\nrestraint and thereby refrain from giving birth to judicial legislation. In\n\nthe applicant&#x27;s view, the legislative wisdom of the Parliament must be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">\f                                      43</span>\n\n\n\nrespected and it must be left to the Parliament to amend <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 377</a>\n\nIPC, if so desired.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96356448\" id=\"span_88\">62.        The applicant has contended that if the prayers of the\n\npetitioners herein are allowed, it would amount to judicial legislation,\n\nfor the Courts cannot add or delete words into a statute. It is stated\n\nthat the words &#x27;consent&#x27; and/or &#x27;without consent&#x27; are not mentioned in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 377</a> IPC and, therefore, the Courts cannot make such an\n\nartificial distinction. To buttress this stand, the applicant has relied\n\nupon the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/96356448/\" id=\"a_127\">Sakshi v. Union of India and\n\nothers</a> 24 wherein it was observed that the attention of the Court\n\nshould be on what has been said and also on what has not been said\n\nwhile interpreting the statute and that it would be wrong and\n\ndangerous for the Court to proceed by substituting some other words\n\nin a statute since it is well settled that a statute enacting an offence\n\nor imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"92507\" id=\"span_89\">63.        The applicant has also drawn the attention of this Court to the\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/92507/\" id=\"a_128\">Union of India and another v. Deoki Nandan\n\nAggarwal25</a> wherein it was observed that the Court cannot rewrite,\n\n\n24(2004)  5 SCC 518\n251992   Supp. (1) SCC 323\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                                    44</span>\n\n\n\nrecast or re-frame the legislation for the good reason that it has no\n\npower to legislate since the power to legislate has not been conferred\n\nupon the Court and, therefore, the Courts cannot add words to a\n\nstatute or read words into it which are not there.</span> The Courts are to\n\ndecide what the law is and not what it should be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">64.   It is also the case of the applicant that the decriminalization of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 377</a> IPC will open a floodgate of social issues which the\n\nlegislative domain is not capable of accommodating as same sex\n\nmarriages would become social experiments with unpredictable\n\noutcome.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">65.   Further,   it   is   the   contention   of   the   applicant   that\n\ndecriminalization of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 377</a> IPC will have cascading effect on\n\nexisting laws such as <a href=\"/doc/347491/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 32(d)</a> of the Parsi Marriage and\n\nDivorce Act, 1936; <a href=\"/doc/695509/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 27(7)(1A)</a> A of the Special Marriage Act,\n\n1954 which permits a wife to present a petition for divorce to the\n\ndistrict court on the ground,—(i) that her husband has, since the\n\nsolemnization of the marriage, been guilty of rape, sodomy or\n\nbestiality; <a href=\"/doc/89426212/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 10(2)</a> of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 and <a href=\"/doc/493667/\" id=\"a_134\">Section\n\n13(2)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">\f                                  45</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n\nE.    Decisions in Naz Foundation and Suresh Koushal\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">66.   We shall now advert to what had been stated by the Delhi High\n\nCourt in Naz Foundation and thereafter advert to the legal base of\n\nthe decision in Suresh Koushal’s case. The Delhi High Court had\n\ntaken the view that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 15</a> of the Constitution prohibits\n\ndiscrimination on several enumerated grounds including sex. The\n\nHigh Court preferred an expansive interpretation of &#x27;sex&#x27; so as to\n\ninclude prohibition of discrimination on the ground of &#x27;sexual\n\norientation&#x27; and that sex-discrimination cannot be read as applying to\n\ngender simpliciter. Discrimination, as per the High Court&#x27;s view, on\n\nthe basis of sexual orientation is grounded in stereotypical judgments\n\nand generalization about the conduct of either sex.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">67.   Another facet of the Indian Constitution that the High Court\n\ndelineated was that of inclusiveness as the Indian Constitution\n\nreflects this value of inclusiveness deeply ingrained in the Indian\n\nsociety and nurtured over several generations. The High Court\n\ncategorically said that those who are perceived by the majority as\n\ndeviants or different are not to be, on that score, excluded or\n\nostracised. In the High Court&#x27;s view, where a society displays\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                                    46</span>\n\n\ninclusiveness and understanding, the LGBT persons can be assured\n\nof a life of dignity and non-discrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">68.   It has been further opined by the High Court that the\n\nConstitution does not permit any statutory criminal law to be held\n\ncaptive of the popular misconceptions of who the LGBTs are, as it\n\ncannot be forgotten that discrimination is the antithesis of equality\n\nand recognition of equality in its truest sense will foster the dignity of\n\nevery individual. That apart, the High Court had taken the view that\n\nsocial morality has to succumb to the concept of constitutional\n\nmorality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_81\">69.   On the basis of the aforesaid reasons, the High Court declared\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 377</a> IPC violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_137\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_138\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_139\">21</a> of the Constitution\n\nin so far as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private,\n\nwhereas for non-consensual penile non-vaginal sex and penile non-\n\nvaginal sex involving minors, the High Court ruled that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 377</a>\n\nIPC was valid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_93\">70.   The Delhi High Court judgment was challenged in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_141\">Suresh\n\nKoushal</a> (supra) wherein this Court opined that acts which fall within\n\nthe ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 377</a> IPC can only be determined with reference\n\nto the act itself and to the circumstances in which it is executed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">\f                                   47</span>\n\n\nWhile so opining, the Court held that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 377</a> IPC would apply\n\nirrespective of age and consent, for <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 377</a> IPC does not\n\ncriminalize a particular people or identity or orientation and only\n\nidentifies certain acts which, when committed, would constitute an\n\noffence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_95\">Such a prohibition, in the Court&#x27;s view in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_145\">Suresh Koushal</a>\n\n(supra), regulates sexual conduct regardless of gender identity and\n\norientation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">71.   The Court further observed that those who indulge in carnal\n\nintercourse in the ordinary course and those who indulge in carnal\n\nintercourse against the order of nature constitute different classes\n\nand the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_146\">Section\n\n377</a> IPC suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational\n\nclassification. The Court further observed that while reading down\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code, it cannot be overlooked that\n\nonly a minuscule fraction of the country&#x27;s population constitutes\n\nlesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders and in last more than 150\n\nyears, less than 200 persons have been prosecuted under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_148\">Section\n\n377</a> of the Indian Penal Code which cannot, therefore, be made a\n\nsound basis for declaring <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 377</a> IPC ultra vires the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_150\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_151\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_152\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                                       48</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_84\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">72.        The submission advanced by the respondents therein to the\n\neffect that the provision had become a pernicious tool for perpetrating\n\nharassment, blackmail and torture on those belonging to the LGBT\n\ncommunity was repelled by stating that such treatment is neither\n\nmandated by the Section nor condoned by it and the mere fact that\n\nthe Section is misused by police authorities and others is not a\n\nreflection of the vires of the Section, though it might be a relevant\n\nfactor for the Legislature to consider while judging the desirability of\n\namending <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">F.         Other judicial pronouncements on Section 377 IPC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">73.        Presently, we may refer to some of the judgments and the\n\nviews taken therein by this Court as well as by the High Courts on\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 377</a> IPC so as to have a holistic perspective.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">74.        While interpreting the said provision, the Courts have held that\n\nthe provision stipulates certain acts, which when committed, would\n\nconstitute a criminal offence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1052165\" id=\"span_97\">In <a href=\"/doc/1052165/\" id=\"a_155\">Childline India Foundation and\n\nanother v. Allan John Waters</a> and others26, the Court was dealing\n\nwith carnal intercourse against the order of nature when the material\n\non record showed that the accused Nos. 2 and 3 used to have sex\n\n\n26   (2011) 6 SCC 261\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">\f                                        49</span>\n\n\nand fellatio with PWs 1 and 4. The Court opined that the ingredients\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 377</a> IPC were proved and, accordingly, restored the\n\nconviction and sentence of 6 years‘ rigorous imprisonment and\n\nconfirmed the imposition of fine.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1880919\" id=\"span_99\">In <a href=\"/doc/1880919/\" id=\"a_157\">Fazal Rab Choudhary</a> (supra),\n\nalthough the Court convicted the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 377</a> IPC, yet\n\nit took note of the absence of any force in the commission of the act.\n\nThe Court also took into account the prevalent notions of permissive\n\nsociety and the fact that homosexuality has been legalized in some\n\ncountries. In view of the same, the Court reduced the sentence of 3\n\nyears imposed on the accused to 6 months opining that the aforesaid\n\naspects must also be kept in view as they have a bearing on the\n\nquestion of offence and quantum of sentence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">75.       A reference may be made to Khanu v. Emperor27 which was\n\nalso alluded to in Suresh Koushal‘s case. We deem it appropriate to\n\nreproduce a part of Khanu‘s decision to understand how the courts in\n\nIndia had understood the word ―carnal intercourse against the order\n\nof nature‖. The said passage reads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">          ―The principal point in this case is: whether the\n          accused (who is clearly guilty of having committed the\n          sin of Gomorrah coitus per os) with a certain little child,\n          the innocent accomplice of his abomination, has\n\n27   AIR 1925 Sind 286\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">\f                             50</span>\n\n\nthereby committed an offence under Section 377 of the\nPenal Code.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">    Section 377 punishes certain persons who have\ncarnal intercourse against the order of nature with inter\nalia human beings. Is the act here committed one of\ncarnal intercourse? If so, it is clearly against the order\nof nature, because the natural object of carnal\nintercourse is that there should be the possibility of\nconception of human beings which in the case of\ncoitus per os is impossible. Intercourse may be defined\nas mutual frequent action by members of independent\norganisation. Commercial intercourse [is thereafter\nreferred to; emphasis is made on the reciprocity].\n\n   By a metaphor the word intercourse like the word\ncommerce is applied to the relations of the sexes. Here\nalso there is the temporary visitation of one organism\nby a member of other organisation, for certain clearly\ndefined and limited objects. The primary object of the\nvisiting organisation is to obtain euphoria by means of\na detent of the nerves consequent on the sexual crisis.\nBut there is no intercourse unless the visiting member\nis enveloped at least partially by the visited organism,\nfor intercourse connotes reciprocity. Looking at the\nquestion in this way it would seem that sin of\nGomorrah is no less carnal intercourse than the sin of\nsodomy. …\n\n   It is to be remembered that the Penal Code does\nnot, except in Section 377, render abnormal sexual\nvice punishable at all. In England indecent assaults are\npunishable very severely. It is possible that under the\nPenal Code, some cases might be met by prosecuting\nthe offender for simple assault, but that is a\ncompoundable offence and in any case the patient\ncould in no way be punished.

A contention was raised that there was no penetration and,\n\ntherefore, there could not have been any carnal intercourse. The\n\nHigh Court referred to a passage from the book ‗Pyschology of Sex‘\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">29</span>\n     authored by Mr. Havelock Ellis which reads thus:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           &quot;While the kiss may be regarded as the typical and\n           normal erogenic method of contrectation for the end of\n           attaining tumescene, there are others only less\n           important. Any orifical contact &#x27;between persons of\n           opposite sex&#x27; is sometimes almost equally as effective\n           as the kiss in stimulating tumescene; all such contacts,\n           indeed, belong to the group of which the kiss is the\n           type,    Cunnilinctus     (often  incorrectly    termed\n           cunnilingus) and fellatio cannot be regarded as\n           unnatural for they have their prototypic forms among\n           animals, and they are found among various savage\n28   AIR 1968 Guj 252\n29   ‘Psychology of Sex’ Twelfth Impression, 1948, London\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">\f                                      52</span>\n\n\n          races.

Even if I am to hold that there was no penetration\n          into the vagina and the sexual acts were committed\n          only between the thighs, I do not think that the\n          respondents can escape conviction under Section 377\n          of the Penal Code. The counsel of the respondents\n          contends (in this argument the Public Prosecutor also\n\n301969   Cri LJ 818 (Ker)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">\f                             53</span>\n\n\nsupports him) that sexual act between the thighs is not\nintercourse. The argument is that for intercourse there\nmust be encirclement of the male organ by the organ\nvisited; and that in the case of sexual act between the\nthighs, there is no possibility of penetration.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">19. The word ‗intercourse‘ means ‗sexual connection‘\n(Concise Oxford Dictionary). In Khanu v. Emperor the\nmeaning of the word ‗intercourse‘ has been\nconsidered: (AIR p. 286)\n\n‗Intercourse may be defined as mutual frequent action\nby members of independent organisation.‘\n\nThen commercial intercourse, social intercourse, etc.\nhave been considered; and then appears:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">‗By a metaphor the word intercourse, like the word\ncommerce, is applied to the relations of the sexes.\nHere also there is the temporary visitation of one\norganism by a member of the other organisation, for\ncertain clearly defined and limited objects. The primary\nobject of the visiting organisation is to obtain euphoria\nby means of a detent of the nerves consequent on the\nsexual crisis. But there is no intercourse unless the\nvisiting member is enveloped at least partially by the\nvisited organism, for intercourse connotes reciprocity.‘\nTherefore, to decide whether there is intercourse or\nnot, what is to be considered is whether the visiting\norgan is enveloped at least partially by the visited\norganism. In intercourse between the thighs, the\nvisiting male organ is enveloped at least partially by\nthe organism visited, the thighs: the thighs are kept\ntogether and tight.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">20. Then about penetration. The word ‗penetrate‘\nmeans in the Concise Oxford Dictionary ‗find access\ninto or through, pass through.‘ When the male organ is\ninserted between the thighs kept together and tight, is\nthere no penetration? The word ‗insert‘ means place,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">\f                                             54</span>\n\n\n           fit, thrust.‘ Therefore, if the male organ is ‗inserted‘ or\n           ‗thrust‘ between the thighs, there is ‗penetration‘ to\n           constitute unnatural offence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           21. Unnatural offence is defined in Section 377 of the\n           Penal Code; whoever voluntarily has carnal\n           intercourse against the order of nature with any man,\n           woman or animal commits unnatural offence. The act\n           of committing intercourse between the thighs is carnal\n           intercourse against the order of nature. Therefore\n           committing intercourse by inserting the male organ\n           between the thighs of another is an unnatural offence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">           In this connection, it may be noted that the act in\n           Section 376 is ‗sexual intercourse‘ and the act in\n           Section 377 is ‗carnal intercourse against the order of\n           nature‘.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">           22. The position in English law on this question has\n           been brought to my notice. The old decision of R. v.\n           Samuel Jacobs 31 lays down that penetration through\n           the mouth does not amount to the offence of sodomy\n           under English law. The counsel therefore argues that\n           sexual intercourse between the thighs cannot also be\n           an offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code. In\n           Sirkar v. Gula Mythien Pillai Chaithu Maho Mathu32 a\n           Full Bench of the Travancore High Court held that\n           having connection with a person in the mouth was an\n           offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code. In a\n           short judgment, the learned Judges held that it was\n           unnecessary to refer to English Statute Law and\n           English text books which proceeded upon an\n           interpretation of the words sodomy, buggery and\n           bestiality; and that the words used in the Penal Code\n           were very simple and wide enough to include all acts\n           against the order of nature. My view on the question is\n           also that the words of Section 377 are simple and wide\n           enough to include any carnal intercourse against the\n           order of nature within its ambit.

From the aforesaid analysis, it is perceptible that the two-Judge\n\nBench has drawn a distinction between the ―class‖ and the ―act‖ that\n\nhas been treated as an offence. On a plain reading of the provision,\n\nit is noticeable that the ―act‖ covers all categories of persons if the\n\noffence is committed. Thus, the seminal issue that emerges for\n\nconsideration, as has been understood by various High Courts and\n\nthis Court, is whether the act can be treated as a criminal offence if it\n\nviolates <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_166\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_167\">21</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, the\n\nprovision has to be tested on the anvil of the said constitutional\n\nprovisions. Additionally, it is also to be tested on the touchstone of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 14</a> especially under the scanner of its second limb, that is,\n\nmanifest arbitrariness.   For adjudging the aforesaid facets, certain\n\nfundamental concepts which are intrinsically and integrally associated\n\nwith the expression of a person who enjoys certain inalienable natural\n\nrights which also have been recognized under the Constitution are\n\nrequired to be addressed. In this context, the individuality of a person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">\f                                      57</span>\n\n\nand the acceptance of identity invite advertence to some necessary\n\nconcepts which eventually recognize the constitutional status of an\n\nindividual that resultantly brushes aside the ―act‖ and respects the\n\ndignity and choice of the individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_98\">\nG.

The idea of identity of the individual\n\nand the constitutional legitimacy behind the same is of immense\n\nsignificance. Therefore, in this context, the duty of the constitutional\n\ncourts gets accentuated.

The judiciary\n\ncannot remain oblivious to the fact that the society is constantly\n\nevolving and many a variation may emerge with the changing times.\n\nThere is a constant need to transform the constitutional idealism into\n\nreality by fostering respect for human rights, promoting inclusion of\n\npluralism, bringing harmony, that is, unity amongst diversity,\n\nabandoning the idea of alienation or some unacceptable social\n\nnotions built on medieval egos and establishing the cult of egalitarian\n\nliberalism founded on reasonable principles that can withstand\n\nscrutiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">87.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1060370\" id=\"span_120\">In <a href=\"/doc/1060370/\" id=\"a_173\">Ashok Kumar Gupta</a> (supra), the Court had observed that\n\ncommon sense has always served in the court&#x27;s ceaseless striving as\n\na voice of reason to maintain the blend of change and continuity of\n\norder which are sine qua non for stability in the process of change in\n\na parliamentary democracy.

For understanding the need of having a constitutional\n\ndemocracy and for solving the million dollar question as to why we\n\nadopted the Constitution, we perhaps need to understand the\n\nconcept of transformative constitutionalism with some degree of\n\ndefiniteness. In this quest of ours, the ideals enshrined in the\n\nPreamble to our Constitution would be a guiding laser beam. The\n\nultimate goal of our magnificent Constitution is to make right the\n\nupheaval which existed in the Indian society before the adopting of\n\nthe Constitution. The Court in <a href=\"/doc/1130169/\" id=\"a_175\">State of Kerala and another v. N.M.\n\nThomas and others</a> 41 observed that the Indian Constitution is a\n\ngreat social document, almost revolutionary in its aim of transforming\n\na medieval, hierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy\n\nand its provisions can be comprehended only by a spacious, social-\n\nscience approach, not by pedantic, traditional legalism. The whole\n\nidea of having a Constitution is to guide the nation towards a\n\nresplendent future. Therefore, the purpose of having a Constitution is\n\nto transform the society for the better and this objective is the\n\nfundamental pillar of transformative constitutionalism.\n\n41   AIR 1976 SC 490</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">\f                                   66</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">96.   The concept of transformative constitutionalism has at its kernel\n\na pledge, promise and thirst to transform the Indian society so as to\n\nembrace therein, in letter and spirit, the ideals of justice, liberty,\n\nequality and fraternity as set out in the Preamble to our Constitution.\n\nThe expression ‗transformative constitutionalism‘ can be best\n\nunderstood by embracing a pragmatic lens which will help in\n\nrecognizing the realities of the current day. Transformation as a\n\nsingular term is diametrically opposed to something which is static\n\nand stagnant, rather it signifies change, alteration and the ability to\n\nmetamorphose. Thus, the concept of transformative constitutionalism,\n\nwhich is an actuality with regard to all Constitutions and particularly\n\nso with regard to the Indian Constitution, is, as a matter of fact, the\n\nability of the Constitution to adapt and transform with the changing\n\nneeds of the times.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">97.   It is this ability of a Constitution to transform which gives it the\n\ncharacter of a living and organic document. A Constitution\n\ncontinuously shapes the lives of citizens in particular and societies in\n\ngeneral. Its exposition and energetic appreciation by constitutional\n\ncourts constitute the lifeblood of progressive societies. The\n\nConstitution would become a stale and dead testament without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                                              67</span>\n\n\ndynamic,          vibrant       and    pragmatic    interpretation.   Constitutional\n\nprovisions have to be construed and developed in such a manner that\n\ntheir real intent and existence percolates to all segments of the\n\nsociety. That is the raison d&#x27;etre for the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">98.       The Supreme Court as well as other constitutional courts have\n\ntime and again realized that in a society undergoing fast social and\n\neconomic change, static judicial interpretation of the Constitution\n\nwould stultify the spirit of the Constitution. Accordingly, the\n\nconstitutional             courts,    while   viewing   the   Constitution   as   a\n\ntransformative document, have ardently fulfilled their obligation to act\n\nas the sentinel on qui vive for guarding the rights of all individuals\n\nirrespective of their sex, choice and sexual orientation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">99.

Dignity is that component of one‘s being without which\n\nsustenance of his/her being to the fullest or completest is\n\ninconceivable.

Dignity while\n\nexpressive of choice is averse to creation of any dent.

Prior to that,\n\nwe are advised to devote some space to sexual orientation and the\n\ninstructive definition of LGBT by Michael Kirby, former Judge of the\n\nHigh Court of Australia:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">―Homosexual: People of either gender who are attracted, sexually,\n\nemotionally and in relationships, to persons of the same sex.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">Bisexual: Women who are attracted to both sexes; men who are\n\nattracted to both sexes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">Lesbian: Women who are attracted to women.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">Gay: Men who are attracted to men, although this term is sometimes\n\nalso used generically for all same-sex attracted persons.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">\f                                     90</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">Gender identity: A phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation\n\nwhich refers to whether a person identifies as male or female.

The word &#x27;Queer&#x27; is sometimes used generically,\n\nusually by younger people, to include the members of all of the\n\nsexual minorities. I usually avoid this expression because of its\n\npejorative overtones within an audience unfamiliar with the\n\nexpression. However, it is spreading and, amongst the young, is\n\noften seen as an instance of taking possession of a pejorative word\n\nin order to remove its sting.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">\f                                                   91</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">MSM: Men who have sex with men. This expression is common in\n\nUnited Nations circles. It refers solely to physical, sexual activity by\n\nmen with men. The expression is used on the basis that in some\n\ncountries - including India - some men may engage in sexual acts\n\nwith their own sex although not identifying as homosexual or even\n\naccepting a romantic or relationship emotion.‖60\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">140. Presently, we shall focus on the aspect of sexual orientation.\n\nEvery human being has certain basic biological characteristics and\n\nacquires or develops some facets under certain circumstances.\n\nThe first can generally be termed as inherent orientation that is\n\nnatural to his/her being. The second can be described as a\n\ndemonstration of his/her choice which gradually becomes an\n\ninseparable quality of his/her being, for the individual also leans on\n\na different expression because of the inclination to derive\n\nsatisfaction. The third one has the proclivity which he/she\n\nmaintains and does not express any other inclination. The first one\n\nis homosexuality, the second, bisexuality and third, heterosexuality.\n\nThe third one is regarded as natural and the first one, by the same\n\nstandard, is treated to be unnatural. When the second category\n60SexualOrientation &amp; Gender Identity – A New Province of Law for India, J. Michael D.

In sum, the ‗act‘ is treated\n\neither in accord with nature or against the order of nature in terms\n\nof societal perception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">141. The Yogyakarta Principles define the expression &quot;sexual\n\norientation‖ thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">       &quot;Sexual Orientation&quot; is understood to refer to each\n       person&#x27;s capacity for profound emotional, affectional\n       and sexual attraction to and intimate and sexual\n       relations with, individuals of a different gender or the\n       same gender or more than one gender.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">142. In its study, the American Psychological Association has\n\nattempted to define ―sexual orientation‖ in the following manner:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">       &quot;Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of\n       emotional, romantic and/or sexual attractions to men.\n       women or both sexes. Sexual orientation also refers to\n       a person&#x27;s sense of identity based on those attractions,\n       related behaviors, and membership in a community of\n       others who share those attractions. Research over\n       several decades has demonstrated that sexual\n       orientation ranges along a continuum, from exclusive\n       attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the\n       same sex.‖61\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">143. From the aforesaid, it has to be appreciated that homosexuality\n\nis something that is based on sense of identity. It is the reflection of a\n\n61American Psychological Association, &quot;Answers to Your Questions for a Better Understanding of\n Sexual Orientation &amp; Homosexuality,&quot; 2008\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">\f                                   93</span>\n\n\nsense of emotion and expression of eagerness to establish intimacy.\n\nIt is just as much ingrained, inherent and innate as heterosexuality.\n\nSexual orientation, as a concept, fundamentally implies a pattern of\n\nsexual attraction. It is as natural a phenomenon as other natural\n\nbiological phenomena. What the science of sexuality has led to is that\n\nan individual has the tendency to feel sexually attracted towards the\n\nsame sex, for the decision is one that is controlled by neurological\n\nand biological factors. That is why it is his/her natural orientation\n\nwhich is innate and constitutes the core of his/her being and identity.\n\nThat apart, on occasions, due to a sense of mutuality of release of\n\npassion, two adults may agree to express themselves in a different\n\nsexual behaviour which may include both the genders. To this, one\n\ncan attribute a bisexual orientation which does not follow the rigidity\n\nbut allows room for flexibility.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">144. The society cannot remain unmindful to the theory which\n\nseveral researches, conducted both in the field of biological and\n\npsychological science, have proven and reaffirmed time and again.\n\nTo compel a person having a certain sexual orientation to proselytize\n\nto another is like asking a body part to perform a function it was never\n\ndesigned to perform in the first place. It is pure science, a certain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">\f                                                 94</span>\n\nmanner in which the brain and genitals of an individual function and\n\nreact. Whether one&#x27;s sexual orientation is determined by genetic,\n\nhormonal, developmental, social and/or cultural influences (or a\n\ncombination thereof), most people experience little or no sense of\n\nchoice about their sexual orientation.62\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">145. The statement of the American Psychological Association on\n\nhomosexuality which was released in July 1994 reiterates this\n\nposition in the following observations:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">          &quot;The research on homosexuality is very7 clear.\n          Homosexuality is neither mental illness nor moral\n          depravity. It is simply the way a minority of our\n          population expresses human love and sexuality. Study\n          after study documents the mental health of gay men\n          and lesbians. Studies of judgment, stability, reliability,\n          and social and vocational adaptiveness all show that\n          gay men and lesbians function every bit as well as\n          heterosexuals. Nor is homosexuality a matter of\n          individual choice. Research suggests that the\n          homosexual orientation is in place very early in the life\n          cycle, possibly even before birth. It is found in about\n          ten percent of the population, a figure which is\n          surprisingly constant across cultures, irrespective of\n          the different moral values and standards of a particular\n          culture. Contrary to what some imply, the incidence of\n          homosexuality in a population does not appear to\n          change with new moral codes or social mores.\n          Research findings suggest that efforts to repair\n          homosexuals are nothing more than social prejudice\n          garbed in psychological accouterments.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_172\">                                               (Emphasis is ours)\n62   UNHCR GUIDELINES ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION NO. 9: Claims to Refugee Status based on\n     Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity within the context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951\n     Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">\f                                    95</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">146. In the said context, the observations made by Leonard Sax to\n\nthe following effect are relevant and are reproduced below:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">       ―Biologically, the difference between a gay man and a\n       straight man is something like the difference between a\n       left-handed person and a right-handed person. Being\n       left- handed isn&#x27;t just a phase. A left-handed person\n       won&#x27;t someday magically turn into a right-handed\n       person....

Apart from orientation, as stated earlier, there\n\ncan be situations which influence the emotional behaviour of an\n\nindividual to seek intimacy in the same gender that may bring two\n\npersons together in a biological pattern.

Privacy and its concomitant aspects\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_170\">149. While testing the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 377</a> IPC, due\n\nregard must be given to the elevated right to privacy as has been\n\nrecently proclaimed in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_191\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_171\">We shall not delve in\n\ndetail upon the concept of the right to privacy as the same has been\n\ndelineated at length in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_192\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra). In the case at hand, our\n\nfocus is limited to dealing with the right to privacy vis-à-vis <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_193\">Section\n\n377</a> IPC and other facets such as right to choice as part of the\n\nfreedom of expression and sexual orientation. That apart, within the\n\ncompartment of privacy, individual autonomy has a significant space.\n\nAutonomy is individualistic. It is expressive of self-determination and\n\nsuch self-determination includes sexual orientation and declaration of\n\nsexual identity. Such an orientation or choice that reflects an\n\nindividual‘s autonomy is innate to him/her. It is an inalienable part of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">\f                                    97</span>\n\n\nhis/her identity. The said identity under the constitutional scheme\n\ndoes not accept any interference as long as its expression is not\n\nagainst decency or morality. And the morality that is conceived of\n\nunder the Constitution is constitutional morality. Under the autonomy\n\nprinciple, the individual has sovereignty over his/her body. He/she\n\ncan surrender his/her autonomy wilfully to another individual and their\n\nintimacy in privacy is a matter of their choice.       Such concept of\n\nidentity is not only sacred but is also in recognition of the\n\nquintessential facet of humanity in a person‘s nature. The autonomy\n\nestablishes identity and the said identity, in the ultimate eventuate,\n\nbecomes a part of dignity in an individual. This dignity is special to the\n\nman/woman who has a right to enjoy his/her life as per the\n\nconstitutional norms and should not be allowed to wither and perish\n\nlike a mushroom. It is a directional shift from conceptual macrocosm\n\nto cognizable microcosm. When such culture grows, there is an\n\naffirmative move towards a more inclusive and egalitarian society.\n\nNon-acceptance of the same would tantamount to denial of human\n\nrights to people and one cannot be oblivious of the saying of Nelson\n\nMandela ― ―to deny people their human rights is to challenge their\n\nvery humanity.‖</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">\f                                        98</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">150. <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, (1948)\n\nmakes a reference to privacy by stating:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">           &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference\n           with his privacy, family, home or correspondence nor\n           to attacks upon his honour and reputation.

The South African Constitutional Court in National Coalition\n\nfor Gay and Lesbian Equality and another v.

If, in expressing our sexuality, we act\n\nconsensually and without harming one another, invasion of that\n\nprecinct will be a breach of our privacy. The Court admitted that the\n\nsociety had a poor record of seeking to regulate the sexual\n\nexpression of South Africans. It observed that in some cases, as in\n\nthis one, the reason for the regulation was discriminatory; the law, for\n\nexample, outlawed sexual relationships among people of different\n\nraces. The fact that a law prohibiting forms of sexual conduct is\n\ndiscriminatory does not, however, prevent it at the same time from\n\nbeing an improper invasion of the intimate sphere of human life to\n\nwhich protection is given by the Constitution in <a href=\"/doc/49908551/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 14</a>. The Court\n\nemphasized that the importance of a right to privacy in the new\n\nconstitutional order should not be denied even while acknowledging\n\nthe importance of equality. In fact, emphasising the breach of both\n\nthese rights in the present case highlights just how egregious the\n\ninvasion of the constitutional rights of gay persons has been. The\n\noffence which lies at the heart of the discrimination in this case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">\f                                   103</span>\n\n\nconstitutes, at the same time and independently, a breach of the\n\nrights of privacy and dignity which, without doubt, strengthens the\n\nconclusion that the discrimination is unfair.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_187\">160. At home, the view as to the right to privacy underwent a sea-\n\nchange when a nine-Judge Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_200\">Puttaswamy</a>\n\n(supra) elevated the right to privacy to the stature of fundamental\n\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. One of us, Chandrachud, J.,\n\nspeaking for the majority, regarded the judgment in Suresh Koushal\n\nas a discordant note and opined that the reasons stated therein\n\ncannot be regarded as a valid constitutional basis for disregarding a\n\nclaim based on privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Further,\n\nhe observed that the reasoning in Suresh Koushal‘s decision to the\n\neffect that ―a minuscule fraction of the country&#x27;s population\n\nconstitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders&quot;       is not a\n\nsustainable basis to deny the right to privacy.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">161. It was further observed that the purpose of elevating certain\n\nrights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate\n\ntheir exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether legislative or\n\npopular, and the guarantee of constitutional rights does not depend\n\nupon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">\f                                  104</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_192\">162. The test of popular acceptance, in view of the majority opinion,\n\nwas not at all a valid basis to disregard rights which have been\n\nconferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection. The Court\n\nnoted that the discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of\n\ndiscrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of\n\nlife does not accord with the &#x27;mainstream&#x27;, but in a democratic\n\nConstitution founded on the Rule of Law, it does not mean that their\n\nrights are any less sacred than those conferred on other citizens.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_193\">163. As far as the aspect of sexual orientation is concerned, the\n\nCourt opined that it is an essential attribute of privacy and\n\ndiscrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation\n\nis deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. The\n\nCourt was of the view that equality demands that the sexual\n\norientation of each individual in the society must be protected on an\n\neven platform, for the right to privacy and the protection of sexual\n\norientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_203\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_204\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_205\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_189\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_190\">164. Regarding the view in Suresh Koushal‘s case to the effect that\n\nthe Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_206\">Naz Foundation</a> case had erroneously relied\n\nupon international precedents in its anxiety to protect the so-called\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">\f                                    105</span>\n\n\nrights of LGBT persons, the nine-Judge Bench was of the opinion that\n\nthe aforesaid view in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_207\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra) was unsustainable.</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_192\">The rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population,\n\nas per the decision in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_208\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra), cannot be construed to\n\nbe &quot;so-called rights&quot; as the expression &quot;so-called&quot; seems to suggest\n\nthe exercise of liberty in the garb of a right which is illusory.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">165. The Court regarded such a construction in Suresh Koushal‘s\n\ncase as inappropriate of the privacy based claims of the LGBT\n\npopulation, for their rights are not at all &quot;so-called&quot; but are real rights\n\nfounded on sound constitutional doctrine. The Court went on to\n\nobserve that the rights of the LGBT community inhere in the right to\n\nlife, dwell in privacy and dignity and they constitute the essence of\n\nliberty and freedom. Further, the Court observed that sexual\n\norientation being an essential component of identity, equal protection\n\ndemands equal protection of the identity of every individual without\n\ndiscrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">166. Speaking in the same tone and tenor, Kaul, J., while concurring\n\nwith the view of Chandrachud, J., observed that the right to privacy\n\ncannot be denied even if there is a minuscule fraction of the\n\npopulation which is affected. He was of the view that the majoritarian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">\f                                       106</span>\n\n\nconcept does not apply to constitutional rights and the Courts are\n\noften called upon to take what may be categorized as a non-\n\nmajoritarian view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">167. Kaul, J. went on to opine that one‘s sexual orientation is\n\nundoubtedly an attribute of privacy and in support of this view, he\n\nreferred to the observations made in Mosley (supra) which read\n\nthus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">         &quot;130... It is not simply a matter of personal privacy v.\n         the public interest. The modern perception is that there\n         is a public interest in respecting personal privacy. It is\n         thus a question of taking account of conflicting public\n         interest considerations and evaluating them according\n         to increasingly well recognized criteria.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">         131. When the courts identify an infringement of a\n         person‘s <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_209\">Article 8</a> rights, and in particular in the context\n         of his freedom to conduct his sex life and personal\n         relationships as he wishes, it is right to afford a remedy\n         and to vindicate that right. The only permitted\n         exception is where there is a countervailing public\n         interest which in the particular circumstances is strong\n         enough to outweigh it; that is to say. because one at\n         least of the established &quot;limiting principles&quot; comes into\n         play. Was it necessary and proportionate for the\n         intrusion to take place, for example, in order to expose\n         illegal activity or to prevent the public from being\n         significantly misled by public claims hitherto made by\n         the individual concerned (as with Naomi Campbell&#x27;s\n         public denials of drug- taking)? Or was it necessary\n         because the information, in the words of the\n         Strasbourg court in Von Hannover at (60) and (76).\n         would make a contribution to &quot;a debate of general\n         interest&quot;? That is, of course, a very high test, it is yet to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">\f                                   107</span>\n\n\n      be determined how far that doctrine will be taken in the\n      courts of this jurisdiction in relation to photography in\n      public places. If taken literally, it would mean a very\n      significant change in what is permitted. It would have a\n      profound effect on the tabloid and celebrity culture to\n      which we have become accustomed in recent years.&quot;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_195\">168. After the nine-Judge bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_210\">Puttaswamy</a> (supra),\n\nthe challenge to the vires of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 377</a> IPC has been stronger than\n\never. It needs to be underscored that in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_212\">the said decision</a>, the nine-\n\nJudge Bench has held that sexual orientation is also a facet of a\n\nperson&#x27;s privacy and that the right to privacy is a fundamental right\n\nunder the Constitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_196\">169. The observation made in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_213\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra) that gays,\n\nlesbians, bisexuals and transgenders constitute a very minuscule part\n\nof the population is perverse due to the very reason that such an\n\napproach would be violative of the equality principle enshrined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The mere fact that the percentage of\n\npopulation whose fundamental right to privacy is being abridged by\n\nthe existence of Section 377 in its present form is low does not\n\nimpose a limitation upon this Court from protecting the fundamental\n\nrights of those who are so affected by the present <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 377</a> IPC.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">170. The constitutional framers could have never intended that the\n\nprotection of fundamental rights was only for the majority population.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">\f                                   108</span>\n\n\nIf such had been the intention, then all provisions in Part III of the\n\nConstitution would have contained qualifying words such as &#x27;majority\n\npersons&#x27; or &#x27;majority citizens&#x27;. Instead, the provisions have employed\n\nthe words &#x27;any person‘ and ‗any citizen&#x27; making it manifest that the\n\nconstitutional courts are under an obligation to protect the\n\nfundamental rights of every single citizen without waiting for the\n\ncatastrophic situation when the fundamental rights of the majority of\n\ncitizens get violated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">171. Such a view is well supported on two counts, namely, one that\n\nthe constitutional courts have to embody in their approach a\n\ntelescopic vision wherein they inculcate the ability to be futuristic and\n\ndo not procrastinate till the day when the number of citizens whose\n\nfundamental rights are affected and violated grow in figures. In the\n\ncase at hand, whatever be the percentage of gays, lesbians,\n\nbisexuals and transgenders, this Court is not concerned with the\n\nnumber of persons belonging to the LGBT community. What matters\n\nis whether this community is entitled to certain fundamental rights\n\nwhich they claim and whether such fundamental rights are being\n\nviolated due to the presence of a law in the statute book. If the\n\nanswer to both these questions is in the affirmative, then the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">\f                                   109</span>\n\n\nconstitutional courts must not display an iota of doubt and must not\n\nhesitate in striking down such provision of law on the account of it\n\nbeing violative of the fundamental rights of certain citizens, however\n\nminuscule their percentage may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_202\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_199\">172. A second count on which the view in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_216\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra)\n\nbecomes highly unsustainable is that the language of both <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_217\">Articles 32</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_218\">226</a> of the Constitution is not reflective of such an intention. A\n\ncursory reading of both the Articles divulges that the right to move the\n\nSupreme Court and the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_219\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_220\">226</a>\n\nrespectively is not limited to a situation when there is violation of the\n\nfundamental rights of a large chunk of populace.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_200\">173. Such a view is also fortified by several landmark judgments of\n\nthe Supreme Court such as <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_221\">D.K. Basu v. State of W.B.71</a> wherein the\n\nCourt was concerned with the fundamental rights of only those\n\npersons who were put under arrest and which again formed a\n\nminuscule fraction of the total populace.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_201\">Another recent case wherein\n\nthe Supreme Court while discharging its constitutional duty did not\n\nhesitate to protect the fundamental right to die with dignity is\n\n<a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_222\">Common Cause (A Regd.

Such an approach reflects the idea as also mooted by Martin\n\nLuther King Jr. who said, ―Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice\n\neverywhere‖. While propounding this view, we are absolutely\n\nconscious of the concept of reasonable classification and the fact that\n\neven single person legislation could be valid as held in <a href=\"/doc/4354/\" id=\"a_223\">Chiranjit Lal\n\nChowdhury v. Union of India72</a>, which regarded the classification to\n\nbe reasonable from both procedural and substantive points of view.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">175. We are aware that the legislature is fully competent to enact\n\nlaws which are applicable only to a particular class or group. But, for\n\nthe classification to be valid, it must be founded on an intelligible\n\ndifferentia and the differentia must have a rational nexus with the\n\nobject sought to be achieved by a particular provision of law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">176. That apart, since it is alleged that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 377</a> IPC in its present\n\nform violates a fundamental right protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, that is, the right to personal liberty, it has to not only\n\nstand the test of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 21</a> but it must also stand the test of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 19\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">72</span>\n [1950] 1</a> SCR 869\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">\f                                  111</span>\n\n\nwhich is to say that the restriction imposed by it has to be reasonable\n\nand also that of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 14</a> which is to say that Section 377 must not\n\nbe arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_207\">177.

Doctrine of progressive realization of rights</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">178. When we talk about the rights guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution and the protection of these rights, we observe and\n\ncomprehend a manifest ascendance and triumphant march of such\n\nrights which, in turn, paves the way for the doctrine of progressive\n\nrealization of the rights under the Constitution. This doctrine\n\ninvariably reminds us about the living and dynamic nature of a\n\nConstitution. Edmund Burke, delineating upon the progressive and\n\nthe perpetual growing nature of a Constitution, had said that a\n\nConstitution is ever-growing and it is perpetually continuous as it\n\nembodies the spirit of a nation.

The constitutional courts have to recognize that the\n\nconstitutional rights would become a dead letter without their dynamic,\n\nvibrant and pragmatic interpretation. Therefore, it is necessary for the\n\nconstitutional courts to inculcate in their judicial interpretation and\n\ndecision making a sense of engagement and a sense of constitutional\n\nmorality so that they, with the aid of judicial creativity, are able to fulfill\n\ntheir foremost constitutional obligation, that is, to protect the rights\n\nbestowed upon the citizens of our country by the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_218\">185.

Further, the Court\n\nacknowledged that adults may choose to enter upon a relationship in\n\nthe confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain\n\ntheir dignity as free persons and that when sexuality finds overt\n\nexpression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can\n\nbe but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.

The EEOC,\n        the body charged with enforcing Title VII, came to this\n        conclusion for three primary reasons. First, it concluded\n        that   &quot;sexual     orientation  discrimination    is   sex\n        discrimination because it necessarily entails treating an\n        employee less favorably because of the employee&#x27;s sex.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">        Id. at *5 (proffering the example of a woman who is\n        suspended for placing a photo of her female spouse on\n        her desk, and a man who faces no consequences for the\n\n77490U.S. 228 (1989)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">78</span>\n 830 F.3d 698 (7th Cir. 2016)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">\f                                        121</span>\n\n\n          same act).

Finally, the EEOC described sexual orientation\n          discrimination as a form of discrimination based on\n          gender stereotypes in which employees are harassed or\n          punished for failing to live up to societal norms about\n          appropriate     masculine     and    feminine    behaviors,\n          mannerisms, and appearances.

The Court further\n\nobserved that the issue related to two adults who, with full and mutual\n\nconsent of each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a\n\n79   539 U.S. 558 (2003)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">\f                                      122</span>\n\n\nhomosexual lifestyle.

In one line of decisions, the Court has\n          concluded that choices to enter into and maintain\n          certain intimate human relationships must be secured\n          against undue intrusion by the State because of the\n          role of such relationships in safeguarding the individual\n          freedom that is central to our constitutional scheme. In\n          this respect, freedom of association receives protection\n          as a fundamental element of personal liberty.

In Delwin Vriend, the Supreme Court of Canada, relying on the\n\nreasoning adopted by it in Egan v. Canada (supra), applied its well-\n\nknown test of grounds analogous to those specified textually. The\n\nEgan test is:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">       &quot;In Egan, it was said that there are two aspects which\n       are relevant in determining whether the distinction\n       created by the law constitutes discrimination. First,\n       &quot;whether the equality right was denied on the basis of\n       a personal characteristic which is either enumerated in\n       s. 15(1) or which is analogous to those enumerated&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_237\">       Second &quot;whether that distinction has the effect on the\n       claimant of imposing a burden, obligation or\n       disadvantage not imposed upon others or of\n       withholding or limiting access to benefits or\n       advantages which are available to others&quot; (para. 131).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">81</span>\n [1998] 1 SCR 493\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">\f                                  124</span>\n\n\n     A discriminatory distinction was also described as one\n     which is &quot;capable of either promoting or perpetuating\n     the view that the individual adversely affected by this\n     distinction is less capable, or less worthy of recognition\n     or value as a human being or as a member of\n     Canadian society, equally deserving of concern,\n     respect, and consideration&quot; (Egan, at para. 56, per\n     L&#x27;Heureux - Dube J.). It may as well be appropriate to\n     consider whether the unequal treatment is based on\n     &quot;the stereotypical application of presumed group or\n     personal characteristics&quot; (Miron, at para. 128, per\n     McLachlin J.)\n\n     In Egan, it was held, on the basis of &quot;historical social,\n     political and economic disadvantage suffered by\n     homosexuals&quot; and the emerging consensus among\n     legislatures (at para. 176), as well as previous judicial\n     decisions (at para. 177), that sexual orientation is a\n     ground analogous to those listed in<a href=\"/doc/10002733/\" id=\"a_240\"> s. 15(1)</a>. Sexual\n     orientation is &quot;a deeply personal characteristic that is\n     either unchangeable or changeable only at\n     unacceptable personal costs&quot; (para. 5). It is analogous\n     to the other personal characteristics enumerated in<a href=\"/doc/10002733/\" id=\"a_241\"> s.\n     15(1)</a>; and therefore this step of the test is satisfied.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_238\">199. Thereafter, the Court in Delwin Vriend (supra) observed that\n\nperhaps the most important outcome is the psychological harm which\n\nmay ensue from the state of affairs as the fear of discrimination (by\n\nLGBT) would logically lead them to concealment of true identity and\n\nthis is harmful to their personal confidence and self-esteem. The\n\nCourt held that this is a clear example of a distinction which demeans\n\nthe individual and strengthens and perpetrates the view that gays and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">\f                                     125</span>\n\n\nlesbians are less worthy of protection as individuals in Canada‘s\n\nsociety and the potential harm to the dignity and perceived worth of\n\ngay and lesbian individuals constitutes a particularly cruel form of\n\ndiscrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_239\">(iii)   South Africa\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">200. The Constitutional Court of South Africa in National Coalition\n\nfor Gay &amp; Lesbian Equality (supra) made the following relevant\n\nobservations:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">        &quot;Its symbolic effect is to state that in the eyes of our\n        legal system all gay men are criminals. The stigma\n        thus attached to a significant proportion of our\n        population is manifest. But the harm imposed by the\n        criminal law is far more than symbolic. As a result of\n        the criminal offence, gay men are at risk of arrest,\n        prosecution and conviction of the offence of sodomy\n        simply because they seek to engage in sexual conduct\n        which is part of their experience of being human. Just\n        as apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of\n        different racial groups perpetually at risk, the sodomy\n        offence builds insecurity and vulnerability into the daily\n        lives of gay men. There can be no doubt that the\n        existence of a law which punishes a form of sexual\n        expression for gay men degrades and devalues gay\n        men in our broader society. As such it is a palpable\n        invasion of their dignity and a breach of <a href=\"/doc/174845796/\" id=\"a_242\">section 10</a> of\n        the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">\f                                     126</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_241\">(iv)   United Kingdom\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">201. In Euan Sutherland v.

While considering the same, the\n\nCommission       observed   that     no    objective   and   reasonable\n\njustification exists for the maintenance of a higher minimum age of\n\nconsent in case of male homosexuals as compared to\n\nheterosexuals and that the application discloses discriminatory\n\ntreatment in the exercise of the applicant&#x27;s right to respect for\n\nprivate life under <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 8</a> of the Convention. The Commission\n\nfurther observed that sexual orientation was usually established\n\nbefore the age of puberty in both boys and girls and referred to\n\nevidence that reducing the age of consent would unlikely affect the\n\nmajority of men engaging in homosexual activity, either in general\n\nor within specific age groups. The Council of the British Medical\n\nAssociation (BMA) concluded in its Report that the age of consent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">82</span>\n 2001 ECHR 234\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">\f                                                    127</span>\n\n\nfor homosexual men should be set at 16 since the then existing\n\nlaw might inhibit efforts to improve the sexual health of young\n\nhomosexual and bisexual men. An equal age of consent was also\n\nsupported by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Health\n\nEducation Authority and the National Association of Probation\n\nOfficers as well as by other bodies and organizations concerned\n\nwith health and social welfare.

In order to justify the prohibition of\n     a particular expression of opinion, public institutions\n     must show that their actions were caused by\n     &quot;something more than a mere desire to avoid the\n     discomfort    and    unpleasantness        that   always\n     accompany an unpopular viewpoint.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">203. Further, in Toonen‘s case, the Human Rights Committee made\n\nthe following relevant observations:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">     &quot;I concur with this view, as the common denominator\n     for the grounds &quot;race, colour and sex&quot; are biological or\n     genetic factors. This being so, the criminalization of\n     certain behaviour operating under Sections 122(a), (c)\n     and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code must be\n     considered incompatible with <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_244\">article 26</a> of the\n     Covenant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">           Firstly, these provisions of the Tasmanian\n     Criminal Code prohibit sexual intercourse between\n     men and between women, thereby making a distinction\n     between heterosexuals and homosexuals. Secondly,\n     they criminalize other sexual contacts between\n     consenting men without at the same time criminalizing\n     such contacts between women. These provisions\n     therefore set aside the principle of equality before the\n     law. It should be emphasized that it is the\n     criminalization as such that constitutes discrimination\n     of which individuals may claim to be victims, and thus\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">\f                                  129</span>\n\n\n     violates <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_245\">article 26</a>, notwithstanding the fact that the law\n     has not been enforced over a considerable period of\n     time: the designated behaviour none the less remains\n     a criminal offence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">204. In Dudgeon (supra), the European Court of Human Rights\n\nmade the following observations with respect to homosexuality:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">     &quot;It cannot be maintained in these circumstances that\n     there is a &quot;pressing social need&quot; to make such acts\n     criminal offences, there being no sufficient justification\n     provided by the risk of harm to vulnerable sections of\n     society requiring protection or by the effects on the\n     public. On the issue of proportionality, the Court\n     considers that such justifications as there are for\n     retaining the law in force unamended are outweighed\n     by the detrimental effects which the very existence of\n     the legislative provisions in question can have on the\n     life of a person of homosexual orientation like the\n     applicant. Although members of the public who regard\n     homosexuality as immoral may be shocked, offended\n     or disturbed by the commission by others of private\n     homosexual acts, this cannot on its own warrant the\n     application of penal sanctions when it is consenting\n     adults alone who are involved.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_247\">                                          [Emphasis supplied]\n\nO.

A cursory reading of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 375</a> IPC divulges that it is a\n\ngender specific provision for the protection of women as only a man\n\ncan commit the offence of rape. The Section has been divided into\n\ntwo parts. The former part, comprising of Clauses (a) to (d), simply\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">\f                                    132</span>\n\n\ndescribes what acts committed by a man with a woman would\n\namount to rape provided that the said acts are committed in the\n\ncircumstances falling under any of the seven descriptions as\n\nstipulated by the latter part of the Section.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">207. It is in this way that the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 375</a> IPC becomes\n\nimportant as it lays down the circumstances, either of which must be\n\npresent, for an act committed by a man with a woman to come within\n\nthe sweep of the offence of rape. To put it differently, for completing\n\nthe offence of rape, any of the circumstances described in the latter\n\npart of Section 375 must be present. Let us now dissect each of the\n\nseven descriptions appended to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 375</a> IPC which specify the\n\nabsence of a willful and informed consent for constituting the offence\n\nof rape.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">208. The first description provides that any of the acts described in\n\nthe former part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 375</a> IPC would amount to rape if such acts\n\nare committed against the will of the woman. The second description\n\nstipulates that the acts described in the former part would amount to\n\nrape if such acts are committed without the consent of the woman. As\n\nper the third description, the acts would amount to rape even if the\n\nwoman has given her consent but the said consent has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">\f                                  133</span>\n\n\nobtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested, in\n\nfear of death or of hurt. As per the fourth description, the acts would\n\namount to rape when the woman has given her consent but the same\n\nwas given by her under the belief that she is or believes herself to be\n\nlawfully married to the man committing the acts stated in the former\n\npart of the Section. The fifth description provides that the acts\n\ndescribed in the former part would amount to rape if the woman gives\n\nher consent but at the time of giving such consent, she is unable to\n\nunderstand the nature and consequences of the acts to which she\n\nconsents due to the reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or\n\nthe administration of any stupefying or unwholesome substance\n\neither by the man who commits the acts or through another third\n\nperson. The sixth description is plain and simple as it stipulates that\n\nthe acts described in the former part of the Section would amount to\n\nrape, irrespective of the fact whether the woman has given her\n\nconsent or not, if, at the time when the acts were committed, the\n\nwoman was below the age of eighteen years. Coming to the seventh\n\nand the last description, it provides that the acts prescribed in the\n\nformer part would amount to rape if the woman is unable to\n\ncommunicate her consent.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">\f                                 134</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">209. Explanation 2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 375</a> IPC gives the definition of consent\n\nfor the purpose of Section 375 to the effect that consent means an\n\nunequivocal voluntary agreement by the woman through words,\n\ngestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication whereby\n\nshe communicates her willingness to participate in any of the sexual\n\nacts described in the former part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 375</a> IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">210. We have scrutinized the anatomy of the seven descriptions\n\ncontained in the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 375</a> IPC along with Explanation\n\n2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 375</a> IPC to emphasize and accentuate that the element\n\nof absence of consent is firmly ingrained in all the descriptions\n\ncontained in the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 375</a> IPC and the absence of a\n\nwillful and informed consent is sine qua non to designate the acts\n\ncontained in the former part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 375</a> IPC as rape.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">211. Presently, we proceed to scan the anatomy of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_258\">Section 377</a> of\n\nIPC and x-ray the provision to study its real nature and content. It\n\nreads thus:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">     ―Section 377. Unnatural offences.—Whoever\n     voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of\n     nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be\n     punished with imprisonment for life, or with\n     imprisonment of either description for a term which\n     may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to\n     fine.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">\f                                             135</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">           Explanation.—Penetration is sufficient to constitute the\n           carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described\n           in this section.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">212. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 377</a> IPC, unlike Section 375, is a gender-neutral\n\nprovision as it uses the word ‗whoever‘. The word ‗carnal‘, as per the\n\nBlack‘s Law Dictionary 84 , means of the body, relating to the body,\n\nfleshy or sexual. ‗Sexual intercourse‘ has been defined in Black‘s Law\n\nDictionary as a contact between a male and a female‘s organ.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">213. Another expression which has been employed in Section 377 is\n\n‗against the order of nature‘. The phrase ‗against the order of nature‘\n\nhas neither been defined in <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 377</a> IPC nor in any other\n\nprovision of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_261\">IPC</a>.                 The foundation on which <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\nmakes carnal intercourse an offence is the precept that such carnal\n\nintercourse is against the order of nature. This brings us to the\n\nimportant question as to what is ‗against the order of nature‘?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">214. In Khanu (supra), where the question before the Court was\n\nwhether coitus per os (mouth contact with the male genitals) amounts\n\nto carnal intercourse against the order of nature, the Court ruled in\n\nthe affirmative observing that the natural object of intercourse is that\n\nthere should be the possibility of conception of human beings which\n\n\n84                          nd\n     Black’s Law Dictionary, 2 edn.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">\f                                   136</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_255\">in the case of coitus per os is impossible. Thus, the most common\n\nargument against homosexuality and criminalization of carnal\n\nintercourse even between consenting adults of opposite sex is that\n\ntraditionally, the essential purpose of sex is to procreate.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">215. With the passage of time and evolution of the society,\n\nprocreation is not the only reason for which people choose to come\n\ntogether, have live-in relationships, perform coitus or even marry.\n\nThey do so for a whole lot of reasons including emotional\n\ncompanionship. Homer Clark writes:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">      ―But the fact is that the most significant function of\n      marriage today seems to be that it furnishes emotional\n      satisfactions to be found in no other relationships. For\n      many people it is the refuge from the coldness and\n      impersonality of contemporary existence.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_257\">216. In the contemporary world where even marriage is now not\n\nequated to procreation of children, the question that would arise is\n\nwhether homosexuality and carnal intercourse between consenting\n\nadults of opposite sex can be tagged as ‗against the order of nature‘.\n\nIt is the freedom of choice of two consenting adults to perform sex for\n\nprocreation or otherwise and if their choice is that of the latter, it\n\ncannot be said to be against the order of nature. Therefore, sex, if\n\nperformed differently, as per the choice of the consenting adults,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">\f                                   137</span>\n\n\ndoes not per se make it against the order of nature.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_258\">217. Section 377 criminalises even voluntary carnal intercourse not\n\nonly between homosexuals but also between heterosexuals. The\n\nmajor difference between the language of Section 377 and Section\n\n375 is that of the element of absence consent which has been\n\nelaborately incorporated in the seven descriptions contained in the\n\nlatter part of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 375</a> IPC. It is the absence of willful and informed\n\nconsent embodied in the seven descriptions to Section 375 which\n\nmakes the offence of rape criminal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_259\">218. On the other hand, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 377</a> IPC contains no such\n\ndescriptions/exceptions embodying the absence of willful and\n\ninformed consent and criminalises even voluntary carnal intercourse\n\nboth between homosexuals as well as between heterosexuals. While\n\nsaying so, we gain strength and support from the fact that the\n\nlegislature, in its wisdom, while enacting <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 375</a> IPC in its\n\namended form after the <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_266\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013</a>, has\n\nnot employed the words ―subject to any other provision of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_267\">IPC</a>‖.\n\nThe implication of the absence of these words simply indicates that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 375</a> IPC which does not criminalize consensual carnal\n\nintercourse between heterosexuals is not subject to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_269\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">\f                                 138</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_260\">219. Section 377, so far as it criminalises carnal intercourse\n\nbetween heterosexuals is legally unsustainable in its present form for\n\nthe simple reason that <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_270\">Section 375</a> IPC clearly stipulates that carnal\n\nintercourse between a man and a woman with the willful and\n\ninformed consent of the woman does not amount to rape and is not\n\npenal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_261\">220. Despite the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 coming into\n\nforce, by virtue of which Section 375 was amended, whereby the\n\nwords ‗sexual intercourse‘ in Section 375 were replaced by four\n\nelaborate clauses from (a) to (d) giving a wide definition to the\n\noffence of rape, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 377</a> IPC still remains in the statute book in\n\nthe same form. Such an anomaly, if allowed to persist, may result in a\n\nsituation wherein a heterosexual couple who indulges in carnal\n\nintercourse with the willful and informed consent of each other may\n\nbe held liable for the offence of unnatural sex under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 377</a> IPC,\n\ndespite the fact that such an act would not be rape within the\n\ndefinition as provided under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 375</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_262\">221. Drawing an analogy, if consensual carnal intercourse between\n\na heterosexual couple does not amount to rape, it definitely should\n\nnot be labelled and designated as unnatural offence under <a href=\"/doc/64871/\" id=\"a_274\">Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">\f                                  139</span></a>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_275\">377</a> IPC. If any proclivity amongst the heterosexual population\n\ntowards consensual carnal intercourse has been allowed due to the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_276\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013</a>, such kind of proclivity amongst\n\nany two persons including LGBT community cannot be treated as\n\nuntenable so long as it is consensual and it is confined within their\n\nmost private and intimate spaces.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_263\">222. There is another aspect which needs to be discussed, which is\n\nwhether criminalisation of carnal intercourse under Section 377\n\nserves any useful purpose under the prevalent criminal law.\n\nDelineating on this aspect, the European Commission of Human\n\nRights in Dudgeon (supra) opined thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">     ―The 1967 Act, which was introduced into Parliament\n     as a Private Member‘s Bill, was passed to give effect\n     to the recommendations concerning homosexuality\n     made in 1957 in the report of the Departmental\n     Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution\n     established under the chairman ship of Sir John\n     Wolfenden (the ―Wolfenden Committee‖ and\n     ―Wolfenden report‖). The Wolfenden Committee\n     regarded the function of the criminal law in this field as:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">           ―to preserve public order and decency, to\n           protect the citizen from what is offensive or\n           injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards\n           against exploitation and corruption of others,\n           particularly those who are specially vulnerable\n           because they are young, weak in body or\n           mind, inexperienced, or in a state of special\n           physical, official, or economic dependence‖,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">\f                                     140</span>\n\n\n        but not\n\n              ―to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or\n              to seek to enforce any particular pattern of\n              behaviour, further than is necessary to carry\n              out the purposes we have outlined‖.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">     The Wolfenden Committee concluded that homosexual\n     behaviour between consenting adults in private was\n     part of the ―realm of private morality and immorality\n     which is, in brief and crude terms, not the law‘s\n     business‖ and should no longer be criminal‖\n                                        [Underlining is ours]\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">223. At the very least, it can be said that criminalisation of\n\nconsensual      carnal   intercourse,      be   it   amongst   homosexuals,\n\nheterosexuals, bi-sexuals or transgenders, hardly serves any\n\nlegitimate public purpose or interest.

In view of the aforesaid analysis, we record our conclusions in\n\nseriatim:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">     (i)      The eminence of identity which has been luculently stated in\n\n              the NALSA case very aptly connects human rights and the\n\n              constitutional guarantee of right to life and liberty with dignity.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_298\">              With the same spirit, we must recognize that the concept of\n\n              identity which has a constitutional tenability cannot be\n\n              pigeon-holed singularly to one‘s orientation as it may keep\n\n              the individual choice at bay. At the core of the concept of\n\n              identity lies self-determination, realization of one‘s own\n\n              abilities visualizing the opportunities and rejection of external\n\n              views with a clear conscience that is in accord with\n\n              constitutional norms and values or principles that are, to put\n\n              in a capsule, ―constitutionally permissible‖.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_299\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_288\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_289\">(ii)     In <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_355\">Suresh Koushal</a> (supra), this Court overturned the\n\n              decision of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_356\">Naz Foundation</a> (supra)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">\f                                 157</span>\n\n\n        thereby upholding the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 377</a> IPC\n\n        and stating a ground that the LGBT community comprised\n\n        only a minuscule fraction of the total population and that the\n\n        mere fact that the said Section was being misused is not a\n\n        reflection of the vires of the Section.

The Courts must commemorate that it is the\n\n        Constitution and its golden principles to which they bear their\n\n        foremost allegiance and they must robe themselves with the\n\n        armoury of progressive and pragmatic interpretation to\n\n        combat the evils of inequality and injustice that try to creep\n\n        into the society. The role of the Courts gains more\n\n        importance when the rights which are affected belong to a\n\n        class of persons or a minority group who have been\n\n        deprived of even their basic rights since time immemorial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_301\">(iv)    The primary objective of having a constitutional democracy\n\n        is to transform the society progressively and inclusively. Our\n\n        Constitution has been perceived to be transformative in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">\f                                158</span>\n\n\n      sense that the interpretation of its provisions should not be\n\n      limited to the mere literal meaning of its words; instead they\n\n      ought to be given a meaningful construction which is\n\n      reflective of their intent and purpose in consonance with the\n\n      changing times. Transformative constitutionalism not only\n\n      includes within its wide periphery the recognition of the rights\n\n      and dignity of individuals but also propagates the fostering\n\n      and development of an atmosphere wherein every individual\n\n      is bestowed with adequate opportunities to develop socially,\n\n      economically and politically. Discrimination of any kind\n\n      strikes at the very core of any democratic society. When\n\n      guided by transformative constitutionalism, the society is\n\n      dissuaded from indulging in any form of discrimination so\n\n      that the nation is guided towards a resplendent future.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_302\">(v)   Constitutional morality embraces within its sphere several\n\n      virtues, foremost of them being the espousal of a pluralistic\n\n      and inclusive society. The concept of constitutional morality\n\n      urges the organs of the State, including the Judiciary, to\n\n      preserve the heterogeneous nature of the society and to\n\n      curb any attempt by the majority to usurp the rights and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">\f                                 159</span>\n\n\n       freedoms of a smaller or minuscule section of the populace.\n\n       Constitutional morality cannot be martyred at the altar of\n\n       social morality and it is only constitutional morality that can\n\n       be allowed to permeate into the Rule of Law. The veil of\n\n       social morality cannot be used to violate fundamental rights\n\n       of   even   a   single   individual,   for   the   foundation   of\n\n       constitutional morality rests upon the recognition of diversity\n\n       that pervades the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_303\">(vi)   The right to live with dignity has been recognized as a\n\n       human right on the international front and by number of\n\n       precedents of this Court and, therefore, the constitutional\n\n       courts must strive to protect the dignity of every individual,\n\n       for without the right to dignity, every other right would be\n\n       rendered meaningless. Dignity is an inseparable facet of\n\n       every individual that invites reciprocative respect from others\n\n       to every aspect of an individual which he/she perceives as\n\n       an essential attribute of his/her individuality, be it an\n\n       orientation or an optional expression of choice.

In the western world, given the fact that both Judaism and\n\nChristianity outlawed sexual intercourse by same-sex couples,\n\noffences relating thereto were decided by ecclesiastical courts.\n\nIt is only as a result of Henry VIII of England breaking with the\n\nRoman Catholic Church that legislation in his reign, namely the\n\nBuggery   Act   of   1533,   prohibited   “the   detestable   and\n\nabominable offence” of buggery committed with mankind or\n\nbeast.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_332\">8.    Between 1806, when reliable figures begin, and 1900,\n\n8,921 men were indicted for sodomy, gross indecency or other\n\n‘unnatural misdemeanours’ in England and Wales.

Fifty-six were executed, and the remainder\n\n       were either imprisoned or transported to Australia for life. Two\n\n       such men, James Pratt and John Smith, were the last to be\n\n       executed in Britain for sodomy on 27 November, 1835.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_333\">       9.      During the reign of the East India Company in India,\n\n       Parliament established what was called the Indian Law\n\n       Commission. In 1833, Thomas Babington Macaulay was\n\n       appointed to chair the Commission.2\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_334\">       10.     The Indian Law Commission, with Macaulay as its head,\n\n       submitted the Draft Penal Code to the Government of India on\n\n       14.10.1837. This draft consisted of 488 clauses. After the First\n\n       Report submitted on 23.07.1846, the Second Report of Her\n\n       Majesty’s Commissioners for revising and consolidating the law\n\n       was submitted by C.H. Cameron and D. Eliott on 24.06.1847.\n2Thomas Babington Macaulay was a Whig liberal who was a precocious genius. Apart from having a\nphotographic memory with which he astounded persons around him, one incident which took place when\nMacaulay was only 5 years old told the world what was in store for it when Macaulay would reach\nadulthood. A lady dropped some hot coffee on the five-year old child and expressed great sorrow for\ndoing so. The child riposted, after letting out a scream, “Madam, the agony has abated”.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_316\">                                                                                                 6</span>\n\fThese Commissioners concluded that the Draft Penal Code\n\nwas sufficiently complete, and, with slight modifications, fit to be\n\nacted upon.

Even if it could be established that\nhomosexuality were a disease, it is clear that many\nindividuals, however their state is reached, present\nsocial rather than medical problems and must be\ndealt with by social, including penological, methods.\nThis is especially relevant when the claim that\nhomosexuality is an illness is taken to imply that its\ntreatment should be a medical responsibility. Much\nmore important than the academic question whether\nhomosexuality is a disease is the practical question\nwhether a doctor should carry out any part or all of\nthe treatment. Psychiatrists deal regularly with\nproblems of personality which are not regarded as\ndiseases, and conversely the treatment of cases of\nrecognized psychiatric illness may not be strictly\nmedical but may best be carried out by non-medical\nsupervision or environmental change. Examples\nwould be certain cases of senile dementia or\nchronic schizophrenia which can best be managed\nat home. In fact, the treatment of behavior\ndisorders, even when medically supervised, is rarely\nconfined to psychotherapy or to treatment of a\nstrictly medical kind. This is not to deny that expert\nadvice should be sought in very many homosexual\ncases.

The claim that homosexuality is an illness\ncarries the further implication that the sufferer\ncannot help it and therefore carries a diminished\nresponsibility for his actions. Even if it were\naccepted that homosexuality could properly be\ndescribed as a “disease”, we should not accept this\ncorollary. There are no prima facie grounds for\nsupposing that because a particular person’s sexual\npropensity happens to lie in the direction of persons\nof his or her own sex it is any less controllable than\nthat of those whose propensity is for persons of the\nopposite sex. We are informed that patients in\nmental hospitals, with few exceptions, show clearly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">                                                         14</span>\n\f      by their behavior that they can and do exercise a\n      high degree of responsibility and self-control; for\n      example, only a small minority need to be kept in\n      locked wards. The existence of varying degrees of\n      self-control is a matter of daily experience - the\n      extent to which coughing can be controlled is an\n      example - and the capacity for self-control can vary\n      with the personality structure or with temporary\n      physical or emotional conditions. The question\n      which is important for us here is whether the\n      individual suffers from a condition which causes\n      diminished responsibility. This is a different question\n      from the question whether he was responsible in the\n      past for the causes or origins of his present\n      condition. That is an interesting enquiry and may be\n      of relevance in other connections; but our concern is\n      with the behavior which flows from the individual’s\n      present condition and with the extent to which he is\n      responsible for that behavior, whatever may have\n      been the causes of the condition from which it\n      springs. Just as expert opinion can give valuable\n      assistance in deciding on the appropriate ways of\n      dealing with a convicted person, so can it help in\n      assessing the additional factors that may affect his\n      present responsibility?”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_345\">24.   It then went on to note in paragraph 36 that the evidence\n\nbefore them showed that homosexuality existed in all levels of\n\nsociety and was prevalent in all trades and professions. In\n\nparagraph 53, the main arguments for retention of the existing\n\nlaw were set out. Insofar as societal health was concerned, the\n\nCommittee rejected this for lack of evidence.

As regards the first of these arguments, it is\nheld that conduct of this kind is a cause of the\ndemoralization and decay of civilisations, and that\ntherefore, unless we wish to see our nation\ndegenerate and decay, such conduct must be\nstopped, by every possible means. We have found\nno evidence to support this view, and we cannot feel\nit right to frame the laws which should govern this\ncountry in the present age by reference to\nhypothetical explanations of the history of other\npeoples in ages distant in time and different in\ncircumstances from our own. In so far as the basis\nof this argument can be precisely formulated, it is\noften no more than the expression of revulsion\nagainst what is regarded as unnatural, sinful or\ndisgusting. Many people feel this revulsion, for one\nor more of these reasons. But moral conviction or\ninstinctive feeling, however strong, is not a valid\nbasis for overriding the individual’s privacy and for\nbringing within the ambit of the criminal law private\nsexual behaviour of this kind. It is held also that if\nsuch men are employed in certain professions or\ncertain branches of the public service their private\nhabits may render them liable to threats of blackmail\nor to other pressures which may make them “bad\nsecurity risks.” If this is true, it is true also of some\nother categories of persons: for example, drunkards,\ngamblers and those who become involved in\ncompromising situations of a heterosexual kind; and\nwhile it may be a valid ground for excluding from\ncertain forms of employment men who indulge in\nhomosexual behaviour, it does not, in our view,\nconstitute a sufficient reason for making their private\nsexual behaviour an offence in itself.”\n                                 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">                                                            16</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_347\">\f25.   Insofar as the damaging effects on family life were\n\nconcerned, this was rejected by stating:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">      “55. The second contention, that homosexual\n      behaviour between males has a damaging effect on\n      family life, may well be true. Indeed, we have had\n      evidence, that it often is; cases in which\n      homosexual behaviour on the part of the husband\n      has broken up a marriage are by no means rare,\n      and there are also cases in which a man in whom\n      the homosexual component is relatively weak\n      nevertheless derives such satisfaction from\n      homosexual outlets that he does not enter upon a\n      marriage which might have been successfully and\n      happily consummated. We deplore this damage to\n      what we regard as the basic unit of society; but\n      cases are also frequently encountered in which a\n      marriage has been broken up by homosexual\n      behaviour on the part of the wife, and no doubt\n      some women, too, derive sufficient satisfaction from\n      homosexual outlets to prevent their marrying. We\n      have had no reasons shown to us which would lead\n      us to believe that homosexual behaviour between\n      males inflicts any greater damage on family life than\n      adultery, fornication or lesbian behaviour. These\n      practices are all reprehensible from the point of view\n      of harm to the family, but it is difficult to see why on\n      this ground male homosexual behaviour alone\n      among them should be a criminal offence. This\n      argument is not to be taken as saying that society\n      should condone or approve male homosexual\n      behaviour. But where adultery, fornication and\n      lesbian behaviour are not criminal offences there\n      seems to us to be no valid ground, on the basis of\n      damage to the family, for so regarding homosexual\n      behaviour between men. Moreover, it has to be\n      recognized that the mere existence of the condition\n      of homosexuality in one of the partners can result in\n      an unsatisfactory marriage, so that for a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                                                                 17</span>\n\f      homosexual to marry simply for the sake of\n      conformity with the accepted structure of society or\n      in the hope of curing his condition may result in\n      disaster.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_348\">26.

We should certainly not wish to\n      countenance any proposal which might tend to\n      increase offences against minors. Indeed, if we\n      thought that any recommendation for a change in\n      the law would increase the danger to minors, we\n      should not make it. But in this matter, we have been\n      much influenced by our expert witnesses. They are\n      in no doubt that whatever may be the origins of the\n      homosexual condition, there are two recognisably\n      different categories among adult male homosexuals.\n      There are those who seek as partners other adult\n      males, and there are paedophiliacs, that is to say\n      men who seek as partners boys who have not\n      reached puberty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">      57.

Therefore, such a claimed fundamental right could\n\nnot possibly exist when adultery, incest and other sexual crimes\n\nare punished, even though they may be committed in the home.\n\nAnother important rationale was that the Georgia law was\n\nbased on a notion of morality, which is a choice that could\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">                                                                     21</span>\n\flegitimately be exercised by a State Legislature. Chief Justice\n\nBurger, concurring, again relied heavily on ‘ancient roots’,\n\nstating that throughout the history of western civilization,\n\nhomosexual sodomy was outlawed in the Judeo-Christian\n\ntradition, which the Georgia legislature could well follow.\n\nJustice Powell, concurring with the majority, found that to\n\nimprison a person upto 20 years for a single, private,\n\nconsensual act of sodomy within the home would be a cruel\n\nand unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth\n\nAmendment. However, since no trial had taken place on the\n\nfacts, and since the respondent did not raise any such Eighth\n\nAmendment issue, Justice Powell concurred with the majority.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_357\">32.   The dissenting opinion of four Justices makes interesting\n\nreading. Justice Blackmun, who spoke for four dissenters,\n\nbegan with the classical definition of the old privacy right which\n\nis the “right to be let alone”, and quoted from Justice Holmes’\n\narticle The Path of the Law, stating:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">      “[i]t is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of\n      law than that so it was laid down in the time of\n      Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon\n      which it was laid down have vanished long since,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_332\">                                                                     22</span>\n\f      and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of\n      the past.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">33.   So much, then, for history and its “ancient roots”. Justice\n\nBlackmun’s dissent then went on to consider the famous\n\njudgment in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972), in\n\nwhich the Court had upheld the fundamental right of the Amish\n\ncommunity not to send their children to schools, stating that a\n\nway of life that is odd or even erratic but interferes with no\n\nrights or interests of others is not to be condemned because it\n\nis different. Referring to Judeo-Christian values, the Court said\n\nthat the fact that certain religious groups condemn the behavior\n\nof sodomy gives the State no licence to impose their moral\n\njudgment on the entire citizenry of the United States. Ending\n\nwith a John Stuart Mill type of analysis, the dissent stated:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">      “44. This case involves no real interference with the\n      rights of others, for the mere knowledge that other\n      individuals do not adhere to one’s value system\n      cannot be a legally cognizable interest, cf.

In Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), by a\n\nmajority of 6:3, Justice Anthony Kennedy, speaking for the\n\nmajority, set aside the judgment in Bowers (supra), accepting\n\nthat the dissenting judgments in that case were correct. In a tilt\n\nat the history analysis of the majority judgment in Bowers\n\n(supra), the Court found that earlier sodomy laws were not\n\ndirected at homosexuals at large, but instead sought to prohibit\n\nnon-procreative sexual activity more generally, and were not\n\nenforced against consenting adults acting in private. After citing\n\nfrom Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey\n\n(“Casey”), 505 U.S. 833 (1992), the majority held – “our\n\nobligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own\n\nmoral code.” The majority judgment then referred to a Model\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_334\">                                                                     24</span>\n\f       Penal Code that the American Law Institute took out in 1955,\n\n       making it clear that it did not provide for criminal penalties for\n\n       consensual same-sex relationships conducted in private. The\n\n       judgment then went on to refer to the Wolfenden Committee\n\n       Report and the Sexual Offences Act,1967 in the United\n\n       Kingdom and referred to the European Court’s decision in\n\n       Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981). It then\n\n       referred to Romer v. Evans (“Romer”), 517 U.S. 620 (1996),\n\n       where the Court struck down a class-based legislation which\n\n       deprived homosexuals of State anti-discrimination laws as a\n\n       violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The majority then\n\n       found that the 1986 decision of Bowers (supra), had “sustained\n\n       serious erosion” through their recent decisions in Casey (supra)\n\n       and Romer (supra), and had, therefore, to be revisited.5 Justice\n\n\n\n5The majority’s decision echoes what had happened earlier in what is referred to as the celebrated flag\nsalute case, namely, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). The\nU.S. Supreme Court had overruled its recent judgment in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310\nU.S. 586 (1940). Justice Jackson speaking for the majority of the Court found:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">        “The freedom asserted by these appellees does not bring them into collision with rights\n        asserted by any other individual.

Justice Scalia, with whom the\n\n        Chief Justice and Justice Thomas joined, found no reason to\n\n        undo the Bowers (supra) verdict stating that stare decisis\n\n        should carry the day. An interesting passage in Justice Scalia’s\n\n        judgment reads as follows:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                 “Let me be clear that I have nothing against\n                 homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their\n                 agenda through normal democratic means. Social\n                 perceptions of sexual and other morality change\n                 over time, and every group has the right to\n                 persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such\n                 matters is the best. That homosexuals have\n                 achieved some success in that enterprise is attested\n                 to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining\n                 States that criminalize private, consensual\n                 homosexual acts. But persuading one’s fellow\n                 citizens is one thing, and imposing one’s views in\n                 absence of democratic majority will is something\n                 else. I would no more require a State to criminalize\n                 homosexual acts—or, for that matter, display any\n                 moral disapprobation of them—than I would forbid it\n                 to do so. What Texas has chosen to do is well within\n                 the range of traditional democratic action, and its\n                 hand should not be stayed through the invention of\n                 a brand-new “constitutional right” by a Court that is\n                 impatient of democratic change. It is indeed true\n                 that “later generations can see that laws once\n\n        assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on\n        the outcome of no elections.”\nAnd finally, it was held:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">        “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or\n        petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other\n        matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there\n        are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_336\">                                                                                                           26</span>\n\f      thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to\n      oppress,” [ante, at 579]; and when that happens,\n      later generations can repeal those laws.

Before coming to our own judgments, we may quickly\n\nsurvey some of the judgments of the courts of other democratic\n\nnations. The European Community decisions, beginning with\n\nDudgeon v. United Kingdom (supra) and continuing with\n\nNorris v. Ireland, Application no. 10581/83, and Modinos v.\n\nCyprus, 16 EHRR 485 (1993), have all found provisions similar\n\nto Section 377 to     be violative of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_412\">Article 8</a> of the European\n\nHuman Rights Convention, 1948 in which everyone has the\n\nright to respect for his private and family life, his home and his\n\ncorrespondence, and no interference can be made with these\n\nrights unless the law is necessary in a democratic society inter\n\nalia for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of\n\nhealth or morals, or for the protection of the rights and\n\nfreedoms of others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_365\">38.   In El-Al Israel Airlines Ltd. v.

The Court\n\nheld:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">         “14.….The principle of equality demands that the\n         existence of a rule that treats people differently is\n         justified by the nature and substance of the issue.\n         The principle of equality therefore presumes the\n         existence of objective reasons that justify a\n         difference (a distinction, dissimilarity). Discrimination\n         — which is the opposite of equality — exists\n         therefore in those situations where a different law\n         for people who are (de facto) different from one\n         another is based on reasons that are insufficient to\n         justify a distinction between them in a free and\n         democratic society. In Justice Or’s words,\n         discrimination is ‘different treatment without an\n         objective justification’ (Hoppert v. ‘Yad VaShem’\n         Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority\n         [12], at p. 360). President Agranat discussed this\n         and pointed out:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">               ‘The principle of equality, which is merely\n               the opposite of discrimination and which,\n               for reasons of justice and fairness, the\n               law of every democratic country aspires\n               to achieve, means that people must be\n               treated equally for a particular purpose,\n               when no real differences that are relevant\n               to this purpose exist between them. If\n               they are not treated equally, we have a\n               case of discrimination. However, if the\n               difference     or    differences   between\n               different people are relevant for the\n               purpose under discussion, it is a\n               permitted distinction to treat them\n               differently for that purpose, provided that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">                                                                     28</span>\n\f      those differences justify this. In this\n      context, the concept of “equality”\n      therefore means “relevant equality”, and it\n      requires, with regard to the purpose\n      under discussion, “equality of treatment”\n      for those persons in this state. By\n      contrast, it will be a permitted distinction if\n      the different treatment of different\n      persons derives from their being for the\n      purpose of the treatment, in a state of\n      relevant inequality, just as it will be\n      discrimination if it derives from their being\n      in a state of inequality that is not relevant\n      to the purpose of the treatment’ (FH\n      10/69 Boronovski v. Chief Rabbis [16], at\n      p. 35).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">Therefore, a particular law will create discrimination\nwhen two individuals, who are different from one\nanother (factual inequality), are treated differently by\nthe law, even though the factual difference between\nthem does not justify different treatment in the\ncircumstances. Discrimination is therefore based on\nthe factors of arbitrariness, injustice and\nunreasonableness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">XXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">17.

In this context, it\n     notes that the policy of the Department of Public\n     Prosecutions not to initiate criminal proceedings in\n     respect of private homosexual conduct does not\n     amount to a guarantee that no actions will be\n     brought against homosexuals in the future,\n     particularly in the light of undisputed statements of\n     the Director of Public Prosecutions of Tasmania in\n     1988 and those of members of the Tasmanian\n     Parliament.

As to\n     whether it may be deemed arbitrary, the Committee\n     recalls that pursuant to its General Comment 16 on\n     <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_415\">article 17</a>, the &quot;introduction of the concept of\n     arbitrariness is intended to guarantee that even\n     interference provided for by the law should be in\n     accordance with the provisions, aims and objectives\n     of the Covenant and should be, in any event,\n     reasonable     in   the     circumstances”.(4) The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                                                                    32</span>\n\fCommittee     interprets   the    requirement    of\nreasonableness to imply that any interference with\nprivacy must be proportional to the end sought and\nbe necessary in the circumstances of any given\ncase.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">XXX\n8.5 As far as the public health argument of the\nTasmanian authorities is concerned, the Committee\nnotes that the criminalization of homosexual\npractices cannot be considered a reasonable means\nor proportionate measure to achieve the aim of\npreventing the spread of AIDS/HIV. The Australian\nGovernment observes that statutes criminalizing\nhomosexual activity tend to impede public health\nprogrammes “by driving underground many of the\npeople at the risk of infection”. Criminalization of\nhomosexual activity thus would appear to run\ncounter to the implementation of effective education\nprogrammes in respect of the HIV/AIDS prevention.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_373\">Secondly, the Committee notes that no link has\nbeen shown between the continued criminalization\nof homosexual activity and the effective control of\nthe spread of the HIV/AIDS virus.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_374\">XXX\n8.7 The State party has sought the Committee&#x27;s\nguidance as to whether sexual orientation may be\nconsidered an “other status” for the purposes of\n<a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_416\">article 26.</a> The same issue could arise under <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_417\">article\n2</a>, paragraph 1, of the Covenant.

Self-determination of\n      gender is an integral part of personal autonomy and\n      self-expression and falls within the realm of\n      personal liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_453\">Article 21</a> of the\n      Constitution of India.”</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_395\">54.

The chilling\neffect on the exercise of the right poses a grave\ndanger to the unhindered fulfilment of one&#x27;s sexual\norientation, as an element of privacy and dignity.\nThe chilling effect is due to the danger of a human\nbeing subjected to social opprobrium or disapproval,\nas reflected in the punishment of crime. <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_463\">Hence the\nKoushal [Suresh Kumar Koushal v.

The respect for an individual human\nbeing and in particular for his right to choose how he\nshould live his own life is individual autonomy or the\nright of self-determination. It is the right against non-\ninterference by others, which gives a competent\nperson who has come of age the right to make\ndecisions concerning his or her own life and body\nwithout any control or interference of others. Lord\nHoffman, in Reeves v. Commr. of Police of the\nMetropolis [Reeves v.

An inquiry into Common Law jurisdictions\nreveals that all adults with capacity to consent have\nthe right of self-determination and autonomy.

Under our Constitution, the inherent value\n      which sanctifies life is the dignity of existence.\n      Recognising human dignity is intrinsic to preserving\n      the sanctity of life. Life is truly sanctified when it is\n      lived with dignity. There exists a close relationship\n      between dignity and the quality of life. For, it is only\n      when life can be lived with a true sense of quality\n      that the dignity of human existence is fully realised.\n      Hence, there should be no antagonism between the\n      sanctity of human life on the one hand and the\n      dignity and quality of life on the other hand.

Liberty and autonomy are\n      essential attributes of a life of substance. It is liberty\n      which enables an individual to decide upon those\n      matters which are central to the pursuit of a\n      meaningful existence.

[Ibid.] Thus, choices and\n      decisions on matters such as procreation,\n      contraception and marriage have been held to be\n      protected. While death is an inevitable end in the\n      trajectory of the cycle of human life of individuals\n      are often faced with choices and decisions relating\n      to death. Decisions relating to death, like those\n      relating to birth, sex, and marriage, are protected by\n      the Constitution by virtue of the right of privacy. The\n      right to privacy resides in the right to liberty and in\n      the respect of autonomy. [T.L. Beauchamp, “The\n      Right to Privacy and the Right to Die”, Social\n      Philosophy and Policy (2000), Vol. 17, at p. 276.]\n      The right to privacy protects autonomy in making\n      decisions related to the intimate domain of death as\n      well as bodily integrity. Few moments could be of as\n      much importance as the intimate and private\n      decisions that we are faced regarding death. [Ibid.]\n      Continuing treatment against the wishes of a patient\n      is not only a violation of the principle of informed\n      consent, but also of bodily privacy and bodily\n      integrity that have been recognised as a facet of\n      privacy by this Court.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_421\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18303067\" id=\"span_383\">64.

During the first half of the 20th\n      century, many mental health professionals regarded\n      homosexuality as a pathological condition, but that\n      perspective    reflected    untested     assumptions\n      supported largely by clinical impressions of patients\n      seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct\n      brought them into the criminal justice system.

But research conducted over four\ndecades has established that “homosexuality in and\nof itself bears no necessary relationship to\npsychological adjustment.” The efforts to “cure”\nhomosexuality that were prevalent in earlier\ngenerations—which          included       hypnosis,\nadministration of hormones, aversive conditioning\nwith electric shock or nausea-inducing drugs,\nlobotomy, electroshock, and castration—are now\nregarded by the mental-health professions as\nregrettable.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_392\">                                                         64</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_432\">\f69.

Discrimination, Prejudice, And Violence\n      Encountered By Gay People\n      Lesbians and gay men in the United States\n      encounter extensive prejudice, discrimination, and\n      violence because of their sexual orientation. Intense\n      prejudice against gay men and lesbians was\n      widespread throughout much of the 20th century;\n      public opinion studies routinely showed that, among\n      large segments of the public, gay people were the\n      target of strong antipathy. Although a shift in public\n      opinion concerning homosexuality occurred in the\n      1990s, hostility toward gay men and lesbians\n      remains common in contemporary American\n      society. Prejudice against bisexuals appears to exist\n      at comparable levels. Discrimination against gay\n      people in employment and housing also appears to\n      remain widespread.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">      The severity of this anti-gay prejudice is reflected in\n      the consistently high rate of anti-gay harassment\n      and violence in American society. Numerous\n      surveys indicate that verbal harassment and abuse\n      are nearly universal experiences of gay people.\n      Although physical violence is less common,\n      substantial numbers of gay people report having\n      experienced crimes against their person or property\n      because of their sexual orientation. In 2001, the\n      most recent year for which FBI statistics are\n      available, there were 1,375 reported bias motivated\n      incidents against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals.\n      That figure likely represents only a fraction of such\n      crimes, because reporting of hate crimes by law\n      enforcement       agencies     is   voluntary,      the\n      thoroughness of police statistics differs widely\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_393\">                                                                    65</span>\n\f      among jurisdictions, and many victims do not report\n      their experiences to police because they fear further\n      harassment or lack confidence that the assailants\n      will be caught.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">      Although homosexuality is not a mental disorder,\n      this societal prejudice against gay men and lesbians\n      can cause them real and substantial psychological\n      harm. Research indicates that experiencing\n      rejection, discrimination, and violence is associated\n      with heightened psychological distress among gay\n      men and lesbians. These problems are exacerbated\n      by the fact that, because of anti-gay stigma, gay\n      men and lesbians have less access to social\n      support and other resources that assist\n      heterosexuals in coping with stress. Although many\n      gay men and lesbians learn to cope with the social\n      stigma against homosexuality, efforts to avoid that\n      social stigma through attempts to conceal or\n      dissimulate sexual orientation can be seriously\n      damaging to the psychological well-being of gay\n      people. Lesbians and gay men have been found to\n      manifest better mental health to the extent that they\n      feel positively about their sexual orientation and\n      have integrated it into their lives through “coming\n      out” and participating in the gay community. Being\n      able to disclose one’s sexual orientation to others\n      also increases the availability of social support,\n      which is crucial to mental health.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_433\">70.

In Bowers, a bare\n      majority upheld a law criminalizing same-sex\n      intimacy. See 478 U.S., at 186, 190–195. That\n      approach might have been viewed as a cautious\n      endorsement of the democratic process, which had\n      only just begun to consider the rights of gays and\n      lesbians.

As\n      evidenced by the dissents in that case, the facts and\n      principles necessary to a correct holding were\n      known to the Bowers Court. See id., at 199\n      (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and\n      Stevens, JJ., dissenting); id., at 214 (Stevens, J.,\n      joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting).\n      That is why Lawrence held Bowers was “not correct\n      when it was decided.” 539 U.S., at 578. Although\n      Bowers was eventually repudiated in Lawrence,\n      men and women were harmed in the interim, and\n      the substantial effects of these injuries no doubt\n      lingered long after Bowers was overruled. Dignitary\n      wounds cannot always be healed with the stroke of\n      a pen.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">72.

Another argument raised on behalf of the intervenors is\n\n       that change in society, if any, can be reflected by amending\n\n       laws by the elected representatives of the people. Thus, it\n\n       would be open to the Parliament to carve out an exception from\n\n       Section 377, but this Court should not indulge in taking upon\n\n       itself the guardianship of changing societal mores. Such an\n\n       argument must be emphatically rejected. The very purpose of\n\n       the fundamental rights chapter in the Constitution of India is to\n\n       withdraw the subject of liberty and dignity of the individual and\n\n       place      such     subject      beyond       the     reach     of    majoritarian\n\n       governments so that constitutional morality can be applied by\n\n       this Court to give effect to the rights, among others, of ‘discrete\n\n       and insular’ minorities.6 One such minority has knocked on the\n\n       doors of this Court as this Court is the custodian of the\n\n       fundamental rights of citizens. These fundamental rights do not\n\n       depend upon the outcome of elections. And, it is not left to\n\n       majoritarian governments to prescribe what shall be orthodox in\n\n       matters concerning social morality. The fundamental rights\n\n       chapter is like the north star in the universe of constitutionalism\n\n\n6 This phrase occurs in one of the most celebrated footnotes in the US Supreme Court’s constitutional\nhistory – namely, Footnote 4 of United States v.

Suresh Kumar Koushal’s judgment (supra) first\n\nbegins with the presumption of constitutionality attaching to pre-\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_423\">                                                                     88</span>\n\fconstitutional laws, such as the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_517\">Indian Penal Code</a>. The\n\njudgment goes on to state that pre-constitutional laws, which\n\nhave been adopted by Parliament and used with or without\n\namendment, being manifestations of the will of the people of\n\nIndia through Parliament, are presumed to be constitutional.\n\nWe are afraid that we cannot agree.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_489\">90.   <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_518\">Article 372</a> of the Constitution of India continues laws in\n\nforce in the territory of India immediately before the\n\ncommencement of the Constitution. That the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_519\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n\nis a law in force in the territory of India immediately before the\n\ncommencement of this Constitution is beyond cavil.         Under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_520\">Article 372(2)</a>, the President may, by order, make such\n\nadaptations and modifications of an existing law as may be\n\nnecessary or expedient to bring such law in accord with the\n\nprovisions of the Constitution. The fact that the President has\n\nnot made any adaptation or modification as mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/74529/\" id=\"a_521\">Article\n\n372(2)</a> does not take the matter very much further. The\n\npresumption of constitutionality of a statute is premised on the\n\nfact that Parliament understands the needs of the people, and\n\nthat, as per the separation of powers doctrine, Parliament is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_424\">                                                                     89</span>\n\faware of its limitations in enacting laws – it can only enact laws\n\nwhich do not fall within List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution\n\nof India, and cannot transgress the fundamental rights of the\n\ncitizens and other constitutional provisions in doing so.\n\nParliament is therefore deemed to be aware of the aforesaid\n\nconstitutional limitations. Where, however, a pre-constitution\n\nlaw is made by either a foreign legislature or body, none of\n\nthese parameters obtain. It is therefore clear that no such\n\npresumption attaches to a pre-constitutional statute like the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_522\">Indian Penal Code</a>. In fact, in the majority judgment of B.P.\n\nJeevan Reddy, J. in New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of\n\nPunjab and Ors., (1997) 7 SCC 339, the <a href=\"/doc/115845812/\" id=\"a_523\">Punjab Municipal Act</a>\n\nof 1911 was deemed to be a post-constitutional law inasmuch\n\nas it was extended to Delhi only in 1950, as a result of which\n\nthe presumption of constitutionality was raised. Ahmadi, C.J.’s\n\ndissenting opinion correctly states that if a pre-constitutional law\n\nis challenged, the presumption of constitutional validity would\n\nnot obtain. The relevant paragraph is extracted below:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_293\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"129099\" id=\"span_425\">“119.

The basis of this doctrine is the\n      assumed intention of the legislators not to\n      transgress constitutional boundaries. It is difficult to\n      appreciate how that intention can be assumed\n      when, at the time that the law was passed, there\n      was no such barrier and the limitation was brought\n      in by a Constitution long after the enactment of the\n      law. (This Court has in a Constitution Bench\n      decision, <a href=\"/doc/129099/\" id=\"a_525\">Gulabbhai Vallabbhai Desai v. Union of\n      India</a> [AIR 1967 SC 1110 : (1967) 1 SCR 602] , (AIR\n      at p. 1117 raised doubts along similar lines). The\n      Framers obviously wanted the law under <a href=\"/doc/808995/\" id=\"a_526\">Article\n      289(2)</a> to be of a very high standard. Can these\n      laws, which are silent on the most important aspect\n      required by <a href=\"/doc/808995/\" id=\"a_527\">Article 289(2)</a>, i.e., the specification of\n      the trading activities of State Governments which\n      would be liable to Union taxation, be said to meet\n      with that standard?”</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_490\">91.

The fact that the legislature has chosen not to amend the\n\nlaw, despite the 172nd Law Commission Report specifically\n\nrecommending deletion of Section 377, may indicate that\n\nParliament has not thought it proper to delete the aforesaid\n\nprovision, is one more reason for not invalidating Section 377,\n\naccording to <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_528\">Suresh Kumar Koushal</a> (supra).

It is a neutral fact which need not be taken\n\ninto account at all.

It is a little difficult to appreciate the Court stating that the\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_530\">Section 377</a> IPC is only determined with reference to\n\nthe sexual act itself and the circumstances in which it is\n\nexecuted. It is also a little difficult to appreciate that Section 377\n\nregulates sexual conduct regardless of gender identity and\n\norientation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_494\">94.   After 2013, when Section 375 was amended so as to\n\ninclude anal and certain other kinds of sexual intercourse\n\nbetween a man and a woman, which would not be criminalized\n\nas rape if it was between consenting adults, it is clear that if\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_430\">                                                                          92</span>\n\fSection 377 continues to penalize such sexual intercourse, an\n\nanomalous position would result. A man indulging in such\n\nsexual intercourse would not be liable to be prosecuted for rape\n\nbut would be liable to be prosecuted under Section 377.\n\nFurther, a woman who could, at no point of time, have been\n\nprosecuted for rape would, despite her consent, be prosecuted\n\nfor indulging in anal or such other sexual intercourse with a\n\nman in private under Section 377. This would render Section\n\n377, as applied to such consenting adults, as manifestly\n\narbitrary as it would be wholly excessive and disproportionate\n\nto prosecute such persons under Section 377 when the\n\nlegislature has amended one portion of the law in 2013, making\n\nit clear that consensual sex, as described in the amended\n\nprovision, between two consenting adults, one a man and one a\n\nwoman, would not be liable for prosecution. If, by having regard\n\nto what has been said above, Section 377 has to be read down\n\nas not applying to anal and such other sex by a male-female\n\ncouple, then the Section will continue to apply only to\n\nhomosexual sex. If this be the case, the Section will offend\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_531\">Article 14</a> as it will discriminate between heterosexual and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_431\">                                                                   93</span>\n\f        homosexual adults which is a distinction which has no rational\n\n        relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Section -\n\n        namely,       the    criminalization        of    all    carnal     sex      between\n\n        homosexual and/or heterosexual adults as being against the\n\n        order of nature.8 Viewed either way, the Section falls foul of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_532\">Article 14.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_495\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_432\">95.     The fact that only a minuscule fraction of the country’s\n\n        population constitutes lesbians and gays or transgenders, and\n\n        that in the last 150 years less than 200 persons have been\n\n        prosecuted for committing the offence under Section 377, is\n\n        neither here nor there. When it is found that privacy interests\n\n        come in and the State has no compelling reason to continue an\n\n        existing law which penalizes same-sex couples who cause no\n\n        harm to others, on an application of the recent judgments\n\n        delivered by this Court after <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_533\">Suresh Kumar Koushal</a> (supra), it\n\n        is clear that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_534\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_535\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_536\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_537\">21</a> have all been\n\n        transgressed without any legitimate state rationale to uphold\n\n        such provision.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_496\">8 An argument was made by the Petitioners that Section 377, being vague and unintelligible, should be\nstruck down on this ground as it is not clear as to what is meant by “against the order of nature”.

We may conclude by stating that persons who are\n\nhomosexual have a fundamental right to live with dignity, which,\n\nin the larger framework of the Preamble of India, will assure the\n\ncardinal constitutional value of fraternity that has been\n\ndiscussed in some of our judgments (See (<a href=\"/doc/920448/\" id=\"a_539\">1) Nandini Sundar v.\n\nState of Chhattisgarh</a>, (2011) 7 SCC 547 at paragraphs 16, 25\n\nand 52; and (<a href=\"/doc/80997184/\" id=\"a_540\">2) Subramaniam Swamy v.

The law deprived them of the simple right as human beings to live, love\n\nand partner as nature made them. The human instinct to love was caged by\n\nconstraining the physical manifestation of their sexuality. Gays and lesbians2\n\nwere made subordinate to the authority of a coercive state.

But Macaulay’s legacy - the offence under Section 377 of\n\nthe Penal Code - has continued to exist for nearly sixty eight years after we\n\ngave ourselves a liberal Constitution. Gays and lesbians, transgenders and\n\nbisexuals continue to be denied a truly equal citizenship seven decades after\n\nIndependence. The law has imposed upon them a morality which is an\n\nanachronism. Their entitlement should be as equal participants in a society\n\ngoverned by the morality of the Constitution.

The shadows of a receding past confront their quest for\n\nfulfillment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_506\">\n\n4      Section 377 exacts conformity backed by the fear of penal reprisal.\n\nThere is an unbridgeable divide between the moral values on which it is based\n\nand the values of the Constitution. What separates them is liberty and dignity.\n\nWe must, as a society, ask searching questions to the forms and symbols of\n\ninjustice. Unless we do that, we risk becoming the cause and not just the\n\ninheritors of an unjust society.

If there is only one answer to this question, as I believe\n\nthere is, the tragedy and anguish which Section 377 inflicts must be remedied.\n\n\n\n5     The Constitution brought about a transfer of political power. But it\n\nreflects above all, a vision of a society governed by justice. Individual liberty is\n\nits soul. The constitutional vision of justice accommodates differences of\n\nculture, ideology and orientation. The stability of its foundation lies in its effort\n\nto protect diversity in all its facets: in the beliefs, ideas and ways of living of\n\nher citizens. Democratic as it is, our Constitution does not demand conformity.\n\nNor does it contemplate the mainstreaming of culture. It nurtures dissent as\n\nthe safety valve for societal conflict. Our ability to recognise others who are\n\ndifferent is a sign of our own evolution. We miss the symbols of a\n\ncompassionate and humane society only at our peril.\n\n\n\nSection 377 provides for rule by the law instead of the rule of law. The rule of\n\nlaw requires a just law which facilitates equality, liberty and dignity in all its\n\nfacets. Rule by the law provides legitimacy to arbitrary state behaviour.\n\n\n\n6     Section 377 has consigned a group of citizens to the margins. It has\n\nbeen destructive of their identities. By imposing the sanctions of the law on\n\nconsenting adults involved in a sexual relationship, it has lent the authority of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_445\">                                          7</span>\n\f                                                                             PART B\n\n\nthe state to perpetuate social stereotypes and encourage discrimination.\n\nGays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders have been relegated to the\n\nanguish of closeted identities. Sexual orientation has become a target for\n\nexploitation, if not blackmail, in a networked and digital age. The impact of\n\nSection 377 has travelled far beyond the punishment of an offence. It has\n\nbeen destructive of an identity which is crucial to a dignified existence.\n\n\n\n7     It is difficult to right the wrongs of history. But we can certainly set the\n\ncourse for the future. That we can do by saying, as I propose to say in this\n\ncase, that lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders have a constitutional\n\nright to equal citizenship in all its manifestations. Sexual orientation is\n\nrecognised and protected by the Constitution. Section 377 of the Penal Code\n\nis unconstitutional in so far as it penalises a consensual relationship between\n\nadults of the same gender.

In dealing with the validity of the provision, it is necessary to\n\nunderstand the nature of the constitutional right which LGBT individuals claim.\n\n4(2010)   Cri LJ 94\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_450\">                                         10</span>\n\f                                                                           PART B\n\n\nAccording to them, the right to be in a relationship with a consenting adult of\n\nthe same gender emanates from the right to life, as a protected value under\n\nthe Constitution. They ground their right on the basis of an identity resting in\n\ntheir sexual orientation. According to them, their liberty and dignity require\n\nboth an acknowledgement as well as a protection under the law, of their\n\nsexual orientation. Representing their identity, based on sexual orientation, to\n\nthe world at large and asserting it in their relationship with the community and\n\nthe state is stated to be intrinsic to the free exercise of speech and expression\n\nguaranteed by the Constitution. Sexual orientation is claimed to be intrinsic to\n\nthe guarantee against discrimination on the ground of sex. The statutory\n\nprovision, it has been asserted, also violates the fundamental guarantee\n\nagainst arbitrariness because it unequally targets gay men whose sexual\n\nexpression falls in the area prohibited by Section 377.\n\n\n\n\n13    In answering the dispute in regard to the validity of Section 377, the\n\ncourt must of necessity understand and explain in a constitutional perspective,\n\nthe nature of the right which is claimed. The challenge to Section 377 has to\n\nbe understood from the perspective of a rights discourse. While doing so, it\n\nbecomes necessary to understand the constitutional source from which the\n\nclaim emerges. When a right is claimed to be constitutionally protected, it is\n\nbut necessary for the court to analyze the basis of that assertion. Hence, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_451\">                                       11</span>\n\f                                                                            PART C\n\n\nanswering the reference, it is crucial for the court to place the entitlement of\n\nthe LGBT population in a constitutional framework. We have approached the\n\nmatter thus far from the perspective of constitutional analysis. But there is a\n\nmore simple line of reasoning as well, grounded as we believe, in common-\n\nsense. Sexual acts between consenting adults of the same gender constitute\n\none facet – albeit an important aspect – of the right asserted by gay men to\n\nlead fulfilling lives. Gay and lesbian relationships are sustained and nurtured\n\nin every aspect which makes for a meaningful life. In understanding the true\n\nnature of those relationships and the protection which the Constitution affords\n\nto them, it is necessary to adopt a perspective which leads to their acceptance\n\nas equal members of a humane and compassionate society. Forming a\n\nholistic perspective requires the court to dwell on, but not confine itself, to\n\nsexuality. Sexual orientation creates an identity on which there is a\n\nconstitutional claim to the entitlement of a dignified life. It is from that broad\n\nperspective that the constitutional right needs to be adjudicated.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">C     From “The Ashes of the Gay”\n\n                                         “Democracy\n                          It&#x27;s coming through a hole in the air,\n                                               …\n                                  It&#x27;s coming from the feel\n                                 that this ain&#x27;t exactly real,\n                           or it&#x27;s real, but it ain&#x27;t exactly there.\n                             From the wars against disorder,\n                              from the sirens night and day,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_452\">                                             12</span>\n\f                                                                                                              PART C\n\n\n                                         from the fires of the homeless,\n                                            from the ashes of the gay:\n                                             Democracy is coming…”5\n\n\n\n14       <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_544\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_545\">IPC</a>”) has made ‘carnal\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_511\">intercourse against the order of nature’ an offence.

When Lot offered them his two virgin daughters instead, the\n\nmen of Sodom responded by threatening Lot. The angels then blinded the\n\n“Sodomites.”15 The use of the term “sodomites” to describe those who\n\nengaged in anal intercourse emerged in the 13th Century, and the term\n\n“sodomy” was used as a euphemism for a number of sexual ‘sins’ two\n\ncenturies earlier.16\n\n\n\n16        The preservation of the Judeo-Christian condemnation of homosexuality\n\nis also attributed to the Jewish theologian, Philo of Alexandria, who is\n\nregarded as the father of the Church Fathers and who reviled homosexuals\n\nand called for their execution.17 The condemnation of homosexuality can also\n\nbe traced to Roman law.

In order to avoid a prison sentence,\n\nTuring was forced to agree to chemical castration. He was injected with\n\nsynthetic female hormones. Less than two years after he began the hormone\n\ntreatment, Turing committed suicide. The Amendment Act (also known as the\n\nLabouchere Amendment) remained in English law until 1967. Turing was\n\nposthumously pardoned in 2013, and in 2017, the UK introduced the Policing\n\nand Crime Bill, also called the “Turing Law,” posthumously pardoning 50,000\n\nhomosexual men and providing pardons for the living.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of several court cases in which homosexuality had been featured,\n\nthe British Parliament in 1954 set up the Wolfenden Committee, headed by\n\n\n27   H.

Macaulay abhorred the\n\nidea of any debate or discussion on this ‘heinous crime’.

Section 377 reveals only the hatred, revulsion and disgust of the\n\ndraftsmen towards certain intimate choices of fellow human beings. The\n\ncriminalization of acts in Section 377 is not based on a legally valid distinction,\n\n“but on broad moral proclamations that certain kinds of people, singled out by\n\ntheir private choices, are less than citizens – or less than human.”74\n\n\n\n31        The Naz judgement has been criticised on the ground that even though\n\nit removed private acts between consenting adults from the purview of Section\n\n377, it still retained the section along with its problematic terminology\n\nregarding the ‘order of nature’:75\n\n                   “…even though the acts would not be criminal, they would still\n                   be categorized as “unnatural” in the law. This is not an idle\n                   terminological issue. As Durkheim noted over a hundred\n                   years ago, the law also works as a tool that expresses social\n                   relations.76 Hence, this expression itself is problematic from a\n                   dignitarian standpoint, otherwise so eloquently referred to by\n                   the judgement.”\n\nAt this point, we look at some of the legislative changes that have taken place\n\nin India’s criminal law since the enactment of the Penal Code. <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_576\">The Criminal\n\nLaw (Amendment) Act</a> 2013 imported certain understandings of the concept of\n\nsexual intercourse into its expansive definition of rape in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_577\">Section 375</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, which now goes beyond penile–vaginal penetrative\n\n\n\n74   Supra note 25.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_578\">75   John Sebastian, “The opposite of unnatural intercourse: understanding Section 377 through Section 375, Indian\n     Law Review, Vol. 1 (2018).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_579\">76   Emile Durkheim, The Division of Labour in Society, Macmillan (1984).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_485\">                                                        39</span>\n\f                                                                                                                PART D\n\n\nintercourse.77 It has been argued that if ‘sexual intercourse’ now includes\n\nmany acts which were covered under Section 377, those acts are clearly not\n\n‘against the order of nature’ anymore. They are, in fact, part of the changed\n\nmeaning of sexual intercourse itself. This means that much of Section 377 has\n\nnot only been rendered redundant but that the very word ‘unnatural’ cannot\n\nhave the meaning that was attributed to it before the 2013 amendment.78\n\nSection 375 defines the expression rape in an expansive sense, to include\n\nany one of several acts committed by a man in relation to a woman. The\n\noffence of rape is established if those acts are committed against her will or\n\nwithout the free consent of the woman. Section 375 is a clear indicator that in\n\na heterosexual context, certain physical acts between a man and woman are\n\nexcluded from the operation of penal law if they are consenting adults.

The order of nature that Section 377 speaks of is not just about non-\n\nprocreative sex but is about forms of intimacy which the social order finds\n\n“disturbing”.80 This includes various forms of transgression such as inter-caste\n\nand inter-community relationships which are sought to be curbed by society.\n\nWhat links LGBT individuals to couples who love across caste and community\n\nlines is the fact that both are exercising their right to love at enormous\n\npersonal risk and in the process disrupting existing lines of social authority.81\n\nThus, a re-imagination of the order of nature as being not only about the\n\nprohibition of non-procreative sex but instead about the limits imposed by\n\nstructures such as gender, caste, class, religion and community makes the\n\nright to love not just a separate battle for LGBT individuals, but a battle for\n\nall.82\n\n\n\n\nE         Beyond physicality: sex, identity and stereotypes\n\n                   “Only in the most technical sense is this a case about who\n                   may penetrate whom where.

Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy.\n                   Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual\n                   orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of\n                   the individual.

The closet does not\n                 simply hide this susceptibility; it hides stigma and oppression\n                 itself. It marks the silencing of different voices, a silence\n                 which is achieved by a gross violation of lives that inhabit the\n                 closet, through both violence and pain inflicted by significant\n                 others both within and without the closet and instances of\n                 self-inflicted pain and violence.

The notion of ‘unnatural acts’, viewed in myopic terms of a “fixed\n\nprocreational model of sexual functioning”, is improperly applied to sexual\n\nrelations between consenting adults.131 Sexual activity between adults and\n\nbased on consent must be viewed as a “natural expression” of human sexual\n\ncompetences and sensitivities.132 The refusal to accept these acts amounts to\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_633\">129 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Epistemology of the Closet, University of California Press (1990).\n130 Supra note 65, at page 102.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_634\">131 David A.

In\n                    that zone of privacy, an individual is not judged by others.\n                    Privacy enables each individual to take crucial decisions\n                    which find expression in the human personality. It enables\n                    individuals to preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions,\n                    ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices against societal\n                    demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition of\n                    heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be different and\n                    to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a zone of\n                    solitude.

The realisation of the human\n\npersonality is dependent on the autonomy of an individual. In a liberal\n\ndemocracy, recognition of the individual as an autonomous person is an\n\nacknowledgment of the State’s respect for the capacity of the individual to\n\nmake independent choices. The right to privacy may be construed to signify\n\nthat not only are certain acts no longer immoral, but that there also exists an\n\naffirmative moral right to do them.149 As noted by Richards, this moral right\n\nemerges from the autonomy to which the individual is entitled:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">                “Autonomy, in the sense fundamental to the theory of human\n                rights, is an empirical assumption that persons as such have\n                a range of capacities that enables them to develop, and act\n                upon plans of action that take as their object one&#x27;s life and the\n                way it is lived. The consequence of these capacities of\n                autonomy is that humans can make independent decisions\n                regarding what their life shall be, self-critically reflecting, as a\n                separate being, which of one&#x27;s first-order desires will be\n                developed and which disowned, which capacities cultivated\n                and which left barren, with whom one will or will not identify,\n                or what one will define and pursue as needs and aspirations.\n                In brief, autonomy gives to persons the capacity to call their\n                life their own. The development of these capacities for\n                separation and individuation is, from birth, the central\n                developmental task of becoming a person.”150\n\n148 Ibid at para 22.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">149 Supra note 131, at pages 1000-1001.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">150 Supra note 131, at pages 964-965; M.

Rawls’\n\nconception of the ‘Original Position’ serves as a constructive model to\n\nillustrate the notion of choice behind a “partial veil of ignorance.”154 Persons\n\nbehind the veil are assumed to be rational and mutually disinterested\n\nindividuals, unaware of their positions in society.155 The strategy employed by\n\nRawls is to focus on a category of goods which an individual would desire\n\nirrespective of what individuals’ conception of ‘good’ might be.156 These\n\nneutrally desirable goods are described by Rawls as ‘primary social goods’\n\nand may be listed as rights, liberties, powers, opportunities, income, wealth,\n\nand the constituents of self-respect.157 Rawls&#x27;s conception of self-respect, as\n\na primary human good, is intimately connected to the idea of autonomy.158\n\nSelf-respect is founded on an individual&#x27;s ability to exercise her native\n\ncapacities in a competent manner.159\n\n\n\n66      An       individual’s        sexuality         cannot        be       put      into      boxes          or\n\ncompartmentalized; it should rather be viewed as fluid, granting the individual\n\nthe freedom to ascertain her own desires and proclivities.

Accepting the\n\nrole of human sexuality as an independent force in the development of\n\npersonhood is an acknowledgement of the crucial role of sexual autonomy in\n\nthe idea of a free individual.160 Such an interpretation of autonomy has\n\nimplications for the widening application of human rights to sexuality.161\n\nSexuality cannot be construed as something that the State has the\n\nprerogative to legitimize only in the form of rigid, marital procreational sex.162\n\nSexuality must be construed as a fundamental experience through which\n\nindividuals define the meaning of their lives.163 Human sexuality cannot be\n\nreduced to a binary formulation. Nor can it be defined narrowly in terms of its\n\nfunction as a means to procreation. To confine it to closed categories would\n\nresult in denuding human liberty of its full content as a constitutional right. The\n\nConstitution protects the fluidities of sexual experience. It leaves it to\n\nconsenting adults to find fulfilment in their relationships, in a diversity of\n\ncultures, among plural ways of life and in infinite shades of love and longing.\n\n\n\nF.2     A right to intimacy- celebration of sexual agency\n\n\n67      By criminalising consensual acts between individuals who wish to\n\nexercise their constitutionally-protected right to sexual orientation, the State is\n160 Supra note 131, at page 1003.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_659\">161 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_660\">162 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_661\">163 Ibid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_662\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_538\">                                        82</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART F\n\n\ndenying its citizens the right to intimacy.

At the hospital, the\n\nstaff learned about T’s sexual orientation, and pejoratively discussed it in his\n\npresence. He also had to endure “a local prayer group that visited the ward\n\ndaily to provide spiritual support to patients” which “prayed at his bedside to\n\nrectify his “devious” sexuality. When he requested that they leave, or that he\n\nbe transferred to another ward, the nurses did not intervene, and the prayer\n\ngroup visited regularly to continue to recite their homophobic prayers.

Both\n\nParliament and the State Legislatures can enact laws providing for offences\n\narising out of legislation falling within their legislative domains. The authority\n\nto enact law, however, is subject to the validity of the law being scrutinised on\n\nthe touchstone of constitutional safeguards. A citizen, or, as in the present\n\ncase, a community of citizens, having addressed a challenge to the validity of\n\na law which creates an offence, the authority to determine that question is\n\nentrusted to the judicial branch in the exercise of the power of judicial review.\n\nThe Court will not, as it does not, in the exercise of judicial review, second\n\nguess a value judgment made by the legislature on the need for or the\n\nefficacy of legislation. But where a law creating an offence is found to be\n\noffensive to fundamental rights, such a law is not immune to challenge. The\n\nconstitutional authority which is entrusted to the legislatures to create offences\n\nis subject to the mandate of a written Constitution. Where the validity of the\n\nlaw is called into question, judicial review will extend to scrutinising whether\n\nthe law is manifestly arbitrary in its encroachment on fundamental liberties. If\n\na law discriminates against a group or a community of citizens by denying\n\nthem full and equal participation as citizens, in the rights and liberties granted\n\nby the Constitution, it would be for the Court to adjudicate upon validity of\n\nsuch a law.</p><pre id=\"pre_9\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_580\">                                       112</span>\n\f                                                                                                             PART I\n\n\nI          India’s commitments at International Law\n\n\n\n98         International human rights treaties and jurisprudence impose obligations\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_729\">upon States to protect all individuals from violations of their human rights,\n\nincluding on the basis of their sexual orientation.229 Nevertheless, laws\n\ncriminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults remain on the\n\nstatute books in more than seventy countries.

Bentham was one of the earliest supporters for reform in\n\nsodomy laws.

On the first principle of primary mischief, Bentham said:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_468\">             “As to any primary mischief, it is evident that it produces no\n             pain in anyone. On the contrary it produces pleasure, and that\n             a pleasure which, by their perverted taste, is by this\n             supposition preferred to that pleasure which is in general\n             reputed the greatest. The partners are both willing. If either of\n             them be unwilling, the act is not that which we have here in\n             view: it is an offence totally different in its nature of effects: it\n             is a personal injury; it is a kind of rape.” 318\n\n\n\n\n314 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_469\">315 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_470\">316 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_471\">317 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_472\">318 Ibid.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_631\">                                                 151</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_810\">\f                                                                                PART K\n\n\nThus, Bentham argued that consensual homosexual acts do not harm anyone\n\nelse. Instead, they are a source of pleasure to adults who choose to engage in\n\nthem. Bentham was clear about the distinction between ‘willing’ partners and\n\n‘unwilling’ partners, and the latter according to him, would not fall under his\n\ndefence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_811\">\n\nBentham’s second argument was that there was no secondary mischief,\n\nwhich he described as something which may “produce any alarm in the\n\ncommunity.” On this, Bentham argued:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_473\">              “As to any secondary mischief, it produces not any pain of\n              apprehension. For what is there in it for any body to be afraid\n              of? By the supposition, those only are the objects of it who\n              choose to be so, who find a pleasure, for so it seems they do,\n              in being so.”319\n\n\n\nBentham’s explanation was that only those adults who choose will be the\n\nobjects of homosexual sexual acts. It does not involve any activity which will\n\ncreate anxiety among the rest of the society. Therefore, homosexuality does\n\nnot cause secondary harm either.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_474\">Lastly, Bentham tested sodomy laws on whether they cause danger to\n\nsociety.

However,\n\nBentham argues that since homosexual activities in themselves do not cause\n\nany harm, there is no danger even if they have a domino effect on other\n\nindividuals:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_475\">               “As to any danger exclusive of pain, the danger, if any, must\n               consist in the tendency of the example. But what is the\n               tendency of this example? To dispose others to engage in the\n               same practises: but this practise for anything that has yet\n               appeared produces not pain of any kind to anyone.” 320\n\n\n\n\nThus, according to Bentham, sodomy laws fail on all three grounds- they\n\nneither cause primary mischief, nor secondary mischief, nor any danger to\n\nsociety.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_476\">Bentham also critiqued criminal laws by analysing the utility of the punishment\n\nprescribed by them. He succinctly described the objective of law through the\n\nprinciples of utility- “The general object which all laws have, or ought to\n\nhave…is to augment the total happiness of the community; [and] to\n\nexclude…everything that tends to subtract from that happiness.”321 According\n\nto Bentham, “all punishment in itself is evil”322 because it reduces the level of\n\nhappiness in society, and should be prescribed only if it “excludes some\n\n\n\n320 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_477\">321 Ibid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_478\">322 Ibid.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_633\">                                               153</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_813\">\f                                                                                                      PART K\n\n\ngreater evil.”323 Bentham stipulated four kinds of situations where it is not\n\nutilitarian to inflict punishment:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_479\">                “1.

Therefore, society is justified in taking steps to\n\npreserve its morality as much as it preserves the government.347 Devlin\n\nproposed that the common morality or “collective judgment of the society”\n\nshould be ascertained taking into consideration the “reasonable man.”348\n\nAccording to him, a reasonable man is an ordinary man whose judgment “may\n\nlargely be a matter of feeling.”349                 He added that if the reasonable man\n\nbelieved a practice to be immoral, and held this belief honestly and\n\ndispassionately, then for the purpose of law such practice should be\n\nconsidered immoral.350\n\n\n\n\n344 Sir Patrick Arthur Devlin, “The Enforcement Of Morals” Oxford University Press (1959) at page 9.\n345 Supra note 334, at page 662.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_833\">346 Animesh Sharma, “Section 377: No Jurisprudential Basis.” Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 43 (2008) at\n\n    pages 12-14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_834\">347 Supra note 344.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_835\">348 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_836\">349 Ibid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_837\">350 Ibid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_838\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_639\">                                                    159</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART K\n\n\n134 Countering Devlin’s theory, Hart argued that society is not held together\n\nby a common morality, for, after all, it is not a hive mind or a monolith,\n\ngoverned by a singular set of morals and principles.351 Hart rebutted Devlin’s\n\nargument in the following way:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_492\">                    “…apart from one vague reference to ‘history’ showing the\n                    ‘the loosening of moral bonds is often the first stage of\n                    disintegration,’ no evidence is produced to show that\n                    deviation from accepted sexual morality, even by adults in\n                    private is something which, like treason, threatens the\n                    existence of society. No reputable historian has maintained\n                    this thesis, and there is indeed much evidence against\n                    it…Lord Devlin’s belief in it [that homosexuality is a cause of\n                    societal disintegration], and his apparent indifference to the\n                    question of evidence, are at points traceable to an\n                    undiscussed assumption. This is that all morality – sexual\n                    morality together with the morality that forbids acts injurious to\n                    others such as killing, stealing, and dishonesty -- forms a\n                    single seamless web, so that those who deviate from any part\n                    are likely to perhaps bound to deviate from the whole. It is of\n                    course clear (and one of the oldest insights of political theory)\n                    that society could not exist without a morality which mirrored\n                    and supplemented the law’s proscription of conduct injurious\n                    to others. But there is again no evidence to support, and\n                    much to refute, the theory that those who deviate from\n                    conventional sexual morality are in other ways hostile to\n                    society.”352\n\n\n\nDespite countering Devlin, Hart was not completely opposed to a relationship\n\nbetween law and morality, and in fact, he emphasised that the two are closely\n\nrelated:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_493\">351   Supra note 346, at pages 12-14.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_494\">352   Hart, H.

The\n\nconduct which Section 377 criminalises voluntary ‘carnal intercourse against\n\nthe order of nature’ with a man or woman, inter alia – pertains solely to acts\n\nbetween consenting adults. Such conduct is purely private, or as Mill would\n\ncall it, “self-regarding,” and is neither capable of causing injury to someone\n\nelse nor does it pose a threat to the stability and security of society. Once the\n\nfactor of consent is established, the question of such conduct causing any\n\ninjury, does not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_850\">\n\nAlthough Section 377 prima facie appears to criminalise certain acts or\n\nconduct, it creates a class of criminals, consisting of individuals who engage\n\nin consensual sexual activity. It typecasts LGBTQ individuals as sex-\n\noffenders, categorising their consensual conduct on par with sexual offences\n\nlike rape and child molestation. Section 377 not only criminalises acts\n\n(consensual sexual conduct between adults) which should not constitute\n\ncrime, but also stigmatises and condemns LGBTQ individuals in society.\n\n\n\n137 We are aware of the perils of allowing morality to dictate the terms of\n\ncriminal law. If a single, homogenous morality is carved out for a society, it will\n\nundoubtedly have the effect of hegemonizing or ‘othering’ the morality of\n\nminorities.

Constitutions are scripts in which people\n\ninscribe the text of their professed collective destiny. They write down who\n\nthey think they are, what they want to be, and the principles that will guide\n\ntheir interacting along that path in the future.368 The Constitution of India was\n\nburdened with the challenge of “drawing a curtain on the past”369 of social\n\ninequality and prejudices. Those who led India to freedom established into the\n\nConstitution the ideals and vision of a vibrant equitable society. The framing of\n\nIndia’s Constitution was a medium of liberating the society by initiating the\n\nprocess of establishing and promoting the shared values of liberty, equality\n\n\n367 Jawaharlal Nehru, “Tryst with Destiny”, address to the Constituent Assembly of India, delivered on 14-15 August\n    1947.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_852\">368 Uday S.

It was an attempt\n\nto reverse the socializing of prejudice, discrimination, and power hegemony in\n\na disjointed society. All citizens were to be free from coercion or restriction by\n\nthe state, or by society privately.370 Liberty was no longer to remain the\n\nprivilege of the few.

The draftspersons were clear that the imbibing of new\n\nconstitutional values by the population at large would take some time. Society\n\nwas not going to change overnight. Dr Ambedkar remarked in the Constituent\n\nAssembly:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_506\">            “Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil,\n            which is essentially undemocratic.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_856\">141 The values of a democracy require years of practice, effort, and\n\nexperience to make the society work with those values. Similar is the position\n\nof   non-discrimination,     equality,    fraternity    and     secularism.   While     the\n\nConstitution guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the\n\nlaw, it was felt that the realization of the constitutional vision requires the\n\nexistence of a commitment to that vision. Dr Ambedkar described this\n\ncommitment to be the presence of constitutional morality among the members\n\nof the society. The conception of constitutional morality is different from that of\n\npublic or societal morality.

The\n\ncontinuance of certain symbols, labels, names or body shapes determine the\n\nnotions, sentiments and mental attitudes of the people towards individuals and\n\nthings.372 Constitutional morality determines the mental attitude towards\n\nindividuals and issues by the text and spirit of the Constitution. It requires that\n\nthe rights of an individual ought not to be prejudiced by popular notions of\n\nsociety. It assumes that citizens would respect the vision of the framers of the\n\nConstitution and would conduct themselves in a way which furthers that\n\nvision. Constitutional morality reflects that the ideal of justice is an overriding\n\nfactor in the struggle for existence over any other notion of social acceptance.\n\nIt builds and protects the foundations of a democracy, without which any\n\nnation will crack under its fissures. For this reason, constitutional morality has\n\nto be imbibed by the citizens consistently and continuously.

In his famous, yet undelivered speech titled “Annihilation of\n\nCaste” (which has been later published as a book), Dr Ambedkar described\n\n‘fraternity’ as “primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated\n\nexperience” and “essentially an attitude of respect and reverence towards\n\nfellow men.”374 He remarked:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_509\">                    “An ideal society should be mobile, should be full of channels\n                    for conveying a change taking place in one part to other parts.\n                    In an ideal society there should be many interests consciously\n                    communicated and shared. There should be varied and free\n                    points of contact with other modes of association. In other\n                    words there must be social endosmosis.

Constitutional morality is\n\nthus the guiding spirit to achieve the transformation which, above all, the\n\nConstitution seeks to achieve. This acknowledgement carries a necessary\n\nimplication: the process through which a society matures and imbibes\n\nconstitutional          morality      is   gradual,            perhaps    interminably    so.   Hence,\n\nconstitutional courts are entrusted with the duty to act as external facilitators\n\nand to be a vigilant safeguard against excesses of state power and\n\ndemocratic           concentration         of   power.          This     Court,   being   the   highest\n\nconstitutional court, has the responsibility to monitor the preservation of\n\nconstitutional morality as an incident of fostering conditions for human dignity\n\nand liberty to flourish.

Constitutional morality requires this Court not to\n\nturn a blind eye to their right to an equal participation of citizenship and an\n\nequal enjoyment of living. Constitutional morality requires that this Court must\n\nact as a counter majoritarian institution which discharges the responsibility of\n\nprotecting constitutionally entrenched rights, regardless of what the majority\n\nmay believe.380 Constitutional morality must turn into a habit of citizens.

It denudes members of the LGBT communities of their\n\nconstitutional right to lead fulfilling lives. In its application to adults of the\n\nsame sex engaged in consensual sexual behaviour, it violates the\n\nconstitutional guarantee of the right to life and to the equal protection of law.\n\n\n\n148 Sexual orientation is integral to the identity of the members of the LGBT\n\ncommunities. It is intrinsic to their dignity, inseparable from their autonomy\n\nand at the heart of their privacy. Section 377 is founded on moral notions\n\nwhich are an anathema to a constitutional order in which liberty must trump\n\nover stereotypes and prevail over the mainstreaming of culture.                Our\n\nConstitution, above all, is an essay in the acceptance of diversity. It is founded\n\non a vision of an inclusive society which accommodates plural ways of life.\n\n\n\n149 The impact of Section 377 has travelled far beyond criminalising certain\n\nacts. The presence of the provision on the statute book has reinforced\n\nstereotypes about sexual orientation. It has lent the authority of the state to\n\nthe suppression of identities. The fear of persecution has led to the closeting\n\nof same sex relationships. A penal provision has reinforced societal disdain.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_658\">                                        177</span>\n\f                                                                         PART M\n\n\n150 Sexual and gender based minorities cannot live in fear, if the\n\nConstitution has to have meaning for them on even terms. In its quest for\n\nequality and the equal protection of the law, the Constitution guarantees to\n\nthem an equal citizenship. In de-criminalising such conduct, the values of the\n\nConstitution assure to the LGBT community the ability to lead a life of freedom\n\nfrom fear and to find fulfilment in intimate choices.\n\n\n\n151 The choice of a partner, the desire for personal intimacy and the\n\nyearning to find love and fulfilment in human relationships have a universal\n\nappeal, straddling age and time.       In protecting consensual intimacies, the\n\nConstitution adopts a simple principle: the state has no business to intrude\n\ninto these personal matters. Nor can societal notions of heteronormativity\n\nregulate constitutional liberties based on sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n152 This reference to the Constitution Bench is about the validity of Section\n\n377 in its application to consensual sexual conduct between adults of the\n\nsame sex. The constitutional principles which we have invoked to determine\n\nthe outcome address the origins of the rights claimed and the source of their\n\nprotection. In their range and content, those principles address issues broader\n\nthan the acts which the statute penalises. Resilient and universal as they are,\n\nthese constitutional values must enure with a mark of permanence.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_659\">                                        178</span>\n\f                                                                            PART M\n\n\n153 Above all, this case has had great deal to say on the dialogue about the\n\ntransformative power of the Constitution. In addressing LGBT rights, the\n\nConstitution speaks – as well – to the rest of society. In recognising the rights\n\nof the LGBT community, the Constitution asserts itself as a text for\n\ngovernance which promotes true equality. It does so by questioning prevailing\n\nnotions about the dominance of sexes and genders. In its transformational\n\nrole, the Constitution directs our attention to resolving the polarities of sex and\n\nbinarities of gender. In dealing with these issues we confront much that\n\npolarises our society. Our ability to survive as a free society will depend upon\n\nwhether constitutional values can prevail over the impulses of the time.\n\n\n\n154 A hundred and fifty eight years is too long a period for the LGBT\n\ncommunity to suffer the indignities of denial. That it has taken sixty eight years\n\neven after the advent of the Constitution is a sobering reminder of the\n\nunfinished task which lies ahead. It is also a time to invoke the transformative\n\npower of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_869\">\n\n155 The ability of a society to acknowledge the injustices which it has\n\nperpetuated is a mark of its evolution. In the process of remedying wrongs\n\nunder a regime of constitutional remedies, recrimination gives way to\n\nrestitution, diatribes pave the way for dialogue and healing replaces the hate\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_660\">                                        179</span>\n\f                                                                                PART M\n\n\nof a community. For those who have been oppressed, justice under a regime\n\ncommitted to human freedom, has the power to transform lives. In addressing\n\nthe causes of oppression and injustice, society transforms itself. The\n\nConstitution has within it the ability to produce a social catharsis. The\n\nimportance of this case lies in telling us that reverberations of how we address\n\nsocial conflict in our times will travel far beyond the narrow alleys in which\n\nthey are explored.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_870\">\n\n156 We hold and declare that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_515\">(i)     Section 377 of the Penal Code, in so far as it criminalises consensual\n\n        sexual conduct between adults of the same sex, is unconstitutional;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_516\">(ii)    Members of the LGBT community are entitled, as all other citizens, to\n\n        the full range of constitutional rights including the liberties protected by\n\n        the Constitution;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_517\">(iii)   The choice of whom to partner, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual\n\n        intimacies and the right not to be subjected to discriminatory behaviour\n\n        are intrinsic to the constitutional protection of sexual orientation;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_518\">(iv)    Members of the LGBT community are entitled to the benefit of an equal\n\n        citizenship, without discrimination, and to the equal protection of law;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_871\">        and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_661\">                                          180</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART M\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_872\">(v)   The decision in Koushal stands overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_873\">\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nBefore concluding, I acknowledge the efforts of counsel for the petitioners and\n\nintervenors who appeared in this case – Mr Mukul Rohatgi, Mr Arvind Datar,\n\nMr Ashok Desai, Mr Anand Grover, Mr Shyam Divan, Mr CU Singh and Mr\n\nKrishnan Venugopal, Senior Counsel; and Mr Saurabh Kirpal, Dr Menaka\n\nGuruswamy and Ms Arundhati Katju, and Ms Jayna Kothari, learned Counsel.\n\nTheir erudition has enabled us to absorb, as we reflected and wrote.

In 1957, the United Kingdom published the Wolfenden\n\n  Committee Report (supra) which recognised how the anti-\n\n  sodomy laws had created an atmosphere for blackmail,\n\n  harassment and violence against homosexuals. An extract of\n\n  the findings of this Committee reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_525\">     “We have found it hard to decide whether the\n     blackmailer’s primary weapon is the threat of disclosure\n     to the police, with attendant legal consequences, or the\n     threat of disclosure to the victim’s relatives, employers or\n     friends, with attendant social consequences. It may well\n     be that the latter is the more effective weapon, but it\n     may yet be true that it would lose much of its edge if the\n     social consequences were not associated with the\n     present legal position.”\n\n\n    Pursuant to this Report, the House of Lords initiated\n\n  legislation to de-criminalise homosexual acts done in private\n\n  by consenting parties. The Sexual Offences Act, 1967 came to\n\n  be passed in England which de-criminalised homosexual acts\n\n  done in private, provided the parties had consented to it, and\n\n  were above the age of 21.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_891\">10.

The expression ‘carnal intercourse’ used in Section 377\n\n              is distinct from ‘sexual intercourse’ which appears in\n\n              <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_717\">Sections 375</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_718\">497</a> of the IPC.

The Court\n\n              held that the act of carnal intercourse was clearly\n\n              against the order of nature, because the natural object of\n\n              carnal intercourse is that there should be the possibility\n\n              of conception of human beings, which in the case of\n\n              coitus per os is impossible.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_896\">                The Lahore High Court in Khandu v.

It provides for\n\n     penetrative acts which if performed by a man against a\n\n     woman without her consent, or by obtaining her consent\n\n     under duress, would amount to rape. Penetrative acts\n\n     (after the 2013 Amendment) include anal and oral sex.\n\n       The necessary implication which can be drawn from\n\n     the amended provision is that if such penetrative acts\n\n     are done with the consent of the woman they are not\n\n     punishable under Section 375.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_909\">       While Section 375 permits consensual penetrative acts\n\n     (the definition of ‘penetration’ includes oral and anal\n\n     sex), Section 377 makes the same acts of penetration\n\n     punishable irrespective of consent.
