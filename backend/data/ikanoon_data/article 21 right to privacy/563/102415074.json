But suddenly the FIR involved in the present case was leaked to the\n\n                public domain, revealing the details of victim and the incident. Further, the\n\n                Commissioner of Police, Chennai has also divulged the details of the\n\n                investigation through a press conference, which has become the subject\n\n                matter of debate. The investigation details ought not to have been disclosed in\n\n                the public, while the investigation is ongoing, as this could hamper and\n\n                obstruct the process. The leakage of FIR is a serious lapse in the investigation\n\n                process and cannot be taken lightly. This gives high chances to deviate and\n\n                destabilize the ongoing investigation. Hence, this Court is inclined to\n\n                interfere and entertain the present Public Interest Litigations to meet the ends\n\n                of justice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">                        2.

Further, he\n\n               took pictures of her college identity card and threatened her to oblige to his\n\n               sexual demands in future.

It is further reported that several such untoward incidents\n\n               occurred inside Anna University campus during earlier occasions. Some of\n\n               the incidents were known to the Professors, Students and Administrative staff\n\n               within the Anna University Campus, but no complaint was registered.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">                         6.

She has all rights that is guaranteed to her by\n\n               the Constitution. The Constitution does not distinguish between a man and a\n\n               woman.

Nobody in this free country has any right to dictate a woman as\n\n               to how she should live her life. It is always Her Life. Her Body.

That is the fundamental that must be taught to a Man.\n\n               Instead blaming and shaming the woman affected is a degradation of integral\n\n               standards in a progressive society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">                       12.

Rather than teaching the woman as to how to\n\n               behave, the society should learn its duty as to how to treat a woman with\n\n               respect and dignity.

In this\n                                  regard, we may make reference to some ways and\n                                  means where the identity is disclosed without\n                                  naming the victim. In one case, which made the\n                                  headlines recently, though the name of the victim\n                                  was not given, it was stated that she had topped the\n                                  State Board Examination and the name of the State\n                                  was given. It would not require rocket science to\n                                  find out and establish her identity. In another\n                                  instance, footage is shown on the electronic media\n                                  where the face of the victim is blurred but the faces\n                                  of her relatives, her neighbours, the name of the\n                                  village, etc. is clearly visible. This also amounts to\n                                  disclosing the identity of the victim. We, therefore,\n                                  hold that no person can print or publish the name of\n                                  the victim or disclose any facts which can lead to\n                                  the victim being identified and which should make\n                                  her identity known to the public at large.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">                                        13.

However, this should not be\n                                  made public and especially not to the media. We are\n                                  of the opinion that the police officers investigating\n                                  such cases and offences should also as far as\n                                  possible either use a pseudonym to describe the\n                                  victim unless it is absolutely necessary to write\n                                  down her identity.

Some examples of\n                                  matters where her identity will have to be disclosed\n                                  are when samples are taken from her body, when\n                                  medical examination is conducted, when DNA\n                                  profiling is done, when the date of birth of the\n                                  victim has to be established by getting records from\n                                  school, etc. However, in these cases also the police\n                                  officers should move with circumspection and\n                                  disclose as little of the identity of the victim as\n                                  possible but enough to link the victim with the\n                                  information sought.
