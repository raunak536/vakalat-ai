Shorn of unnecessary details, the petitioner union comprises\n                   residents of the Dhobi Ghat Jhuggi clusters. It is claimed by the\n                   petitioner union that the Jhuggi Jhopri 1 Basti at Dhobi Ghat, Batla\n                   House Jamia Nagar, Okhla, South Delhi, Delhi - 110025 2 has been in\n                   existence since 1990s and consists of 800 households. The residents,\n                   who are primarily daily wage labourers and domestic workers, claim\n                   to have documentary proof of residence predating 01.01.2015, as\n                   mandated under the DUSIB3 Policy, 2015 4\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                   3.        The grievance of the petitioner union is that on 23.09.2020, two\n                   police officials visited the Basti and directed the residents to vacate\n                   their respective dwellings on the ground that demolition was\n                   scheduled for the following day. The petitioner union alleges that no\n                   prior notice of eviction was served upon the residents. On 24.09.2020,\n                   at approximately 10:00 AM, two officials of the DDA, accompanied\n\n\n                   1 JJ\n                   2 Subject site\n                   3 Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                        W.P.

It\n                   is averred that during the process, household belongings, including\n                   furniture, utensils, jewellery, money, and documents, were loaded into\n                   MCD trucks without affording the residents an opportunity to retrieve\n                   them. The petitioner union further alleges that individuals who\n                   protested against the demolition were subjected to physical assault and\n                   unlawful detention at the police station. No formal notice of eviction\n                   was issued prior to the said demolition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">                   4.        The petitioner union contends that the Basti is listed at Serial\n                   No. 10 in the Additional JJ Clusters List published by DUSIB for\n                   rehabilitation, and thus, the respondents are obligated to adhere to the\n                   DUSIB Relocation Policy, 2015. As per the policy, any resident with\n                   proof of residence prior to 01.01.2015 is eligible for rehabilitation. It\n                   is further stated that in 2017, a fire of unknown origin destroyed\n                   several documents of the residents, which might have otherwise\n                   substantiated their claims of long-standing residence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">                   5.        It is stated that a family residing in the Basti, along with certain\n                   other residents, had filed W.P.

It cannot be disputed and in fact, has not been disputed that\n                             the present status of Yamuna is only of a sewer, due to lack of fresh\n                             water flow, discharge of untreated or partly treated domestic and\n                             industrial waste and due to dumping of debris on its banks and in\n                             it. Its flood plains are highly truncated and degraded, resulting in\n                             depletion in most of its natural bio-diversity. It has been submitted\n                             before the Tribunal that around 37000 cu. m. on the Eastern bank\n                             and around 53000 cu. m. on the Western bank is the quantum of\n                             debris which was lying on the banks River Yamuna. Of course,\n                             majority of this has already been removed under the directions of\n                             the Tribunal and steps have been taken to identify such sites. Still\n                             little part of debris, consisting of construction and other debris\n                             remains. Steps need to be taken not only to remove the remaining\n                             part of debris and clear the river banks absolutely, but also to\n                             prevent and ensure that there is no fresh dumping of debris in the\n                             entire stretch passing through the National Capital Region (for\n                             short, &#x27;NCR&#x27;).

Private persons, authorities, and\n                             even bodies like DMRC had contributed to encroachments and\n                             dumping, which was rampant.

As already noticed above, vide order dated 13th September,\n                             2013 passed by the Tribunal, the Expert Committee was required\n                             to examine and critically analyse the Yamuna River Front\n                             Development Plan of the DDA as well. This was done by the\n                             Committee. This Plan of DDA is an Integrated project of\n                             recreational areas along with, bio-diversity parks, in four of the\n                             subzones of the &#x27;O Zone&#x27;. The area proposed for the\n                             implementation of Yamuna River Front Development {YRFD}\n                             scheme by the DDA, is the active Flood Plain which is frequently\n                             flooded by medium floods. According to the Expert Committee, the\n                             proposed activities such as construction of various recreational\n                             and public facilities, by effecting topographic changes, will reduce\n                             the flood carrying capacity and aggravate flooding, besides\n                             contributing to pollution. Development of the flood plains has to be\n                             strictly done, while keeping the biodiversity intact and ensuring\n                             that no major and impermissible construction activity is permitted\n                             on the flood plain. Biodiversity parks could be made at suitable\n                             locations, for example, sub-zone IV and sub-zone. VI, as\n                             recommended by the Expert Committee in its report. The\n                             Committee has specifically noticed that the flood carrying capacity\n                             of the river has been considerably reduced due to encroachments\n                             and waste dumps resulting in flooding of its banks every year and\n                             this was also reported by NEERI in its report of 2005. The\n                             Committee has suggested that new wetland habitats should be\n                             created for biodiversity conservation, whenever feasible, and inter-\n                             connectedness between wetlands for water movement and\n                             exchange should be promoted. The Expert Committee, for the\n                             reasons stated in its Report, suggested that the YRFD plan of DDA\n                             is untenable and should be stopped. It has already been placed on\n                             record that the DDA itself admits in their proposed re-delineation\n                             of &#x27;O Zone&#x27;, in terms of the public notice issued by it on 28th\n                             September, 2013, that the &#x27;River Front&#x27; refers to an area that lies\n                             outside the embankments of a river, but the area of the proposed\n                             YRFD plan is within the active floodplain. Thus, it is recommended\n                             that this YRFD scheme should be replaced by another plan for\n                             restoration of the river and its floodplain, as suggested by the\n                             Expert Committee and accepted by the High Powered Committee.\n                             We direct that all the recommendations of the Expert Committee,\n                             including the above, should be implemented without any further\n                             delay.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                        W.P.

As a result, the living conditions at the Basti situated\n                   in Dhobi Ghat have deteriorated significantly, rendering the area\n                   unhygienic and uninhabitable.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">                        W.P.

Therefore, DUSIB\n                   asserts that it has no role in either the demolition or the rehabilitation\n                   of the petitioner union&#x27;s members.

Referring to Clause 2(a)(i) of the 2015\n                   Policy (Part A) it is urged that only those JJ Bastis established prior to\n                   01.01.2006 shall not be removed without providing alternate housing.\n                   Clause 2(a)(ii) further states that no jhuggis established after\n                   01.01.2015 shall be provided alternate housing. Additionally, it is\n                   urged that Clause 1 of Part B outlines 11 eligibility criteria for\n                   allotment of alternate housing for rehabilitation and the JJ Basti in\n                   question, located in Village Okhla, is on land acquired by the DDA,\n                   the details of which have been provided in the DDA&#x27;s counter-\n                   affidavit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"42397673\" id=\"span_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"20683\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"131330551\" id=\"span_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"63462236\" id=\"span_49\">30.

It is submitted that this Court has\n                   consistently clarified through numerous judgments, including\n                   decisions by coordinate benches, the Division Bench of this Court,\n                   and the Supreme Court, that only identified Bastis are entitled to\n                   protection, and that these identified Bastis cannot be removed or\n                   demolished without being provided alternate housing.

There is no\n                   clear averment as to the status of the petitioner union, in the sense that\n                   it is not clear as to whether it is a Society, Trust, Firm, or Corporation.\n                   No rules and regulation governing the affairs of the petitioner union\n                   have been placed on record.

The petitioner union is not a\n                   natural legal person and, therefore, has no right to file the present\n                   petition in a representative capacity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                   33.

In fact, regarding possession itself, there is a\n                   contradictory stand, inasmuch as it is admitted that, on multiple\n                   occasions, some of the members of the petitioner union have been\n                   evicted, yet they return, reoccupy, and continue to live on the subject\n                   site.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"194213271\" id=\"span_54\">34.

Anyhow, upon careful examination of the records, it is\n                   abundantly clear that the Basti located at Dhobi Ghat, Batla House,\n                   Jamia Nagar, Okhla, South Delhi, Delhi-110025, lies within the\n                   floodplain/riverbed of the River Yamuna. The DDA has unequivocally\n                   stated that the subject site was acquired through Award No. 51/81-82\n                   dated 09.02.1982 and Award No. 95/83-84 dated 24.02.1984,\n                   specifically for developing a Biodiversity Park under Phase II of its\n                   plan. Since 1982, the DDA has taken physical possession of the land,\n                   further solidifying its legal rights over the property. This acquisition\n                   and possession serve as irrefutable evidence of the DDA&#x27;s lawful\n                   control over the site, underscoring that any unauthorized occupation is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                   22</span>\n                        W.P.(C) 7032/2020 dated 25.09.2020 and LPA 276/2020 dated 07.10.2020\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                        W.P.

The DDA further\n                   refutes the petitioner union&#x27;s claim of inhabiting the site since 1990,\n                   asserting that satellite images of the subject site, with geo-coordinates\n                   of Latitude 28.569263° and Longitude 77.290282°, confirm that the\n                   site was a green belt, devoid of any structures, as recent as 2016 and\n                   2019.

In summary, there can be no iota of doubt that the petitioner\n                   union, being rank tress-passers and unlawfully occupying a portion of\n                   the subject site, is causing immense harm and pollution to the River\n                   Yamuna, as exemplified from the photographs placed on the record. It\n                   goes without saying that there is a plethora of case laws on the subject\n                   of encroachment, unauthorized occupation, and constructions on the\n                   River Yamuna floodplains, as well as the relocation of displaced\n                   persons, as adjudicated by this Court. In the case of Haq Through its\n                   Member Abdul Shakeel v.

It was held that by removing the\n                   encroachment, the DDA was merely complying with the directions of\n                   the Division Bench in W.P.(C) 211/2022 dated 03.03.2003.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                   Furthermore, the Court observed that, since there was permanent\n                   habitation on the land in question, the issue of rehabilitating those\n                   occupying the land did not arise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                   38.

The government had\n                   determined the lease, vesting the land in the DDA. When several\n                   petitioners, claiming to be in occupation of the land and making\n                   payments to the aforesaid two Societies, challenged their eviction, the\n                   Court dismissed the challenge.

The study said high level of lead in blood\n                                  was eight times more when exposed to the riverbank after\n                                  Wazirabad in north Delhi, compared to rural areas\n                                  upstream in Haryana, where river water contamination\n                                  was found to be less.

The\n                                  presence of heavy metals increased after Wazirabad even\n                                  though every drop of water that flows in the river .in Delhi\n                                  has to be cleaned through Sewage Treatment and Effluent\n                                  Treatment Plants.

The riverbed is so high and the river so\n                             shallow that it can no longer support any aquatic life. Because of\n                             the high riverbed, every monsoon sees an overflow of the river\n                             water, many a times causing floods. We have been informed that\n                             the river has been consistently becoming shallow and hence lacks\n                             the capacity to carry excess water during the monsoon or maintain\n                             life during the rest of the year. Hence, we see the Yamuna\n                             becoming a veritable putrid drain, especially during the summer\n                             months.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                             31.

Consequently, it must be a notified cluster\n                                       comprising of not less than 50 jhuggis. The aforesaid\n                                       cluster must additionally form part of the 675 clusters\n                                       which had been identified by the DUSIB. The recitals\n                                       and recordal of facts of the present case leads the Court\n                                       to the inescapable conclusion that the cluster in\n                                       question would not meet those requirements. In view\n                                       of the aforesaid, the reliefs as claimed cannot possibly\n                                       be granted. 12.

The Court\n                                       also bears in mind that the undisputed fact that the\n                                       Rehabilitation Policy which was placed in the shape of\n                                       a protocol in Ajay Maken was neither interfered with\n                                       nor any adverse observation in respect thereof\n                                       entered.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131330551\" id=\"span_86\">47.

In\n                                       the present case, the categorical stand of the\n                                       respondent nos. 1 and 2 is that such a determination\n                                       was made in the case of the appellants, and the cluster\n                                       of jhuggis at Sarojini Nagar was not found in existence\n                                       as on 01.01.2006, and therefore, not notified under the\n                                       Act.

The Court further notes that the decisions\n                                       noticed in Dinesh Singh have consistently held that the\n                                       question whether the cluster forms part of those which\n                                       were identified by DUSIB is determinative of whether\n                                       the residents thereof are entitled to extension of\n                                       benefits under the 2015 Policy.

That issue clearly\n                                       attained finality once the list of eligible clusters had\n                                       been duly identified by DUSIB. The prayers for the\n                                       Court to embark down that path would not only lead to\n                                       it being compelled to delve into disputed questions of\n                                       fact and a de novo assessment of evidence, it would\n                                       also unsettle a position which was statutorily conferred\n                                       finality.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                                       8.

The petitioner union has failed to\n                   demonstrate any legal right, title, or interest of its member in the\n                   subject site. At the cost of repetition, the subject site is not even\n                   capable of being inhabited. Moreover, the so-called members of the\n                   petitioner union, being rank tress-passers or unauthorized occupants,\n                   are not entitled to the benefit of any Rehabilitation Policy framed by\n                   the DUSIB. There arises no question of conducting any fresh survey,\n                   let alone awarding compensation to the so-called members of the\n                   petitioner union, who repeatedly return to the subject site and\n                   encroach upon the land after each eviction. The plea that the\n                   respondents have not followed due process of law in carrying out\n                   demolition action cannot be sustained in law. The floodplain area is a\n                   designated prohibited activity zone and serves as a vital element of the\n                   river ecosystem. Encroachment upon this area disrupts the natural\n                   flow of water, resulting in the diversion of watercourses and\n                   contributing to flooding in adjacent regions. In fact, numerous experts\n                   assert that recurring floods in Delhi are largely man-made, primarily\n                   driven by unlawful encroachment on drains and riverbeds, which\n                   obstruct the natural flow of water into and within the River Yamuna,\n                   exacerbating the severity of the floods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">                   43.
