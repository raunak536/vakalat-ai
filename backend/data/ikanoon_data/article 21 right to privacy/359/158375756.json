The results of\n\nthe elections were announced on 03.09.2018. The fourth\n\nrespondent secured the highest number of votes.          The\n\nappellant secured the second highest number of votes.

The appellant has filed the election petition\n\nimpugning the fourth respondent&#x27;s election asserting that\n\nthe appellant, after the announcement of the results, has\n\nobtained certified copies of the nomination, the declaration\n\n(the affidavit) and the enclosures filed by the fourth\n\nrespondent.    The appellant has also asserted that the\n\nfourth respondent in such declaration has inter alia\n\ndeclared that (i) her husband&#x27;s name as &#x27;Nanje Gowda&#x27;, (ii)\n\nneither she nor her two children are Income Tax Assessees\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  -7-</span>\n\n\n\nand they do not hold any PAN Card, and (iii) the fourth\n\nrespondent has further declared that neither she nor her\n\nhusband either own or possess any immovable property.\n\nHowever, the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband owns different\n\nimmovable      properties   in   Kyathamaranhalli      Village,\n\nHanchaya Village and Stahagahalli Village, Kasaba Hobli,\n\nMysore Taluk. The appellant has furnished the details of\n\nthe lands/site and the details of the motor vehicle that are\n\nallegedly owned by the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband as well\n\nthe name of the firm in which he is a partner.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">      5.     The appellant has contended that the fourth\n\nrespondent     in   furnishing   false   information   in   the\n\ndeclaratory affidavit filed along with the nomination form\n\nhas indulged in Corrupt Practice to claim reservation under\n\nBackward Class - B because if either the fourth respondent\n\nor her husband owned immovable properties, or a PAN\n\nCard, the fourth respondent would not be eligible to contest\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    -8-</span>\n\n\n\nthe elections to a seat reserved for backward Class-B\n\ncategory. The appellant, while seeking declaration that the\n\nelection of the fourth respondent as void on the aforesaid\n\nground, has also sought for declaration that she is the\n\nsuccessful candidate on the ground that she has secured\n\nthe second highest number of votes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">       6.   The fourth respondent, upon service of notice of\n\nthe   election   petition,   has    filed   objection   statement\n\ncontesting the petition.     The fourth respondent has not\n\ndenied the allegations that there is an error in Paragraph 8\n\nof the declaratory affidavit in mentioning her husband&#x27;s\n\nname and in declaring that neither she nor husband own\n\nimmovable properties. But, she has asserted that she did\n\nnot know that her husband owned immovable properties\n\nand therefore she has not mentioned the same in the\n\ndeclaration. The errors in mentioning the husband&#x27;s name\n\nand the failure to furnish details of the immovable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                    -9-</span>\n\n\n\nproperties    owned     by   the    husband   are   bona   fide\n\nunintentional errors.    As regards the contention that the\n\nfourth respondent could not have contested the elections\n\nreserved for Backward Class - B, the fourth respondent has\n\nasserted that the necessary criteria to claim reservation\n\nunder such category is the caste and income of the person.\n\nShe has filed necessary Certificate/s issued by the\n\ncompetent authority as regards her Caste and Income. The\n\nappellant has not disputed the same.          As such, she is\n\nentitled to contest the seat reserved for Backward Class - B.\n\nTherefore, the nomination has rightly been accepted, and\n\nbecause she has secured the highest number of votes, she\n\nhas rightly been declared as the successful candidate.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">      7.     The appellant has examined herself as PW 1.\n\nThe appellant in her affidavit in lieu of Examination-in-\n\nchief, has reiterated the assertions made in the petition,\n\nincluding the assertions as regards the errors by the fourth\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                                - 10 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">\n\nrespondent in the declaratory affidavit in mentioning her\n\nhusband&#x27;s name and in declaring that neither she nor her\n\nhusband owned any immovable property.          The appellant\n\nhas furnished the details of the properties owned by the\n\nfourth respondent&#x27;s husband. The certified copy of the\n\nprescribed Form No. 24/25 is marked as Exhibit P1, a\n\ncertified copy of the fourth respondent&#x27;s nomination papers\n\nwith the declaration and the annexures thereto are marked\n\nas Exhibit P2.   The RTCs, Sale Deeds and Encumbrance\n\nCertificates for the properties in the name of the fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband as well as the Registration Form for\n\nthe firm, M/s SBM developers, are marked as Exhibits P3 -\n\nP9. The appellant, apart from stating that the fourth\n\nrespondent is guilty of Corrupt Practice because she has\n\nfiled declaration with false information, has also stated that\n\nthe fourth respondent could not have contested the election\n\nto a reserved seat as the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband\n\nowned immovable properties and was a PAN card holder.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                                - 11 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">      8.   In the cross-examination, the appellant has\n\ndenied the suggestions that the errors relied upon by her\n\nare bona fide and unintentional. The appellant, to the\n\nspecific query in the cross examination whether she knows\n\nthat the fourth respondent and her family members are\n\nIncome Tax Assessees and if they possess PAN cards, has\n\nstated that she does not have any personal knowledge\n\nabout the same. The appellant has denied the suggestion\n\nthat the fourth respondent because of her caste and income\n\nwas entitled to contest the seat for Backward Class - B\n\n(women).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">      9.   It would be relevant to mention at this point\n\nthat the appellant, after the completion of her evidence, has\n\nfiled an application under Order XVI Of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure</a> for issuance of summons to the Tahsildar,\n\nMysrur taluk, the Commissioner Of Income Tax, Mysuru\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                                 - 12 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n\nRegion and the Regional Transport Officer, Mysore East to\n\nproduce documents specified in such application and to\n\ngive evidence.   The trial Court by order dated 25.1.2019\n\nhas rejected such application holding that the documents\n\nspecified by the appellant are public documents and they\n\ncould be obtained under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">Right to\n\nInformation Act, 2005</a> (for short, &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a>&#x27;).          The\n\nappellant without first approaching these authorities for\n\ncopies of the documents under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a> cannot maintain\n\nthe said application. The trial Court has opined that it is for\n\nthe appellant to obtain all the relevant documents under\n\nthe provisions of RTI act and produce the same.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">       10. The fourth respondent, who has examined\n\nherself as DW-1, has reiterated in the evidence that the\n\nerrors pointed out by the appellant in the declaration filed\n\nby her along with her nomination papers are bona fide and\n\nunintentional errors.     She has stated that she is a\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">                                    - 13 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">\n\nVokkaliga by caste and her income is below the permissible\n\nlimits and as such, the competent authority has issued\n\nappropriate certificate for her. She is entitled to contest as\n\nBackward Class-B candidate.          She has also produced a\n\ncertified copy of her nomination papers and the enclosures\n\nthere to including the declaration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">      11. In the cross examination, the fourth respondent\n\nhas admitted that she had earlier contested Mysuru city\n\nCorporation elections. She has stated that her brother\n\nhelped her in filling up the nomination papers in filing the\n\ndeclaration. While she does not dispute that she has indeed\n\ndeclared    that   neither   she    nor     her    husband   owned\n\nimmovable properties, has refused to admit the records of\n\nthe properties standing in her husband&#x27;s name stating that\n\nshe does not know about such records. She has denied\n\nknowledge    of    her   husband     paying       any   income   tax.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">                                   - 14 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">\n\nHowever, she admits that her husband could be one of the\n\npartners of M/s SBM Developers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">     12. The trial Court has formulated the following\n\npoints for its consideration:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        i. Whether the appellant proves that the\n             fourth respondent was not eligible and did\n             not qualify to contest in the MCC elections\n             during August 2018 for Ward No. 36 -\n             Yeragenahalli, which is reserved for BC-B\n             (women) category;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">        ii. Whether the appellant proves that, the\n             fourth respondent by indulging in corrupt\n             practices,   influenced   the    voters   by\n             suppressing the material information in\n             the declaration;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">       iii. Whether the appellant further proves that,\n             the election of the returned candidate i.e.,\n             fourth respondent in the said elections\n             and the result declared on 03.09.2018 is\n             liable to be declared as void;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">                                     - 15 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n       iv. Whether the appellant proves that she is\n             entitled   to   be    declared    as    elected\n             candidate as she has secured the second\n             highest number of votes in the elections by\n             setting aside the election of the fourth\n             respondent; and\n\n        v. Whether the appellant is entitled for the\n             reliefs sought for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">     13. The trial Court has taken up all the points\n\ntogether for consideration. The trial Court has opined that\n\nthe fourth respondent&#x27;s failure to furnish the details of the\n\nproperties owned by her husband would not amount to\n\n&#x27;Corrupt practice&#x27;. The trial Court has given the following\n\nreasons for its conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">     Firstly, the State Government Notification dated\n\n16.10.1995     only     stipulates      a     candidate        or   his\n\nparents/guardians/spouse           cannot     be    an   Income     Tax\n\nassessee. The appellant&#x27;s assertion is that the fourth\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_38\">                                - 16 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband must be an Income-Tax assessee\n\nbecause he holds a PAN card. But mere possession of a\n\nPAN card does not necessarily mean that a person is an\n\nIncome-tax assessee. There is no evidence to establish that\n\nthe   fourth   respondent&#x27;s   husband   is   an   Income-tax\n\nassessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">      Secondly, the initial burden is on the appellant to\n\nestablish that the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband is an\n\nIncome Tax assesses, but the appellant has not discharged\n\nsuch burden. The appellant should have produced some\n\ndocuments to demonstrate that the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband is an Income Tax Assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">      Thirdly, the caste and income of a person would be\n\nmaterial in deciding whether a person could claim the\n\nbenefit of reservation for a certain category. The competent\n\nauthority has issued necessary Certificate and such\n\ncertificate would be issued only after necessary enquiry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                                - 17 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">\n\nThis certificate is not challenged in a manner known to law,\n\nand until the Certificate is so challenged and set aside, it\n\ncannot be concluded that the fourth respondent would be\n\nineligible to contest under Backward Class - B category.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">       Fourthly, the decision relied upon by the appellant is\n\nan authority on the proposition that only non-disclosure of\n\nsuch    information   as   would   be   required   under   the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_7\">section 33-A</a> of the Representatives of the\n\nPeople Act 1951 (for short, &#x27;the RP Act&#x27;) would tantamount\n\nto Corrupt Practice. The failure to furnish the details of the\n\nimmovable properties owned by the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband and the suppression of the fact that he possessed\n\na PAN card would not amount to corrupt practice as\n\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/197629908/\" id=\"a_8\">section 39</a> of the KMC Act. There is\n\nalso no evidence to conclude that the fourth respondent by\n\nsuppressing the fact that her husband owns immovable\n\nproperties has indulged in Corrupt Practice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">                                   - 18 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">       14. The first limb of the arguments advanced by\n\nMr.Manmohan P N, the learned counsel for the appellant, is\n\nthat vide the notification dated 16.10.1995 the State\n\nGovernment has stipulated that if either the candidate or\n\nthe candidate&#x27;s spouse is an Income Tax Assessee, such\n\ncandidate shall not be entitled to the benefit of reservation\n\nin elections to the seats and offices of a municipal\n\nCorporation.        The fourth respondent&#x27;s husband owned\n\ndifferent properties, and this fact is suppressed in the\n\ndeclaratory affidavit filed by the fourth respondent.     The\n\nfact   that   the    fourth   respondent&#x27;s   owned   immovable\n\nproperties and a motor vehicle, and was also a partner of\n\nfirm with a Pan Card, in the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, establish that the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband was\n\nan Income-tax Assessee. Therefore, the fourth respondent\n\ncould not have contested the election to a seat reserved for\n\nBackward Class - B category.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">                                  - 19 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">      15.      The   learned   counsel      for   the    appellant,\n\nstrenuously argues that the appellant is able to discharge\n\nthe initial burden of showing             that that the     fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband is an Income-tax assessee by placing\n\non record the indisputable fact that the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband is a PAN card holder and that the fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s    husband,   not    only     owns    properties   as\n\naforementioned but has also been repeatedly purchasing\n\nproperties.    These circumstances irrefutably demonstrate\n\nthe fourth respondent&#x27;s financial prowess and also that he\n\nis an Income-tax assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">      16. The learned counsel for the appellant, submits\n\nthat in the circumstances relied upon by the appellant, it\n\nmust be reasonably concluded that the appellant has\n\ndischarged the initial burden of establishing the fact that\n\nthe   fourth   respondent&#x27;s    husband       in   an    Income-tax\n\nAssessee. But the trial Court has erred in ignoring these\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">                                     - 20 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">\n\ncircumstances and in concluding that the appellant has not\n\ndischarged the initial burden.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">        17. Further, the learned counsel relying upon a\n\ndecision     of   the    Division   Bench    of   this    Court    in\n\nM/s.Srinivasa Traders and others v. CTO2 submits that\n\nwith the appellant discharging the initial burden, the\n\nevidentiary burden was on the fourth respondent to\n\nestablish that her husband is not an Income-tax Assessee.\n\nBut, the fourth respondent except for pleading bonafide in\n\nnot furnishing the details, which in any event is totally\n\nmisdirecting has not placed any material to discharge this\n\nevidentiary burden. The trial Court has grossly erred in not\n\nassessing the evidence on record from the perspective of\n\ndischarge of the initial burden and the liability to discharge\n\nthe     consequential     evidentiary   burden    by     the   fourth\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">2</span>\n    ILR Karnataka 1179\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">                               - 21 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">     18. The learned counsel for the appellant also\n\nsubmits   that   the   appellant   is   relying   upon   the\n\ncircumstances as aforesaid to discharge the initial burden\n\nbecause his application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_9\">Order XIV of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure</a> (for short, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_10\">the CPC</a>) requesting the trial\n\nCourt to issue summons to the different authorities,\n\nincluding the Concerned Income Tax Officer, to produce\n\nIncome Tax Return filed by the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband is rejected.     The application is erroneously\n\nrejected by the order dated 25.02.2019 on the ground that\n\nthe details of the Income Tax Return filed by the fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband could be obtained by the appellant\n\nunder the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_11\">RTI Act</a>. The trial Court after\n\nrejecting the application under XVI <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_12\">of CPC</a> could not have\n\ndismissed the petition holding that the appellant has not\n\nfiled any further documents to establish that the fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband is an Income tax Assessee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">                                    - 22 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_65\">        19. The learned counsel relying upon decision of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble      Supreme      Court    in   Girish     Ramachandra\n\nDeshpande v. Central information commission and\n\nothers3 submits it is held that the details of the Income\n\nTax Returns of a person constitute that person&#x27;s personal\n\ninformation      and    such    information   is   exempt   from\n\ndisclosure under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_13\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI\n\nAct.      The personal information such as details of the\n\nIncome tax Returns cannot be disclosed even on the ground\n\nof larger public interest as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8 (1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_9\">(j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_15\">RTI Act</a> merely because the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nelection is impugned. The Mumbai High Court in <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_16\">Shailesh\n\nGandhi v.

However, though the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant strenuously argues that the requisition for\n\ninformation as to the details of the Income Tax Assessee for\n\nreasons of ensuring probity in public life would not answer\n\nthe test of larger public interest as contemplated under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act, fairly submits that this\n\nproposition will have to be tested in the light of the recent\n\ndecision of the Constitutional Bench in Central Public\n\nInformation Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_19\">India v.

The learned counsel for the appellant, lastly\n\ncanvasses that the State Election Commission has issued\n\nspecific orders as regards the declaratory affidavit that a\n\ncandidate      should   file   along   with   the    nomination;   a\n\ncandidate, as part of such declaratory affidavit, will have to\n\nfurnish the details of the assets and liabilities by way of\n\nlisting the properties owned by the candidate or his/her\n\nspouse as well as listing the liabilities.          The requirement\n\nnotified by the State Election Commission to furnish the\n\ndetails of Assets and Liabilities would be in consonance\n\nwith the law declared by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in its\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/18700540/\" id=\"a_20\">Union of India v. Association</a> for Democratic\n\nReforms and another6 and People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_21\">Civil\n\nLiberties (PUCL) and another v.

The fourth respondent in furnishing false\n\ninformation in the declaratory affidavit in stating that her\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">6</span>\n    (2002) 5 Supreme Court Cases page 294\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">7</span>\n    (2003) 4 Supreme Court Cases 399</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">                               - 25 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">\n\nhusband does not own immovable properties has acted is\n\nbreach of this    requirement.   The fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\ndeliberate suppression of the properties owned by the\n\nfourth respondent tantamount to Corrupt Practice as\n\ncontemplated under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/197629908/\" id=\"a_22\">section 39</a> of the\n\nKarnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 (for short, &#x27;the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/114110113/\" id=\"a_23\">KMC Act</a>&#x27;) inviting the consequences of declaration of the\n\nresult as void.   The trial Court in concluding that only\n\nnondisclosure of criminal proceedings as contemplated\n\nunder section 33-A of the RP Act would amount to corrupt\n\npractice has overlooked this very pivotal circumstance and\n\nas such, the impugned order cannot be sustained.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">     22. Mr. G B Sharath Gowda, the learned counsel for\n\nthe fourth respondent, argues that in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, the appellant cannot succeed in\n\nchallenging the fourth respondent&#x27;s election on the ground\n\nthat she is guilty of indulging in corrupt practice either\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">                                 - 26 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">\n\nbecause    the   fourth   respondent     has   stated   in   her\n\ndeclaratory affidavit, by a bonafide error, that her husband\n\ndid not own properties or that she has contested the\n\nelections as a Backward Class- B category candidate\n\ndespite her husband being an Income tax Assessee.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">     23. The learned counsel submits that it is settled law\n\nthat that in case of an election petition founded on\n\nallegations of Corrupt Practice, not only the material facts\n\n(&#x27;facta probanda&#x27;) have to be pleaded but even the full\n\nparticulars thereof (facta probantia) have to be furnished at\n\nthe stage of filing of the election petition itself. The salient\n\nfeature of this proposition is that the opposite party is put\n\non notice of the case against him/her so that he/she could\n\neffectively meet the allegations, and also to ensure that the\n\nelectoral mandates are not challenged frivolously.           The\n\nfailure to place such details on record would be fatal to an\n\nelection petition.   The learned counsel relies upon the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                                  - 27 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"175384154\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1346161\" id=\"span_19\">decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1346161/\" id=\"a_24\">Anil Vasudevan\n\nSalagoankar v.

Omprakash Soni</a> and others9 and\n\nMarkio Tado v.Takam Sorang and others10 to buttress\n\nhis submissions.      The learned counsel urges that the\n\nenunciation in the aforesaid decisions in the light of the\n\nprovisions of section 83 of the RP Act, given the similarity\n\nin the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/96829657/\" id=\"a_26\">section 33</a> of the KMC Act, would apply\n\nin equal force in the present case.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">      24. The learned counsel, taking this Court through\n\nthe pleadings, urges that the appellant in the election\n\npetition has not even alleged that the fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband is an Income-tax Assessee and because he is an\n\nIncome tax assessee the fourth respondent could not have\n\ncontested the election as Backward Class - B candidate.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">8</span>\n  (2009) 9 Supreme Court Cases 310\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">9</span>\n  (2017) 4 Supreme Court Cases 348\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">10</span>\n   (2012) 3 Supreme Court Cases 236\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">                                - 28 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">\n\nThe learned Counsel emphasizes that it would be beyond\n\ndispute in the present case that the appellant has not only\n\nfailed to allege and plead all the particulars to substantiate\n\nthat the fourth respondent could not contest the election as\n\na Backward Class- B candidate because her husband is an\n\nIncome-tax Assessee but has also failed to place on record\n\nsufficient evidence to establish the same.          The learned\n\ncounsel   canvasses    that   the   evidence   on    record   is\n\ninsufficient to reasonably imply that the fourth respondent\n\ncould not have contested the election as a Backward Class\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">- B candidate because her husband is an Income-tax\n\nAssessee and therefore, the fourth respondent is guilty of\n\ncorrupt practice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_89\">     25. The learned counsel submits that the charge of\n\ncorrupt practice is akin to a criminal charge and has to be\n\nproved beyond doubt. The standard of proof required for\n\nestablishing a charge of corrupt practice is the same as is\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">                                      - 29 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"701803\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"851599\" id=\"span_24\">applicable to a criminal charge and therefore, unless and\n\nuntil there is clear evidence, which is entirely credible,\n\ncorrupt practice cannot be reasonably implied. The learned\n\ncounsel relies upon the decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/851599/\" id=\"a_27\">Joseph M Puthussery v. PS John</a> and others11\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/701803/\" id=\"a_28\">Pradip v Pranati Phukan12</a> in support of this\n\nproposition.      In the light of this settled proposition, it\n\ncannot be canvassed on behalf the appellant that the\n\nappellant, in placing certain documents and circumstances\n\non record, has discharged the initial burden and the fourth\n\nrespondent has not discharged the evidentiary burden of\n\nestablishing that her husband is not an Income-tax\n\nAssessee.

The\n\nlearned counsel submits that an application for personal\n\ninformation such as Income tax details of a person will\n\nhave to be considered by the concerned Public Information\n\nOfficer in the light of the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in Central Public Information Officer, Supreme\n\nCourt of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_30\">India v.

Even\n\notherwise, the learned counsel submits that the provisions\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_32\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act will have to be read in a\n\npurposive manner keeping in view the object of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_33\">RTI Act</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">     28. The learned counsel submits that a candidate\n\nelected to Municipal Corporation as a councilor is a public\n\nservant holding a public office. Therefore, when a person\n\nseeks disclosure of the details of the Income Tax Returns of\n\na candidate contesting elections, especially when such\n\ndetails are to be furnished as evidence in an election\n\npetition, the concerned Public Information Officer will\n\nprovide the same if the officer satisfied that larger public\n\ninterest justifies such disclosure. Even insofar as copies of\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">                               - 32 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_102\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_28\">the Income Tax Returns of a close relative/associate of a\n\nperson who is elected as a councilor, if the concerned\n\nPublic Information Officer is satisfied that furnishing such\n\ncopies would serve the larger public interest, would be\n\nobliged to furnish such details. This, the learned counsel\n\nsubmits that would be the true import of the law declared\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_34\">Girish Ramachandra\n\nDeshpande v.

It is expounded by the Constitutional Bench that\n\nwhere the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_66\">RTI Act</a> contemplates the disclosure of personal\n\ninformation, it engages the right of privacy of the concerned\n\nindividual, and <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_67\">RTI Act</a> recognizes that an absolute or\n\nunwarranted         disclosure    of     an     individual&#x27;s   Personal\n\nInformation would constitute an unwarranted invasion of\n\nthe right to privacy under the statutory provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_68\">RTI Act</a> and also abridge the individual&#x27;s constitutional\n\nright    to   privacy.     But,    the     balance     between    these\n\nfundamentals right is achieved under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the\n\nRTI Act in providing various checks and balances to guard\n\nagainst       the   unadulterated         disclosure     of    personal\n\ninformation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">                                 - 43 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">      37. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_70\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act\n\nprovides for a qualified exemption to the disclosure of the\n\ninformation    if   such   disclosure    relates   to   personal\n\ninformation. It stipulates that if the disclosure of Personal\n\nInformation &quot;has no relationship to any public activity or\n\ninterest&quot;, or if the disclosure of the personal information\n\n&quot;could cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy&quot;, the\n\ndisclosure of such personal information is exempted. But,\n\nthis restriction on disclosure of Personal Information may be\n\noverridden where the Public Information Officer is satisfied\n\nthat the &quot;larger public interest&quot; justifies the disclosure.\n\nThus, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_71\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act does\n\nnot contemplate absolute exemption from the disclosure of\n\nPersonal Information on the ground of privacy but permits\n\ndisclosure of even Personal Information if the concerned\n\nPublic Information Officer is satisfied that the disclosure of\n\nsuch information is justified in the larger public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">                                 - 44 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">     38.

The\n\nprocedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act is that when an\n\napplication is filed for disclosure of the details of the Third\n\nParty Information, the Public Information Officer must\n\nissue notice to such third party within five days from the\n\ndate of the application for information inviting response as\n\nagainst the disclosure of such information.       If the third\n\nparty responds to such notice within 10 days of receiving\n\nthe notice, the Public Information Officer must take into\n\nconsideration the third-party&#x27;s response when making a\n\ndecision with respect to disclosure or nondisclosure of the\n\ninformation. Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_74\">section 11(1)</a> of the RTI Act permits\n\ndisclosure if the public interest in disclosure outweighs any\n\npossible harm in disclosure, as highlighted by the third-\n\nparty.

The two provisions create a substantive\n      system of checks and balance which seek to\n      balance the right of the information applicant to\n      receive information with the right of the third\n      party to prevent the disclosure of personal\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                   - 46 -\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      information by permitting the latter to contest the\n      proposed disclosure.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">      39. The balance between the larger public interest in\n\ndisclosing information and the possible harm or injury to\n\nthe   interests   of   the    concerned    in    disclosing   such\n\ninformation, is common to both the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_83\">section 8\n\n(1) (j)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_84\">section 11of</a> the RTI Act            It is held by the\n\nConstitutional Bench that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_85\">RTI Act</a>, by\n\nrequiring the Information Officer to balance the public\n\ninterest in disclosure against the privacy harm caused,\n\ncreates a legislatively mandated measure of proportionality\n\nto ensure that the harm to the individual&#x27;s right to privacy\n\nis not disproportionate to the aim of securing transparency\n\nand accountability.

Where\n       the misconduct of an elected representative is\n       exposed to the public, citizens can choose not to\n       vote for the person at the next poll. In this\n       manner, the democratic process coupled with the\n       right    to   information      facilitates   better\n       administration and provides powerful incentives\n       for good public decision-making.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">                                 - 49 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">\n\n\nThe constitutional bench has also delineated the different\n\nsteps involved in applying the proportionality test in\n\nassessing the larger public interest between the two\n\nfundamental rights viz., the right to information and the\n\nright to privacy/confidentiality. The first step for the Public\n\nInformation Officer is to identify the Personal Information\n\nwhich has to be disclosed. Once such Personal Information\n\nis ascertained, the Public Information Officer must identify\n\nthe actual rights in play in an individual case. The Public\n\nInformation Officer must next identify the precise interests\n\nweighing in favour of public interest disclosure and those\n\nweighing in favour of privacy and non-disclosure. The\n\nPublic Information Officer must thereafter examine the\n\njustification for restricting such rights and whether the\n\njustification, either proffered or involved, is countenanced\n\nunder the RTI act and by law generally. Lastly, the Public\n\nInformation    Officer   must   employ     the   principle   of\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">                                - 50 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">\n\nproportionality.

It therefore follows from above discussion that if\n\nan application is filed seeking disclosure of the details of\n\nthe Income Tax Returns of a third person, the concerned\n\nPublic Information Officer must consider the same subject\n\nto the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act and in\n\ncompliance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_89\">section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI\n\nAct,   the   concerned   public   officer   must   apply   the\n\nlegislatively mandated test of proportionality weighing the\n\nlarger public interests in disclosing the details over the\n\ninvasion of privacy of the third party following the steps\n\nprescribed in applying such steps keeping the factors to be\n\nconsidered and not to be considered. The first question is\n\nanswered accordingly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">                                - 51 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_157\">     42. The next question for consideration pertains to\n\none of the grounds urged in support of the challenge to the\n\nelection of the fourth respondent as the returned candidate.\n\nThe appellant has asserted that the State by its notification\n\ndated 16.10.1995 has stipulated amongst others that if\n\neither a candidate or the spouse of a candidate is an\n\nIncome-Tax Assessee, such candidate would not be entitled\n\nto the benefit of reservation. The fourth respondent&#x27;s\n\nhusband is an Income-tax Assessee nevertheless, the\n\nfourth respondent, suppressing this material fact, has\n\ncontested the election to the seat reserved for Backward\n\nClass-B.   As such, the fourth respondent is guilty of\n\ncorrupt practice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">     43. There is no dispute that if a person or his/ her\n\nspouse is an Income Tax Assessee, then such person\n\ncannot contest the election to a seat reserved for a\n\nparticular category. However, the factual assertion by the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">                                  - 52 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_161\">\n\nappellant that the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband is an\n\nIncome Tax Assessee is in serious dispute, and in fact, the\n\nappellant&#x27;s case in this regard is resisted by the fourth\n\nrespondent on two folds. Firstly, there is no pleading in this\n\nregard and secondly, there is no clear-cut evidence and\n\nentirely credible in this regard. It is also asserted on behalf\n\nof the fourth respondent that charge of corrupt practice is in\n\nthe nature of a criminal charge and has to be proved\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_163\">       44. This court has perused the pleadings, and\n\nalthough the learned counsel for the appellant vehemently\n\nargued that the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband is an Income-\n\ntax Assessee and therefore the fourth respondent could not\n\nhave contested the election as a Backward Class-B\n\ncandidate, could not point out to this Court any pleading in\n\nthis   regard   in   the   election   petition.   Therefore,   the\n\nproposition that, &quot;in an election petition, one has to plead\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_164\">                                 - 53 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">\n\nthe material facts at the outset, and the failure to plead the\n\nsame is fatal to the election petition and no evidence can be\n\nled in support of a plea which is not raised in the pleading\n\nand no amount of evidence can cure the defect in the\n\npleadings&quot;17 would squarely apply to the present case. The\n\nappellant&#x27;s challenge to the fourth respondent&#x27;s election on\n\nthis ground, which is introduced at the stage of evidence,\n\nwould be impermissible. As such, the appellant&#x27;s challenge\n\nto the trial Court&#x27;s impugned judgment on this ground\n\nmust fail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_166\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">     45.

It\n\ntherefore cannot be contended that the appellant is able to\n\nestablish    beyond        reasonable     doubt   that        the   fourth\n\nrespondent&#x27;s husband is an Income-tax Assessee and\n\ntherefore the fourth respondent&#x27;s election as the returned\n\ncandidate must be set-aside.

The\n\nappellant has listed the agricultural lands/residential site\n\nowned/purchased by the fourth respondent&#x27;s husband to\n\nsubstantiate her case. The appellant has also furnished a\n\ncertified copy of the declaratory affidavit filed by the fourth\n\nrespondent along with the nomination form. The appellant&#x27;s\n\ncontention is that the deliberate failure to mention the\n\ndetails of the properties owned by the husband, and the\n\nerror in mentioning the husband&#x27;s name in column No. 8 of\n\nthe declaratory affidavit tantamount to corrupt practice as\n\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/197629908/\" id=\"a_92\">section 39</a> of the KMC Act.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_177\">     48.

The\n\nfourth respondent contends that the failure to mention the\n\ndetails of the properties owned by her husband and the\n\ndeclaration that he does not own immovable/movable\n\nproperties is a bona fide and an unintentional error, and\n\nthat such bona fide and unintentional error, would not\n\namount to corrupt practice as contemplated under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/114110113/\" id=\"a_93\">KMC Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_181\">     49.

Further, in the interest of justice it would also\n\nbe just and reasonable to direct the parties to appear before\n\nthe trial Court without further notice of first hearing on\n\n15.06.2020 while calling upon the trial Court to dispose of\n\nthe election petition as expeditiously as possible but within\n\nan outer limit of six months from 15.06.2020.
