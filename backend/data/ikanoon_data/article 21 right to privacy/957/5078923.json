If by strength is meant brute strength, then, indeed, is\n         woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power,\n         then woman is immeasurably man&#x27;s superior. Has she not greater\n         intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater\n         powers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her,\n         man could not be. If nonviolence is the law of our being, the future\n         is with woman. Who can make a more effective appeal to the heart\n         than woman?&quot;----Mahatma Gandhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">1.             Rape is a dark reality in Indian society like in any other nation.\nThis abnormal conduct is rooted in physical force as well as familiar and\nother power which the abuser uses to pressure his victim. Nor is abuse by\nknown and unknown persons confined to a single political ideology or to\none economic system. It transcends barriers of age, class, language, caste,\ncommunity, sex and even family. The only commonality is power which\ntriggers and feeds rape. Disbelief, denial and cover-up to &quot;preserve the\nfamily reputation&quot; are often then placed above the interests of the victim\nand her abuse. Rape is an abominable and ghastly and it worsens and\nbecomes inhuman and barbaric when the victim is known to the culprit, as\nin the present case, who is allegedly subjected to unwanted physical contact\nby a perverted male adult on the pretext of promise to marry and whose trust\nis betrayed by a man in whom she reposes maximum trust so much so as to\nsurrender herself before him into a physical relationship and then following\nrefusal, she is made to undergo a farce of marriage ceremony which neither\nis lawful nor valid marriage.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">Sessions Case Number : 57 of 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Unique Case ID Number : 02401R0559232010\nFIR No. 295/10, Police Station Punjabi Bagh,\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_7\">sections 376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1912691/\" id=\"a_8\">496</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_9\">420</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1412540\" id=\"span_1\"><a href=\"/doc/1412540/\" id=\"a_10\">State versus Deepak Dogra</a>.                                       -:: Page 2 of 55 ::-\n                                                  -:: 3 ::-</span>\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134531\" id=\"span_2\">2.             &quot;Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying\nan accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost\nsensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case\nand not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies\nin the statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw\nout allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of lately\ncrime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It\nis an irony that while we are celebrating women&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we\nshow little or no concern for her honour.

It means, on the\nother hand no innocent man should be punished but on the other hand to see\nno person committing an offence should get scot-free. If in spite of such\neffort suspicion is not dissolved, it remains writ at large, benefit of doubt\nhas to be created to the accused. For this, one has to comprehend the totality\nof facts and the circumstances as spelled out through the evidence,\ndepending on the facts of each case by testing the credibility of the\nwitnesses, of course after excluding that part of the evidence which are\nvague and uncertain. There is no mathematical formula through which the\ntruthfulness of the prosecution or a defence case could be concretized. It\nwould depend upon the evidence of each case including the manner of\ndeposition and his demeans, clarity, corroboration of witnesses and overall,\nthe conscience of a Judge evoked by the evidence on record. So the Courts\nhave to proceed further and make genuine efforts within judicial sphere to\nsearch out the truth and not stop at the threshold of creation of doubt to\nconfer benefit of doubt.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">29.

He told her that he would marry her. Thereafter, the prosecutrix\ntold Deepak first he should marry her but he replied that he would marry her\nafter marriage of his sister. Thereafter, the accused had sexual intercourse\nwith the prosecutrix without her consent forcibly. The accused used to\nmaintain sexual relations with the prosecutrix from that day onwards\nsometimes at her house and sometimes at the factory of his grandfather.\nThis continued for about 2-2 ½ years.

The motive has to be gathered from the surrounding\ncircumstances and such evidence should from one of the links to the chain\nof circumstantial evidence.

It has already been observed in the judgment that this case is a\nglaring example of the growing menace of sexual abuse.

The victim\nmay suppress emotions or be filled with feelings of rage, guilt and shame. It\nis difficult for such victims to trust others later on in life. The victim needs\nto stand up for himself/herself and not allow the trauma to make them\npsychologically and socially weak.

The convict and his counsel, on the other hand, have requested for a\nlenient view to be taken against him and for his release on probation as the\nconvict hails from a modest family. He is an unmarried young man, aged\nabout 21 years. He was working as an employee in a factory. He lives with\nhis parents and his father is financially independent. He is in custody w.e.f.\n06.10.2010 to 12.10.20111. He is a first offender and has never committed\nany offence earlier.
