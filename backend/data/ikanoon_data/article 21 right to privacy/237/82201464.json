Respondent No.3 had\n\ndeveloped illicit relations with petitioner which continued for many years\n\nand out of their illicit relationship a female child has born. It is also\n\nalleged that Sarpanch used to force the petitioner to have illicit relations\n\nwith his friends. When the petitioner refused to have physical relations\n\nwith him and his friends, respondent No.3 started black-mailing the\n\npetitioner and committing rape upon the petitioner in the year 2009\n\nforcibly without her consent. Petitioner submitted representation to SSP,\n\nLudhiana and to the Police Commissioner, Ludhiana but no action was\n\ntaken. The petitioner filed Crl. Misc. No. M-3165 of 2010 wherein, vide\n\norder dated 27.10.2011, a direction was issued to decide the representation\n\nwithin two months. It is submitted that no proper investigation was carried\n\nout by the investigating agency, no blood grouping, DNA test of the\n\npetitioner, of daughter of the petitioner and of respondent No.3 has been\n\nconducted. Respondent No.3 is alleged to be an active member of the\n\nruling Akali Dal Party and is the village Sarpanch, has considerable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Crl. Misc.

It is also alleged that one Major Singh, a close\n\nfriend of respondent No.3 is also posted in the Police Station and has been\n\nhelping the petitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">REPLY BY RESPONDENTS:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">             Notice of motion was issued in this case. Respondent Nos.1\n\nand 2 have filed reply and in the reply it is averred that during preliminary\n\ninquiry, allegations of the petitioner were found to be false. Hence, there\n\nwas no question of conducting DNA test of respondent No.3. It is also\n\nalleged that proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/534484/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 182</a> IPC had been initiated against\n\nthe petitioner. It is also mentioned that the petitioner has not come to the\n\ncourt with clean hands. The allegations have been levelled to wreak\n\nvengeance.    Earlier, the petitioner had moved complaints against the\n\npanchayat members levelling allegation of demolishing her boundary\n\nwalls. The said complaint was found false.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">             Respondent No.3 was afforded adequate opportunities to file\n\nreply to the petition, but for the reasons best known to him he did not file\n\nreply, despite being represented by a Learned Counsel.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             I have heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused the\n\nrecord.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">CONTENTIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE\n\nPARTIES:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">             Learned Counsel for the petitioner has vehemently contended\n\nthat crime against women is increasing every day and the innocent rustic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> Crl. Misc.

This is primarily for\n\nthe reason that no woman, specifically a rustic village woman, will come\n\nout because of fear that her honour and dignity may not be maligned. The\n\nwoman in India approach the courts and authorities only in extreme cases.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner was being\n\nexploited for the last 12-13 years. A female child out of illicit relationship\n\nof petitioner and respondent No.3 has born. Learned Counsel for the\n\npetitioner submitted that name of the child has been intentionally withheld\n\nin order to keep identity of the child confidential, so that her honour and\n\ndignity may not be affected in future and may also not affect her marriage\n\nand other prospects. Learned counsel further vehemently argued that non\n\nfiling of reply to the averments made in the petition by respondent No.3\n\namounts to admission of the averments, so an adverse inference should be\n\ndrawn against respondent no.3. Averments in the petition should be taken\n\nas correct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              Learned counsel for respondent No.3 vehemently contended\n\nthat preliminary investigation has already been done and respondent No.3\n\nhas been found to be innocent. It is contended that since the wall of the\n\npetitioner was demolished by the panchayat members, this complaint has\n\nbeen filed to involve them. Respondent No.3 cannot be compelled to\n\nundergo DNA test on flimsy grounds. The presumption with regard to the\n\nchild can only be considered if it is proved that the petitioner had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> Crl. Misc.

He submits that for ordering DNA test of respondent No.3,\n\npetitioner and the alleged girl child, amounts to violation of the right\n\nagainst self-incrimination. DNA test is not absolutely authentic, and is not\n\nfully grown scientific method at least in India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             Before I deal with the above mentioned contentions of the\n\nparties it would be appropriate to refer to the relevant provision of law\n\nand jurisprudence and to know about DNA and DNA evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">RELEVANT LAWS, RULES AND JURISPRUDENCE:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_3\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> : <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 53</a>,<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_5\">53-A</a>,<a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_6\">54</a> and <a href=\"/doc/692331/\" id=\"a_7\">293</a>:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            53.

These concepts of divisibility\n           of matter and transfer of material emerge from the\n           fundamental nature of matter and they assume\n           significance by way of evidence when division and\n           transfer occur in conjunction with a criminal event.\n           The theory that makes concepts of identification,\n           classification and individualization is one attributed\n           Edmund Locard in the early 20th century. As per this\n           theory, when two objects come in contact, traces from\n           one will be transferred to the other, and in both\n           directions. These traces may not be always detectable\n           without scientific aid, but they are always present. This\n           is known as Locard Transfer Theory, which is a\n           linchpin of all forensic examination. The other\n           concepts namely, identification, association through\n           class,     individualizing      characteristics      and     re-\n           construction are integral to the practice of forensic\n           science and are processes that are used to answer\n           various investigative questions. The transfer of matter\n           requires its prior division. After the crime is\n           committed, the process of recognition of evidence\n           follows during investigation for discovering the\n           evidence. However, even if such evidence is never\n           detected, the matter is still divided and transferred. It\n           is only when answering investigative questions about a\n           crime that the processes of association through class\n           and      individualizing     characteristics   and     of    re-\n           construction are employed.

The process of\n            individualization answers the question of &#x27;Who is it?&#x27;.\n            Classification of a physical item is done on the basis of\n            class characteristics. For example, an analyst can\n            identify a human hair on the basis of its microscopic\n            characteristics that distinguish it from animal hair.\n            Individualization relies on the acquisition of traits that\n            are so rare that it would be unreasonable to think of\n            them being duplicated by chance alone (ibid).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">DNA Analysis as Evidence\n\n            DNA is the fundamental building block of a person&#x27;s\n            entire genetic make-up. DNA is found in all human cells\n            and is the same in every cell of the same person.\n            Genetic identity is unique. Hence, a person&#x27;s DNA\n            profile can determine his identity.[See Maria Corazon\n            A.

The DNA is processed to generate a pattern,\n            or a DNA profile, for the individual from whom the\n            sample is taken. This DNA profile is unique for each\n            person, except for identical twins.(See The UP-NSRI\n            DNA Analysis Laboratory, A Primer on DNA-based\n            Paternity Testing (2001).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">            Everyone is born with a distinct genetic blueprint called DNA\n\n(deoxyribonucleic acid).It is exclusive to an individual (except in the rare\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Crl.

They are\n\nknown as A (adenine), G (guanine), C (cystosine) and T (thymine).The\n\norder in which the four bases appear in an individual&#x27;s DNA determines\n\nhis or her physical makeup. And since DNA is a double-stranded\n\nmolecule, it is composed of two specific paired bases, A-T or T-A and G-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">C or C-G. These are called &quot;genes.&quot; Every gene has a certain number of\n\nthe above base pairs distributed in a particular sequence.This gives a\n\nperson his or her genetic code. However, somewhere in the DNA\n\nframework, there are sections that differ. They are known as &quot;polymorphic\n\nloci,&quot; which are the areas analyzed in DNA typing (profiling, tests,\n\nfingerprinting,   or   analysis/DNA     fingerprinting/genetic     tests   or\n\nfingerprinting).

PCR is the process of replicating or copying\n\nDNA in an evidence sample a million times through repeated cycling of a\n\nreaction involving the so-called DNA polymerize enzyme. STR, on the\n\nother hand, takes measurements in 13 separate places and can match two\n\n(2) samples with a reported theoretical error rate of less than one (1) in a\n\ntrillion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">            Just like in fingerprint analysis, in DNA typing, &quot;matches&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">are determined. To illustrate, when DNA or fingerprint tests are done to\n\nidentify a suspect in a criminal case, the evidence collected from the crime\n\nscene is compared with the &quot;known&quot; print. If substantial amount of the\n\nidentifying features are the same, the DNA or fingerprint is deemed to be a\n\nmatch. But then, even if only one feature of the DNA or fingerprint is\n\ndifferent, it is deemed not to have come from the suspect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">            As earlier stated, certain regions of human DNA show\n\nvariations between people. In each of these regions, a person possesses\n\ntwo genetic types called &quot;allele&quot;, one inherited from each parent. In a\n\npaternity test, the forensic scientist looks at a number of these variable\n\nregions in an individual to produce a DNA profile. Comparing next the\n\nDNA profiles of the mother and child, it is possible to determine which\n\nhalf of the child&#x27;s DNA was inherited from the mother.

Mr. P.H. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing\n           for the plaintiff has contended that no reply to this\n           application was necessary. Consequently learned\n           counsels were orally heard in the matter on this\n           application. Learned senior counsel urges at great\n           length that given the judicial pronouncements of the\n           Supreme Court and the adjudication by this court in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> Crl.

Opposing this application, Mr. Patwalia, has further\n           contended that the application is mala fide and an\n           abuse of the process of the court. It is vehemently\n           urged that the order passed by this court has been\n           sustained in appeal and even the Supreme Court has\n           refused stay thereof to the defendant No. 1. It is urged\n           that directions having been made, the defendant No. 1\n           has no option but to comply with the same unless the\n           direction is modified or stayed by the court. It is urged\n           that the defendant has to be forcibly confined and a\n           sample compulsorily extracted from him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">           14. Right at the outset it was pointed out to counsel for\n           the defendant No. 1 that the pleas on which the present\n           application is premised have been heard, considered\n           and rejected by the judgments dated 23rd December,\n           2010 and 7th February, 2011 and that it was not open\n           for the defendant No. 1 to re-agitate the issues which\n           stand decided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">           Mr. Burqi has insisted that he wishes to deal with three\n           pronouncements of the Supreme Court which have not\n           been placed or considered before this court for the\n           purposes of the defendant No. 1&#x27;s submission that he\n           cannot be compelled to provide a sample for DNA\n           testing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_24\">15. This application therefore raises the question as to\n           whether a person can be physically compelled to give a\n           blood sample for DNA profiling in compliance with a\n           civil court order in a paternity action? If it were held\n           that the same was permissible, how is the court to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> Crl. Misc.

The justifiability of\n           the refusal has to be tested against the plaintiff&#x27;s rights\n           which are involved. As a corollary, the impact of the\n           affect of a refusal to comply with the court direction\n           has to be answered. In case an adverse inference was to\n           be drawn, what is the nature of the inference? The role\n           of the court in discovering the truth having made the\n           directions,   and   the   parameters     of   exercise    of\n           jurisdiction by a civil court are also in issue.\n           Whether the judicial pronouncements in AIR 1993 SC\n           2295 Goutam Kundu v.

First and foremost, it is necessary to deal with the\n           misconceived submissions of learned counsel for the\n           applicant that precedents have been overlooked in on\n           the judgment dated 23rd December, 2010. Mr. Burqi\n           has firstly submitted that this court had failed to\n           consider the judgment of the Supreme Court reported at\n           AIR 1993 SC 2295 Goutam Kundu v. State of West\n           Bengal. In this regard, I find that in the order dated\n           23rd December, 2010 my learned brother S.

The matter may be considered from\n                    another angle. In all such matrimonial cases\n                    where divorce is sought, say on the ground\n                    of impotency, schizophrenia, etc. normally\n                    without there being medical examination, it\n                    would be difficult to arrive at a conclusion\n                    as to whether the allegation made by his\n                    spouse against the other spouses seeking\n                    divorce on such a ground, is correct or not.\n                    In order to substantiate such allegation, the\n                    Petitioner would always insist on medical\n                    examination. If respondent avoids such\n                    medical examination on the ground that it\n                    violates his/her right to privacy or for a\n                    matter right to personal liberty as enshrined\n                    under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n                    India, and with the extensive interpretation\n                    of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right\n                    has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be\n                    treated    as    absolute     right.   What       is\n                    emphasized is that some limitations on this\n                    right have to be imposed and particularly\n                    where two competing interests clash. In\n                    matters of aforesaid nature where the\n                    legislature has conferred a right upon his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> Crl. Misc.

Thus the Court\n                    has to reconcile these competing interests\n                    by balancing the interests involved.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">                 xxx xxx xxx xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">                 14.

The other view is that\n                     the court must be reluctant in use of such\n                     scientific advances and tools which result\n                     in invasion of right to privacy of an\n                     individual and may not only be prejudicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> Crl.

The compulsion in this sense is a physical\n                 objective act and not the state of mind of the\n                 person making the statement, except where the\n                 mind has been so conditioned by some extraneous\n                 process as to render the making of the statement\n                 involuntary and, therefore, extorted. Hence, the\n                 mere asking by a police officer investigating a\n                 crime against a certain individual to do a certain\n                 thing is not compulsion within the meaning of\n                 <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 20(3).</a> Hence, the mere fact that the\n                 accused person, when he made the statement in\n                 question was in police custody would not, by\n                 itself, be the foundation for an inference of law\n                 that the accused was compelled to make the\n                 statement. Of course, it is open to an accused\n                 person to show that while he was in police\n                 custody at the relevant time, he was subjected to\n                 treatment which, in the circumstances of the case,\n                 would lend itself to the inference that compulsion\n                 was, in fact, exercised.

Essentially there are two: the\n                 character of the invasion of the body and the\n                 expression of the victim&#x27;s will; the latter may be\n                 manifested by physical resistance. Of course, one\n                 may consent to having his blood extracted or his\n                 stomach pumped and thereby waive any due\n                 process objection. In that limited sense the\n                 expression of the will is significant. But where\n                 there is no affirmative consent, I cannot see that it\n                 should make any difference whether one states\n                 unequivocally that he objects or resorts to\n                 physical violence in protest or is in such condition\n                 that he is unable to protest. The Court, however,\n                 states that &quot;the absence of conscious consent,\n                 without more, does not necessarily render the\n                 taking a violation of constitutional right.&quot; This\n                 implies that a different result might follow if\n                 petitioner had been conscious and had voiced his\n                 objection.

I cannot accept an analysis that would make\n                 physical resistance by a prisoner a prerequisite to\n                 the existence of his constitutional rights.\n                 Apart from the irrelevant factor of physical\n                 resistance, the techniques used in this case and in\n                 Rochin are comparable. In each the operation was\n                 performed by a doctor in a hospital. In each there\n                 was an extraction of body fluids. Neither\n                 operation normally causes any lasting ill effects.\n                 The Court denominates a blood test as a scientific\n                 method for detecting crime and cites the\n                 frequency of such tests in our everyday life. The\n                 stomach pump too is a common and accepted way\n                 of making tests and relieving distress. But it does\n                 not follow from the fact that a technique is a\n                 product of science or is in common, consensual\n                 use for other purposes that it can be used to\n                 extract evidence from a criminal defendant\n                 without his consent. Would the taking of spinal\n                 fluid from an unconscious person be condoned\n                 because such tests are commonly made and might\n                 be used as a scientific aid to law enforcement?\n                 Only personal reaction to the stomach pump and\n                 the blood test can distinguish them. To base the\n                 restriction which the Due Process Clause imposes\n                 on state criminal procedures upon such reactions\n                 is to build on shifting sands.

Dr. Sharma\n           writes that &quot;Indirect references of close blood relatives\n           of the person to be identified are usually desired for\n           establishing identity. A DNA profile for a multiplex of\n           15 autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) markers is\n           generated and obligatory alleles are compared with that\n           of parents, siblings, or close relatives for kinship\n           analysis. An inconsistency at two or more loci\n           (considering the mutation rate of STRS) generally leads\n           to exclusion in a kinship case. Inclusion at all loci is\n           statistically evaluated by calculating paternity, maternity,\n           or sibship indices. The success of a DNA case not only\n           depends on the authenticity of the reference samples but\n           also on the authenticity of the biological relationship of\n           the donors with the person in question, without which\n           any comparison is futile&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">           107.

If the specimen had been\n           obtained and the results indicate that the alleged father is\n           the father of the child, a presumption of paternity is\n           created. Such presumption can be rebutted only by clear\n           and convincing evidence that the results of the genetic\n           test are not reliable in that particular case.

If these\n                 sections do not authorise the court to order an\n                 adult to have his blood tested, I do not see that\n                 they authorise the court to make such an order in\n                 the case of an infant. A test of the child&#x27;s blood\n                 would be useless unless there were tests of the\n                 adults also. But, I would say this. If an adult\n                 unreasonably refuses to have a blood test, or to\n                 allow a child to have one, I think that it is open to\n                 the court in any civil proceedings (no matter\n                 whether it be a paternity issue or an affiliation\n                 summons, or a custody proceeding) to treat his\n                 refusal as evidence against him, and may draw an\n                 inference therefrom adverse to him. This is simply\n                 common sense. It is in keeping with the rule that\n                 in a nullity case, if a party refuses to be medically\n                 examined, the court may infer that some\n                 impediment exists pointing to incapacity (see <a href=\"/doc/682973/\" id=\"a_64\">W.\n                 v.

In this regard, the\n           Supreme Court observed as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">                 &quot;The maximum that can be done where a party\n                 refuses to have a blood test is to draw an adverse\n                 inference (see in this connection Subayya\n                 Gounder v. Bhoppala, AIR 1959 Mad 396) and\n                 the earlier decision of the same court in\n                 Venkateshwarlu v. Subbayya, AIR 1951 Mad 910\n                 (1). Such an adverse inference which has only a\n                 very little relevance here will not advance the\n                 appellant&#x27;s case to any extent. He has to prove\n                 that he had no opportunity to have any sexual\n                 intercourse with the Ist respondent at a time when\n                 these children could have been begotton. That is\n                 the only proof that is permitted under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 112</a>\n                 to dislodge the conclusive presumption enjoined\n                 by the Section.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_81\">126.

DNA test is a scientific test and its accuracy is 99.99% and\n\nas such this must be used as evidence in sexual assault and violent crime\n\ncases.

The quest of the petitioner for justice and\n\ndetermined fight against crime requires use of new and innovative\n\nadvancements in investigation. <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 5</a> to <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_80\">9</a> of the Evidence Act relate to\n\nrelevancy of facts and the outcome of DNA test can certainly be treated as\n\nrelevant evidence according to these provisions.

There is no\n\nlonger any question on the validity of the use of DNA analysis as\n\nevidence. The Courts are now moving from the issue of according\n\n&quot;official recognition&quot; to DNA analysis as evidence to the issue of\n\nobservance of procedures in conducting DNA analysis.
