The brief facts are relevant for the purpose of disposal of the\n\npresent Criminal Revisional application are that the petitioner being\n\nthe de-facto complainant/victim woman had lodged a complaint on\n\n11.03.2009 in afternoon to the effect that when she went to bring her\n\ngoat back at an abandoned place of her village, the accused/opposite\n\nparty no. 2 committed rape upon her forcibly. The petitioner narrated\n\nthe incident of rape before the family members of the opposite party\n\nno. 2, where the opposite party no. 2 admitted the same and,\n\naccordingly, his family members promised to get married her with the\n\naccused/opposite party no. 2 but later on they refused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.      After the refusal of marriage by the accused/opposite party\n\nno. 2, the petitioner was compelled to file a petition of complaint\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 156(3)</a> CrPC before the Learned Additional Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate, Alipore on 02.12.2009. Upon being satisfied, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              3</span>\n\n\n\n\nLearned Court below allowed the petitioner&#x27;s prayer and directed the\n\nOfficer-in-Charge, Basanti Police Station to lodge an FIR against the\n\naccused and his family members. Consequently, Basanti P.S. Case\n\nNo. 373/2009 dated 26.12.2009 under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_9\">120B</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 was registered. When the FIR was lodged,\n\nthe petitioner was pregnant of 6 months gestational period and later\n\non, she gave birth of a male child on 05.03.2010 named as &quot;Master\n\nX&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.       On 22.03.2010, the Investigating Officer submitted the\n\ncharge sheet before the Learned Court below and the said case was\n\nsubsequently committed to the Learned Court of Sessions Judge and,\n\nlater, it was transferred to the Learned Additional District Judge,\n\nSpecial Court under <a href=\"/doc/774360/\" id=\"a_10\">E.C. Act</a> at Alipore for trial. Subsequently,\n\ncharge was framed on 16.03.2012 under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_12\">417</a> of the IPC\n\nand, thereafter, trial has been commenced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.       During trial, at the request of the petitioner, the accused\n\npromised to have the victim and her child back to his home once the\n\ntrial was concluded. However, in violation of the said promise, the\n\nopposite party no. 2 married another woman thereby depriving the\n\npetitioner   and   her   minor   son.   Even   after   marriage,   the\n\naccused/opposite party no. 2 provided maintenance to the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               4</span>\n\n\n\n\nand her minor son for a few years. However, from the month of June,\n\n2019, the accused stopped providing any maintenance to the\n\npetitioner and her minor son under the pressure and instigation of\n\nhis second wife and later the opposite party no. 2 denied to recognize\n\nthe petitioner and her minor son as his wife and son respectively.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.      In the meantime, trial proceeded and the examination of the\n\nprosecution witnesses    was nearing     completion. As    such,     the\n\npetitioner herein filed an application praying for conducting DNA test\n\nof the accused person/opposite party no. 2 in order to ascertain the\n\npaternity of the child on 25th March, 2019. However, the Learned\n\nJudge rejected the said prayer for the DNA Test.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">7.      It was held by the Learned Trial Court that the <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 376</a>\n\nof the IPC is the provision concerning rape. In case of rape, medical\n\nevidence is not always conclusive or final but medical evidence places\n\nthe role of secondary evidence. If the Court finds that evidence\n\nprovided by the prosecutrix is sufficient to establish the truth of\n\nprosecution case, there is a strong likelihood of conviction based\n\nsolely on the evidence of prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">8.      Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has\n\napproached before this Court by filing this Criminal Revisional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                               5</span>\n\n\n\n\napplication reiterating the contentions raised before the Learned Trial\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">9.       During the course of arguments, the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the petitioner contended that the impugned\n\norder is bad in law. The Learned Magistrate, mechanically and\n\nwithout applying his judicious mind, dismissed the said application.\n\nThe Learned Magistrate should have allowed the prayer for DNA test\n\nto uncover the truth of rape and to decide the paternity of the child.\n\nThis case is fit to be considered to allow the application for\n\nconducting DNA test to determine the rape and paternity of the child\n\nbut the Learned Trial Court erred both in law and facts while passing\n\nthe impugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">10.      Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner further\n\nargued that the Learned Trial Court failed to appreciate the necessity\n\nfor conducting the DNA test of the accused person though it is crucial\n\nto determine the commission of offence of rape and establish that the\n\nchild was a result of such offence and thereby squarely jeopardise the\n\nfundamental rights of the petitioner and her son to live with dignity\n\nas guaranteed to them by the Constitution of India especially more\n\nparticularly under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">21</a> of the Constitution of India. In\n\ncase of rape or sexual offence, usually finds no eye witness to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  6</span>\n\n\n\n\nincident as a result of which the court has to rely on the oral evidence\n\nof the victim and supported by the medical evidence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">11.          It was further submitted by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner    that   the   learned   Special   Judge   misconstrued   and\n\nmisunderstood the law that prayer at the stage of trial for DNA test\n\ncannot be allowed. Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case the DNA test is required to be conducted to prove the fact in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">12.      On the other hand, none appears on behalf of the opposite\n\nparties despite good service. As such, hearing was concluded exparte\n\nfor its disposal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\nDISCUSSIONS AND FINDINGS BY THIS COURT:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">13.      Heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\npetitioner and upon perusal of the entire record as well as impugned\n\norder dated 22.09.2020, it appears that charge was framed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_17\">417</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and trial was\n\ncommenced in the year 2012 and several witnesses have already been\n\nexamined. It is an admitted fact that prior to framing of charge or\n\nduring investigation, no prayer for holding DNA test was made on the\n\npart of the prosecution. The case was fixed for examination of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              7</span>\n\n\n\n\nremaining   witnesses   including   the   Investigating   Officer.   The\n\nprosecution moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 311</a> of the CrPC\n\npraying for holding DNA test of the accused and male child of the\n\nvictim born out of the alleged commission of rape. Therefore, the\n\nprimary question arises before this Court is that whether DNA test of\n\nthe accused and child is necessary for the disposal of the case\n\ninitiated under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_20\">417</a> of the IPC?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">14.     The Learned Judge dismissed the said application on three-\n\nfold grounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">        Firstly, the application for a DNA test of the accused was\n\nneither filed nor conducted during the investigation. Even no prayer\n\nwas made for DNA test at the time of filing charge sheet or before\n\nframing of charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">        Secondly, the Court may, at any stage of the enquiry, trial\n\nor other proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_21\">CrPC</a>, summon any person as a\n\nwitness or examine any person in attendance who was not been\n\nsummoned as witness, or recall and re-examine any person already\n\nexamined; and such examination of witnesses may be done if it\n\nappears to the Court that the same is especially for the just decision\n\nof the case. This provision as per <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 311</a> of the CrPC cannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                8</span>\n\n\n\n\nused for any purpose in any manner prosecution likes i.e. prayer\n\nmade for the DNA test of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">         Thirdly, <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 311</a> of the CrPC cannot be invoked to fulfil\n\nthe lacuna of the prosecution case when the entire defence case has\n\nbeen disclosed and no attempt was made by the prosecution to hold\n\nthe DNA test at the appropriate stage of investigation or trial.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">15.      Before deciding the aforesaid issue, this Court would like to\n\nreproduce the <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 311</a> of the CrPC which reads as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          S. 311. Power to summon material witness, or\n          examine person present. --Any Court may, at any\n          stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under\n          this Code, summon any person as a witness, or\n          examine any person in attendance, though not\n          summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine\n          any person already examined; and the Court shall\n          summon and examine or recall and re-examine any\n          such person if his evidence appears to it to be\n          essential to the just decision of the case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">16.        In the present case, prosecution tried to bring some\n\nnew medical evidence to improve the case of the petitioner\n\nthough no such DNA test was earlier conducted or any prayer\n\nwas made either during investigation or at the time of filing\n\ncharge sheet. Bringing such evidence is definitely would be a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                   9</span>\n\n\n\n\nfurther     investigation.   Whether    such     prayer   for   further\n\ninvestigation is permissible after examination of the witnesses\n\nin trial?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">17.         The expressions &quot;further investigation&quot;, &quot;reinvestigation&quot;, and\n\n&quot;fresh investigation&quot; all connote different meanings and are entirely\n\ndistinguishable in their scope and application.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">18.          The words &quot;further investigation&quot; find mention in <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n\n173(8)</a> Cr.P.C. It is worthwhile to note that sub-section (8) in Section\n\n173 did not exist in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_26\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> of 1898. It came\n\nto be inserted in pursuance of the recommendation contained in the\n\nForty-First     Law    Commission      Report,   1969.    Although    it   was\n\nrecommended as sub-section (7) to Section 173, it came to be added\n\nas sub-section (8). The relevant extract of the Report reads as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             &quot;14.23. A report under section 173 is normally the\n             end of the investigation. Sometimes, however, the\n             police officer after submitting the report under section\n             173 comes upon evidence bearing on the guilt or\n             innocence of the accused. We should have thought\n             that the police officer can collect that evidence and\n             send it to the magistrate concerned. It appears,\n             however, that courts have sometimes taken the\n             narrow view that once a final report under <a href=\"/doc/1943863/\" id=\"a_27\">section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                10</span></a>\n\n\n\n\n         173 has been sent, the police cannot touch the case\n         again and cannot re-open the investigation. This view\n         places a hindrance in the way of the investigating\n         agency, which can be very unfair to the prosecution\n         and, for that matter, even to the accused. It should be\n         made clear in Section 173 that the competent police\n         officer can examine such evidence and send a report\n         to the magistrate. Copies concerning the fresh\n         material must of course be furnished to the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">19.   As per the Code, the stage referred to in <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 173(8)</a> Cr.P.C.\n\ncomes into effect after a Report under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 173(2)</a> Cr.P.C. is\n\nforwarded by the police officer to the concerned Magistrate upon\n\ncompletion of the investigation. This provision empowers the police\n\nofficer to carry out further investigation if he obtains further\n\nadditional evidence, oral or documentary, and to thereafter forward a\n\nfurther report regarding such evidence. Ordinarily, a police officer\n\nshould inform the Court and seek formal permission to conduct\n\nfurther investigation when fresh facts come to light [Refer: Ram Lal\n\nNarang (Supra)].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">20.      The word &quot;further&quot; would mean additional, more, or\n\nsupplemental.      &quot;Further   investigation&quot;,   therefore,   would   mean\n\ncontinuation of the earlier investigation. The Supreme Court has shed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           11</span>\n\n\n\n\n           light on the expression &quot;further investigation&quot; in the case of\n\n           Amrutbhai Shambhubhai Patel (Supra) where it was observed as\n\n           under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                     &quot;38. ...further investigation was a phenomenon where\n                     the investigating officer would obtain further oral or\n                     documentary evidence after the final report had\n                     already been submitted, so much so that the report on\n                     the basis of the subsequent disclosures/discoveries\n                     by way of such evidence would be in consolidation\n                     and continuation of the previous investigation and the\n                     report yielded thereby....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1777261\" id=\"span_11\">21.      The    law   regarding     occasion   to   undertake      further\n\n           investigation was propounded by the Supreme Court in the case of\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/1777261/\" id=\"a_30\">Kishan Lal v.

The investigating officer may exercise his\n                     statutory power of further investigation in several\n                     situations as, for example, when new facts come to its\n                     notice; when certain aspects of the matter had not\n                     been considered by him and he found that further\n                     investigation is necessary to be carried out from a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1</span>\n    (2009) 7 SCC 685\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                               12</span>\n\n\n\n\n                      different angle(s) keeping in view the fact that new or\n                      further materials came to its notice.

This power is vested with the\nexecutive.     It    is    the   continuation        of   previous\ninvestigation       and,    therefore,    is   understood      and\ndescribed as &#x27;further investigation&#x27;. The scope of such\ninvestigation is restricted to the discovery of further\noral and documentary evidence. Its purpose is to\nbring the true facts before the court even if they are\ndiscovered at a subsequent stage to the primary\ninvestigation.       It     is   commonly       described       as\n&quot;supplementary report&quot;. Supplementary report would\nbe    the    correct      expression      as   the    subsequent\ninvestigation is meant and intended to supplement\nthe    primary       investigation        conducted       by   the\nempowered police officer. Another significant feature\nof further investigation is that it does not have the\neffect of wiping out directly or impliedly the initial\ninvestigation conducted by the investigating agency.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">This is a kind of continuation of the previous\ninvestigation. The basis is discovery of fresh evidence\nand in continuation of the same offence and chain of\nevents relating to the same occurrence incidental\nthereto. In other words, it has to be understood in\ncomplete     contradistinction       to    a   &quot;reinvestigation&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;fresh or de novo investigation&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                     15</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">23. However, in the case of a &quot;fresh investigation&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;reinvestigation or de novo investigation&quot; there has to\nbe a definite order of the court. The order of the court\nunambiguously should state as to whether the\nprevious investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is\nincapable   of   being   acted    upon.   Neither   the\ninvestigating agency nor the Magistrate has any\npower to order or conduct &quot;fresh investigation&quot;. This\nis primarily for the reason that it would be opposed to\nthe scheme of the Code. It is essential that even an\norder of &quot;fresh/de novo investigation&quot; passed by the\nhigher judiciary should always be coupled with a\nspecific direction as to the fate of the investigation\nalready conducted. The cases where such direction\ncan be issued are few and far between... xxx\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">43. At this stage, we may also state another well-\nsettled canon of the criminal jurisprudence that the\nsuperior courts have the jurisdiction under Section\n482 of the Code or even <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\nof India to direct &quot;further investigation&quot; &quot;fresh or de\nnovo&quot; and even &quot;reinvestigation&quot;. &quot;Fresh de novo and\nreinvestigation&quot; are synonymous expressions and\ntheir result in law would be the same.

The prosecution filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 311</a> of the\n\nCrPC for DNA test of the accused at the stage when the evidence of\n\nprosecution is at the verge of completion. Neither the investigation\n\nwas defective nor lacking. The Investigating Officer had not come\n\nacross any additional, more or supplemental material. There was no\n\nsubsequent disclosure or discovery of any new or additional material\n\nwhatsoever. By filing the application, the prosecution was only trying\n\nto bring additional evidence. In the peculiar facts and circumstances\n\nof this case, this Court is of the view that the impugned order of\n\ndismissal of application praying for DNA test at this advance stage of\n\ntrial should not be permitted when the additional evidence is not\n\nrequired for the final conclusion of the proceedings. Even the sole\n\nevidence of prosecutrix is sufficient to convict a person, if found\n\nguilty without reasonable doubt. The flavour of the present case is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                           18</span>\n\n\n\n\n           criminal act punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/105503/\" id=\"a_39\">417</a> of the Indian Penal\n\n           Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">           28.

It was a case where in a family dispute, the paternity of a\n\n           child was disputed. The State Commission for Women, Orissa issued\n\n           orders directing DNA test of a child.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue\n                     before the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely\n                     delicate and sensitive aspect. One view is that when\n                     modern science gives the means of ascertaining the\n                     paternity of a child, there should not be any\n                     hesitation to use those means whenever the occasion\n                     requires. The other view is that the court must be\n                     reluctant in the use of such scientific advances and\n                     tools which result in invasion of right to privacy of an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">8</span>\n    (2010) 8 SCC 633\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                           21</span>\n\n\n\n\n                    individual and may not only be prejudicial to the\n                    rights of the parties but may have devastating effect\n                    on the child.

The action must be\n\n            one that is pertinent and requisite in the light of the circumstances\n\n            that prevail to achieve the aim of the State.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            Proportionality: The parameter of proportionality shall be fulfilled on\n\n            the establishment of a rational nexus between the objects and the\n\n            means adopted to achieve them.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">            37.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169684843\" id=\"span_39\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/169684843/\" id=\"a_48\">Ashok Kumar v.
