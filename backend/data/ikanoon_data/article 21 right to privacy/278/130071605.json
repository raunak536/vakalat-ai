While, it is claimed by the plaintiff in CS No.163 of 2019\n\n                     that the respondents are linking his name with various Contractors claiming\n\n                     that they are either his henchmen or benamies and he along with the said\n\n                     contractors have been indulging in acts of corruption, thereby causing loss\n\n                     to the ex-chequer, it is the case of the Contractors/plaintiffs in other suits\n\n                     that they have nothing to do with the plaintiff in CS No.163 of 2019. They\n\n                     are doing business as reputed contractors doing Government works for\n\n                     several decades and the false claims made by the respondents linking them\n\n                     to the plaintiff in CS No.163 of 2019 and accusing them of Corruption had\n\n                     damaged their reputation entailing them to damages.

As held in WIC Radio, freewheeling debate on\n\n                          matters of public interest is to be encouraged, and must\n\n                          not be thwarted by “overly solicitous regard for personal\n\n                          reputation” (para. 2). Productive debate is dependent on\n\n                          the free flow of information.
