All the sentences were ordered to run\n       concurrently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.     Brief facts of the case, as noticed by the learned Trial Court, are as\n       under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                &quot;(i) The case of the prosecution is that on 7.9.94\n                Inspector Prithvi Singh, Inspector Raj Mohinder Singh\n                alongwith ACP were called at the office of DCP Crime\n                Branch. There DCP Crime Branch instructed them to\n                meet one Sh. Nand Kishore Taneja at premises No. 148\n                Preet Vihar and proceed with the case if the facts reveal\n                the commission of a cognizable offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                (ii) These officers reached at the said house. There\n                they recorded the statements of prosecutrix.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                (iii) She stated that she was residing at the aforesaid\n                address alongwith her parents and is doing a course of\n                interior designing at South Delhi Polytechnique. As a\n                routine she comes upto Laxmi Nagar in a rickshaw and\n                from there she took U-Spl. for South Extension. She\n                developed intimacy with one Parveen who was residing\n                at premises No. A-137 Preet Vihar. One day said\n                Parveen took her to Connaught Place on the house of his\n                friend Bittoo. Then Parveen committed rape upon her\n                after threatening her. Bittoo, friend of Parveen had\n                also sexual intercourse with her against her consent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">                Parveen took her photograph while Bittoo was\n                committing rape upon her. However, she came to know\n                about it.     Later on when Parveen showed her\n                photograph to her on the same day, she became very\n                much scared and asked Parveen to return photograph.\n                Upon this, Parveen replied that only he knew about this\n                secret and Bittoo was his friend.        Parveen also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl. Appeal Nos. 660/1999, 661/1999, 677/1999, 678/1999 &amp; 692/1999   Page 3 of 47</span>\n                promised to marry her at the earliest. So, she did not\n               disclosed this fact to anybody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">               (iv) Thereafter accused Parveen had been blackmailing\n               her. Parveen had been telephoning her and that is why\n               she had been meeting him openly. In the first week of\n               April, 94, Parveen took her to under-construction flats of\n               a Society near Patparganj Depot after alluring and\n               threatening her. There Sunil, Anil Rawat @ Anni,\n               Bittoo and one more boy (whom she did not know but can\n               identify him) met her and had sexual intercourse with her\n               against her consent. Those boys placed the negative of\n               thesaid photograph before her and told her that if she\n               wants the said negative back, she had to succumb to their\n               advances. Even after committing rape, these persons\n               did not return the negative to the complainant. When\n               she asked for it, they threatened to kill her brother.\n               Hence, she did not disclose anything at her house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">               (v) On 17.7.94 Parveen called her, on the pretext of\n               returning the negative to her, at Coffee House. Parveen\n               took her on his motor cycle to Noida i.e. in an office in an\n               under construction building. There Anil Rawat @ Anni,\n               Bittoo and Sunil were already present. All these boys\n               committed rape upon her. During the rape, two of the\n               boys had caught her. She dis-engaged herself and\n               started crying. Parveen became scared and made the\n               other boys to stop this. She came to her house in a bus.\n               She was threatened that her brother will be killed.\n               Parveen had been threatening on telephone that he will\n               get made the poster of her photograph and get the same\n               sticked at South Extension and near her house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">               (vi) On 5.9.97 Parveen met her at Bengal Sweets, South\n               Extension and compelled her to accompany him after\n               showing her the said photograph. Parveen sweared\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl. Appeal Nos. 660/1999, 661/1999, 677/1999, 678/1999 &amp; 692/1999   Page 4 of 47</span>\n                that this time he will return the photograph and negative\n               to her and they will not do anything with her. So, she\n               had to accompany Parveen. Parveen took her in an\n               office at second floor of a building at Darya Ganj.\n               There a revolver and an open knife were lying on the\n               table. There, Rohit and one more boy (whom she could\n               identify and who was the owner of the office) were\n               already present. Parveen told her that this was the last\n               time and they shall not trouble her again and they would\n               return her photograph and negative. Then all these\n               three boys committed rape upon her turn by turn and told\n               her that in the evening her photograph and negative will\n               be returned. Complainant threatened to commit suicide\n               in case her negative and photograph are not returned.\n               Parveen sweared that at that time he had no photograph\n               and negative with him and shall return the same at 7.30\n               PM near Universal Public School. So, at the appointed\n               time she reached there. There Parveen showed her\n               photograph and negative and compelled her to have sex\n               with him and one Balli @ Pappu (who was already there)\n               Parveen also committed rape upon her. Still, Parveen\n               did not return the photograph and negative to her. Both\n               of them left the said place on motor cycle threatening\n               that they will spoil her brother and sisters. She was so\n               scared that she did not tell all this episode. As she was\n               scared and weeping in the night, her mother asked her\n               the reason for the same.           As her mother asked\n               repeatedly, she told everything to her. Her mother\n               conveyed the same to her father. She could identify all\n               those places where she was raped.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">               (vii) Upon the statement of the prosecutrix a case U/s\n               506/342/376/34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">IPC</a> was registered.

He also stated that FIR against them\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.

Moreover, he came to know the appellant\n       Parveen in June, 1994, when he came to his workshop for getting his\n       scooter repaired.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">               Appellant Ajay Kumar also pleaded innocence and stated that\n       he had been falsely implicated in this case by the prosecutrix and her\n       parents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">               Appellant Balbir Singh pleaded innocence. He stated that on\n       09.09.94 at about 5/6 a.m., he was going to Sanjay Lake along with\n       his friend for a morning walk and a car came there in which four\n       persons were seated. They enquired from him about Flat No. 561,\n       Mayur Vihar and he showed his ignorance on which they started\n       abusing him and some altercation took place. One person alighted\n       from the car and caught him by his collar and forcibly push him inside\n       the car. Thereafter, they went to the house of Parveen from where he\n       was also lifted and ultimately brought to Police Station              Adarsh\n       Nagar and falsely implicated in this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">               Appellant Anil Rawat stated that before the registration of this\n       case, prosecutrix was residing in his neighbourhood at Mangal Bazar,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Crl.

Appellant Ajay Singh expired during the pendency of the appeal\n       therefore his appeal stands abated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">5.     Mr. Vikas Pahwa, Senior Advocate appearing for appellant Parveen\n       Kumar has assailed the impugned judgment on several counts being\n       that the prosecutrix was an unchaste woman, having illicit relationship\n       with many boys and the court below erred in not appreciating properly\n       the evidence of the defence witnesses examined by the appellant.\n       Elaborating his arguments, Mr. Pahwa contends that the prosecutrix\n       had been confronted on large number of issues/facts with her\n       statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 161</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure\n       and embellishments/improvements are of such a large magnitude that\n       her statement itself becomes unreliable. It is further argued that the\n       sole testimony of prosecutrix is totally unreliable as well as full of\n       material contradictions, concealment, improvements, exaggerations,\n       inconsistencies and thereby does not inspire confidence and creates a\n       genuine doubt about her version.

In our considered opinion, the &#x27;sterling\n               witness&#x27; should be of a very high quality and caliber\n               whose version should, therefore, be unassailable.

To test the quality of such a witness,\n               the status of the witness would be immaterial and\n               what would be relevant is the truthfulness of the\n               statement made by such a witness. What would be\n               more relevant would be the consistency of the\n               statement right from the starting point till the end,\n               namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial\n               statement and ultimately before the Court. It should\n               be natural and consistent with the case of the\n               prosecution qua the accused. There should not be any\n               prevarication in the version of such a witness. The\n               witness should be in a position to withstand the\n               cross-examination of any length and strenuous it may\n               be and under no circumstance should give room for\n               any doubt as to the factum of the occurrence, the\n               persons involved, as well as, the sequence of it.

Only if the version of\n               such a witness qualifies the above test as well as all\n               other similar such tests to be applied, it can be held\n               that such a witness can be called as a &#x27;sterling\n               witness&#x27; whose version can be accepted by the Court\n               without any corroboration and based on which the\n               guilty can be punished. To be more precise, the\n               version of the said witness on the core spectrum of the\n               crime should remain intact while all other attendant\n               materials, namely, oral, documentary and material\n               objects should match the said version in material\n               particulars in order to enable the Court trying the\n               offence to rely on the core version to sieve the other\n               supporting materials for holding the offender guilty of\n               the charge alleged.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1887316\" id=\"span_10\">Reliance has also been placed on <a href=\"/doc/1887316/\" id=\"a_12\">Krishan Kumar Malik Vs.

We do not have the slightest hesitation in\n               accepting the broad submission of Mr. Jain that the\n               conviction can be based on the sole testimony of the\n               prosecutrix, if found to be worthy of credence and\n               reliable and for that no corroboration is required. It\n               has often been said that oral testimony can be\n               classified into three categories, namely (i) wholly\n               reliable, (ii) wholly unreliable and (iii) neither wholly\n               reliable nor wholly unreliable. In case of wholly\n               reliable testimony of a single witness, the conviction\n               can be founded without corroboration. This principle\n               applies with greater vigour in case the nature of\n               offence is such that it is committed in seclusion. In\n               case prosecution is based on wholly unreliable\n               testimony of a single witness, the court has no option\n               than to acquit the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               9. In the background of the aforesaid legal position,\n               when we consider the case in hand we are of the\n               opinion that the statement of the prosecutrix is not at\n               all reliable or in other words wholly unreliable. No\n               other evidence has been led to support the allegation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Crl.

Hence, it shall be unsafe to base the\n               conviction on her sole testimony. In her evidence she\n               had stated that she was subjected to rape at 12.00\n               noon when her sister Jitendra, the wife of the accused\n               had gone to purchase milk. However, during the\n               course of investigation she alleged that she was\n               subjected to rape at 06.30 A.M. When confronted with\n               the aforesaid contradiction in the cross-examination,\n               she could not explain the aforesaid discrepancy. Her\n               statement that she shouted for help when she was\n               subjected to rape also does not find support from the\n               evidence of Ramchandra Salvi (PW-11), the owner of\n               the house where the incident is alleged to have taken\n               place. Dr. Smt. Sushila (PW-12), has also not\n               supported the allegation of rape as also the Forensic\n               Science Laboratory Report. In the face of what we\n               have observed above, the evidence of the prosecutrix\n               cannot be said to be wholly reliable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">6.     Secondly, Mr. Pahwa contended that there was delay in registration of\n       FIR, which was registered on 07.09.1994 whereas the alleged first\n       incident took place in January, 1994.                         It is argued that the\n       unexplained inordinate delay of nine months in registration of\n       the FIR raises a grave doubt in the highly belated version of the\n       prosecutrix and the possibility of false implication cannot be ruled\n       out.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"684086\" id=\"span_14\">In support of his contention, Mr. Pahwa relied upon <a href=\"/doc/684086/\" id=\"a_17\">Surjan\n       and Others Vs.

In a case where\n               six indicated persons should be visited with a\n               minimum sentence of 10 years&#x27; RI, the Court\n               cannot afford to act on the uncorroborated\n               testimony of the prosecutrix unless the said\n               evidence is wholly reliable. When looked at the\n               testimony of PW1 from all the different angles\n               highlighted above, we are unable to hold that has\n               testimony is wholly reliable. In such a situation,\n               materials for corroborating the testimony of PW1\n               could not be obviated. But unfortunately there is\n               none.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">        In the case of Ram Dass and Others Vs.

Thirdly, Mr. Pahwa contended that the allegation made by the\n       prosecutrix       has     been     shattered       and        have   fallen   flat      by\n       the medical evidence which clearly indicates that there was no sign\n       of external injury on the body of the prosecutrix.                       It is further\n       contended that where the oral evidence of the prosecutrix is not\n       supported by the medical evidence, moreover it is dangerous to punish\n       the accused for rape solely on the basis of her oral evidence.                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1113057\" id=\"span_16\">In\n       support of his contention, counsel relied upon the case of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Crl.

Another aspect of the matter is that where\n               there has been any real resistance there is bound\n               to be local injury and marks of violence on the\n               body and the limbs of the victim. Taylor in his\n               book Principles and Practice of Medical\n               Jurisprudence, Vol. II, observes thus at p. 64:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">               Nevertheless, it is most likely that when there has\n               been some real resistance, local injury will be\n               apparent and probably also marks of violence on\n               the body and limbs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               Although according to the prosecutrix, three\n               persons raped her with great force and violence\n               resulting in great pain to her and her breasts\n               becoming swollen and red and other injuries, yet\n               when she was examined by the Doctor P.W. 8 only\n               after 16 to 17 hours of the occurrence, the Doctor\n               found no marks of injuries on her body at all. In\n               this connection P.W. .&amp; has categorically stated\n               thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               I examined her (P.W. 1) at 5-15 p. m. on\n               20-4-1972.

The learned Sessions Judge, with\n               whom the High Court has agreed, seems to have\n               brushed aside this important circumstance on the\n               ground that as the prosecutrix was examined by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.

M\n               about 17 hours after the occurrence injuries may\n               have disappeared and has relied on an observation\n               of Taylor at p. 66 of his book which runs as\n               follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">               Injuries from rape may soon disappear or become\n               obscure, especially in women who have been used\n               to sexual intercourse.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">               The Sessions Judge explained that as the\n               prosecutrix was habituated to sexual intercourse\n               injuries may have disappeared. While referring to\n               one part of the observation of Taylor, the learned\n               Sessions Judge has completely lost sight of the\n               other part which explains the real issue and which\n               runs thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">               After 3 or 4 days, unless there has been unusual\n               degree of violence, no traces may be found. Where\n               there has been much violence, the signs may of\n               course persist longer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">               Thus, if such a serious violence was caused to the\n               prosecutrix by the appellants, the injuries are not\n               likely to have disappeared before 2 or 3 days and\n               the signs were bound to persist at least when she\n               was examined by the Doctor. The absence of\n               injuries on the person of the appellants as also on\n               the person of the prosecutrix is yet another factor\n               to negative the allegation of rape and to show that\n               the appellants had sexual intercourse with the\n               prosecutrix with her tacit consent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">8.     Another contention raised by the counsel for the appellant is that as\n       per the case of the prosecution, the appellant used to blackmail and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Crl.

This does not inspire confidence and\n       truthfulness as the alleged photograph does not show the face of the\n       prosecutrix and thus there was no apprehension of same being\n       misused.       Moreso, the prosecution in her deposition has given\n       different versions about the first incident when she came to know\n       about the alleged photograph for the first time. Further, the fact that\n       the negative was available with the photograph the original is in\n       doubt. It is alleged that in fact the negative was prepared from the\n       photograph in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">9.     It is next argued by the counsel that the presence and identity of the\n       girl and the appellant Bittoo in the alleged photograph is highly\n       doubtful as the face of the girl in the alleged photograph is covered\n       with her hands whereas the person in the alleged photograph has\n       been observed as appellant Bittoo from his hairstyle by the learned\n       Trial Court and the same is totally bad in law and outside the purview\n       of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_19\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> and the appellants could not have\n       been convicted in the absence of proper identification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">10.    The Counsel further argued that it is an admitted case of the\n       prosecution that the prosecutrix had an affair with the appellant\n       Parveen from 1989 to January, 1994. However, when the appellant\n       Parveen refused to accept the marriage proposal of the prosecutrix as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Crl.

So, the courts should\n               deal with such cases sternly and severely.

It is a serious blow to her supreme\n               honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity as\n               well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where\n               the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it\n               leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not\n               only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar\n               on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her\n               dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not\n               only an offence against the person of a woman, rather\n               a crime against the entire society. It is a crime against\n               basic human rights and also violates the most\n               cherished fundamental right guaranteed under\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">18.

Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies should not be a\n       ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case.\n       A prosecutrix complaining of having been a victim of the offence of\n       rape is not an accomplice after the crime. Her testimony has to be\n       appreciated on the principle of probabilities just as the testimony of\n       any other witness; a high degree of probability having been shown to\n       exist in view of the subject matter being a criminal charge.

Prosecution has failed to\n       adduce any material/evidence on record in support of her aforesaid\n       claim.

There is no rule of\n               law that her testimony cannot be acted upon without\n               corroboration in material particulars.

In view of the above, the reports of doctors, who have conducted\n       medical examination of the prosecutrix as well as the CFSL report do\n       not co-relate the version alleged and thus the prosecution has failed to\n       discharge its onus to prove the rape on the prosecutrix.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">       Authenticity of Photograph and negative\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">37.

From his curly hairs, size of head\n                       and the structure, he can clearly be recognized in the\n                       photograph despite the fact that only his back is shown\n                       in the photograph.

It is urged on behalf of the appellants and the other respective counsel\n       that the FIR in the present case has been lodged at a very belated\n       stage i.e. on 07.09.1994, after about 9 months of the alleged incident\n       which took place in January 1994. The delay has to be considered in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">Crl.

It is well settled that the delay in\n       registering the FIR cannot be a ground to doubt the case of the\n       prosecution. In cases of delay, the Courts are required to examine\n       the evidence with a close scrutiny and in doing so; the contents of\n       the FIR should also be scrutinized more carefully. If Court finds that\n       there is no indication of fabrication or it has not been concocted or\n       engineered to implicate innocent persons then, even if there is\n       a delay in lodging the FIR, the case of the prosecution cannot be\n       dismissed merely on that ground. The disinclination to inform the\n       family or report the matter to the police might be due to apprehension\n       and attitude of the society towards the victim. Therefore, the delay\n       in lodging the complaint in such cases does not necessarily indicate\n       that her version is false.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_73\">41.    In the present case, a series of rape committed on the prosecutrix\n       which had started from January, 1994 and ended on 05.09.1994. In\n       fact the prosecutrix was known to the appellant Parveen since 1989\n       and was having friendly relation with him and they used to meet on\n       their way to school and also in the park. The prosecutrix as per her\n       own Statment kept on meeting the appellant Parveen despite the\n       opposition of her father. The prosecutrix alleged that during their\n       friendship Parveen first raped her in January 1994 when she was\n       served a cold drink, after consuming it she became unconscious and\n       thereafter Parveen allowed his friend Bittoo to rape her and she was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Crl.

Finally, she disclosed this unfortunate story to her\n       mother who further informed the same to complainant who got the\n       FIR registered on 07.09.1994. The inordinate delay in registering\n       the FIR casts a cloud of suspicion regarding credibility of the\n       prosecution story when read with the testimony of prosecutrix,\n       medical evidence and all other evidence led by the prosecution. The\n       inordinate delay in registration of FIR and the time and opportunities\n       which the prosecutrix had, to report the matter to the police or any\n       other person by raising an alarm when she was forced to undergo the\n       trauma of rape is unexplainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">       Non-examination of IO and malafide investigation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_75\">42.    Mr. Pahwa, Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant Parveen and\n       other counsel for other appellants have vehemently argued that the\n       Investigating Officer Prithvi Singh has not stepped in the witness-box\n       nor put to the test of cross examination and the prosecution has\n       withheld the testimony of the most vital witness which has caused\n       great prejudice to the appellants and his non examination is fatal to\n       the case of prosecution.            It is well settled law that the appellants\n       can be convicted on the basis of sole testimony of the prosecutrix, if\n       found to be worthy of credence and reliable and for that no\n       corroboration is required.              The prosecution explained that the\n       Investigating Officer had not been examined as he has sustained\n       injuries in his backbone and there was no likelihood of his recovery\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Crl.

Even\n       otherwise, Investigating Officer is not a material witness for the\n       purpose of establishing whether the appellants committed the offence\n       for which they have been charged. Hence, non-examination of\n       the Investigating Officer in the present case is inconsequential.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">       Malafide investigation\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">43.    It has been strongly urged that the investigation in the present case is\n       not fair but tainted as the same was under the direction of an very\n       influential person who was a neighbour of the Grandfather of\n       prosecutrix. From the material available on record, it is clear that\n       the prosecutrix as well as Appellant Parveen were residents of same\n       vicinity and the FIR was registered at Police Station, Preet Vihar.\n       PW-3, ASI V.S. Nagar has testified that on 07.09.1994, Inspector\n       Prithvi Singh gave him a „Tehrir‟ which was taken by him to the\n       police station, Preet Vihar and thereafter FIR was registered in police\n       station, Preet Vihar on the same day.                  PW7 HC Rakesh Kumar\n       deposed in his statement that from 07.09.1994 he was a part of\n       investigation team in the instant case.              Though, there is nothing on\n       record to suggest that the investigation was primarily conducted by\n       Delhi Police and thereafter transferred to Crime Branch the same is\n       evident from the testimonies of PW3 and PW7 that the FIR was\n       registered in police station, Preet Vihar but from the inception i.e.\n       from 07.09.1994, the case was formally in the hands of Investigating\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">Crl.

This fact has also been recorded by learned Trial Court that\n       on 07.09.1994, DCP, Crime Branch called the ACP along with\n       Inspector Prithvi Singh, Inspector Raj Mohinder Singh of the Crime\n       Branch in his office and instructed them to act on the complaint made\n       by father of the prosecutrix without delay. Keeping in view the\n       above material, we are of the opinion that the contention of learned\n       counsel for the appellants with regard to influenced investigation\n       cannot be ruled out.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">       False implication\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\">44.    The main thrust of argument as raised by Mr. Pahwa, learned Senior\n       Counsel for appellant Parveen along with counsel for other appellants\n       is that it is a false case in which Parveen and his friends were falsely\n       implicated by the prosecutrix as the relationship between her and\n       Parveen had turned sour when he came to know that prosecutrix was\n       of easy virtue and was friendly with many other boys and refused to\n       marry her bringing to an end the five years long relationship. It is\n       further contended that thereafter, with the help of an influential\n       person a false FIR was got registered and an objectionable\n       photograph and negative, alleged to be that of prosecutrix with one of\n       the appellant namely Bittoo, wherein the faces are not visible was\n       planted by the Investigating Agency to implicate the appellants. It is\n       argued that the testimony of the prosecutrix is not creditworthy and\n       she cannot be called as a sterling witness whose version can be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Crl.

The version of the\n       said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should remain intact\n       while all other attendant materials, namely, oral, documentary and\n       material objects should match the said version in material particulars in\n       order to enable the Court trying the offence to rely on the core version\n       to sieve the other supporting materials for holding the offender guilty\n       of the charge alleged. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120726166\" id=\"span_60\">In <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_40\">Rai Sandeep @ Deepu Vs State of NCT of\n       Delhi</a> : (2012) 8 SCC 21, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held that .</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">               &quot;To test the quality of such a witness, the status of the\n               witness would be immaterial and what would be\n               relevant is the truthfulness of the statement made by\n               such a witness. What would be more relevant would be\n               the consistency of the statement right from the starting\n               point till the end, namely, at the time when the witness\n               makes the initial statement and ultimately before the\n               Court. It should be natural and consistent with the case\n               of the prosecution qua the accused. There should not be\n               any prevarication in the version of such a witness. The\n               witness should be in a position to withstand the\n               cross-examination of any length and strenuous it may\n               be and under no circumstance should give room for any\n               doubt as to the factum of the occurrence, the persons\n               involved, as well as, the sequence of it.

The said\n               version should consistently match with the version of\n               every other witness. It can even be stated that it should\n               be akin to the test applied in the case of circumstantial\n               evidence where there should not be any missing link in\n               the chain of circumstances to hold the accused guilty of\n               the offence alleged against him.

There have\n               also been rare instances where a person has persuaded\n               a gullible or obedient daughter to make a false charge\n               of a rape either to take revenge or extort money or to\n               get rid of financial liability. Whether there was rape or\n               not would depend ultimately on the facts and\n               circumstances of each case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195453\" id=\"span_69\">and in <a href=\"/doc/195453/\" id=\"a_47\">Abbas Ahmed Choudhary Vs.

State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (2008) 15 SCC 133, the Hon&#x27;ble\n       Supreme Court has held that testimony of the victim of a rape cannot\n       be presumed to be a gospel truth and observed that false allegations of\n       rape can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused\n       as well, in para 11, the supreme Court echoed the sentiments as\n       under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">               &quot;11. It cannot be lost sight of that rape causes the\n               greatest distress and humiliation to the victim but at the\n               same time a false allegation of rape can cause equal\n               distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as\n               well. The accused must also be protected against the\n               possibility of false implication, particularly where a\n               large number of accused are involved. It must, further,\n               be borne in mind that the broad principle is that an\n               injured witness was present at the time when the\n               incident happened and that ordinarily such a witness\n               would not tell a lie as to the actual assailants, but there\n               is no presumption or any basis for assuming that the\n               statement of such a witness is always correct or without\n               any embellishment or exaggeration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">49.    Keeping in mind the above cited judgments, the testimony of\n       prosecutrix has to be consistent and natural in line with the case of\n       the prosecution and free from infirmities which inspire confidence in\n       the Court.         It cannot be presumed that the statement of the\n       prosecutrix is always true or without any embellishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">50.    In the instant case, the testimony of the prosecutrix is not natural and\n       consistent with the case of the prosecution.                  Her version has no\n       correlation with other supporting material being medical, scientific\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">Crl.

After rescanning the entire case in its right\n       perspective, we are of the firm view if the evidence of\n       the prosecutrix is read and considered in totality of the circumstances\n       alongwith the other evidence on record, in which the offence is\n       alleged to have been committed, we are of the view that her\n       deposition does not inspire confidence.                       The version of the\n       prosecutrix has not been corroborated with medical evidence and has\n       not disclosed the true genesis of the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">51.    In view of the above discussion, there is no scope to sustain\n       conviction and sentence imposed on the appellants, resultantly,\n       these appeals succeed and are hereby allowed.
