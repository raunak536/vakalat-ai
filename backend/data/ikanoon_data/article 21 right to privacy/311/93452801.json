This is for the reason that once a\n                                     matter becomes a matter of public record, the right\n                                     to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\n                                     legitimate subject for comment by press and media\n                                     among others.

In the case of public officials, it is\n                               obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\n                               remedy of action for damages is simply not\n                               available with respect to their acts and conduct\n                               relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This\n                               is so even where the publication is based upon facts\n                               and statements which are not true, unless the official\n                               establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                               defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such\n                               a case, it would be enough for the defendant\n                               (member of the press or media) to prove that he\n                               acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it\n                               is not necessary for him to prove that what he has\n                               written is true. Of course, where the publication is\n                               proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n                               personal animosity, the defendant would have no\n                               defence and would be liable for damages. It is\n                               equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the\n                               discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the\n                               same protection as any other citizen, as explained in\n                               (1) and (2) above.

In fact, upon watching the programme on the\n\n                           compact disk, it appears that the news anchors were at\n\n                           pains to emphasize the fact that their source of\n\n                           information is the letter in question and they go on\n\n                           repeatedly    telling    the     viewers     about       the\n\n                           charges/allegations with each caption carrying question\n\n                           mark(?) at its end, thereby conveying to the viewers that\n\n                           the allegations/charges contained in the letter are yet to\n\n                           be established.

In this view of the\n\n                           matter, it cannot be stated that the accused intended to\n\n                           harm the reputation of the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">                           33) The next question that arises for consideration is as\n\n                           to whether reporting of allegations levelled by a senior\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">2021.10.13 13:42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">integrity of this document</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                      24                  CRMC No.58/2019</span>\n\n\n\n\n                           office bearer of a Public Sector Corporation against a\n\n                           Minister touching the public duties of the said Minister\n\n                           would amount to offence of defamation. The answer to this\n\n                           question has to be in negative. This is so because\n\n                           categorizing as defamation, the publication of allegations/\n\n                           charges concerning      public duties of public figure\n\n                           recorded in a letter which is in public domain, would be\n\n                           an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of press\n\n                           guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572071\" id=\"span_129\">34) As already noted, in <a href=\"/doc/572071/\" id=\"a_44\">R. Rajagopal</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the\n\n                           Supreme Court has clearly emphasized that once a matter\n\n                           becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no\n\n                           longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for\n\n                           comment by press and media among others. The Court\n\n                           has further observed that publication of the matters\n\n                           relating to conduct relevant to the discharge of official\n\n                           functions of a public figure is not defamation. Therefore,\n\n                           on the touchstone of the broad principles enunciated by\n\n                           the Supreme Court in the aforenoted case, the reporting of\n\n                           contents of    letter written by Shri Khalid Jahangir\n\n                           touching the official functioning of the department that\n\n                           was under the Ministry headed by the complainant, would\n\n                           not amount to offence of defamation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">2021.10.13 13:42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">integrity of this document</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                                                       25                   CRMC No.58/2019</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">                           35) There is yet another aspect of the matter which\n\n                           deserve to be noticed. The complainant/respondent in his\n\n                           complaint has admitted that the news item based upon\n\n                           letter of Shri Khalid Jahangir was published by certain\n\n                           other newspapers. One of the newspapers, Daily Early\n\n                           Times, has published the news item on the basis of the\n\n                           letter in question on the same day when the programme\n\n                           was telecast by the channel of petitioners. Certain other\n\n                           newspaper like Tribune etc. have also published the news\n\n                           item based upon the aforesaid letter, which is clearly\n\n                           mentioned by the respondent in his complaint. In fact, the\n\n                           complainant has been fair enough not only to state these\n\n                           facts in his complaint but he has also annexed these news\n\n                           clippings along with the complaint. So, it is not a case\n\n                           where the allegations against the respondent have\n\n                           emanated from petitioners. It is a case where petitioners\n\n                           in their capacity of anchors and reporters of news channel\n\n                           have disseminated whatever was already in public domain\n\n                           in the form of letter of Shri Khalid Jahangir\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1998416\" id=\"span_135\">36) In somewhat similar circumstances, the Supreme\n\n                           Court in the case of    <a href=\"/doc/1998416/\" id=\"a_45\">Jawaharlal Darda and others v.\n\n                           Manoharrao Ganpatrao Kapsikar and another</a>, AIR\n\n                           1998 SC 2117, quashed the prosecution against Chief\n\n                           Editor, Editor and Executive Editor of a newspaper who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">MOHAMMAD ALTAF BHAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">2021.10.13 13:42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">integrity of this document</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                                         26                       CRMC No.58/2019</span>\n\n\n\n\n                           had published a news item regarding happenings that had\n\n                           taken place during a debate in the Assembly.

The complaint in that behalf\n                                     was filed by the complainant on 2.2.87. The news\n                                     item merely disclosed what happened during the\n                                     debate which took place in the Assembly on\n                                     13.12.83.

When questioned further about the names of\n                                     persons involved, he had stated the names of five\n                                     person, including that of the complainant.

He has to examine the\n                                      nature of allegations made in the complaint and the\n                                      evidence both oral and documentary in support\n                                      thereof and would that be sufficient for the\n                                      complainant to succeed in bringing charge home to\n                                      the accused.
