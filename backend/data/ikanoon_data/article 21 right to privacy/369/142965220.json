Per contra, Mr. S.R.Rajagopal, learned Addl.

It is the further submission of the learned Addl.

It is the further contention of the learned Addl.

It is further submitted that the criminal prosecution should be\n\n                      allowed to go through to its logical conclusion and this Court should not, at this\n\n                      stage, interfere with the said prosecution, more especially by invoking its\n\n                      inherent powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and, if at all the petitioners\n\n                      are aggrieved, they ought to have approached this Court under the relevant\n\n                      provision of law by filing appropriate petitions and not invoking the inherent\n\n                      jurisdiction of this Court.

The principles as regards reasonable restriction as has\n                                 been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\n                                 restriction should not be excessive and in public interest.

It\n                              would depend upon the nature of the right which has been\n                              infringed or sought to be infringed. The ultimate “impact”, that\n                              is, effect on the right has to be determined. The “impact\n                              doctrine” or the principle of “inevitable effect” or “inevitable\n                              consequence” stands in contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a\n                              legislation or a statutory provision depending upon the\n                              circumstances of the case. The prevailing conditions of the time\n                              and the principles of proportionality of restraint are to be kept in\n                              mind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a\n                              provision regard being had to the nature of the right. The nature\n                              of social control which includes public interest has a role. The\n                              conception of social interest has to be borne in mind while\n                              considering reasonableness of the restriction imposed on a right.\n                              The social interest principle would include the felt needs of the\n                              society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                                     *       *       *      *       *       *       *       *\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                                 131. As the submissions would show, the stress is given on the\n                              right to freedom of speech and expression in the context of\n                              individual growth, progress of democracy, conceptual respect for\n                              a voice of dissent, tolerance for discordant note and acceptance\n                              of different voices. Right to say what may displease or annoy\n                              others cannot be throttled or garrotted. There can never be any\n                              cavil over the fact that the right to freedom of speech and\n                              expression is a right that has to get ascendance in a democratic\n                              body polity, but at the same time the limit has to be\n                              proportionate and not unlimited. It is urged that the defamation\n                              has been described as an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 499</a> IPC that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                      22/38</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                             ___________________\n                                                                                  W.P.

The\n                                  argument is that to give a remedy by taking recourse to criminal\n                                  jurisprudence to curb the constitutional right, that is, right to\n                                  freedom of speech and expression, is neither permissible nor\n                                  justified. The provision possibly could have met the constitutional\n                                  requirement had it been associated with law and order or breach\n                                  of peace but the same is not the position. It is also canvassed\n                                  that in the colonial era the defamation was conceived of to keep\n                                  social peace and social order but with the changing climate of\n                                  growing democracy, it is not permissible to keep alive such a\n                                  restriction.”\n                                                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                              24.

In the\n                              case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n                              matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not available\n                              with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge\n                              of their official duties. This is so even where the publication is\n                              based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless the\n                              official establishes that the publication was made (by the\n                              defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n                              would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                              media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of\n                              the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he has\n                              written is true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be\n                              false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                              defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n                              damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the\n                              discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n                              protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above.\n                              It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by the\n                              power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and\n                              legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_79\">Articles 105</a> and\n                              <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_80\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n                              exceptions to this rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                      27/38</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                            ___________________\n                                                                                 W.P.

In the case on hand, it is on record that the statements carried on in\n\n                      print by the petitioners are based on the statements made by Dr.Subramanian\n\n                      Swamy in the interview to the media. Therefore, what the media has carried are\n\n                      the views expressed by Dr.Subramanian Swamy.                Based on the principles\n\n                      enumerated by the Apex Court above, it is not necessary for the Press/Media to\n\n                      ascertain the truthfulness or the veracity of the statements made by\n\n                      Dr.Subramanian Swamy. Further, a careful analysis of the above statements and\n\n                      also the materials published in the print media based on the above interview\n\n                      shows that Dr.Swamy has made those statements in the course of his interview\n\n                      and further he has spoken about Dr.Jayalalithaa, as a person, who is trying to take\n\n                      credit for the work done by him and has in no way imputed any defamatory\n\n                      statements against the office of the said individual. <a href=\"/doc/822867/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 199 (2)</a> Cr.P.C. clearly\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                      28/38</span>\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\f                                                                                        ___________________\n                                                                             W.P.

Rather, even a bare reading of\n\n                      the Government Orders reveal that the Dr.Subramanian Swamy has stated that\n\n                      Dr.Jayalalithaa is making false propaganda as if the success has been achieved\n\n                      because of her efforts, though it was due to his efforts that success was achieved\n\n                      and the act of Dr.Jayalalithaa is for the purpose of enhancing her image in the\n\n                      Assembly Polls. The sum and substance of the above clearly reveal that the\n\n                      statements, which are alleged to be defamatory are not against any public\n\n                      function discharged by the said individual in her official capacity, but it is a\n\n                      criticism levelled against Dr.Jayalalithaa in her personal capacity. The print media\n\n                      has carried the statements made by Dr.Swamy. The petitioners have not imputed\n\n                      any allegations or made false accusations against Dr.Jayalalithaa nor against the\n\n                      public office held by the individual.
