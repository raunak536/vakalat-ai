This writ petition is filed challenging the decision of the\n\nSub Divisional Police Officer, Sirsilla, dated 14.07.2020 granting\n\npermission to the Inspector of Police, Sirsilla Police station to open\n\na Rowdy Sheet against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">3.      From the reading of the order of the Sub-Divisional Police\n\nOfficer, it is seen that from 2008 onwards, petitioner is involved in\n\n21 crimes and in 5 crimes allegation was of encroachment into\n\nland.    Petitioner also lodged 15 complaints between 2015 and\n\n2019. The order further discloses that petitioner started interfering\n\nin all civil disputes between parties and also in family disputes and\n\ncollecting money from the parties. He intervened and settled many\n\nland disputes forcibly and fraudulently.       The victims could not\n\ncome forward to complain against him fearing his violent and\n\nlitigant behavior. It is also alleged that there is every possibility of\n\nhe indulging in extortion and land settlements, therefore would\n\ncause breach of peace and tranquility in the limits of Sirsilla town.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.      Learned counsel for petitioner sought to contend that out of\n\n21 crimes stated to have been registered against the petitioner, he\n\nwas acquitted in 5 crimes and all other crimes are frivolous in\n\nnature and those crimes do not satisfy the requirements of Police\n\nStanding Order 601 to open Rowdy Sheet. She further contended\n\nthat opening of Rowdy Sheet and keeping surveillance amounts to\n                                                                             PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                               WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\n\n\ninfringing <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. As a citizen of\n\nthis country, petitioner is entitled to life, liberty and privacy and\n\nthis cannot be infringed upon without following due process of law.\n\nShe would therefore, submit that opening of Rowdy Sheet is\n\nex facie illegal, contrary to the settled principles of law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.    On the contrary, learned Assistant Government Pleader\n\njustified the decision to open the Rowdy Sheet. He would submit\n\nthat having regard to the fact that petitioner continues to involve in\n\ncrimes, it is a fit case to open Rowdy Sheet and to have continuous\n\nsurveillance on the activities of the petitioner, otherwise, innocent\n\ncitizen would suffer in his hands. He would further submit that as\n\nper Police Standing Order 601-B, if bound over orders are passed,\n\nRowdy Sheet can be opened. As can be seen from the statement in\n\nthe proceedings impugned in the writ petition, petitioner was\n\nbound over in four crimes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.    Enforcement of law and order is most important State\n\nfunction.   To enforce law and order State formed Police Force.\n\nEnforcement of law and order includes taking all preventive\n\nmeasures to ensure that no untoward incident happens and peace\n\nand tranquility is not affected.     To prevent breach of peace and\n\ntranquility, it is permissible for the police to take all measures\n\npossible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">7.    There are several persons who are known to be frequently\n\ninvolving in crimes. Such involvement can be on various aspects.\n\nBecause of frequent involvement in crimes, they pose threat to life,\n\nliberty and freedom of others and a greater challenge on police to\n\ncontrol such persons. In order to prevent such person indulging in\n                                                                        PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                          WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  4</span>\n\n\ncrimes, police may resort to keep a watch on him; in other words,\n\nto keep surveillance on him; to closely monitor his day today\n\nactivities and his movements.     No statutory provision prescribes\n\nsuch surveillance. Police Standing Orders are notified in exercise\n\nof executive power which deal with various aspects of functioning\n\nof the Police Officer. These standing orders also deal with keeping\n\nsurveillance on known criminals. For the purpose of keeping\n\nsurveillance, Police Standing Order 601 enables opening a Rowdy\n\nSheet in the concerned police station. After opening of rowdy sheet,\n\nclose surveillance is enforced on the concerned person.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">8.    Opening    of   Rowdy   Sheet   and    thereon   keeping       close\n\nsurveillance on the person would certainly infringe upon right to\n\nlife, liberty and privacy of the individual concerned. Right to life,\n\nliberty and privacy flows out of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Right to life and liberty are sacrosanct to any person.\n\nA person is entitled to lead his life with dignity and self respect and\n\ndoes not want an outsider to intrude in his private affairs and to\n\nprobe into his movements. Thus, there are two competing interests\n\non preventive measures. On the one side is right guaranteed by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, which is sacrosanct and on\n\nthe other side is the primacy of enforcement of law and order,\n\nmaintenance of peace and tranquility, which is the primary\n\nresponsibility of the State through its police force.      Compelling\n\npublic interest may require intrusion into privacy of a person.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">9.    Having regard to the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, when a rowdy sheet is opened, it is the\n\nbounden duty of the police to take due care and caution and resort\n                                                                                                PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                                  WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                   5</span>\n\n\nto       opening        of   rowdy       sheet     can     be    only     in    extraordinary\n\ncircumstances where such recourse is imminent to enforce peace\n\nand tranquility in the locality and to prevent happening of\n\nuntoward incident. When a citizen comes to the High Court\n\nalleging infringement of his right to life, liberty and privacy by\n\nopening a rowdy sheet, the Court can look into whether the\n\ndecision of the police to have a surveillance on the petitioner is\n\njustified and supported by the material on record or it was initiated\n\nonly to harass and humiliate the individual. It is to be noted that\n\nmere involvement in a crime may not per se require surveillance on\n\nthat person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">10.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1470089\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1470089/\" id=\"a_5\">Mohammed Quadeer and others Vs.

Opening of a rowdy sheet against a citizen is undoubtedly fraught with\n           serious consequences. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees\n           right to life with dignity and the right to live, as a dignified man, carries with\n           it the right to reputation. Right to reputation is an integral part of right to\n           life guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a>, and such a right cannot be deprived except in\n           accordance with the procedure established by law. Such laws which\n           authorise the Police to open rowdy sheets and exercise surveillance are\n           required to be very strictly construed. Opening of the rowdy sheets and\n           retention thereof except in accordance with law would amount to\n           infringement of fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the\n           Constitution of India. It is true that the State is duty bound at all levels to\n           protect the persons and property from the criminals and criminal activity.\n           Prevention of organised crime is an obligation on the part of the State.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           Right to Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           32. Fundamental rights and civil liberties exist and can only flourish in an\n           orderly society. Civil liberties and fundamental rights are intimately\n           connected with the nature and dynamics of the Society. It is the duty of the\n           Police to deal with crime and criminals expeditiously and effectively while at\n           the same time holding to the values and concepts of the fundamental rights\n           and the Constitution. Both the competing interests are to be reconciled. This\n           much is clear so far as our Constitutional system is concerned that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">1</span>\n    1999 (3) ALD 60\n                                                                                              PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                                WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                               6</span>\n\n\n        intrusion into personal liberty without an authority of law is forbidden.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">        Surveillance and watching of movements of a citizen by the Police is not a\n        matter of course. Such rights can be exercised by the Police only in\n        accordance with law which permits such surveillance. The action in this\n        regard which is in accordance with law may result in violation of the\n        fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n        Every citizen has fundamental right and entitled to indulge in harmless\n        activities without observation or interference. It is a right to be left alone.\n        The guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 8</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights that\n        &quot;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home\n        and has correspondence&quot; reflects both the individual&#x27;s psychological need to\n        preserve an intrusion-free zone of personality and family, and the anguish\n        and stress which can be suffered when that zone is violated. The saying that\n        &#x27;an Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&#x27; would be equally applicable to Indian\n        situation and it can be said that an &#x27;Indian citizen&#x27;s home is his castle.&#x27;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_11\">11.       Learned        single      Judge         of   this     Court         in     <a href=\"/doc/232602/\" id=\"a_11\">Sunkara\n\nSatyanarayana Vs State of Andhra Pradesh, Home Department</a>\n\nand others2, held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        &quot;23. Surveillance by the police makes very serious inroads into the life of a\n        person. It even grossly violates the right of persons to privacy. Obtrusive\n        surveillance does not leave a citizen alone. With the subtle methods of\n        telephone tapping, telescope watching, remote controlled audio and video\n        recording gadgets, a citizen subjected to surveillance can never have mental\n        peace and thus his life and liberty at every movement would be restricted. A\n        person with lot of restrictions cannot be expected to lead a dignified life and\n        exercise his right to liberty and other freedoms. A citizen&#x27;s life would become\n        miserable. Such a situation is worse than animal existence, For these\n        reasons can it be said that there is a &#x27;right&#x27; against surveillance?\n        ..... ....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        &quot;49. Therefore, in the context of police surveillance against history sheeters\n        and rowdy sheeters, the following principles vis-a-vis right to privacy under\n        <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution would emerge: (i) If the surveillance is not\n        obtrusive, the same does not violate the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of\n        the Constitution of India. The same does not either in material or palpable\n        form affect the right of the suspect to move freely nor can it be held to\n        deprive the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter of his personal liberty. (ii) In\n        testing whether fundamental right of free movement or personal liberty is\n        infringed or not, it is to be remembered that infringement should be direct as\n        well as tangible. If surveillance hurts personal sensitivities, the same is not a\n        violation, for the constitution makers never intended to protect mere\n        personal sensitiveness. (iii) If police surveillance is in accordance with\n        executive/departmental guidelines and not authorised by statute or rules\n        having statutory force, it is for the State to prove that surveillance does not\n        in anyway infringe the fundamental right of the person and that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">2</span>\n    1999 (6) ALT 249\n                                                                                             PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                               WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                               7</span>\n\n\n       authorities   have   followed   the   guidelines   scrupulously    in    ordering\n       surveillance, (iv) If the action of the police is found to infringe the freedoms\n       guaranteed to the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter and violates his right to\n       privacy, in that, the surveillance is excessively obtrusive and intrusive, it\n       may seriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to infringe the\n       fundamental right to privacy and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> as well as\n       the freedom of movement guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the\n       Constitution of India and the same is impermissible, (v) Even where there is\n       statutory sanction for surveillance against history sheeter/rowdy sheeter\n       principle (iv) is equally applicable, if the surveillance is obtrusive. (vi) In\n       either case-whether police regulations are statutory or where they have no\n       statutory force-there should be sufficient material to induce the opinion that\n       the history sheeters/rowdy sheeters show a determination to lead a life of\n       crime which involves public peace or security only. Mere convictions in\n       criminal cases where nothing imperils the safety of the society cannot be\n       regarded as warrange surveillance under the relevant regulations, however\n       broadly and in whatever language the regulation might have been couched,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (vii) In either case-whether the regulation is statutory or non-statutory-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">       domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should be reduced to the\n       clearest cases of danger to community security, and there can be no routine\n       follow-up at the end of a conviction or release from prison in every case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">       (viii) The above principles that emerge from various binding precedents\n       are only general principles. As seen from various decided cases of this\n       Court, opening of history sheet or rowdy sheet can be justified only\n       when it is proved before the Court by the State that based on the\n       relevant material the competent police officer has applied mind with\n       due care and considered all aspects in the light of the law and then\n       ordered   opening    of   history     sheet   or   rowdy   sheet   or    ordered\n       continuation or retention of the history sheet. In the beginning of this\n       Judgment, all the relevant decisions of this Court have been referred to\n       and those principles may also have to be kept in mind.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">                                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">12.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_15\">In the light of the facts, noted above, it is appropriate to note\n\nthe observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_16\">Vijay Narain\n\nSingh v.

What\n      has to be &#x27;repetitive&#x27; are the anti-social acts.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">13.    Having regard to the principles governing opening of Rowdy\n\nSheet vis-à-vis right to life and liberty, it is necessary to considered\n\nwhether by opening rowdy sheet against petitioner, respondent\n\npolice have violated the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia and whether their decision is supported by reasons\n\nwarranting requirement to open rowdy sheet.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">14.    As per the proceedings impugned in the writ petition, it is\n\nseen that 21 crimes were registered. In addition, there are some\n\nmore crimes alleging involvement of encroachment of land. Out of\n\n21 crimes, in 4 crimes, petitioner was bound over for good\n\nconduct; in 5 crimes, he is facing trial.                       The crimes involved\n\ninclude <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 143</a> (unlawful assembly); <a href=\"/doc/828685/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 151</a> (knowingly\n\njoining or continuing in assembly of five of more persons after it\n\nhas been commanded to disperse); <a href=\"/doc/1099867/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 290</a> (public nuisance);\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\"><a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 323</a> (voluntarily causing hurt); <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 324</a> ( causing hurt\n\nby dangerous weapon or means); <a href=\"/doc/1208971/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 353</a> (Assault or criminal\n\nforce to deter public servant from discharge of his duty); <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_27\">Section\n\n427    (mischief)</a>;       <a href=\"/doc/1947545/\" id=\"a_28\">Section       448</a>     (house     trespass);       <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_29\">Section        500\n\n(defamation)</a>; <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 504</a> (intentional insult with intent to provoke\n\nbreach of the peace); <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 506</a> (criminal intimidation) and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 509</a> (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of\n                                                                                       PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                         WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                           9</span>\n\n\na woman).

The offences in which petitioner is involved, noted above,\n\nwould attract many of the clauses of PSO 601, more particularly,\n\nClauses A, B and D.            Therefore, the decision to open the rowdy\n\nsheet cannot be held as one made in illegal exercise of power and\n\nauthority and without application of mind. Having regard to the\n\nhistory of involvement of crimes, Police are justified in opening the\n\nrowdy sheet to keep surveillance on movements of petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">17.    Therefore, I see no merit in the writ petition. Accordingly,\n\nWrit Petition is dismissed.            However, it is made clear that such\n                                                                    PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                      WP No.20843 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                10</span>\n\n\nsurveillance should not be obtrusive and does not impinge upon\n\nprivacy of the petitioner.
