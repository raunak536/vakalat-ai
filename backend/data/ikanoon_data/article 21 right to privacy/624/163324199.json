The\n\n  notices issued to the Co operative Societies under the\n\n  impugned provisions were also under challenge.                            The\n\n  learned single Judge considered the contentions advanced\n\n  on either side and held, drawing support from the decisions\n\n  of the Apex Court, that right to privacy cannot be pleaded\n\f\nW.A.Nos.524/15 &amp; con.cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 3</span>\n\n\n\n\n  as a ground to invalidate a provision of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_4\">Income Tax Act</a>,\n\n  especially where the avowed object of the provision was to\n\n  get details of financial transactions which could be\n\n  associated with black money.

Christopher Abraham, learned standing counsel\n\n  appearing for the Revenue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">4.Learned counsel for the appellants would contend that right\n\n  to privacy is a necessary corollary of the right to life and\n\n  human dignity and cannot be lightly interfered with. A law\n\n  which violates the right to privacy is violative of the\n\n  fundamental rights of the citizen and is thus liable to be\n\n  struck down. They would contend that a roving and fishing\n\n  inquiry seeking details of persons against whom no\n\n  proceedings are pending or even contemplated under any\n\n  fiscal statute is clearly a licence to the Revenue to exercise\n\f\nW.A.Nos.524/15 &amp; con.cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   4</span>\n\n\n\n\n  arbitrary powers without any checks or measures.          It is\n\n  submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 133(6)</a> as it originally stood had been\n\n  construed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in DBS Financial\n\n  Pvt.Ltd. vs. Smt.M.George [1994 207-ITR 1077] and it had\n\n  been held that demand for addresses of all credit card\n\n  holders whose account showed an annual expenditure of\n\n  over Rs.5000/- cannot be sustained as there were no\n\n  proceedings pending against such persons. It is therefore\n\n  contended that by adding the word &#x27;inquiry&#x27; in the section\n\n  and introducing a new proviso, the ambit of the section has\n\n  been widened so as to include a roving inquiry into the legal\n\n  financial transactions of private citizens even where no\n\n  financial wrong doing is alleged or suspected against them.\n\n  The details of their transactions cannot be extracted from\n\n  co-operative banks so as to make investigations into their\n\n  private financial affairs, it is contended. The learned counsel\n\n  further contend that the relationship between a banker and\n\n  its customer being fiduciary in nature and the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\n  Court having held that the Co-operative Banks are not\n\n  expected to give out the details of its customers even under\n\f\nW.A.Nos.524/15 &amp; con.cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 5</span>\n\n\n\n\n  the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">Right to Information Act</a>, the attempt to elicit such\n\n  details through a notice issued under <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 133(6)</a> is\n\n  totally vitiated and arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">5.Learned counsel appearing for the Revenue, on the other\n\n  hand, would submit that the provision is a part of the direct\n\n  taxing system of the nation and the intention of <a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 133\n\n  (6)</a> and other like provisions in the Act is to gather\n\n  information which could be crucial for the nation&#x27;s economic\n\n  interests. Curbing the menace of black money which tends\n\n  to erode the very foundation of the nation&#x27;s economy is the\n\n  ultimate object of all provisions relating to search, seizure,\n\n  inspection and gathering of information with regard to\n\n  financial transactions. It is to be remembered that what is\n\n  sought for is only the details of customers or members who\n\n  hold deposits having a value specified in the circular. The\n\n  notices issued in the instant case refer to a list of persons\n\n  having a deposit of Rs.5 lakhs and interest income\n\n  exceeding Rs.10,000/-. It is submitted by the learned\n\n  counsel for the appellants that the said circular has\n\f\nW.A.Nos.524/15 &amp; con.cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                6</span>\n\n\n\n\n  subsequently been modified and the limit of deposit stands\n\n  enhanced to Rs.25 lakhs. The attempt is evidently to gather\n\n  information about funds deposited in Co-operative Banks to\n\n  verify the sources thereof. This is evidently intended in the\n\n  best national interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_7\">6.The learned counsel appearing for the Revenue would\n\n  further submit that the scope of the right to privacy vis a vis\n\n  the need for gathering of information for the proper\n\n  administration of the economic interest of the nation have to\n\n  be balanced and the courts have to look at the issue of the\n\n  constitutional validity of a provision of a taxing statute in its\n\n  proper perspective. The learned counsel places reliance on\n\n  the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_9\">Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh and\n\n  another</a> [(<a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_10\">1975)2 SCC 148] and Ram Jethmalani v.

State of Bihar</a> [AIR 1962 SC\n\n  955]. It is submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\n\n  specifically held that the attempt of the courts should be to\n\n  support the constitutional validity of a provision of law and\n\n  attempts should be made to construe the law to make it\n\n  consistent with its constitutional validity.      It is further\n\n  submitted that apart from this rebutable presumption as to\n\n  the constitutional validity of a statute, it is stated that the\n\n  Apex Court has further held that in matters of laws relating\n\n  to economic activities, such laws should be viewed with a\n\n  greater latitude that laws touching civil rights such as\n\n  freedom of speech, religion etc.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"856631\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"314044\" id=\"span_11\">Reliance is placed on the\n\n  decisions of the larger Bench of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/314044/\" id=\"a_12\">R.K.Garg\n\n  v.

The learned single Judge after considering the\n\n  safeguards incorporated in the statute found that sufficient\n\n  guidelines were provided to guard against possible misuse\n\n  of the provision. The decisions cited on either side have also\n\n  been considered in extenso. The learned single Judge came\n\n  to the conclusion that there was no arbitrariness or\n\n  constitutional invalidity in the amendment in question.
