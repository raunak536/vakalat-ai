The impugned article, which is filed as Document no.1 alongwith the\n                          documents filed with the plaint, concerns the quantum of compensation paid\n                          for acquisition of certain land for the purposes of undertaking construction\n                          activities in respect of the Dwarka Expressway of NHAI. It has sought to be\n                          brought out in the impugned article that the compensation in respect of the\n                          said acquired land was enhanced to Rs. 353 crores from the previously\n                          determined compensation of Rs. 41.52 crores by the concerned District\n                          Magistrate (South-West Delhi).

Learned senior counsel for the plaintiff and the learned counsel for the\n                          defendant nos. 1 &amp; 2 have been heard on the aspect of the grant of ad-\n                          interim injunction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          9.    It has been strenuously contended by the learned senior counsel for\n                          the plaintiff that the defendant nos. 1 &amp; 2 have launched a personal attack on\n                          plaintiff with an oblique motive to malign, defame and injure the plaintiff‟s\n                          reputation based on series of blatant falsehoods and gross misrepresentation.\n                          It is contended that the well-earned reputation of an individual cannot be\n                          allowed to be eroded in the manner sought to be done and that the defendant\n                          nos. 1 &amp; 2 ought not to be permitted to disseminate falsities without proper\n                          due diligence, only with an oblique motive to achieve cheap publicity while\n                          acting as mouthpieces of person/s who may have personal/political agenda\n                          against the plaintiff. He submits that a decorated public officer cannot be\n                          used as bait for publicity and defamation in the name of free speech and\n                          journalism. He submits that the malicious, false &amp; defamatory statements\n                          have caused immense damage to the reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff\n                          that has been built over a period of several decades and that further\n                          irreparable damage will be caused to the plaintiff, unless injunctive orders\n                          are passed against the defendants.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                          I.A.

On the other hand, learned counsel for defendant nos. 1 &amp; 2 has\n                          sought to controvert the contentions made by the plaintiff. It is sought to be\n                          refuted that the impugned article/publication contains any defamatory\n                          imputation as alleged. He further sought to place reliance upon a\n                          &quot;Preliminary Report submitted to the Chief Minister of Delhi on 14.11.2023\n                          by Ms. Atishi, Minister of Vigilance and Revenue, Government of NCT of\n                          Delhi&quot; as a justification for the contents of the article. He further seeks some\n                          time to reply to the present application to deal with the contentions made on\n                          behalf of the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">                          11.    Having carefully perused the article/publication dated 09.11.2023, I\n                          find merit in the contentions made by learned senior counsel for the plaintiff\n                          that the impugned article contains defamatory and libellous allegations and\n                          insinuations, made in a reckless manner without regard to the truth, in order\n                          to cause injury to the reputation of the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                          12.    The impugned article proceeds on the basis that the enhanced\n                          compensation in respect of the concerned land acquired for the purpose of\n                          Dwarka Expressway, was linked to plaintiff‟s &quot;handling&quot; of the matter. This\n                          is completely misconceived inasmuch as the enhancement was pursuant to\n                          an arbitral award dated 15.05.2023 which was rendered in terms of <a href=\"/doc/120401589/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n                          3G</a> of the National Highways Act, 1956. The said award was passed by\n                          another IAS Officer in his capacity as arbitrator. It cannot be said, by any\n                          stretch of imagination, that the plaintiff could have interfered with the\n                          discharge of quasi-judicial functions entrusted to another officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          13.

It appears evident that contrary to what has been suggested in the\n                          impugned article, the matter concerning the proposed transfer of the\n                          delinquent officer was evidently placed before NCCSA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">                          19.    The fact that the plaintiff was involved in the decision to transfer/\n                          taking action against the delinquent officer (in the aftermath of the rendering\n                          the aforesaid arbitral award dated 15.05.2023), can hardly be said to involve\n                          any impropriety or any conflict of interest. If anything, the same is\n                          demonstrative of departmental resolve to take action against the delinquent\n                          officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                          20.    Further, the nexus sought to be drawn between the person which was\n                          the beneficiary of the arbitral award dated 15.05.2023 and the son of the\n                          plaintiff is also quite far-fetched, to say the least, contrary to what has been\n                          sought to be projected in the title/caption of the impugned article.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                          21.    In any event, as already stated hereinabove, the arbitral award dated\n                          15.05.2023 was an outcome of arbitration proceedings under a statutory\n                          framework and pursuant to discharge of quasi-judicial responsibility by\n                          another IAS Officer, and which has already been set aside by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                          22.

But perhaps another way of looking at the matter lies in examining\n                                   the consequences of the initial order as soon as it is passed. There are\n                                   cases where an order may cause serious injury as soon as it is made, an\n                                   injury not capable of being entirely erased when the error is corrected on\n                                   subsequent appeal. For instance, as in the present case, where a member\n                                   of a highly respected an publicly trusted profession is found guilty of\n                                   misconduct and suffers penalty, the damage to his professional reputation\n                                   can be immediate and far-reaching. &quot;Not all the King&#x27;s horses and all the\n                                   King&#x27;s men&quot; can ever salvage the situation completely, notwithstanding\n                                   the widest scope provided to an appeal. To many a man, his professional\n                                   reputation is his most valuable possession. It affects his standing and\n                                   dignity among his fellow members in the profession, and guarantees the\n                                   esteem of his clientele. It is often the carefully garnered fruit of a long\n                                   period of scrupulous, conscientious and diligent industry. It is the portrait\n                                   of his professional honour. In a world said to be notorious for its blase\n                                   attitude towards the noble values of an earlier generation, a man&#x27;s\n                                   professional reputation is still his most sensitive pride. In such a case,\n                                   after the blow suffered by the initial decision, it is difficult to\n                                   contemplate complete restitution through an appellate decision. Such a\n                                   case is unlike an action for money or recovery of property, where the\n                                   execution of the trial decree may be stayed pending appeal, or a\n                                   successful appeal may result in refund of the money or restitution of the\n                                   property, with appropriate compensation by way of interest or mesne\n                                   profits for the period of deprivation. And, therefore, it seems to us, there is\n                                   manifest need to ensure that there is no breach of fundamental procedure\n                                   in the original proceeding, and to avoid treating an appeal as an overall\n                                   substitute for the original proceeding.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                          24.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176929306\" id=\"span_44\">In <a href=\"/doc/176929306/\" id=\"a_5\">Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri v.

In appropriate cases where the court is of the\n                                view that statements are unsubstantiated and have been made in a reckless\n                                manner without regard to the truth, in order to cause injury to the\n                                reputation of the plaintiff, the court would be justified in granting an\n                                interim injunction. If the aforesaid submission of the defendants is\n                                accepted, it would give the defendant a free reign to continue making\n                                defamatory statements against the plaintiff and continue to tarnish his\n                                reputation. Therefore, the court cannot be powerless in such a situation.\n                                After suffering the brunt of such defamatory content, it is difficult to\n                                contemplate a complete restitution through damages. Such cases demand\n                                immediate injunctive relief and the court cannot wait for the defendants to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                          I.A.

We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above\n                                discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                                (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n                                guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be\n                                let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his\n                                family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education\n                                among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above\n                                matters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and whether\n                                laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to\n                                privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for\n                                damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n                                thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a\n                                controversy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\n                                concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such\n                                publication is based upon public records including court records. This is\n                                for the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the\n                                right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for\n                                comment by press and media among others. We are, however, of the\n                                opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must\n                                be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual\n                                assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\n                                to the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n                                press/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above -- indeed, this is\n                                not an exception but an independent rule.

This is so even where the\n                                publication is based upon facts and statements which are not true, unless\n                                the official establishes that the publication was made (by the defendant)\n                                with reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for\n                                the defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted after\n                                a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove\n                                that what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is\n                                proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n                                defendant would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It is\n                                equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties,\n                                the public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as\n                                explained in (1) and (2) above.

It is not a restriction that has an inevitable\n                                consequence which impairs circulation of thought and ideas. In fact, it is\n                                control regard being had to another person&#x27;s right to go to court and state\n                                that he has been wronged and abused.

Therefore, the balance between the two rights needs to be\n                                struck. &quot;Reputation&quot; of one cannot be allowed to be crucified at the altar\n                                of the other&#x27;s right of free speech.
