The issue at hand arises from a matrimonial dispute which is pending\nbefore the Family Court by way of a divorce petition bearing HMA\nNo. 609/2012, the relevant details of which are referred to hereinafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.     The petitioner/wife is the respondent in the aforesaid divorce petition\nwhich was filed on 26.09.2012 by the respondent/husband seeking\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                     page 1 of 46\n dissolution of their marriage on the ground of cruelty available under <a href=\"/doc/72812721/\" id=\"a_2\">section\n13(1)(ia)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In the divorce proceedings, the\nhusband filed a Compact Disc (CD) purporting to contain an audio-video\nrecording of the wife supposedly speaking with her lady friend, by name\nSugandha, on phone and talking about the husband and his family in a\nmanner, which the husband claims was derogatory, defamatory and\nconstituted cruelty to him. In the written statement filed by the wife in the\ndivorce proceedings, she opposed the taking on record of the CD and the\npurported transcript of conversation contained therein. The wife opposed the\nCD being brought on record on the ground, firstly, that the contents of the\nCD were tampered with and were therefore not authentic ; and secondly, that\nthe contents of the CD were not admissible in evidence since they were a\nrecording of a &#x27;private&#x27; conversation that the wife had had with a friend,\nwhich had been secretly recorded by the husband, without the knowledge or\nconsent of the wife, in breach of her fundamental right to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.     In response to the wife&#x27;s objections, the husband moved an\napplication before the Family Court, in which he in effect sought\nappointment of an expert to prove the genuineness of the CD with the\npurpose of bringing the CD on record. Agreeing with the husband&#x27;s\ncontentions, by way of impugned order dated 24.12.2018, the Family Court\nallowed the husband to bring on record the evidence comprised in the CD,\nwhile directing that the contents of the CD be examined by the Forensic\nScience Laboratory (FSL) to assess the genuineness of the recording. By\nway of the impugned order, the Family Court has directed the FSL to render\nits opinion on the following aspects :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 2 of 46\n                   &quot;The FSL shall report :(l) (sic) Whether the contents of CD\n                  and the original recording in the recording device are at\n                  variance? (2) Whether the original recording has been\n                  tempered (sic) with? (3)Whether the transcript relied upon\n                  by the petitioner is correct, as per the original recording?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.        While the prayer made in the application on which the Family Court\nhas made the impugned order is somewhat ambiguous, the essential question\nraised in the present proceeding is as regards the admissibility of the\ncontents of the CD, since according to the wife, the conversation comprised\nin the CD has been recorded in breach of her fundamental right to privacy;\nand is therefore inadmissible in evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Petitioner&#x27;s submissions :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_1\">6.        The wife&#x27;s objection arises from the conceded position that the audio-\nvideo recording on the CD was made by means of a CCTV camera installed\nby the husband in the bedroom of the parties ; and that is how the\nconversation between the wife and her friend came to be recorded. The wife\naccordingly contends that since the evidence comprised in the CD was\ncollected in breach of the wife&#x27;s fundamental right to privacy, the same is\nnot admissible in a court of law. Relying on a Constitution Bench judgment\nof the Supreme Court in Justice K. S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) &amp; <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_3\">Anr. vs. Union\nof India &amp; Ors.1</a>, the wife has urged that privacy has (now) been recognised\nby the Supreme Court as a fundamental right, available to a person not only\nagainst the State but also against private individuals. It is argued that a\nperson is entitled to criticise someone and not share the criticism with the\nworld ; and that a person has a right to all thoughts and behavioural patterns\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">1</span>\n    (2017) 10 SCC 1\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                         page 3 of 46\n within one&#x27;s zone of privacy.        In this context, it is urged that the\nconversation between the wife and her friend, conducted in the bedroom and\ntherefore in the belief that the same was being conducted in private, cannot\nbe brought on record and be cited in evidence. It is further submitted that\nsince the husband&#x27;s action of secretly recording the conversation using a\nCCTV camera installed in the bedroom is a violation of the wife&#x27;s\nfundamental right to privacy, the recording is per se illegal and therefore not\nadmissible in evidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">7.     In the context of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_4\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act 1984 (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_5\">Family\nCourts Act</a>&#x27;, for short), it is argued, that though this provision otherwise\nempowers a Family Court to receive evidence, if in the opinion of the\nFamily Court, such evidence assists it to deal effectually with a dispute,\nwhether or not the same is otherwise relevant or admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian\nEvidence Act</a> 1872 (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_7\">Evidence Act</a>&#x27;, for short), yet this section does not\npermit evidence which is inadmissible &quot;as per the Constitution&quot; to be taken\non record. Relying upon certain judicial precedents, it is argued on behalf of\nthe wife that since the conversation comprised in the CD was recorded in\nbreach of the wife&#x27;s fundamental right to privacy as recognised in the\nConstitution, it cannot be admitted in evidence even under <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_8\">section 14</a> of the\nFamily Courts Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.     Additionally it has been urged that the husband&#x27;s action of\nsurreptitiously and clandestinely recording the wife&#x27;s telephone conversation\nwith her friend also amounts to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/27280854/\" id=\"a_9\">section 354-D</a> of the Indian\nPenal Code 1860, whereby the very act of recording such conversation is a\ncriminal offence, punishable in law ; and accordingly evidence collected by\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                     page 4 of 46\n committing a penal offence must per se be inadmissible in a court of law for\nany purpose and under any statute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">Respondent&#x27;s submissions :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.     On the other hand, it is the husband&#x27;s contention that although privacy\nhas been recognised by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right, this right\nis not absolute but is subject to exceptions. Relying upon other judicial\nprecedents, it is urged that the husband was entitled to establish cruelty on\nthe wife&#x27;s part and to prove his case seeking dissolution of marriage on that\nground ; and in these circumstances, the wife&#x27;s right to privacy must give\nway to the husband&#x27;s right to bring evidence to prove his case, else the\nhusband would be denied the right to fair trial guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a>\nof the Constitution. It is of course also argued on behalf of the husband, that\n<a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_11\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act specifically empowers a Family Court\nto receive evidence, if in its opinion such evidence will assist the court to\ndeal effectively with the dispute, regardless of whether the same is otherwise\nrelevant or admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_12\">Evidence Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">10.

For ready reference, Sec.-14 of the\n              Family Court Act is reproduced hereinbelow :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                         ******\n\n              It is, therefore, evident that the Family Court is within its\n              right to receive any report, statement, document or\n              information, which in the opinion of the court will assist it\n              in effectually dealing with a dispute between the parties;\n              whether such evidence is relevant or admissible or not.\n              Therefore, the question of admissibility of the evidence\n              collected by violating the respondent&#x27;s right to privacy,\n              would not be gone into, by a Family Court and the evidence\n              shall be taken on record; if the court is of the opinion, that\n              such evidence will assist it in dealing with the dispute\n              effectively.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                        page 13 of 46\n                   &quot;8.2 This court is of the opinion that the conversation\n                  between the respondent and her friend, wherein, she has\n                  allegedly spoken about the petitioner/ his family and the\n                  status of the matrimonial life would, certainly assist the\n                  court in effectively deciding the dispute between the\n                  parties. Such a piece of evidence is certainly relevant.\n                  Therefore, in view of sec.-14 of the <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_62\">Family Court Act</a>, the\n                  evidence can not be thrown out on the ground that the same\n                  is inadmissible. Dr. Hingorani&#x27;s argument that the\n                  admissibility mentioned in Sec.-14 of The Family Courts Act\n                  pertains to admissibility under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_63\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and not\n                  under the Constitution of India, does not impress this court.\n                  The question of admissibility has been defined only under\n                  the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_64\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and there is no way that\n                  appreciation of admissibility of evidence can be carried out\n                  under Constitution of India. Therefore, court is of the\n                  opinion that the audio-video recording, as contained in the\n                  CD is certainly permissible to be taken on record and\n                  considered for effectively adjudicating the dispute between\n                  the parties.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">                                                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1769219\" id=\"span_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1179783\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"60395166\" id=\"span_52\">13.

One of the earliest, leading decisions on the question of admissibility\nof tape-recorded conversations is Regina vs. Maqsud Ali22, where a secretly\ntape-recorded conversation was the only incriminating piece of evidence\nimplicating the accused persons for murder. In the face of strong objection\nraised by the defence however, in exercise of his discretion, the trial judge\nadmitted the tape recording in evidence. In this backdrop, the court of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">22</span>\n     (1966) 1 QB 688\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 18 of 46\n criminal appeal held that there was no difference in principle between a tape\nrecording and a photograph; accordingly, a tape recording was admissible in\nevidence provided that its accuracy could be proved and the voices properly\nidentified and provided the evidence was relevant and otherwise admissible.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">The court did not lay down any exhaustive set of rules by which the\nadmissibility of evidence could be judged but observed that such evidence\nhad always to be regarded with caution and assessed in the light of all the\ncircumstances of a particular case. The court further observed that but for\nthe fact that the tape recorder was a mechanical device, it was no different\nfrom an eavesdropper, and since the accused were not in custody and no\ncaution was required, the use of the tape recorder could not be said to\noperate unfairly against them. The court said that the method of taking the\ntape recording could not affect its admissibility, which still remained a\nmatter for the discretion of the judge. The court however added that it\nshould not be taken to be saying that such recordings are admissible\nwhatever the circumstances, but it does appear wrong to deny to the law of\nevidence advantages to be gained by new techniques and new devices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_57\">19.

Nor is it legitimate to assume that\n                    the constitutional protection under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 20(3)</a> would be\n                    defeated by the statutory provisions for searches.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">              It, therefore, follows that neither by invoking the spirit of our\n              Constitution nor by a strained construction of any of the\n              fundamental rights can we spell out the exclusion of evidence\n              obtained on an illegal search.&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">              &quot;24. So far as India is concerned its law of evidence is\n              modelled on the rules of evidence which prevailed in English\n              Law, and Courts in India and in England have consistently\n              refused to exclude relevant evidence merely on the ground\n              that it is obtained by illegal search or seizure. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"780830\" id=\"span_60\">In <a href=\"/doc/780830/\" id=\"a_88\">Barindra\n              Kumar Ghose v.

On this assumption he\n              has contended that the evidence discovered by the searches is\n              not admissible, but to this view I cannot accede. For, without in\n              any way countenancing disregard of the provisions prescribed\n              by the Code, I hold that what would otherwise be relevant does\n              not become irrelevant because it was discovered in the course\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 21 of 46\n               of a search in which those provisions were disregarded. As\n              Jimutavahana with his shrewd common sense observes -- &quot;a\n              fact cannot be altered by 100 texts,&quot; and as his commentator\n              quaintly remarks: &quot;If a Brahmana be slain, the precept &#x27;slay\n              not a Brahmana&#x27; does not annul the murder&quot;. But the absence\n              of the precautions designed by the Legislature lends support to\n              the argument that the alleged discovery should be carefully\n              scrutinized.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                                           ******\n              In Kuruma v.

The question was whether the evidence\n              with regard to the finding of the ammunition on the person of\n              Kuruma could be shut out on the ground that the evidence had\n              been obtained by an unlawful search. It was held it could not be\n              so shut out because the finding of ammunition was a relevant\n              piece of evidence on a charge for unlawful possession. In a\n              later case before the Privy Council in Herman\n              King v. Queen [(1969) 1 AC 304] which came on appeal from a\n              Court of Appeal of Jamaica, the law as laid down in Kuruma\n              case was applied although the Jamaican Constitution\n              guaranteed the constitutional right against search and seizure\n              * * * * * * In other words search and seizure for the purposes\n              of preventing or detecting crime reasonably enforced was not\n              inconsistent with the constitutional guarantee against search\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                        page 22 of 46\n                   and seizure. It was held in that case that the search of the\n                  appellant by a Police Officer was not justified by the warrant\n                  nor was it open to the Officer to search the person of the\n                  appellant without taking him before a Justice of the Peace.\n                  Nevertheless it was held that the Court had a discretion to\n                  admit the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search and\n                  the constitutional protection against search of person or\n                  property without consent did not take away the discretion of the\n                  Court. Following Kuruma v. Queen the Court held that it was\n                  open to the Court not to admit the evidence against the\n                  accused if the Court was of the view that the evidence had\n                  been obtained by conduct of which the prosecution ought not\n                  to take advantage. But that was not a rule of evidence but a\n                  rule of prudence and fair play. It would thus be seen that in\n                  India, as in England, where the test of admissibility of evidence\n                  lies in relevancy, unless there is an express or necessarily\n                  implied prohibition in the Constitution or other law evidence\n                  obtained as a result of illegal search or seizure is not liable to\n                  be shut out.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                                                               (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1769219\" id=\"span_61\">20.

In that case, the Court\n              clarified that a contemporaneous tape record of a relevant\n              conversation is a relevant fact and is admissible as res gestae\n              under <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 7</a> of the Evidence Act.

At the same\n                  time, the question of admissibility of evidence illegally obtained\n                  was discussed. The law was laid down as follows: (SCC p. 477,\n                  para 24)\n\n                       &quot;There is warrant for the proposition that even if\n                       evidence is illegally obtained it is admissible. Over a\n                       century ago it was said in an English case where a\n                       constable searched the appellant illegally and found a\n                       quantity of offending article in his pocket that it would be\n                       a dangerous obstacle to the administration of justice if it\n                       were held, because evidence was obtained by illegal\n                       means, it could not be used against a party charged with\n                       an offence.</span> See Jones v. Owens. The Judicial Committee\n                       in Kuruma v. R. dealt with the conviction of an accused of\n                       being in unlawful possession of ammunition which had\n                       been discovered in consequence of a search of his person\n                       by a police officer below the rank of those who were\n                       permitted to make such searches. The Judicial Committee\n                       held that the evidence was rightly admitted. The reason\n                       given was that if evidence was admissible it matters not\n                       how it was obtained. There is of course always a word of\n                       caution. It is that the judge has a discretion to disallow\n                       evidence in a criminal case if the strict rules of\n                       admissibility would operate unfairly against the accused.\n                       That caution is the golden rule in criminal jurisprudence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_63\">&quot;155.

Although in Puttaswamy (supra) the 9-Judge Constitution Bench of\nthe Supreme Court has not dealt with the law and principles of evidence in\nthe context of the right to privacy, the observations of the Supreme Court in\nthat case that are relevant for purposes of the present discussion are the\nfollowing :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       On the right to privacy being a fundamental right :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              &quot;644. The right to privacy is a fundamental right. It is a right\n              which protects the inner sphere of the individual from\n              interference from both State and non-State actors and allows\n              the individuals to make autonomous life choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">       On right to privacy not being an absolute right:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">              &quot;325. Like other rights which form part of the fundamental\n              freedoms protected by Part III, including the right to life and\n              personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 21</a>, privacy is not an absolute\n              right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to\n              withstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions on\n              fundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21</a> an invasion of\n              privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which stipulates\n              a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must\n              also be valid with reference to the encroachment on life and\n              personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 21.</a> An invasion of life or\n              personal liberty must meet the threefold requirement of (i)\n              legality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need,\n              defined in terms of a legitimate State aim; and (iii)\n              proportionality which ensures a rational nexus between the\n              objects and the means adopted to achieve them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                     page 25 of 46\n        On the need to place right to privacy in the context of other rights\n       and values:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_65\">&quot;509.

Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern\n                  of any system of limited Government, is protected in part\n                  under our Constitution by explicit constitutional\n                  guarantees. In the application of the Constitution our\n                  contemplation cannot only be of what has been but what\n                  may be. Time works changes and brings into existence new\n                  conditions. Subtler and far-reaching means of invading\n                  privacy will make it possible to be heard in the street\n                  what is whispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition\n                  of privacy raises serious questions about the propriety of\n                  judicial reliance on a right that is not explicit in the\n                  Constitution. Of course, privacy primarily concerns the\n                  individuals. It therefore relates to and overlaps with the\n                  concept of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy\n                  must confess that there are serious problems of defining\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                    page 26 of 46\n                   the essence and scope of the right.

This\n                  catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as\n                  instructive as it does not give analytical picture of\n                  distinctive characteristics of the right to privacy. Perhaps,\n                  the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying\n                  principle underlying the concept has been the assertion\n                  that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit\n                  in the concept of ordered liberty.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                                           ******\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">                  27.     There are two possible theories for protecting\n                  privacy of home. The first is that activities in the home\n                  harm others only to the extent that they cause offence\n                  resulting from the mere thought that individuals might be\n                  engaging in such activities and that such &quot;harm&quot; is not\n                  constitutionally protectable by the State. The second is\n                  that individuals need a place of sanctuary where they can\n                  be free from societal control. The importance of such a\n                  sanctuary is that individuals can drop the mask, desist for\n                  a while from projecting on the world the image they want\n                  to be accepted as themselves, an image that may reflect\n                  the values of their peers rather than the realities of their\n                  natures.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">                  28.

While a litigating party certainly has a right to privacy, that right must\nyield to the right of an opposing party to bring evidence it considers relevant\nto court, to prove its case. It is a critical part of the hallowed concept of fair\ntrial that a litigating party gets a fair chance to bring relevant evidence\nbefore court. It is important to appreciate that while the right to privacy is\nessentially a personal right, the right to a fair trial has wider ramifications\nand impacts public justice, which is a larger cause. The cause of public\njustice would suffer if the opportunity of fair trial is denied by shutting-out\nevidence that a litigating party may wish to lead at the very threshold.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86964673\" id=\"span_74\">24.

Consequently, free speech, in appropriate cases, has got\n                  to correlate with fair trial.

The object, effect and consequence of this provision\n              is to remove any embargo on the Family Court to first examine\n              the relevancy or admissibility of the documents under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_129\">Indian\n              Evidence Act</a> in considering such documents in adjudication of\n              the matrimonial dispute. The Statement of Object and Reasons\n              leading to the enactment of the Family Court&#x27;s Act would also\n              become a guiding factor so as to ascertain the intention of the\n              legislature in framing <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_130\">section 14</a> when it uses the above words.\n              One of the objects of the legislation as Clause 2 (h) of the\n                  Statement of Object and Reasons would provide is &quot;simplify the\n                  rules of evidence and procedure so as to enable a Family Court\n                  to deal effectively with a dispute&quot;. This clearly manifests the\n                  intention of the legislature to remove complexities in the\n                  application of rules of evidence to make the procedure more\n                  comprehensible so as to enable a Family Court to deal\n                  effectively with a matrimonial dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_131\">Family Courts\n                  Act</a>, which is a special Act.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">              &quot;7. When <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_132\">section 14</a> stipulates and says that the Family Court\n              can receive a document in evidence irrespective of the same\n              being relevant or admissible in evidence under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_133\">Evidence\n              Act</a>, it signifies two important facets namely that the Family\n              Court at the threshold cannot reject a document on the ground\n              that the document is not legally admissible in evidence and\n              secondly the test and rigor of relevancy and admissibility of the\n              document can be dispensed with by the Family Court if the\n              Family Court is of the opinion that any evidence would assist it\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 32 of 46\n                   to deal effectively with the dispute. It cannot be disputed that\n                  admissibility presupposes relevancy as admissibility is founded\n                  on law whereas relevancy is determined by Court using judicial\n                  skills, logic and experience. Admissibility does not signify that\n                  a particular fact stands proved but merely that such a fact is\n                  received by the Court for the purpose of being weighed. The\n                  learned Judge overlooked that merely because the documents\n                  are marked as Exhibits and the same also becoming available\n                  for cross-examination, is neither an admission as to documents\n                  nor can be treated as an admission of its contents.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">                                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\nFurthermore, discussing the effect of <a href=\"/doc/1231073/\" id=\"a_134\">section 20</a> of the Family Courts Act,\nwhich gives overriding effect to that statute, the Bombay High Court has\nheld as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">              &quot;9.

In matrimonial cases, the Family Court is expected to\n              adopt standards as to how a prudent person would gauge the\n              realities of life and a situation of commotion and turmoil\n              between the parties and applying the principle of\n              preponderance of probabilities, consider whether a particular\n              fact is proved. Thus, the approach of the Family Court is\n              required to be realistic and rational to the facts in hand rather\n              than technical and narrow. It cannot be overlooked that\n              matrimonial disputes involve human problems which are\n              required to be dealt with utmost human sensitivity by using all\n              intelligible skills to judge such issues. The Family Court has a\n              special feature where in a given case there may not be legal\n              representation of the parties. <a href=\"/doc/808094/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 13</a> of the Act makes such\n              a provision. In such a situation, the parties who are not experts\n              in law cannot be expected to know the technical rules of the\n              evidence qua the relevancy, admissibility and proof of\n              documents. Thus, the strict principles as referred in the\n              impugned order on the decisions which are not under the\n              <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_141\">Family Courts Act</a>, would not be of any relevance in the\n              proceedings before the Family Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">              &quot;11. Thus, in my opinion, even if there is any electronic record\n              for which certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_142\">section 65-B</a> of the Evidence Act is\n              necessary, it would not preclude the learned Judge of the\n              Family Court to exhibit such documents and receive such\n              documents in evidence, on forming an opinion as to whether the\n              documents would assist the Court, to deal effectively with the\n              dispute in hand. Such exercise has not been undertaken in\n              passing the impugned order.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">                                                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 34 of 46\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\"> 27.       In this court&#x27;s opinion, the Legislature being fully cognisant of the\nforegoing principle of admissibility of evidence, has enacted <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_143\">section 14</a>\ninfact to expand that principle insofar as disputes relating to marriage and\nfamily affairs are concerned ; and the Family Court is thereby freed of all\nrigours and restrictions of the law of evidence. The Legislature could not\nhave enunciated it more clearly than to say that the Family Court &quot;may\nreceive as evidence any report, statement, documents, information or matter\nthat may, in its opinion, assist it to deal effectually with a dispute, whether\nor not the same would be otherwise relevant or admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_144\">Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872</a>&quot;. Therefore the only criterion or test under <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_145\">section 14</a>\nfor a Family Court to receive, that is to say admit, evidence is its subjective\nsatisfaction that the evidence would assist it to deal effectually with the\ndispute. It may also be relevant to note that under <a href=\"/doc/40332/\" id=\"a_146\">section 13</a> of the Family\nCourts Act, parties are to represent themselves without the assistance of\nlawyers ; and therefore even more so, all technical aspects of admissibility\nof evidence are to be ignored before a Family Court, since parties appearing\nin-person cannot be expected to be well versed with the technicalities of the\nlaw of evidence. Reference in this regard may be made to the observations\nmade by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Shiv Anand\nDamodar Shanbhag vs Sujata Shiv Anand Shanbhagh28.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">28.       For the record, the vires of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_147\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act has\nnot been challenged by the petitioner in these proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">29.       To be sure, in view of the expressed intention of the Legislature in\n<a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_148\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, all that is being said here is that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">28</span>\n     2013 SCC OnLine Bom 421\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                      page 35 of 46\n evidence, whether collected legitimately or otherwise, may be received by\nthe Family Court if it is of opinion that the evidence would assist it to\neffectively decide the dispute. It is not being suggested that the Family\nCourt is bound to believe, accept or act upon such evidence for purposes of\nadjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">30.    As observed by the Bombay High Court in the aforementioned case, it\nis noteworthy that, what is permitted under <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_149\">section 14</a> is only for the Family\nCourt to receive evidence without the rigours and shackles of the\nconventional rules of evidence, with the only threshold test being that in the\nopinion of the Family Court that piece of evidence will assist it to deal\neffectively with the dispute at hand. Thereafter however, the Family Court is\nfree to either accept or discard or give weightage or disregard a particular\npiece of evidence when finally adjudicating the dispute. As under the\nordinary law of evidence, so also under <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_150\">section 14</a>, there is absolutely no\ncompulsion on the Family Court to accept a given piece of evidence as proof\nof a fact-in-issue or of a relevant fact, merely because such evidence has\nbeen taken on record by disregarding all rigours of the rules of evidence.\nCorrespondingly, it is open to the contesting party to dispute, cross-examine\nand disprove the evidence so cited; and to thereby contest any claim being\nmade on the basis of such evidence. The limited relaxation as it were, in\n<a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_151\">section 14</a> is that even if under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_152\">Evidence Act</a> or under conventional rules\nof evidence, a certain piece of evidence (whether a report, statement,\ndocument, information or other matter) is ex-facie found to be not relevant\nand therefore not admissible, the Family Court may yet receive such\nevidence on record if in its opinion, the evidence would assist it to deal\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                    page 36 of 46\n effectively with the dispute. What credence, value or weightage is to be\ngiven to the evidence so received is discretionary upon the judge, when\nfinally adjudicating the dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">31.       Another settled principle of interpretation of statutes that guides us in\nunderstanding the scope and operation of <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_153\">section 14</a> is the maxim &#x27;generalia\nspecialibus non derogant&#x27;. In Barker vs. Edger &amp; Others 29 , the Privy\nCouncil of the House of Lords has pithily summarised the purport of the\nmaxim in the following words :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                   &quot;The general maxim is, &quot;Generalia specialibus non derogant.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_86\">                   When the Legislature has given its attention to a separate\n                   subject, and made provision for it, the presumption is that a\n                   subsequent general enactment is not intended to interfere with\n                   the special provision unless it manifests that intention very\n                   clearly. Each enactment must be construed in that respect\n                   according to its own subject-matter and its own terms.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">          While in the above case, the Privy Council was dealing with a\nsubsequent general enactment, the principle applies a fortiori to a\nsubsequent special enactment. That is to say, a special enactment would\nprevail, whether made earlier or subsequently, over a general enactment if\nthat is the discernible intention of the Legislature in relation to the subject\nmatter of the special enactment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153597150\" id=\"span_85\">Our Supreme Court has also dealt with the\nissue in <a href=\"/doc/153597150/\" id=\"a_154\">Sharat Babu Digumarti vs. Government (NCT of Delhi</a>)30 in which\nthe issue was of construing <a href=\"/doc/1932336/\" id=\"a_155\">section 81</a> of the Information Technology Act\n2000, which provision is in pari materia with <a href=\"/doc/1577106/\" id=\"a_156\">section 20</a> of the Act and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">29</span>\n     1898 AC 748\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">30</span>\n     (2017) 2 SCC 18\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                         page 37 of 46\n gives an overriding effect to the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_157\">Information Technology Act</a> over anything\ninconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.\nThe other provision of law in question was <a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_158\">section 292</a> of the Indian Penal\nCode 1860 which makes the sale of obscene books etc. a penal offence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153597150\" id=\"span_88\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/153597150/\" id=\"a_159\">Sharat Babu Digumarti</a> (supra), the Supreme Court has opined as under :</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">              &quot;32. <a href=\"/doc/1039298/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 81</a> of the IT Act also specifically provides that the\n              provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n              inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time\n              being in force. All provisions will have their play and\n              significance, if the alleged offence pertains to offence of\n              electronic record. It has to be borne in mind that <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_161\">IT Act</a> is a\n              special enactment. It has special provisions. <a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 292</a> IPC\n              makes offence sale of obscene books, etc. but once the offence\n              has a nexus or connection with the electronic record the\n              protection and effect of <a href=\"/doc/540972/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 79</a> cannot be ignored and\n              negated. We are inclined to think so as it is a special provision\n              for a specific purpose and the Act has to be given effect to so as\n              to make the protection effective and true to the legislative\n              intent. This is the mandate behind <a href=\"/doc/1039298/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 81</a> of the IT Act. The\n              additional protection granted by the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_165\">IT Act</a> would apply.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">                                         ******\n\n              &quot;37. The aforesaid passage clearly shows that if legislative\n              intendment is discernible that a latter enactment shall prevail,\n              the same is to be interpreted in accord with the said intention.\n              We have already referred to the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_166\">IT Act</a> and how\n              obscenity pertaining to electronic record falls under the scheme\n              of the Act.

To address the aspect whether ethical and moral considerations should\nbe factored-in to decide admissibility of evidence, attention may be drawn\nto the observation of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_173\">Pooran Mal</a> (supra), where the\ncourt said that when there is no express or specifically implied prohibition\nin the Constitution, it is uncalled for and unwarranted to invoke the spirit of\nthe Constitution to exclude evidence. Equally so, in the face of the settled\nrule of evidence as augmented by <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_174\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, it\nwould be unwarranted to bring into the picture subjective and undefined\nethical and moral values or considerations, to decide if evidence should\neven be receivable by a Family Court. Without at all denigrating the\nimportance of ethical and moral considerations, in the opinion of this court,\nto say that a Family Court should shut-out evidence at the very threshold on\nthe basis of how it is collected, would be (i) in breach of <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_175\">section 14</a> which\nunequivocally expresses the intention of the Legislature ; (ii) in breach of\nsettled principles of evidence ; and (iii) in breach of the enunciation by the\nSupreme Court that though the right to privacy is a fundamental right, it is\nnot absolute and must be placed in the context of other rights and values.\nSuch construction would have more potential for mischief than possible\nsalutary effect.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\">33.    If it were to be held that evidence sought to be adduced before a\nFamily Court should be excluded based on an objection of breach of privacy\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                            page 39 of 46\n or some other cognate right, then in many a case the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_176\">section 14</a>\nwould be rendered nugatory and dead-letter. It must be borne in mind that\nFamily Courts have been established to deal with what are essentially\nsensitive, personal disputes relating to dissolution of marriage, restitution of\nconjugal rights, legitimacy of children, guardianship, custody, and access to\nminors; which matters, by the very nature of the relationship from which\nthey arise, involve issues that are private, personal and involve intimacies. It\nis easily foreseeable therefore, that in most cases that come before the\nFamily Court, the evidence sought to be marshalled would relate to the\nprivate affairs of the litigating parties. If <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_177\">section 14</a> is held not to apply in its\nfull expanse to evidence that impinges on a person&#x27;s right to privacy, then\n<a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_178\">section 14</a> may as well be effaced from the statute. And yet, falling back\nupon the general rule of evidence, the test of admissibility would only be\nrelevance ; and accordingly, even ignoring <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_179\">section 14</a>, fundamental\nconsiderations of fair trial and public justice would warrant that evidence be\nreceived if it is relevant, regardless of how it is collected. No purpose would\ntherefore be served by emasculating the salutary provisions of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_180\">section 14</a> of\nthe Family Courts Act by citing breach of privacy. Looking at it\ndispassionately, even assuming evidence is collected in breach of privacy, at\nbest and at worst, it is the process of collection of evidence that would be\ntainted not the evidence itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">34.      The sequitur to the aforesaid constitutional and legal landscape is\nthat :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">          (a) The settled rule, purely from the standpoint of the law of\n              evidence, is that evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant,\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                         page 40 of 46\n               regardless of how it is collected. Digressing from this settled\n              position would have wide ramifications and consequences; and\n              would be a serious hindrance to judicial proceedings across the\n              board, in several foreseeable and unforeseeable ways. On the\n              other hand, the possible misuse of this rule of evidence,\n              particularly in the context of the right to privacy, can be\n              addressed by prudent exercise of judicial discretion by a court\n              not at the time of receiving evidence but at the time of using\n              evidence at the stage of adjudication ;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">        (b) Merely admitting evidence on the record is not proof of a fact-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">              in-issue or a relevant fact ; admitting evidence is not even\n              reliance by the court on such evidence ; admitting evidence is\n              mere inclusion of evidence in the record, to be assessed on a\n              comprehensive set of factors, parameters and aspects, in the\n              discretion of the court ;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">        (c) The limited threshold test of &#x27;relevance&#x27; ensures that the right\n              of a party to bring evidence to court, and thereby to a fair trial,\n              is not defeated.

The Family Court must bear in mind that tape recordings\n              are   more   susceptible   to   tampering   and   alteration    by\n              transposition, excision etc., which may be difficult to detect;\n              and therefore such evidence must be received and treated with\n              caution and circumspection ; and, to rule-out the possibility of\n              any kind of tampering, the standard of proof applied by a court\n              for the authenticity and accuracy of a tape recording should be\n              more stringent as compared to other documentary evidence;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_99\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438183\" id=\"span_94\">(g) In the context of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_189\">section 50</a> of the NDPS Act, in <a href=\"/doc/1438183/\" id=\"a_190\">Baldev Singh</a>\n              (supra) the Supreme Court has said that while considering the\n              aspect of fair trial, the nature of evidence obtained and the\n              nature of the safeguard violated are both relevant factors. If\n              therefore, evidence has been collected in a search conducted in\n              violation of the statutory mandate of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_191\">section 50</a> of the NDPS\n              Act, the admission of such evidence would make the trial\n              unfair ; and in that circumstance, the evidence must be\n              excluded. <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_192\">Under the Family Courts Act</a>, on the other hand, the\n              statutory mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_193\">section 14</a> is to relax the rules of\n              admissibility of evidence, which relaxation must therefore\n              guide the Family Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                     page 43 of 46\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\"> 35.    That being said however, considering the breadth of the power\nconferred upon it under <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_194\">section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, some\nsafeguards are required to be considered by the Family Court while\nexercising its power to receive evidence under that provision. Firstly, even\nthough a given piece of evidence may have been admitted on the record, the\nFamily Court must be extremely circumspect in what evidence it chooses to\nrely upon in deciding the dispute, particularly the authenticity and\ngenuineness of the evidence, for which stringent standards must be applied.\nSecondly, if in its opinion the nature of the evidence sought to be adduced is\ninappropriate, embarrassing or otherwise sensitive in nature for any of the\nlitigating parties, or for that matter for some other person not directly\nconnected with the litigation, the court may restrict the parties who are\npresent in court at the time of considering such evidence ; or may anonymise\nor redact the evidence ; or may conduct in-camera proceedings so as not to\ncause distress to any person or party, while at the same time not hesitating to\nreceive evidence that the Family Court considers necessary for effectively\ndeciding the dispute. All proceedings must be conducted strictly within the\nbounds of decency and propriety; and no opportunity should be given to any\nparty to create a spectacle in the guise of producing evidence. Thirdly, in\negregious cases, the Family Court may initiate or direct initiation of legal\naction against a litigating party or other person, who may appear guilty of\nprocuring evidence by illegal means. Any party aggrieved by the production\nof such evidence would also be at liberty to initiate appropriate proceedings,\nwhether in civil or criminal law, against concerned parties for procuring\nevidence illegally, although the initiation or pendency of such proceeding\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                     page 44 of 46\n shall not make the evidence so produced inadmissible before the Family\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">36.      It may be noted that in the impugned order the Family Court has\nexpressed its subjective opinion that the recording comprised in the CD will\ncertainly assist it in deciding the dispute between the parties ; and that\ntherefore the evidence on the CD is relevant. Even otherwise, the\nconversation between the wife and her friend, which is the subject matter of\nrecording on the CD, in which she is alleged to have spoken about the\nhusband and his parents, would be a &#x27;relevant fact&#x27; as understood in law,\nupon a combined reading of <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_195\">sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_196\">7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_197\">8</a> of the Evidence Act. To that\nextent therefore, the contents on the CD are relevant for purposes of the\ndivorce proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">37.      While consistency in law is of utmost importance and law must get its\nfull play regardless of the fact situation, this court must record the unease it\nfeels with regard to a certain aspect that has arisen in this matter. Marriage is\na relationship to which sanctity is still attached in our society. Merely\nbecause rules of evidence favour a liberal approach for admitting evidence\nin court in aid of dispensation of justice, this should not be taken as approval\nfor everyone to adopt any illegal means to collect evidence, especially in\nrelationships of confidence such as marriage. If the right to adduce evidence\ncollected by surreptitious means in a marital or family relationship is\navailable without any qualification or consequences, it could potentially\ncreate havoc in people&#x27;s personal and family lives and thereby in the society\nat large. For instance, if a spouse has the carte blanche to install a recording\ndevice in a bedroom or other private space or to adopt any means\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\nC.M.(M) 40/2019                                                       page 45 of 46\n whatsoever to collect evidence against the partner, even if in circumstances\nof matrimonial discord, it would be difficult to foresee the length to which a\nspouse may go in doing so ; and such possibility would itself spell the end of\nthe marital relationship. It is not uncommon for spouses to continue living\ntogether, even in matrimonial strife, for years on-end. So, while law must\ntrump sentiment, a salutary rule of evidence or a beneficent statutory\nprovision, must not be taken as a license for illegal collection of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">38.
