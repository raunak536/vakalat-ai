The present appeal is against the judgment and decree\n\n     dated 07.10.2017 passed by the First Addl. Principal\n\n     Judge,   Family   Court   Durg   whereby    the   suit    for\n\n     declaration that the plaintiff is not the biological father\n\n     of the defendant was dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">  2. According to the plaint, on a report being made by\n\n     mother of respondent, a sessions case was registered\n\n     against the appellant<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_1\"> u/s 376</a> of IPC wherein he was\n\n     acquitted. At the time of birth of the child Dhanush Lal,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                              2</span>\n\n  the name of plaintiff Chummanlal Sahu (appellant\n\n  herein) was got recorded as father. The appellant\n\n  contended that he never had physical relations with the\n\n  mother to whom child Dhanush Lal was born. As such,\n\n  the plaintiff cannot be declared to be a biological father\n\n  of Dhanush Lal Sahu and declaration was sought for to\n\n  that effect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3. The defendant(s) filed their written statement and stated\n\n  that in Sessions case registered under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 376</a> IPC,\n\n  certain compromise was effected and the prosecutrix\n\n  was examined before the Court wherein she           made a\n\n  statement in favour of the plaintiff, therefore, the\n\n  plaintiff was acquitted.   During the cross examination\n\n  before the Court in the said criminal case, when a\n\n  question was posed to her as to whether she is ready\n\n  and willing to go with the plaintiff if the accused plaintiff\n\n  marries and keeps her as wife, she answered that she is\n\n  ready and willing to marry the plaintiff but the marriage\n\n  should be in the Court. In the said case, during the\n\n  statement made of accused<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_3\"> u/s 313</a> of CrPC, the\n\n  appellant/ plaintiff also stated that if the complainant\n\n  wants to marry and stay with him, then he is ready and\n\n  willing to keep her. In the written statement, it is further\n\n  contended that the birth of child Dhanush is an outcome\n\n  of physical relations developed between the plaintiff and\n\n  mother of respondent, therefore, the name of plaintiff\n\n  got recorded in the birth certificate. The learned family\n\n  Court dismissed the suit of the plaintiff.      Hence, this\n\n  appeal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4. Learned counsel for the appellant would submit that\n\n  there is no evidence on record that at any point of time,\n\n  the mother of the defendant was in relation with the\n\n  plaintiff appellant. He therefore submits that in absence\n\n  of any evidence showing physical relations between the\n\n  plaintiff and mother Durpat Bai, the Court below ought\n\n  to have passed a declaratory decree and only on the\n\n  basis presumption, the inference cannot be drawn that\n\n  the plaintiff is biological father of Dhanush Lal Sahu.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5. No representation is made on behalf of the respondent\n\n  despite repeated calls.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">6. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and\n\n  have   also   perused     the   evidence   of   the   plaintiff\n\n  Chummanlal Sahu. In the cross examination of the\n\n  plaintiff, he admits that a case<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s 376</a> IPC was\n\n  registered against him in the year 2009 and before he\n\n  was arrested, child Dhanush was born. It was further\n\n  admitted that after birth of Dhanush, a meeting was held\n\n  between the parents of the plaintiff and parents of the\n\n  girl and subsequently during Chhatti ceremony of child,\n\n  his parents sent clothes and other ornaments etc.          He\n\n  further admitted that after Chhatti programme          that is\n\n  after birth of the children, the mother of child came to\n\n  his house.    Thereafter some dispute took place. He\n\n  denied to have given any contrary statement during the\n\n  course of evidence of accused recorded in sessions case\n\n  to the effect that he was ready and willing to marry and\n\n  keep the mother of respondent. He further denied to\n\n  have given any answer to        question no.32 during the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               4</span>\n\n  cross examination of accused to the effect that he is\n\n  ready and willing to marry and keep the complainant\n\n  with him if she wants to marry and stay with him,\n\n  therefore, he be acquitted.        The birth certificate was\n\n  marked as Ex.P-1 wherein the name of child Dhanushlal,\n\n  and the name of Chumman Lal stand recorded              along\n\n  with the name of mother.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">7. In the Statement of D.W.1, she has deposed that on the\n\n  pretext of marriage, the plaintiff developed physical\n\n  relations with her but when she became pregnant, he\n\n  refused to marry and out of that relation, a child was\n\n  born. In the cross examination of the plaintiff/appellant,\n\n  a question was posed by the Court that whether he is\n\n  ready to undergo DNA test. Though the objection was\n\n  made on behalf of the plaintiff/appellant but the court\n\n  allowed such question for the reason that it was a\n\n  relevant point       as the very paternity of child was in\n\n  question.   The      appellant   straight-away    refused   to\n\n  undergo DNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_4\">8. The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_5\">Sharda v. Dharampal</a> (2003)\n\n  4 SCC 493 has dealt with similar issue when the DNA\n\n  test is sought by one of the parties and at para 20\n\n  referred to the decision rendered by English Court in\n\n  B.R.B. Versus J.B        (1968) 2 All ER 1023 wherein\n\n  it was held thus :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">              &quot;A Judge of the High Court has power to\n          order a blood test whenever it is in the best\n          interest of the child. The Judges can be trusted\n          to exercise this discretion wisely.          No limit-\n          condition or bound is set up to the way in which\n          Judges exercise their discretion.        The object of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 5</span>\n\n           the court always is to find out the truth. When\n           scientific   advances        give   fresh   means     of\n           ascertaining   it,       there   should   not   be   any\n           hesitations to use those means whenever the\n           occasion requires&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_6\">9. Further, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_6\">Goutam Kundu v. State of\n\n   W.B.</a> AIR 1993 SC 2295 initially the Court has held\n\n   that Courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter\n\n   of course and whenever applications are made for such\n\n   prayers in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for\n\n   blood test cannot be entertained. It was further held that\n\n   the Court must carefully examine as to what would be\n\n   the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it\n\n   will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and\n\n   the mother as an unchaste woman and therefore no\n\n   person can be compelled to give sample of blood for\n\n   analysis.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167495843\" id=\"span_7\">10. The said finding was further considered in case of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/167495843/\" id=\"a_7\">Sharda vs. Dharampal</a>              (supra) and the Court held\n\n   that if the respondent avoids such medical examination\n\n   on the ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or\n\n   for that matter right to personal liberty as enshrined\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, then it may\n\n   in most of such cases become impossible to arrive at a\n\n   conclusion. It was further held that no right to privacy\n\n   specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\n   India and with the extensive interpretation of the phrase\n\n   &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article\n\n   21</a>, it cannot be treated as an absolute right. It was held\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  6</span>\n\n   that some limitations on this right have to be imposed\n\n   and particularly where two competing interests clash.\n\n   The <a href=\"/doc/167495843/\" id=\"a_11\">Court further held</a> if for arriving at the satisfaction of\n\n   the court and to protect the right of a party to the lis\n\n   who may otherwise be found to be incapable of\n\n   protecting   his   own   interest,   the court      passes    an\n\n   appropriate order, the question of such action being\n\n   violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India would\n\n   not arise. It was further held that the court having\n\n   regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India must also\n\n   see to it that the right of a person to defend himself\n\n   must be adequately protected. The limitation was further\n\n   imposed that court cannot order for a roving inquiry and\n\n   there must have sufficient materials before it to enable it\n\n   to exercise its discretion.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11. Lately thereafter the Supreme Court in Narayan Dutt\n\n   Tiwari v. Rohit Shekhar (2012) 12 SCC 554                     at\n\n   Para 40 has reproduced the observations from the Court\n\n   of Appeal (Civil Division) of H. and A. (Children Paternity\n\n   Tests), which reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;40. Though in the light of what we have held, it is\n            not strictly relevant, but we are unable to restrain\n            ourselves from recording what the Court of Appeal\n            (Civil Division) observed in H. and A. (Children)\n            (Paternity : Blood Tests), In re- 2002 EWCA (Civ)\n            383 :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133524703\" id=\"span_9\">&quot;Over thirty years ago in his speech in <a href=\"/doc/133524703/\" id=\"a_14\">S. v. McC Lord\n            Hodson</a> said : (AC pp. 57 F-58 A)\n\n            &#x27;......The only disadvantage to the child which is put\n            forward as an argument against the use of a blood\n            test, not for therapeutic purposes but to ascertain\n            paternity, is that the child is exposed to the risk that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                         7</span>\n\n     he may lose the protection of the presumption of\n     legitimacy.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     Without seeking to depreciate the value of this\n     presumption it is, I think, fair to say that whatever\n     may have been the position in the past the general\n     attitude towards illegitimacy has changed and the\n     legal incidents of being born a bastard are now\n     almost non-existent. I need not dilate upon this, for I\n     recognise that it is impossible to say that there is no\n     stigma of bastardy even though it be no more than\n     the indirect stigma of the imputation of unchastity to\n     the mother of the child so described. On the other\n     hand, it is difficult to conceive of cases where,\n     assuming illegitimacy in fact, it is to the advantage\n     of the child that this legal status of legitimacy should\n     be preserved only perhaps to be displaced by firm\n     evidence of illegitimacy decided later in his or her\n     life from a blood test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     The interests of justice in the abstract are best\n     served by the ascertainment of the truth and their\n     must be few cases where the interests of children\n     can be shown to be best served by the suppression\n     of truth. Scientific evidence of blood groups has\n     been available since the early part of this century\n     and the progress of serology has been so rapid that\n     in many cases certainty or near certainty can be\n     reached in the ascertainment of paternity. Why\n     should the risk be taken of a judicial decision being\n     made which is factually wrong and may later be\n     demonstrated to be wrong ?&#x27;\n\nThose   principles   have   been   consistently   applied   in\nsubsequent cases, including H. (A Minor) (Blood Tests :\nParental Rights), In re-1997 Fam 89 : (1996) 3 WLR 506\nand T. (A Child) (DNA Tests : Paternity), In re- (2001) 3\nFCR 577. The Jude sought to distinguish those two\nauthorities in his concluding paragraph, which I have cited\nabove. It draws the distinction that in those two cases\nthere were serious doubts as to the husband&#x27;s procreative\ncapacities. I do not consider that factual distinction begins\nto displace the points of principle to be drawn from the\ncases, first that the interests of justice are best served by\nthe ascertainment of the truth and second that the court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                 8</span>\n\n         should be furnished with the best available science and\n         not confined to such unsatisfactory alternatives as\n         presumptions and inferences. It seems to me obvious that\n         all the Lord Hodson expressed in the passage that I have\n         cited applies with even greater force and logic in a later\n         era. First there have been huge scientific advances with\n         the arrival of DNA testing. Scientists no longer require\n         blood, thus removing what for some is the unbearable\n         process of its extraction. Of even greater importance is\n         the abandonment of the legal concept of legitimacy\n         achieved by the Family Law Act, 1987.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n      It was further observed that paternity of any child is to\n\n      be established by science and not by legal presumption\n\n      or inference or by a long and acrimonious trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_12\">12.   Subsequently, the Supreme Court in case of Dipanwita\n\n      Roy   Versus Ronobroto (Supra)            has reiterated the\n\n      principles laid down in       <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_15\">Bhabani Prasad Jena v.\n\n      Orissa State Commission</a> for Women (2010) 8\n\n      SCC 633 , which are reproduced herein below :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_13\">&quot;14. A similar issue case to be adjudicated upon\n              by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_16\">Bhabani Prasad Jena v. Orissa State\n              Commission</a> for Women, wherein this Court held as\n              under :</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                  21. In a matter where paternity of a child is in\n              issue before the court, the use of DNA test is an\n              extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. One view is\n              that when modern science gives the means of\n              ascertaining the paternity of a child, there should not\n              be any hesitation to use those means whenever the\n              occasion requires. The other view is that the court\n              must be reluctant in the use of such scientific\n              advances and tools which result in invasion of right\n              to privacy of an individual and may not only be\n              prejudicial to the rights of the parties but may have\n              devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the result\n              of such scientific test may bastardise an innocent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                              9</span>\n\n       child even though his mother and her spouse were\n       living together during the time of conception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           22. In our view, when there is apparent conflict\n       between the right to privacy of a person not to\n       submit himself forcibly to medical examination and\n       duty of the court to reach the truth, the court must\n       exercise its discretion only after balancing the\n       interests of the parties and on due consideration\n       whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is\n       eminently needed. DNA test in a matter relating to\n       paternity of a child should not be directed by the\n       court as a matter of course or in a routine manner,\n       whenever such a request is made. The court has to\n       consider    diverse       aspects    including   presumption\n       under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_17\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons\n       of such order and the test of &#x27;eminent need&#x27; whether\n       it is not possible for the court to reach the truth\n       without use of such test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_16\">23. There is no conflict in the two decisions of\n       this Court, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_18\">Goutam Kundu v. State of W.P.</a>\n       (<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_19\">1993) 3 SCC 418 and Sharda v. Dharampal</a>, 2003\n       (4) SCC 493. In Goutam Kundu [(1993) 3 SCC 418] , it\n       has been laid down that courts in India cannot order\n       blood test as a matter of course and such prayers\n       cannot be granted to have roving inquiry; there must\n       be strong prima facie case and the court must\n       carefully     examine      as   to   what   would    be     the\n       consequence of ordering the blood test. In Sharda\n       [2003   (4)    SCC    493]      while   concluding   that    a\n       matrimonial court has power to order a person to\n       undergo a medical test, it was reiterated that the\n       court should exercise such a power if the applicant\n       has a strong prima facie case and there is sufficient\n       material before the court. Obviously, therefore, any\n       order for DNA test can be given by the court only if a\n       strong prima facie case is made out for such a\n       course.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">Therefore, in view of the above legal position, if a strong\n\nprima facie case is made out, it would be permissible for\n\na Court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                              10</span>\n\n     determine the veracity of the allegations.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">13. In sum and substance, the Supreme Court in            case of\n\n    Dipanwita Roy (supra) has observed that if the DNA\n\n    test has been ordered it would be open for a party to\n\n    expose the existence of fact by DNA test and the DNA\n\n    will determine conclusively the veracity of accusation\n\n    levelled by the husband against her. However, in case\n\n    he/she declines to comply with the direction issued by\n\n    the Court, the allegation would be determined by the\n\n    court concerned by drawing the presumption of nature\n\n    contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_20\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act in\n\n    terms of Illustration (h) thereof. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 114</a> as also\n\n    Illustration (h) is relevant here and quoted below:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">           &quot;114.     Court may presume existence of\n           certain   facts. --The court may presume the\n           existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have\n           happened, regard being had to the common\n           course of natural events, human conduct and\n           public and private business, in their relation to the\n           facts of the particular case.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                &quot;Illustration (h) - that if a man refuses to\n           answer a question which he is not compelled to\n           answer by law, the answer, if given, would be\n           unfavourable to him;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">14. Applying the aforesaid legal position in the instant case\n\n    and considering the question posed to the appellant and\n\n    the answer given by him before the court below, when\n\n    the appellant himself sought for a declaration that he is\n\n    not a biological father of child, then he should have\n\n    courageous enough to enter into witness box for the\n\n    evidence qua the DNA test. Certainly, the Court cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     11</span>\n\n          force the appellant to undergo DNA test but in case of\n\n          refusal to comply with the direction of Court to expose\n\n          the existence of fact that might have occurred, by such\n\n          test, the adverse inference can be drawn. The statement\n\n          of the plaintiff that after the birth of child, the father and\n\n          mother performed certain rituals would be a relevant\n\n          fact which can be considered to presume existence of\n\n          certain facts with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence\n\n          Act and illustration (h) thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">      15. In the result,   after going through the entire facts and\n\n          evidence on record, we do not find any merit in the\n\n          appeal warranting interference by this Court in the\n\n          impugned judgment and decree as the findings given by\n\n          the court below are just and proper. Accordingly, the\n\n          appeal fails and is dismissed.      The parties shall bear\n\n          their own costs.\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">                 Sd/-                               Sd/-\n          (Goutam Bhaduri)               (Radhakishan Agrawal)\n               Judge                           Judge\n\n\n\nRao\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                        12</span>\n\n                            HEAD-NOTES\n\n\n(I)     If a strong prima facie case is made out, the Court\n\ncan     order     DNA test to determine the veracity of the\n\nallegations.\n\n(ii)           Pursuant to such order, if he/she refuses to\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">comply the direction to expose the existence of fact by DNA\n\ntest,      the    allegation   would    be determined      by     court\n\nconcerned by drawing presumption in terms of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_23\">section 114</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act and Illustration (h) thereof.\n\n\n\n(I)            ;fn izFke n`&quot;V;k dksbZ etcwr izdj.k curk gks rks\n\nU;k;ky;] vkjksiksa dh lR;rk fu/kkZfjr djus gsrq Mh-,u-,- ijh{k.k djk;s\n\ntkus dk vkns&#x27;k ns ldrk gSA\n\n(II)           ,sls vkns&#x27;k ds ikyu esa] ;fn og Mh-,u-,- ijh{k.k ls izkIr\n\nrF; ds vfLrRo dks iznf&#x27;kZr fd;s tkus ds funsZ&#x27;k ds ikyu ls bUdkj\n\ndjrk@djrh gS] rks lacaf/kr U;k;ky; }kjk lk{; vf/kfu;e dh /kkjk 114\n\nrFkk mlds n`&quot;Vkar ¼t½ ds lUnHkZ esa vo/kkj.kk dj vkjksiksa dk fu/kkZj.k\n\nfd;k tkosxkA\n </p>","numcites":10,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Chattisgarh High Court","citetid":146987716,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"paternity tests","formInput":"paternity%20tests"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"dna","formInput":"dna"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"\"strong prima facie case\" ","formInput":"%22strong%20prima%20facie%20case%22%20"},{"value":"376,","formInput":"376%2C"},{"value":"legitimacy ","formInput":"legitimacy%20"},{"value":"goutam kundu","formInput":"goutam%20kundu"},{"value":"\"prima facie case\"","formInput":"%22prima%20facie%20case%22"},{"value":"paternity","formInput":"paternity"},{"value":"Biological father","formInput":"Biological%20father"},{"value":"Sessions case ","formInput":"Sessions%20case%20"},{"value":"Blood test","formInput":"Blood%20test"},{"value":"\"article 21\"","formInput":"%22article%2021%22"},{"value":"prima facie case","formInput":"prima%20facie%20case"},{"value":"birth ","formInput":"birth%20"},{"value":"Article 21  filter:  case laws","formInput":"Article%2021%20%20filter%3A%20%20case%20laws"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"court-may-presume-existence-of-certain-facts","formInput":"tag:court-may-presume-existence-of-certain-facts"},{"value":"rape","formInput":"tag:rape"},{"value":"birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy","formInput":"tag:birth-during-marriage-is-conclusive-proof-of-legitimacy"},{"value":"power-to-summon-persons-for-evidence","formInput":"tag:power-to-summon-persons-for-evidence"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
