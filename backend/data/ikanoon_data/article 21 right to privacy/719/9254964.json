The parties are referred to as per their original\n\nrankings before the Trial Court as complainant and accused to\n\navoid the confusion and for the convenience of the Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">        3.   The   factual   matrix   of   the   case   is   that   the\n\ncomplainant married the accused on 05.11.1974 and the said\n\nmarriage was dissolved on 09.08.1978 as per the decree of the\n\nCourt. It is the allegation of the complainant that after the\n\ndissolution of the marriage, the accused had been writing open\n\nletters to the complainant containing per se defamatory matters\n\nto her residential address as well as official address, wherein the\n\ncomplainant was working and also addressing letters to her\n\ncolleagues. The said letters, which were written in the open\n\ncards have been read by her colleagues. The accused has\n\ninsulted the womanhood of the complainant describing her as a\n\n&#x27;born prostitute&#x27; and threatened that he would make publication\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 3</span>\n\n\n\nin all newspapers to that effect. The contents of those letters\n\nattribute unchastity to her and per se defamatory. Many of the\n\nletters are in the form of open cards sent to her office address\n\nand also addressed to her Bank Manager and thereby it has been\n\nread by her colleagues and others and defamed the complainant.\n\nHence, the complainant filed the complaint against the accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">      4.    The Trial Court after considering both oral and\n\ndocumentary evidence placed on record, vide judgment dated\n\n29.11.2006 found the accused guilty for the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 500</a> of IPC and sentenced him to undergo simple\n\nimprisonment for a period of one year and also to pay a fine of\n\nRs.5,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple\n\nimprisonment for 30 days. However, the accused was acquitted\n\nfor the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 504</a> of IPC.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      5.    The accused being aggrieved by the judgment of\n\nconviction, preferred Crl.A.No.367/2006 before the Appellate\n\nCourt. The Appellate Court vide judgment dated 03.09.2010 set\n\naside the judgment of the Trial Court. Hence, this present appeal\n\nis filed by the complainant/appellant.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      6.    The main grounds urged in this appeal is that the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge has not appreciated the evidence on\n\nrecord and no valid and justifiable reasons are assigned to upset\n\nthe judgment of conviction. The Appellate Court failed to take\n\nnote of the fact that the letters written by the accused are in\n\nopen post cards and some of the letters are addressed to the\n\nManager and staff of the Bank. Moreover, the evidence of the\n\ncomplainant - P.W.1 coupled with evidence of P.W.2 and P.W.3\n\nproves the publication. The well reasoned judgment of conviction\n\npassed by the Trial Court has been set aside on the ground that\n\nthere is nothing on record to show that the contents of those\n\nletters were made known to the public. The finding of the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge in the appeal is factually incorrect. The\n\ningredients of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 500</a> of IPC have been\n\nproved beyond reasonable doubt. The Trial Court has rightly\n\nconvicted the accused and the Appellate Court has committed\n\nillegality in upsetting the judgment of conviction. It is also\n\ncontended   that   acquittal   of   the   accused   for   the   offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 504</a> of IPC by the Trial Court is also\n\nunsustainable. Hence, it requires interference of this Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                5</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">     7.    The learned counsel for the complainant/appellant in\n\nhis oral arguments vehemently contended that the Appellate\n\nCourt has committed an error in coming to the conclusion that\n\nthere is no material with regard to the publication of per se\n\ndefamatory allegations made in the letters. The counsel would\n\nalso submit that P.W.4 - handwriting expert has categorically\n\ndeposed that the documents of Exs.P.1 to 7 are in the\n\nhandwriting of the accused and has given the report in terms of\n\nExs.P.19 and 20 i.e., the report and certificate of handwriting\n\nexamination. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the\n\nletters are addressed to the complainant as well as the Bank\n\nManager, wherein the complainant was working. P.W.3 who was\n\nworking as Manager during the period in which the letters were\n\naddressed turned hostile. P.W.3 was won over by the accused\n\nand the Appellate Court ought not to have acquitted the\n\naccused, which amounts to casuality. The accused has also not\n\nled any defence evidence and the Appellate Court committed an\n\nerror in acquitting the accused even though the accused has not\n\ndenied Ex.P.4 - open post card, which was sent to the Manager.\n\nWhen the open post card was sent to the Manager, both the\n\nManager and the staff of the Bank would read the contents of it.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n\nHence, the reasoning of the Trial Court that the same was not\n\npublished, is nothing but committing an illegality in passing the\n\nacquittal order. The Court also cannot expect mathematical\n\nniceties while appreciating the evidence available on record and\n\naddressing the letters to others itself is a publication. The\n\nlearned counsel would also contend that the very conduct of the\n\naccused also shall be taken note of and Exs.P.10 to 14 are\n\nwritten subsequent to the filing of the complaint during the\n\npendency of the complaint and those letters are sent through\n\npost in open card.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        8.     The learned counsel brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt    the    definition    of    <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section   499</a>   of   IPC,   particularly\n\nexplanation 3 and would contend that the said letters which have\n\nbeen written to the complainant as well as the Bank Manager,\n\nare per se defamatory, which diminishes the reputation of the\n\ncomplainant. The learned counsel referring the material available\n\non record and also the reasoning given by the Trial Court would\n\nsubmit       that   the   Trial    Court   appreciated   both    oral   and\n\ndocumentary evidence placed on record and discussed in detail\n\nwhile forming the opinion that the accused has committed an\n\noffence. The approach of the Appellate Court is casual in nature\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 7</span>\n\n\n\nand the reasons assigned are illegal and it requires interference\n\nof this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"681866\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1737184\" id=\"span_7\">9.    The learned counsel for the appellant/complainant in\n\nhis argument relied upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1737184/\" id=\"a_8\">SUKHWANT SINGH AND OTHERS v.\n\nSTATE OF PUNJAB</a> reported in (2009) 7 SCC 559 and brought\n\nto my notice paragraph No.3 of the judgment, wherein it is held\n\nthat the reputation of a person is his valuable asset, and is a\n\nfacet of his right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution as held in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/681866/\" id=\"a_10\">Deepak Bajaj v.

The learned counsel relied on the judgment of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/145623382/\" id=\"a_11\">SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY v.\n\nUNION OF INDIA, MINISTRY OF LAW AND OTHERS</a>\n\nreported in (2016) 7 SCC 221 and brought to my notice\n\nparagraph Nos.25.1, 46, 47, 48, 52, 53, 168, 169 and 195 of the\n\njudgment. Referring these paragraphs, the learned counsel\n\nwould submit that the Apex Court has discussed in detail\n\nregarding the reputation of a person and referred Bhagavad Gita\n\nand definition of <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 499</a> and offence under <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 500</a> of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 8</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a> and the judgments of different countries. The Apex Court in\n\nparagraph No.47 of the judgment held that the right to the\n\nenjoyment of a private reputation, unassailed by malicious\n\nslander is of ancient origin, and is necessary to human society. A\n\ngood reputation is an element of personal security, and is\n\nprotected by the Constitution equally with the right to the\n\nenjoyment of life, liberty and property.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1899469\" id=\"span_10\">In paragraph No.52, the\n\nApex Court has referred to the case of <a href=\"/doc/1899469/\" id=\"a_15\">State of Gujarat v. High</a>\n\nCourt of Gujarat reported in (1998) 7 SCC 392, wherein in\n\nparagraph No.99 it is held that an honour which is lost or life\n\nwhich is snuffed out cannot be recompensed.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">      11.   The learned counsel referring paragraph No.168\n\nbrought to the notice of this Court that the criminal offence\n\nemphasizes on the intention or harm. <a href=\"/doc/1106981/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 44</a> of IPC defines\n\n&quot;injury&quot;. It denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any\n\nperson, in body, mind, reputation or property. Thus, the word\n\n&quot;injury&quot; encapsulates harm caused to the reputation of any\n\nperson. It also takes into account the harm caused to a person&#x27;s\n\nbody and mind. <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 499</a> provides for harm caused to the\n\nreputation of a person, that is, the complainant.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                  9</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">      12.   The learned counsel also brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt paragraph No.169 of the judgment, wherein it is held that\n\nit would be sufficient to show that the accused intended or knew\n\nor had reason to believe that the imputation made by him would\n\nharm the reputation of the complainant, irrespective of whether\n\nthe complainant actually suffered directly or indirectly from the\n\nimputation alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">      13.   The learned counsel also brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt paragraph No.195 of the judgment, wherein it is held that,\n\nin that context criminal defamation which is in existence in the\n\nform of <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 499</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_19\">500</a> of IPC is not a restriction on free\n\nspeech that can be characterized as disproportionate. Right to\n\nfree speech cannot mean that a citizen can defame the other.\n\nProtection of reputation is a fundamental right. It is also a\n\nhuman right. Cumulatively it serves the social interest.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      14.   The learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the\n\njudgment    of   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of\n\nR. RAJAGOPAL ALIAS R.R. GOPAL AND ANOTHER v. STATE\n\nOF T.N.

However, it must be remembered that\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">Indian Penal Code</a> exhaustively codifies the law relating to\n\noffences with which it deals and the rules of the common law\n\ncannot be resorted to for inventing exemptions which are not\n\nexpressly enacted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"75389836\" id=\"span_14\">16.

The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/813088/\" id=\"a_39\">MURARI LAL v. STATE OF\n\nMADHYA PRADESH</a> reported in (1980) 1 SCC 704 and\n\nbrought to the notice of this Court paragraph Nos.4 and 6 of the\n\njudgment, which read as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          &quot;4. We will first consider the argument, a stale\n      argument often heard, particularly in criminal courts,\n      that the opinion-evidence of a handwriting expert\n      should    not    be    acted   upon    without    substantial\n      corroboration. We shall presently point out how the\n      argument cannot be justified on principle or precedent.\n      We begin with the observation that the expert is no\n      accomplice. There is no justification for condemning his\n      opinion-evidence to the same class of evidence as that\n      of an accomplice and insist upon corroboration. True, it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                 15</span>\n\n\n\nhas occasionally been said on very high authority that\nit would be hazardous to base a conviction solely on\nthe opinion of a handwriting expert. But, the hazard in\naccepting the opinion of any expert, handwriting expert\nor any other kind of expert, is not because experts, in\ngeneral,   are     unreliable    witnesses-the        quality    of\ncredibility or incredibility being one which an expert\nshares with all other witnesses-, but because all human\njudgment is fallible and an expert may go wrong\nbecause of some defect of observation, some error of\npremises or honest mistake of conclusion. The more\ndeveloped and the more perfect a science, the less the\nchance of an incorrect opinion and the converse if the\nscience is less developed and imperfect. The science of\nidentification    of   finger-prints      has    attained     near\nperfection and the risk of an incorrect opinion is\npractically non-existent. On the other hand, the science\nof identification of handwriting is not nearly so perfect\nand the risk is, therefore, higher. But that is a far cry\nfrom doubting the opinion of a handwriting expert as\nan   invariable   rule   and    insisting      upon   substantial\ncorroboration in every case, howsoever the opinion\nmay be backed by the soundest of reasons. It is hardly\nfair to an expert to view his opinion with an initial\nsuspicion and to treat him as an inferior sort of\nwitness.   His    opinion   has      to   be    tested   by     the\nacceptability of the reasons given by him. An expert\ndeposes and not decides. His duty &#x27;is to furnish the\njudge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                 16</span>\n\n\n\nthe accuracy of his conclusion, so as to enable the\njudge to form his own independent judgment by the\napplication of these criteria to the facts proved in\nevidence&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     6. Expert testimony is made relevant by <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n45</a> of the Evidence Act and where the Court has to\nform an opinion upon a point as to identity of\nhandwriting, the opinion of a person `specially skilled&#x27;\n`in questions as to identity of handwriting&#x27; is expressly\nmade a relevant fact. There is nothing in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_41\">Evidence\nAct</a>, as for example like illustration (b) to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n114</a> which entitles the Court to presume that an\naccomplice   is   unworthy       of   credit,   unless   he   is\ncorroborated in material particulars which justifies the\ncourt in assuming that a handwriting expert&#x27;s opinion\nin    unworthy    of   credit    unless    corroborated. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_43\">The\nEvidence Act</a> itself (<a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 3</a>) tells us that `a fact is\nsaid to be proved when, after considering the matters\nbefore it, the Court either believes it to exist or\nconsiders its existence so probable that a prudent man\nought, under the circumstances of the particular case,\nto act upon the supposition that it exists&#x27;. It is\nnecessary to occasionally remind ourselves of this\ninterpretation clause in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_45\">Evidence Act</a> lest we set an\nartificial standard of proof not warranted by the\nprovisions of the Act. Further, under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 114</a> of the\nEvidence Act, the Court may presume the existence of\nany fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                   17</span>\n\n\n\n     being had to the common course of natural events,\n     human conduct, and public and private business, in\n     their relation to facts of the particular case. It is also to\n     be noticed that <a href=\"/doc/1458526/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 46</a> of the Evidence Act makes\n     facts, not otherwise relevant, relevant if they support\n     or are inconsistent with the opinions of experts, when\n     such opinions are relevant. So, corroboration may not\n     invariably be insisted upon before acting on the opinion\n     of handwriting expert and there need be no initial\n     suspicion. But, on the facts of a particular case, a court\n     may require corroboration of a varying degree. There\n     can be no hard and fast rule, but nothing will justify\n     the rejection of the opinion of an expert supported by\n     unchallenged reasons on the sole ground that it is not\n     corroborated. The approach of a court while dealing\n     with the opinion of a handwriting expert should be to\n     proceed cautiously, probe the reasons for the opinion,\n     consider all other relevant evidence and decide finally\n     to accept or reject it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">     23.   In paragraph No.7 of the judgment, the Apex Court\n\nhas held that apart from principle, let us examine if precedents\n\njustify invariable insistence on corroboration and came to a\n\nconclusion that the observations made in paragraph Nos.8 and 9\n\nlend no support to any requirement as to corroboration of expert\n\ntestimony. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1413122\" id=\"span_28\">In paragraph No.10 considering the case of <a href=\"/doc/1413122/\" id=\"a_48\">Magan\n\nBihari Lal v.

But we do not think that the observations were\n\nmeant to be observations of general application or as laying\n\ndown any legal principle. It was plainly intended to be a rule of\n\ncaution and not a rule of law as is clear from the statement it\n\nhas almost become a rule of law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">     Paragraph No.11 of the judgment reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           &quot;11.   We are firmly of the opinion that there is no\n     rule of law, nor any rule of prudence which has\n     crystalized into a rule of law, that opinion evidence of a\n     handwriting expert must never be acted upon, unless\n     substantially corroborated. But, having due regard to\n     the imperfect nature of the science of identification of\n     handwriting, the approach, as we indicated earlier,\n     should be one of caution. Reasons for the opinion must\n     be carefully probed and examined. All other relevant\n     evidence must be considered. In appropriate cases,\n     corroboration may be sought. In cases where the\n     reasons for the opinion are convincing and there is no\n     reliable evidence throwing a doubt, the uncorroborated\n     testimony of an handwriting expert may be accepted.\n     There cannot be any inflexible rule on a matter which,\n     in the ultimate analysis, is no more than a question of\n     testimonial weight. We have said so much because this\n     is an argument frequently met with in subordinate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                   19</span>\n\n\n\n      courts and sentences torn out of context from the\n      judgments of this Court are often flaunted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1326499\" id=\"span_31\">24.

It may also be\n\nproved by internal evidence afforded by the contents of the\n\ndocument. This last mode of proof by the contents may be of\n\nconsiderable value where the disputed document purports to be\n\na link in a chain of correspondence, some links in which are\n\nproved to the satisfaction of the Court. In such a situation the\n\nperson who is the recipient of the document, be it either a letter\n\nor a telegram, would be in a reasonably good position both with\n\nreference to his prior knowledge of the writing or the signature\n\nof the alleged sender limited though it may be, as also his\n\nknowledge of the subject matter of the chain of correspondence\n\nto speak to its authorship.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  21</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">      27.     Having referred all these judgments, the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant would submit that the complainant has\n\nproved that the letters Exs.P.1 to 7 are written by the accused.\n\nThose documents are sent to the handwriting expert and the\n\nhandwriting    expert   who    has     been   examined    as   P.W.4,\n\nauthoritatively deposed before the Court that the handwriting in\n\nS1 to S4, which are letter correspondence of the accused with\n\nthe officers are examined and based on those admitted\n\nhandwriting, the expert has given the opinion that Exs.P.1 to 7\n\nare in the handwriting of the accused. Though the complainant\n\nhas not filed any complaint against the accused in respect of\n\nExs.P.10 to 12, those documents are produced with regard to\n\nthe conduct of the accused that even after the filing of the\n\ncomplaint also, he has continued to write such letters. The Trial\n\nCourt has appreciated both oral and documentary evidence\n\nplaced on record and also the contents of the documents and\n\nrightly   convicted   the   accused.    The   Appellate   Court   has\n\ncommitted an error in upsetting the judgment of the Trial Court\n\nin coming to the conclusion that there was no any publication of\n\nthe contents of the documents and the approach of the Appellate\n\nCourt is erroneous in passing illegal order.

The complainant has also not filed any complaint in\n\nrespect of Exs.P.10 to 12. The learned counsel referring Ex.P.1\n\nwould submit that there is no date and signature on Ex.P.1.\n\nEx.P.2 dated 6.2.1997 and Ex.P.3 dated 22.2.1997 do not bear\n\nthe signature. Ex.P.4 is dated 6.9.1994 which was allegedly\n\naddressed to the Manager and the complaint was filed in 1997,\n\nalmost after three years of the said letter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">      29.

The\n\nlearned counsel also brought to my notice the contents of the\n\ndocuments and would contend that no defamatory allegations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    23</span>\n\n\n\nare made in Ex.P.4.

When there is\n\ndissimilarity,   the     Court   cannot   accept   the   evidence    of\n\nhandwriting expert. The handwriting expert in paragraph No.3 of\n\nhis report has not specified as to which document is having\n\ndissimilarity.

Referring\n\nparagraph No.15 of the judgment, the learned counsel would\n\ncontend that the evidence of a handwriting expert is on the\n\nlower rank in the hierarchy of expert evidence. It is the\n\ndissimilarities which are decisive and not the similarities, while\n\ncomparing admitted handwriting with the disputed one. The\n\nscience of calligraphy is not a perfect science and the instances\n\nare not rare when even the best handwriting expert had not\n\nbeen able to find out the forgery.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">      38.      The learned counsel referring all these judgments\n\nwould submit that first of all the complainant has not proved that\n\nEx.P.7 is in the handwriting of the accused. Ex.P.4 - letter\n\naddressed to the Bank Manager also has not been proved and\n\nthe Bank Manager who has been examined as P.W.3 has not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                 28</span>\n\n\n\nsupported the case of the prosecution for having received the\n\nletter and he turned hostile and his evidence cannot be relied\n\nupon. The complainant has also not explained the contents of\n\nthe documents to show that the contents of the documents are\n\nper se defamatory. The complainant has failed to prove the\n\ningredients of <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 499</a> of IPC. When such being the case, the\n\naccused cannot be convicted for the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 500</a> of IPC. The Trial Judge has committed an error in\n\naccepting the evidence of the complainant inspite there being no\n\nincriminating material against the accused and committed an\n\nerror in holding that the complainant has proved the case. The\n\nAppellate Court considered both oral and documentary evidence\n\nplaced on record in its right perspective and has rightly come to\n\nthe conclusion that there is no publication of the letter and there\n\nis no material before the Court that those documents are\n\npublished and diminished the reputation of the complainant. The\n\nAppellate Court has given the reason while reversing the finding\n\nof the Trial Court. Hence, it does not require any interference of\n\nthis Court and order of acquittal requires to be confirmed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">      39.

The Trial Court acquitted the accused for the offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 504</a> of IPC in coming to the conclusion\n\nthat the complainant has failed to prove the charges under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 504</a> of IPC. Though the complainant in the present\n\nappeal has contended that the acquittal of the accused for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                 32</span>\n\n\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 504</a> of IPC by the Trial Court is\n\nunsustainable, no appeal is filed against the order of acquittal of\n\nthe Trial Court.

Now the question before this Court is whether the\n\nacquittal of the accused for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_77\">Section\n\n500</a> of IPC by the Appellate Court, is in accordance with law and\n\nwhether that order is sustainable in the eye of law. Keeping in\n\nview the contentions urged by both the learned counsel for the\n\ncomplainant and the learned counsel for the accused, this Court\n\nhas to re-appreciate the material on record since divergent\n\nfindings are available before this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">      44.   Keeping in view the respective contentions, first this\n\nCourt would like to refer the allegations made in the complaint\n\nagainst the accused. The gist of the complaint is that the\n\ncomplainant was the wife of the accused and their marriage was\n\nsolemnized in the year 1974 and the said marriage was\n\ndissolved in the year 1978. After dissolving of the marriage, both\n\nwere residing separately. However, it is the contention of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                      33</span>\n\n\n\ncomplainant that the accused used to write letters per se\n\ndefamatory against the complainant and those letters were open\n\nletters addressed to the office address of the complainant and\n\nalso her residential address making insulting allegation in\n\nrespect of womanhood of the complainant. It is contended that\n\nthe said letters described the complainant as a &#x27;born prostitute&#x27;\n\nand also he threatened that he would make publication in all the\n\nnewspapers to that effect. It is the specific allegation that in the\n\nletter dated 6.2.1997 written in two post cards addressed to the\n\ncomplainant an allegation is made about the character of the\n\ncomplainant     describing   her     as   having inherited falsehood,\n\ncheating and untrustworthiness. In the letter dated 22.2.1997\n\nwritten in two unbroken post cards to the office address of the\n\ncomplainant, the accused has written that the complainant was a\n\n&#x27;born prostitute&#x27;, who does not understand culture, values of\n\nhuman relationship and described her brother as a &#x27;pimp&#x27; and\n\n&#x27;funac&#x27; and also he has imputed unchastity to the complainant.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">      45.

The Trial Judge having perused the contents of the\n\ncomplaint and also sworn affidavit, took the cognizance and\n\nsecured the accused and framed the charges against the\n\naccused. The accused appeared and denied the charges. Hence,\n\nthe complainant examined herself as P.W.1 and also examined\n\none witness as P.W.2, who is the complainant witness who spoke\n\nwith regard to the addressing of the letter and working in the\n\nhouse of the complainant. The Bank Manager is examined as\n\nP.W.3 and the handwriting expert is examined as P.W.4 who\n\nexamined Exs.P.1 to 7, 10 to 14 and S1 to S4. The complainant\n\ngot marked the documents at Exs.P.1 to 21(a).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">     47.

The complainant in her chief examination\n\nhas reiterated the contents of the complaint and also got marked\n\nthe letters dated Nil, 6.2.1997, 22.2.1997 and 6.9.1994 as\n\nExs.P.1 to 4, respectively and the letter bearing the seal of Bajpe\n\nPost Office dated 15.7.1996 as Ex.P.5 and another letter in the\n\nletter head of the office of the accused as Ex.P.6 and the letter\n\ndated 23.6.1994 as Ex.P.7. Among these, Exs.P.1 to 5 are open\n\ncards. Ex.P.7 is addressed to the Manager and the staff of the\n\nBank where the complainant was working. Ex.P.8 is the copy of\n\nthe legal notice sent to the accused and Ex.P.9 is the\n\nacknowledgment for having served the notice on the accused.\n\nExs.P.10 to 14 are the open cards alleged to have been written\n\nby the accused after filing of the complaint. Exs.P.15 to 18 are\n\nthe documents which were obtained by this Court from the office\n\nof the accused vide letter dated 16.12.2005.

In the\n\ncross-examination, it is elicited that in the year 1993-94 for the\n\nfirst time after the divorce she received the letter from her\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                 36</span>\n\n\n\nhusband and till then there was no letter correspondence. It is\n\nsuggested that in the year 1994, the accused has caused the\n\nissuance of notice to her through advocate for filing the\n\ndefamation case and the complainant P.W.1 replies that she\n\ndoes not remember the same. However, she admits that notice\n\nwas sent on 21.2.1995 through the counsel to her making the\n\nallegation of making defamation case against her. P.W.1 says\n\nthat she received the last letter in April 2001.     It is suggested\n\nthat the accused has not written any per se defamatory letters\n\nand the said suggestion was denied. It is elicited that there were\n\n35 staff members in her Bank and she cannot say particularly\n\nwhich staff have read the letter. It is elicited that Ex.P.1 does\n\nnot contain the signature and name of the author of the said\n\nletter. P.W.1 admits that handwriting available on Exs.P.1 and 2\n\nare different and those letters also does not contain the name of\n\nthe author of the said letter.

The other letters Exs.P.10 to 14 are marked which are\n\nwritten subsequent to the filing of the complaint.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">      49.   In the cross-examination of P.W.1, it is suggested\n\nthat those letters are created and the same was denied. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                37</span>\n\n\n\nsuggested that Exs.P.1 to 7 are in no way concerned to the\n\naccused and the said suggestion was denied. Typed copy of\n\nthose letters are also produced by further examining the\n\ncomplainant. In the further cross-examination, a suggestion was\n\nmade that Exs.P.10 to 14 are created for the purpose of the case\n\nand those documents are in no way concerned to the accused\n\nand the said suggestion was denied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">     50.

In the cross-examination of P.W.2, it is elicited that\n\nhe does not have any documentary evidence such as ration card,\n\nelection identity card to show that he was residing in any\n\nparticular house. It is further elicited that he does not remember\n\non which date he has received the letter Ex.P.5. The first letter\n\nhe received was Ex.P.5 and after three months thereafter he\n\nreceived another letter and he has only read the address of that\n\nletter and not its contents. He stayed in the house of the\n\ncomplainant for four months after receipt of Ex.P.5 and he has\n\nno records to show that he stayed in the house of the\n\ncomplainant during the year 1996-97. The complainant was not\n\npaying any salary to him. He was not looking after the house of\n\nthe complainant. It is suggested that he is falsely deposing to\n\nthe effect that he has received Ex.P.5 and read the same, but he\n\nclaims that one Ramanna, Postman gave Ex.P.5 in his hand.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">     52.

He does not remember having received any\n\nletter containing anything about the complainant. He does not\n\nremember whether he has received any letter particularly\n\naddressed to the Manager and staff during his tenure, because of\n\ntime gap.

If such letters are received, first he used to read it and\n\nit will be maintained in general file. He admits that now he is\n\nleading a retired life. It is elicited that he handed over the letters\n\nconcerning to the particular staff through attender. In Ex.P.7 the\n\nyear is written as 1994 and Ex.P.7 contents are in Kannada and\n\nhe can read it. It is suggested that he is falsely deposing at the\n\ninstance of the accused in order to help him and the same is\n\ndenied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">      54.

After such\n\nscientific investigation of questioned and standard documents,\n\nthey have noted the significant writing habits in execution of\n\nvarious characters found in questioned and admitted documents,\n\nboth in Kannada and English language. After comparison of\n\nhandwriting in question as well as in standard documents, they\n\nhave   found     some    significant      similarities   in    execution    of\n\ncharacters. On the basis of the said significant similarities, they\n\nhave expressed their opinion and submitted the report to the\n\nCourt in terms of Ex.P.19. Based on the report Ex.P.19, he has\n\nissued a certificate of handwriting examination in terms of\n\nEx.P.20. He identifies his signature as Ex.P.20(a).

It is suggested that at the instance of the\n\ncomplainant, he has mentioned S1 to S4 are admitted signatures\n\nand the said suggestion was denied.

Having perused the oral evidence, this Court has to\n\nexamine the documentary evidence, which have been placed\n\nbefore this Court as Exs.P.1 to 21(a). Exs.P.1 to 4 are the letters\n\nwritten in open post cards. Ex.P.5 is also a open post card\n\nconnecting two post cards. Ex.P.6 and Ex.P.7 are written in a\n\nsheet of paper. Ex.P.8 is the legal notice sent to the accused and\n\nEx.P.9 is the postal card for having delivered the notice against\n\nthe accused. Exs.P.10 to 12 are the letters dated 12.1.1998,\n\n11.3.1998      and   21.2.1998,   which   were   addressed   to   the\n\ncomplainant subsequent to the filing of the complaint. Exs.P.13\n\nand 14 are open post cards. Exs.P.15 to 18 are the letters\n\nsecured from the Court from the department wherein the\n\naccused was working which are in both Kannada as well as in\n\nEnglish language. Ex.P.19 is the report of P.W.4 handwriting\n\nexpert. In the report Ex.P.19, P.W.4 stated that he has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                     43</span>\n\n\n\nexamined Exs.P.1 to 7, 10 to 12 and S1 to S4. On comparison\n\nbetween the questioned and standard documents, he finds\n\nsimilarities in the formation of characters. On examining the\n\ndocuments, he has opined in terms of Ex.P.19 that similarities\n\nare observed between questioned and standards documents\n\nwhich are significant and sufficient to express positive opinion\n\nregarding    the     authorship.    Ex.P.20    is   the   certificate    of\n\nhandwriting examination and in the certificate, it is opined that\n\nperson who wrote the enclosed standard writing and signature\n\nstamped and marked as S1 to S4 also wrote the enclosed\n\nquestioned writings, similarly stamped and marked Exs.P.1 to 7\n\nand 10 to 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">     58.     Keeping in view the contentions of the respective\n\ncounsel and also the principles <a href=\"/doc/6516158/\" id=\"a_78\">laid down in</a> the judgments\n\nreferred    supra,   this   Court   has   to   analyze    whether       the\n\nimputations made in the letters are written by the accused. This\n\nCourt has already examined both oral and documentary evidence\n\nplaced on record and it is the specific charge against the accused\n\nthat he has dis-reputed the complainant in the eye of general\n\npublic by writing such letters. As a result, the reputation of the\n\ncomplainant was lowered in the eye of general public. Having\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                44</span>\n\n\n\nperused both oral and documentary evidence placed on record,\n\nthere is no dispute with regard to the fact that the letters were\n\naddressed to the complainant as well as to the Bank Manager\n\nand staff. Having perused the contents of the documents Exs.P.1\n\nto 7, particularly which are the documents are based on which\n\nthe complainant was filed before the Trial Court, a scandalous\n\nand the words disreputing the character of the complainant are\n\nused in such letters. Ex.P.4 is the letter addressed to the Bank\n\nManager. The main contention of the accused is that he has not\n\nwritten such letters and disputed the documents and also he has\n\ndisputed the documents of Exs.P.15 to 18, which are referred as\n\nS1 to S4 by the expert.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">     59.   The learned counsel for the accused brought to the\n\nnotice of this Court that in 313 statement, he has filed the\n\nwritten statement before the Trial Court denying that the said\n\ndocument belongs to him. The defence of the accused is total\n\ndenial of not addressing such letters and also the documents S1\n\nto S4 do not belong to him. It has to be noted that an\n\napplication was filed before the Trial Court to summon the\n\ndocuments from the department and also to send those\n\ndocuments to the handwriting expert and at the first instance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                45</span>\n\n\n\nthe Trial Court has rejected the said application. Being aggrieved\n\nby the said order, a revision petition was filed before the\n\nSessions Court. The said revision petition was allowed and\n\ndirected the Trial Court to secure the records. Consequently, an\n\norder was passed in 2006 summoning those documents and\n\nafter securing the said documents, Exs.P.15 to 18 written by the\n\naccused to the department were secured and those documents\n\nwere also sent along with the questioned documents Exs.P.1 to 7\n\nand 10 to 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">      60.   This Court cannot rely upon Exs.P.10 to 12 to come\n\nto a conclusion that the accused has committed an offence, since\n\nbased on those documents no complaint is filed. It is pointed out\n\nby the learned counsel for the complainant that those documents\n\nare produced to show the conduct of the accused that even after\n\nfiling of the complainant also, he used to write such letters. The\n\ndocuments Exs.P.1 to 7 were also sent to the handwriting expert\n\nafter securing the documents from the department wherein the\n\naccused was working and those letters are written by the\n\naccused and the same are interse correspondence between him\n\nand the department, particularly the accounts department.\n\nThough, the counsel disputes the document S1 to S4 does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                   46</span>\n\n\n\nbelong to him, did not dispute the fact that the document was\n\nsecured from the department wherein the accused was working.\n\nThe order of the Trial Court securing the records has attained its\n\nfinality and the same has not been questioned. Hence, the\n\naccused now cannot contend that those documents does not\n\nbelong to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">      61.    It is also important to note that P.W.4 handwriting\n\nexpert in his oral evidence and also in terms of his report in\n\nExs.P.19 and 20 has categorically deposed before the Court that\n\nhe   has    adopted   the   scientific   method   in   examining   the\n\nquestioned documents and also the documents Exs.P.15 to 18.\n\nIn the cross-examination of P.W.4, it is elicited that he has\n\nmentioned Exs.P.15 to 18 as admitted documents, since he has\n\nreceived the documents from the Court. But in the cross-\n\nexamination of P.W.4, the evidence which he has given before\n\nthe Court has not been disputed except making the suggestion\n\nthat he has given the report at the instance of the complainant\n\nand those documents does not belongs to the accused. There is\n\nno effective cross-examination with regard to the method\n\nadopted by the handwriting expert in coming to the conclusion\n\nthat Exs.P.1 to 7 questioned documents and Exs.P.10 to 12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                     47</span>\n\n\n\nletters written after filing of the complaint and Exs.P.15 to 18 are\n\nwritten by the same person, has not been challenged in the\n\ncross-examination. P.W.4 in his evidence categorically deposed\n\nbefore the Trial Court that he has adopted the scientific method\n\nin examining the documents i.e., by using various scientific\n\ninstruments    like   magnifiers,    micro   scopes,   video   spectral\n\ncomparator and electro static detection operators and his\n\nevidence has not been rebutted by the accused except the\n\nsuggestion. The evidence of P.W.4 is not controverted in the\n\ncross-examination. In the cross-examination of P.W.4, the\n\nmethod adopted by P.W.4 in examining the documents is not\n\ndisputed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">      62.     Now coming to the legal aspect, there is no doubt\n\nthat the learned counsel for the accused vehemently contend\n\nthat the handwriting expert&#x27;s opinion is a weak piece of\n\nevidence. He also cited several judgments and the same has to\n\nbe considered with due caution. It is further contended that\n\nbased on the sole evidence of the handwriting expert, the\n\naccused cannot be convicted. No doubt, it is settled law that\n\nhandwriting expert&#x27;s evidence is one of the factor to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                 48</span>\n\n\n\nconsidered while considering the material on record. In the case\n\non hand, the complainant has been examined as P.W.1. There is\n\nno dispute between the parties that the complainant and the\n\naccused were the husband and wife and the marriage was\n\nsolemnized in 1974 and the same was dissolved in 1978. It is\n\nalso emerged in the evidence of P.W.1 that there was no letter\n\ncorrespondence after dissolving of the marriage till 1993-94. It is\n\nthe specific case of the complainant that the accused started\n\nwriting letters after 1993-94 making the allegation against the\n\ncomplainant about unchastity. The only dispute before the Court\n\nis that the documents are not written by the accused and total\n\ndenial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">      63.   The P.W.1 complainant deposed before the Court\n\nthat she was having acquaintance with the handwriting of the\n\naccused, who is none other than her husband. It is also emerged\n\nin the evidence that they lived together for some time after the\n\nmarriage. When such being the case, it cannot be contended\n\nthat the complainant is not having any acquaintance with the\n\nhandwriting of the accused. In the case on hand, apart from the\n\nevidence of P.W.1 with regard to acquaintance with the\n\nhandwriting of the accused, P.W.4 - handwriting expert in his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                 49</span>\n\n\n\nevidence has given the specific reason in coming to the\n\nconclusion that Exs.P.1 to 7, 15 to 18 are the handwriting of a\n\nparticular person. This Court has already pointed out that in the\n\ncross-examination of handwriting expert, nothing is elicited to\n\ndisbelieve his evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">      64. It is the main contention of the learned counsel for the\n\naccused that this Court has to take note of the dissimilarities and\n\nrefer the judgment of this Court regarding dissimilarities is\n\nconcerned. The said judgment is not applicable to the case on\n\nhand for the reason that nothing is elicited in the cross-\n\nexamination of P.W.4 with regard to dissimilarities. No doubt,\n\nthe Court has to examine the report of the expert with due care\n\nand caution. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for\n\nthe accused that the evidence of handwriting expert is a weak\n\npiece of evidence and in order to come to such a conclusion,\n\nparticularly in this case, nothing is elicited in the cross-\n\nexamination of P.W.4. The evidence of P.W.4 has not been\n\nchallenged and nothing is elicited with regard to dissimilarity.\n\nP.W.4 has adopted the scientific method in comparing the\n\nsignatures. No doubt in the evidence of P.W.1, it is elicited that\n\nhandwriting in Exs.P.1 and 2 are different. P.W.1 is not an expert\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                        50</span>\n\n\n\nand the Court also cannot act as an expert exercising the powers\n\nunder    <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_79\">Section    73</a>   of    the     Evidence     Act    to   compare   the\n\nhandwriting. However, the Court can look into the documents\n\nwhich    are    available     before    the   Court       and   compare   the\n\nhandwriting. The reason has been assigned with regard to the\n\ndissimilarity in the document that if the letter is written in fast\n\nmanner, naturally the handwriting varies. In the case on hand,\n\nthe handwriting expert by adopting scientific method has come\n\nto the conclusion that handwriting belongs to the same person\n\nand I have already pointed out that evidence of P.W.4 has not\n\nbeen challenged except making the suggestion. Hence, it is a\n\nclear case to accept the evidence of the handwriting expert in\n\naddition to the evidence of P.W.1, who was having acquaintance\n\nwith the handwriting of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">        65.    Now the question before this Court is whether this\n\nCourt can consider the evidence of P.W.3, who was the Bank\n\nManager        working   in    the     particular     Bank,     wherein   the\n\ncomplainant was working in between 1994 to 1997. The letters\n\nare also addressed in between 1994 to 1997. The complainant\n\nparticularly relies on Exs.P.4 and 7. Ex.P.4 is the postal card and\n\nEx.P.7 is the letter written in the sheet of paper and there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                 51</span>\n\n\n\ndispute with regard to the fact that those two letters are\n\naddressed to the Bank Manager directly. The handwriting expert\n\nin respect of handwriting available on Exs.P.4 and 7, has\n\nparticularly given the opinion that it is handwriting belonging to\n\na particular person who wrote other documents also.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">      66. P.W.3 - Bank Manager in his evidence deposed that\n\nhe does not remember having received any letter containing\n\nanything about the complainant, but he does not deny the fact\n\nthat the complainant was working in the same Branch and\n\ncategorically admitted that there were 30 persons working and it\n\nis his evidence that he does not remember and he has not\n\nspecifically denied that he has not received such letters. Hence,\n\nit is clear that he has not deposed the truthness before the Court\n\nand he categorically admits in the cross-examination that if any\n\nsuch letters are addressed to the Manager and staff, the same\n\nwill be handed over to him and he used to read the said letter\n\nand thereafter if it belongs to a particular staff, he used to hand\n\nover the same through his attender or otherwise he will keep the\n\nletters in the bank records. When such being the evidence\n\nelicited and taking note of the fact that he is a retired person, in\n\norder to help the accused he gave the evidence. It is not his case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                   52</span>\n\n\n\nthat he has not received the said letter, but his evidence is that\n\ndoes not remember and he admits Ex.P.4 is addressed in favour\n\nof Bank Manager and so also Ex.P.7.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">      67.   Having taken note of those documents which were\n\naddressed to the Bank and also other letters addressed to the\n\ncomplainant that too in a open post card, though evidence of\n\nP.W.2 cannot be believed with regard to he has read the\n\ncontents,   the   accused   was    indulged   in   dis-reputing   the\n\nreputation of the complainant by addressing open card and also\n\naddressing the letter to the Bank. The Trial Court considering\n\nboth oral and documentary evidence available on record,\n\nappreciated the evidence on record. But the Appellate Court has\n\ncommitted an error in coming to the conclusion that there was\n\nno material for publication of those letters. The letters are\n\naddressed to the Bank and the same was served on the Bank\n\nManager. The letters, particularly Exs.P.4 and 7 bears the seal of\n\nthe post office and the same was delivered to the Bank. Though\n\nP.W.3 denied that he does not remember the same, the contents\n\nof the letter Exs.P.1 to 7 are clear that only with an intention to\n\nimpute the reputation of the complainant, those letters are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                 53</span>\n\n\n\naddressed to the complainant as well as the Bank Manager to\n\nlower the dignity of the complainant in the eyes of general\n\npublic.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145623382\" id=\"span_74\">68.

It\n\nis also observed that imputation could be by words, either\n\nspoken or written or by making signs or visible representation\n\nand imputation could be either made or published. It is also\n\nimportant to note that in the case on hand, though the same is\n\nnot published in any paper, the accused made the imputation in\n\nthe said letters addressing the same to the complainant and the\n\nBank wherein the complainant was working. Hence, the very\n\nfinding of the Appellate Court that there was no material before\n\nthe Court for publication cannot be accepted. It is clear that\n\nimputation could be either made or published and it is not\n\nnecessary that there must be a publication and if anything is\n\nspoken or written or by making signs with intention, knowledge,\n\nhaving a reason to believe that such an imputation will harm the\n\nreputation of the person, that itself is enough to come to the\n\nconclusion that the same is made with an intention and\n\nknowledge to disrepute the reputation of a person. The Apex\n\nCourt held that the essence of publication in the context of\n\nSection 499 of IPC is the communication of defamatory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                    56</span>\n\n\n\nimputation to persons other than the persons against whom the\n\nimputation is made by referring the judgment in the cases of\n\nKhima Nand v.

The objection of the learned counsel for the\n      appellant is that neither of them has actually seen the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                 57</span>\n\n\n\nappellant write any of the letters nor are they shown to\nhave     such        intimate       acquaintance      with    his\ncorrespondence as to enable them to speak to the\ngenuineness of these signatures. Learned trial Judge as\nwell as the learned Judges of the High Court have\nfound that there were sufficient number of admitted or\nproved letters which might well enable Jasawalla and\nthe complainant to identify the signatures of the\nappellant in the disputed letters. They also laid stress\nsubstantially on the contents of the various letters, in\nthe context of the other letters and telegrams to which\nthey purport to be replies and which form the chain of\ncorrespondence as indicating the genuineness of the\ndisputed letters. Learned counsel objected to this\napproach on a question of proof. We are, however,\nunable   to    see    any    objection.    The   proof   of   the\ngenuineness of a document is proof of the authorship\nof the document and is proof of a fact like that of any\nother fact. The evidence relating thereto may be direct\nor circumstantial. It may consist of direct evidence of a\nperson who saw the document being written or the\nsignature being affixed. It may be proof of the\nhandwriting of the contents, or of the signature, by one\nof the modes provided in <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_85\">Sections 45</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1463645/\" id=\"a_86\">47</a> of the\nIndian Evidence Act. It may also be proved by internal\nevidence afforded by the contents of the document.\nThis last mode of proof by the contents may be of\nconsiderable    value       where    the   disputed   document\npurports to be a link in a chain of correspondence,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                   58</span>\n\n\n\n     some links in which are proved to the satisfaction of\n     the court. In such a situation the person who is the\n     recipient of the document, be it either a letter or a\n     telegram, would be in a reasonably good position both\n     with reference to his prior knowledge of the writing or\n     the signature of the alleged sender, limited though it\n     may be, as also his knowledge of the subject matter of\n     the   chain   of   correspondence,    to    speak   to   its\n     authorship. In an appropriate case the court may also\n     be in a position to judge whether the document\n     constitutes   a    genuine    link   in    the   chain   of\n     correspondence and thus to determine its authorship.\n     We are unable, therefore, to say that the approach\n     adopted by the courts below in arriving at the\n     conclusion that the letters are genuine is open to any\n     serious legal objection. The question, if any, can only\n     be as to the adequacy of the material on which the\n     conclusion as to the genuineness of the letters is\n     arrived at. That however is a matter which we cannot\n     permit to be canvassed before us.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84475\" id=\"span_81\">72.   In the case on hand, it has to be noted that P.W.1 is\n\nnone other than the wife of the accused and it is her specific\n\ncase that she was having acquaintance with the handwriting of\n\nthe accused and both of them lived together for sometime. Apart\n\nfrom the evidence of P.W.1, the evidence of P.W.4 - handwriting\n\nexpert is clear that he has adopted the scientific method in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                               59</span>\n\n\n\ncomparing the signature and though disputed the opinion of the\n\nP.W.4, nothing is elicited in the cross-examination of P.W.4 to\n\ndisbelieve the evidence of handwriting expert. No doubt hand\n\nwriting expert cannot be the sole basis for convicting a person.\n\nIn the case on hand, evidence of P.W.1 is clear that she was\n\nhaving acquaintance with the handwriting of the accused and\n\napart from that the evidence of P.W.4 has been unchallenged.\n\nOn perusal of evidence of P.W.3, it is clear that he is not\n\nspeaking the truth. It is also clear that the contents of the\n\ndocuments which are addressed was in the knowledge of the\n\naccused. Hence, the principles <a href=\"/doc/84475/\" id=\"a_87\">laid down in</a> the judgment of Apex\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/84475/\" id=\"a_88\">Mobarik Ali Ahmed</a> (supra) is aptly\n\napplicable to the case on hand and the same is proved by person\n\nwho is acquainted with the handwriting of the accused and also\n\nthose letters are received by P.W.1 through post and the sender\n\nis having the knowledge of the subject matter of chain of\n\ncorrespondence and there is a clear link letter to letter making\n\nunchastity allegation against the complainant. Hence, it do not\n\nfind force in the contention of the learned counsel for the\n\naccused that the evidence of handwriting expert cannot be\n\nbelieved.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                60</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">      73.    Having perused both oral and documentary evidence\n\nplaced on record and also the reasoning of the Trial Court, the\n\nTrial Court while coming to the conclusion that the charges has\n\nbeen proved against the accused, in detail discussed the\n\nevidence of the prosecution witnesses as well as the contents of\n\nthe documents. The Appellate Court has committed an error in\n\nupsetting the judgment of the Trial Court in coming to the\n\nconclusion that there is no publication. This Court has already\n\nreferred the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mohd.\n\nAbdulla khan (supra) and particularly referred to paragraph\n\nNo.10 and has observed that in order to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 499</a> of\n\nIPC, it is not necessary that it should be published, but if it is\n\ngone to the knowledge of any other person other than the\n\ncomplainant, that itself is enough to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 499</a> of IPC.\n\nHence, the Appellate Court has committed an error in acquitting\n\nthe accused for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 499</a> of IPC.\n\nHence, the judgment of the Trial Court has to be restored.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">      74.
