It is contended by him\n\n             that Sub-section (4)(p) is subject to the provisions of Sub-section (4)(a) and in the\n\n             case of a minor, it is only the guardian who can decide whether the pregnancy\n\n             should be terminated or not. According to him, the application of Sub-section 4 (b)\n\n             is excluded by its own language if the pregnant woman has not attained the age of\n\n             eighteen. We are unable to accept this contention. The entire scheme of the Act\n\n             shows that the provisions thereof can be invoked only by the pregnant woman. If\n\n             she happens to be a minor, the registered medical practitioner, who is approached\n\n             for terminating the pregnancy must take care to get the consent of the guardian of\n\n             the minor in writing. Sub-section (4)(a) can never be understood as dispensing\n\n             with the consent of the pregnant woman if she is below 18 years of age. The\n\n             provision is only intended to help the registered medical practitioner to take into\n\n             account all the relevant facts and circumstances as set out in Section 3 so as to\n\n             decide whether the continuance of the pregnancy will involve any of the risks\n\n             mentioned in the Section. For example, Sub-section (3) requires the medical\n\n             practitioner to take into account the pregnant woman&#x27;s actual or reasonably\n\n             foreseeable environment while determining the question whether the continuance\n\n             of the pregnancy would involve such risk as is mentioned in Sub-section (2).
