Briefly stated, the facts of the present case are that the\n\nmarriage between the appellant-husband and the respondent-\n\nwife was solemnized on 20.02.2009. A daughter was born out of\n\nthe said wedlock on 11.05.2011. Due to marital discord between\n\nthe parties, the appellant filed a divorce petition being CIS No.\n\nDMC/405/2017 under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act,\n\n1955 before the Family Court, Bathinda, on 07.07.2017. The\n\ndivorce petition was subsequently amended and filed again on\n\n03.04.2018.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.1    When the aforesaid case was listed for evidence, the\n\nappellant herein submitted his affidavit of examination-in-chief\n\non 07.12.2018. Later, an application was moved by the\n\nappellant-husband on 09.07.2019 seeking permission to submit\n\nhis supplementary affidavit by way of examination-in-chief along\n\nwith memory cards/chips of the mobile phones, compact disc\n\n(CD) and transcript of conversations recorded in memory\n\ncards/chips of the mobile phones. In the said application, the\n\nappellant stated that various telephonic conversations happened\n\nbetween the parties during the period from November 2010 to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                     Page 2 of 66</span>\n\fDecember 2010, as well as between August 2016 and December\n\n2016 and the same had been recorded by the appellant and\n\nstored in the memory cards/chips of the mobile phones. The\n\nappellant had also prepared the transcripts of those recorded\n\nconversations. Thus, the appellant prayed that he may be allowed\n\nto file his supplementary affidavit by way of his examination-in-\n\nchief along with memory cards/chips of the respective mobile\n\nphones, CD and transcripts of the conversations so recorded in\n\nmemory cards/chips of the respective mobile phones.\n\n3.2   The respondent herein opposed the application on the\n\nground that the examination-in-chief was already completed and\n\nmoreover, the admissibility of memory card/chips along with CD\n\nand transcripts is in dispute and these electronic instruments\n\ncannot be exhibited. The respondent therefore sought the\n\ndismissal of the application filed by the appellant.\n\n3.3    The learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bathinda\n\nallowed the application filed by the appellant on 29.01.2020, on\n\nthe ground that the conversation between the parties is relevant\n\nfor the adjudication of the controversy between the parties and\n\nthere is no bar on the admissibility of such a tape recording. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                       Page 3 of 66</span>\n\fFamily Court observed that the appellant is only wanting to prove\n\nthe conversation between him and the respondent and not with\n\nrespect to a third party. Reliance was placed by the Family Court\n\non <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, 1984 (“F.C. Act” for short)\n\nwhich allows a Family Court to receive any evidence, statement,\n\nreport, documents, etc., which is helpful in adjudicating the\n\ndispute between the parties and also on Section 20 of the F.C.\n\nAct, which has an overriding effect on the general rules of\n\nevidence. Thus, the appellant was allowed to prove the CD\n\npertaining to the conversation between him and the respondent\n\nsubject to its correctness. Consequently, on 18.02.2020 the\n\nappellant tendered by way of evidence the transcript of the audio\n\nrecording, the original memory card of the phone and the CD\n\nprepared from the said memory card.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">3.4   Being aggrieved by the order dated 29.01.2020 passed by\n\nthe learned Principal Judge, Family Court, Bathinda, the\n\nrespondent-wife filed a civil revision petition before the High\n\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana being CR No. 1616 of 2020 (O&amp;M).\n\nOn 05.03.2020, the High Court issued notice in the matter and\n\ngranted an interim order of stay on the order dated 29.01.2020.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                       Page 4 of 66</span>\n\f3.5        By the impugned judgment dated 12.11.2021, the High\n\nCourt allowed the civil revision petition filed by the respondent\n\nand thereby set aside the order dated 29.01.2020 passed by the\n\nPrincipal Judge, Family Court, Bathinda. It was held that the CD\n\ntendered in evidence by the appellant-husband contained\n\nconversations between the husband and the wife recorded\n\nsurreptitiously without the consent or knowledge of the wife and\n\nacceptance of the same in evidence would constitute a clear\n\ninfringement of the right to privacy of the wife. While the High\n\nCourt did not dispute that the Family Court is not bound by the\n\nstrict rules of evidence, it held that the CD cannot be accepted in\n\nview of the right to privacy of the wife, which is a facet of the right\n\nto life accorded by the Constitution of India.\n\n3.6        In the impugned order, the High Court supported its\n\nreasoning by placing reliance on the following judgments of\n\nvarious High Courts:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"3104926\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18692050\" id=\"span_12\">i.    <a href=\"/doc/18692050/\" id=\"a_3\">Deepinder Singh Mann vs. Ranjit Kaur</a>, 2014 SCC OnLine\n            P&amp;H 4826\n\n   ii.      <a href=\"/doc/3104926/\" id=\"a_4\">Tripat Deep Singh vs. Paviter Kaur</a>, 2018 (3) RCR (Civil) 71\n\n  iii.</span></span>      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100893069\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1058685\" id=\"span_14\"><a href=\"/doc/1058685/\" id=\"a_5\">Rayala M.

Vishal Kaushik vs. Family Court, 2016(1) RLW 693 (Raj.)\n\n3.7        The crux of the observations made by the High Courts in\n\nall these judgments was that the recorded conversations between\n\na husband and a wife cannot be made the basis for deciding a\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 since\n\ncourts cannot judge under what circumstances the recorded\n\nstatements were made by the parties. That recording any such\n\nconversation without the knowledge of the other partner would\n\namount to violation of the right to privacy. On the basis of this\n\nreasoning, the High Court passed the impugned judgment in\n\nfavour of the respondent herein.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">3.8        Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 12.11.2021 passed\n\nin CR No. 1616 of 2020 (O&amp;M), the appellant-husband has\n\npreferred the present civil appeal.

The issue\n\nbefore this Court regarding admissibility of covertly recorded\n\ncommunications between spouses in matrimonial proceedings\n\nlies at the intersection of rights emanating from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, the erstwhile <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a>\n\n(“<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_10\">Evidence Act</a>”, for short) and the F.C.

Act   that   an   interpretation    which\n\nincentivises surveillance and covert recording of interactions and\n\ncommunications without the consent and knowledge of the other\n\nmarried partner militates against the letter and spirit of\n\nconciliation, which is the central objective of the statute as stated\n\nin the preamble to the F.C. Act. That a conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_11\">Section\n\n122</a> of the Evidence Act and Section 14 of the F.C. Act shows that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                           Page 8 of 66</span>\n\fthere is no explicit legal bar on covertly recorded audio/video\n\nrecordings being produced as evidence in proceedings between\n\nparties       to   the   marriage.   However,   certain   considerations,\n\nincluding the avowed objective of the law to promote conciliation\n\nbetween parties to a marriage, the deleterious impact of covert\n\nrecording and surveillance on matrimonial relations and the\n\nbreach of the right to privacy of the spouse subjected to covert\n\nrecording warrant that these elements of law, procedure, rights\n\nand public interest be harmonised in the interest of justice.\n\n4.3         Learned amicus has brought to our attention the divergent\n\nviews taken by various High Courts on the issue of admissibility\n\nof evidence with respect to the recording of conversations                  in\n\nproceedings between a husband and wife.\n\n4.4         As per the compilation of case law submitted by the\n\nlearned amicus for the perusal of this Court, the High Courts in\n\nthe following cases have allowed the communication between the\n\nparties and other private information to be placed on record or\n\nsummoned as evidence:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"50383703\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"147810772\" id=\"span_20\">i.     <a href=\"/doc/147810772/\" id=\"a_12\">Deepti Kapur vs. Kunal Julka</a>, 2020 SCC OnLine Del 672\n\n      ii.    <a href=\"/doc/50383703/\" id=\"a_13\">Preeti Jain vs. Kunal Jain</a>, AIR 2016 Raj 153\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                             Page 9 of 66</span>\n\f  iii.</span></span>       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"391935\" id=\"span_22\">Kethana Lokesh vs. Rahul R.

Some factors suggested by the learned amicus for providing\n\nguidance in the exercise of judicial discretion are enumerated as\n\nfollows:</span></span></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">a)    A proximate and temporal nexus of the audio/video recording\n\n      to the facts in issue or relevant facts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">b)    The intention of defaming, harassing or prejudicing the\n\n      spouse, or prolonging the litigation by placing on record the\n\n      audio/video recording.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">c)    Burden of proof on the party producing the covert recording\n\n      to demonstrate that it is the least restrictive and intrusive\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                        Page 11 of 66</span>\n\f      method of proving the claim, in line with the doctrine of\n\n      proportionality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">d)    Exercise of care and caution while giving weightage to such\n\n      evidence   by      considering   the   context   in    which          the\n\n      conversation happened and was recorded covertly by one of\n\n      the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">e)    Control, ownership and access that each party to the\n\n      marriage has to electronic recording devices since the socio-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      economic differential between parties to the marriage based\n\n      on gender may have a direct bearing on their ability, capacity\n\n      and opportunity to make covert audio/video recordings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">f)    Authenticity and accuracy of the recordings is also an\n\n      important factor, since the electronic audio/video recordings\n\n      are highly vulnerable to manipulation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">     However, while dealing with the issue of determining the\n\nauthenticity of the audio/video recordings, the learned amicus\n\nsounded a note of caution that this might increase the burden on\n\nthe already scarce Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) resources\n\nand lead to delay in the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                            Page 12 of 66</span>\n\f4.7   Lastly, it was submitted that specific directions are\n\nrequired to ensure that the audio/video recordings are filed,\n\nmaintained and stored in a manner which safeguards the privacy\n\nof parties before the Family Court. Reliance was placed on the\n\nrecently notified Delhi Family Courts (Amendment) Rules, 2024,\n\nwhich inserted Chapter VI, Rule 17 in the existing Rules, with\n\nregard to “protecting the privacy of parties or persons”. The said\n\namendment prohibits parties from extracting in the pleadings the\n\ncontents of a document which is of a sensitive nature and which\n\nis likely to affect the right to privacy or cause embarrassment,\n\nwithout the leave of the court and “a document” is said to include\n\nthe electronic recordings as well.

Learned counsel Sri Ankit Swarup appeared for the appellant-\n\nhusband and urged that the impugned order ought to be set\n\naside. It was submitted by the learned counsel that in\n\nmatrimonial proceedings involving allegations of cruelty, the\n\nparties are bound to recreate issues and events which were\n\notherwise confined to the matrimonial home and the bedroom\n\nand away from the public eye. These proceedings involve a\n\ndiscussion on the aspects of the private married life of parties.\n\nOften in such cases, there is neither any third-party witness to\n\nprove the allegations nor is there proof by documentary evidence.\n\nThis is where modern technology and electronic devices can help\n\nin bringing such evidence to the court room. If an argument of\n\nprivacy is permitted to be raised, it will impinge upon the right to\n\nfair trial accorded to the other spouse and the appellant herein\n\nwould be unsuccessful in proving cruelty of the respondent and\n\nthereby be deprived from seeking divorce before the Family\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                       Page 14 of 66</span>\n\f5.1    It was submitted that as per the exception contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act, the communication between\n\nmarried persons can be disclosed in matrimonial proceedings like\n\ndivorce. Further reliance was placed on Sections 14 and 20 of the\n\nF.C. Act to contend that the objective of these overriding\n\nprovisions is to secure the right to fair trial of married persons\n\nand to effectively deal with the private dispute between the\n\nparties and that is why these provisions allow the Family Courts\n\nto deviate from the strict rules of evidence and admit into\n\nevidence materials that are necessary for the adjudication of the\n\ndispute. While the respondent has taken the defence of right to\n\nprivacy, it is not an absolute right and has to be balanced with\n\nthe right to fair trial of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">5.2    Learned counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the\n\njudgments rendered by different High Courts to contend that\n\nright to privacy cannot be a defence to shun relevant evidence in\n\nthe form of audio/video recordings or some other technologically\n\ncollected private data.

Learned senior counsel Sri Gagan Gupta who appeared for\n\nthe respondent-wife, with reference to her counter affidavit,\n\nquestioned the authenticity and admissibility of the purported\n\nconversations sought to be produced. It was submitted that the\n\nappellant had not mentioned anything about these recorded\n\nconversations in his pleadings and therefore, he cannot be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                      Page 17 of 66</span>\n\fallowed to bring in evidence something that does not have any\n\nfoundational basis in any of the pleadings hereinbefore.\n\n6.1    It was further submitted that permission to bring on\n\nrecord such evidence is fraught with inherent and imminent\n\ndanger as the court would never be able to ascertain the\n\ncircumstances in which the alleged conversation was held or the\n\nmanner in which the conversation was initiated or continued.\n\nThe same is a unilateral act of one of the spouses without\n\nknowledge or consent of the other spouse and in the present\n\ncase, the same relates to the years 2010 and 2016 and has been\n\ndeliberately delayed to be filed in Court as late as in July 2019\n\nand thus causes serious prejudice to the respondent herein\n\ninasmuch as while the appellant was as per his own admission\n\nindulging in call recording/phone tapping ever since 2010, the\n\nrespondent cannot be expected to have complete memory of such\n\nold conversations between the husband and wife which were not\n\ndocumented. That the respondent would have no means to verify\n\nthe genuineness and completeness of the said purported phone\n\nconversations. Thus, even if the respondent can be said to have\n\nthe right of cross-examination or of forensic examination of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                     Page 18 of 66</span>\n\fpurported material, the said right would be an illusory right in\n\nthe facts of this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">6.2    Learned senior counsel for the respondent has stressed\n\nupon the right to privacy of the respondent and has highlighted\n\nthat the conversations sought to be produced were recorded\n\nwithout the knowledge or consent of the respondent. Marriage is\n\nsaid to be a sacrosanct relationship and it is not expected of\n\nspouses either to illegally record the conversations between them\n\nor to produce them as evidence. Permission to lead such evidence\n\nwould amount to licensing a married couple to betray the trust at\n\nany given moment and judicial recognition of the same would\n\nresult in every married couple doubting their partner and\n\nbecoming careful and apprehensive and running a risk of every\n\nconversation being recorded which could not be the objective\n\nbehind either <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act, or Sections 14 and\n\n22 of the F.C. Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">6.3    In light of the same, learned senior counsel submitted that\n\nthe unilateral and illegal recording of a private conversation by\n\none spouse without informing the other spouse cannot be said to\n\nbe a “communication” at all and thus any such purported\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                     Page 19 of 66</span>\n\fevidence of any such alleged conversation is not admissible in\n\nlaw.

In a recent judgment of the House of Lords\n    Rumping v. Director of Public Prosecutions, (1962) All\n    E.R. 256 Rumping the mate of a Dutch ship was tried\n    for murder committed on board the ship. Part of the\n    evidence for the prosecution admitted at the trial\n    consisted of a letter that Rumping had written to his\n    wife in Holland which amounted to a confession.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">    Rumping had written the letter on the day of the\n    killing, and had handed the letter in a closed envelope\n    to a member of the crew requesting him to post it as\n    soon as the ship arrived at the port outside England.\n    After the appellant was arrested, the member of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                       Page 22 of 66</span>\n\f      crew handed the envelope to the captain of the ship\n      who handed it over to the police. The member of the\n      crew, the captain and the translator of the letter gave\n      evidence at the trial, but the wife was not called as\n      witness. It was held that the letter was admissible in\n      evidence. Lord Reid, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord\n      Hodson and Lord Pearce were of the view that at\n      common law there had never been a separate principle\n      or rule that communications between a husband and\n      wife during marriage were inadmissible in evidence on\n      the ground of public policy. Accordingly except where\n      the spouse to whom the communication is made is a\n      witness and claims privilege from disclosure under the\n      Criminal Evidence Act. 1898, (of which the terms are\n      similar to<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_42\"> S. 122</a> of the Indian Evidence Act though not\n      identical), evidence as to communications between\n      husband and wife during marriage is admissible in\n      criminal proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      16. The question whether the complainant in this case\n      is an agent of the wife because he has received the\n      letters from the wife and may be permitted to give\n      evidence is a matter on which no opinion at this stage\n      can be expressed. The complainant claims that he has\n      been defamed by the writing of the letters. The letters\n      are in his possession and are available for being\n      tendered in evidence. We see no reason why inquiry\n      into that complaint should, on the preliminary\n      contentions raised, be prohibited. If the complainant\n      seeks to support his case only upon the evidence of the\n      wife of the accused, he may be met with the bar of<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_43\"> S.\n      122</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.

The section protects the individuals and not\n      the    communication      of   it.   Viscount    Radcliffe\n      in Rumping v. Director of Public Prosecutions, 1962-3 All\n      ER 256 at 265 observed that such communications\n      could be proved by some other form of testimony as\n      that of a witness who had overheard their confidence or\n      by the production of a letter which contained the\n      confidence, but had passed into other hands. In other\n      words, the law does not protect the communications as\n      such, but only excludes the spouse from being a\n      witness to prove it. Thus marital communications could\n      be proved by the evidence of the over-hearers, even\n      though the wife herself could not have been called to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                         Page 26 of 66</span>\n\f        testify to them.

According to Sarkar’s\n\nLaw of Evidence, 20th Edition, Volume 2, the provisions of the\n\nSection may be summarised as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(i)       The privilege extends to all communications made to a\n\n          person during marriage, by any person to whom he or she\n\n          has been married, but not to communications before\n\n          marriage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(ii)      The communication need not be confidential. The rule\n\n          applies to communications of every nature.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(iii)     The rule of privilege applies equally whether or not the\n\n          witness or his or her spouse is a party to the proceeding. It\n\n          extends to all cases, i.e., to cases between strangers as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                                           Page 27 of 66</span>\n\f       well as to suits or proceedings in which the husband or\n\n       wife is a party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"669784\" id=\"span_59\">(iv)   The privilege extends to communications made to a\n\n       spouse and not to those made by a spouse. But the\n\n       privilege is conferred not on the witness (unless the\n\n       witness happens to be the spouse who made the\n\n       communication), but on the spouse who made the\n\n       communication; the witness cannot therefore waive it at\n\n       his or her will, nor can the court permit disclosure even if\n\n       he or she is willing to do it (<a href=\"/doc/669784/\" id=\"a_54\">Nawab Howladar vs.\n\n       Emperor</a>, 1913 SCC OnLine Cal 447. It is only the\n\n       spouse who made the communication or his or her\n\n       representative in interest who can consent to give up the\n\n       privilege.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">8.8    From a reading of the above section and the judgments,\n\nthe following principles and interpretations can be culled out:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(i)    Unlike <a href=\"/doc/1079138/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 120</a> of the Evidence Act, which deals with\n\n       competency of a husband or a wife to be a witness in a civil\n\n       or criminal proceeding involving the other, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 122</a> of\n\n       the said Act deals with the admissibility of privileged\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                      Page 28 of 66</span>\n\f        communications made by a married person to a partner\n\n        during the subsistence of the marriage.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(ii)    <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act is worded in two parts –\n\n        one, dealing with ‘compellability’ and the other, dealing\n\n        with ‘permissibility’. These two parts are separated by a\n\n        semi-colon, which shows that the two parts are separate\n\n        and have to be read disjunctively.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(iii)   The first part deals with ‘compellability’. Here, if one of\n\n        the spouses is not willing to disclose the communication\n\n        made to the other, the latter cannot be compelled by any\n\n        court, authority or person, which by law is otherwise\n\n        competent to compel the person to give evidence, to\n\n        disclose what their married partner communicated to the\n\n        said spouse during the time when the marriage was\n\n        subsisting. This is a blanket bar which cannot be relaxed\n\n        in any situation. This protects the right to privacy between\n\n        a married couple.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(iv)    The second part deals with ‘permissibility’. This is an even\n\n        greater restriction than the first part. Here, even if one of\n\n        the spouses is willing to disclose the communication made\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                        Page 29 of 66</span>\n\f      to him/her, the Court still cannot permit it to be taken as\n\n      evidence,   unless   the   other   spouse   who    made       that\n\n      communication,       or    their   representative-in-interest,\n\n      consents to the disclosure of such communication. In other\n\n      words, without the consent of the spouse who made the\n\n      communication, the court cannot permit the other spouse\n\n      to disclose that communication. Another way of looking at\n\n      it is that if one of the spouses is willing to disclose the\n\n      communication, then it is not the court that can give\n\n      consent to the disclosure but it is actually the other spouse\n\n      who made that communication who can consent to\n\n      disclosing it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(v)   The second part, relating to ‘permissibility’, is then followed\n\n      by two exceptions which are –\n\n      a.   proceedings in suits between married persons,\n\n      b.   proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted\n\n           for any crime committed against each other.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">           Therefore, it means that in these two given scenarios,\n\n      the requirement of taking consent from the other spouse\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                        Page 30 of 66</span>\n\f         before being permitted to disclose the communication is\n\n         done away with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1120728\" id=\"span_63\">[Ref.: <a href=\"/doc/1120728/\" id=\"a_58\">M.C.

It is often\n\nalleged by accused persons that the investigation authorities did\n\nnot follow legal methods and procedures to obtain the evidence\n\nagainst them. Sometimes recording devices and phone-tapping\n\nmechanisms are resorted to for the purpose of collecting relevant\n\nevidentiary material. In such cases, the view taken by this Court\n\nhas been that merely the fact that an evidence was not obtained\n\nstrictly in accordance with law does not absolutely bar the\n\nadmissibility of such an evidence. The Court, while appreciating\n\nsuch evidence, may have to tread with caution and be assured\n\nabout the accuracy and reliability of such evidence but the said\n\nevidence cannot be said to be irrelevant and/or inadmissible\n\nmerely on the argument that it was illegally obtained.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                     Page 37 of 66</span>\n\f9.3    In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1557977/\" id=\"a_75\">Yusufalli Esmail Nagree vs. The State Of\n\nMaharashtra</a>, AIR 1968 SC 147 (“Yusufalli Nagree”), a three-</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">judge bench of this Court was dealing with a case of corruption\n\nwherein a conversation was secretly recorded by the police by\n\nlaying a trap and concealing a microphone in the room of the\n\naccused. The conversation was recorded on a tape recorder. The\n\nadmissibility of this recorded conversation was objected to on the\n\nground that this was recorded without the knowledge of the\n\naccused and the accuracy of the conversation recorded on the\n\ntape recorded was challenged. This Court, speaking through\n\nBachawat, J., rejected these arguments made by the accused.\n\nWhile this Court refused to lend its approval to the police practice\n\nof tapping telephone wires and setting up hidden microphones for\n\nthe purpose of tape recording, it held that the fact that the tape\n\nrecording was done without the knowledge of the accused is not\n\nin itself an objection to its admissibility in evidence because the\n\naccused in this case was free to talk or not to talk; his\n\nconversation was voluntary and there was no element of duress,\n\ncoercion or compulsion. It was further observed that the imprint\n\non the magnetic tape is the direct effect of the relevant sounds.\n\nLike a photograph of a relevant incident, a contemporaneous tape\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                       Page 38 of 66</span>\n\frecord of a relevant conversation is a relevant fact and is\n\nadmissible under <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 7</a> of the Evidence Act.

One of the features of magnetic\n      tape recording is the ability to erase and re-use the\n      recording medium. Because of this facility of erasure\n      and re-use, the evidence must be received with caution.\n      The court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt\n      that the record has not been tampered with.”\n                                          (underlining by us)\n\n9.4      In furtherance to the above view came the judgment of\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_77\">R.

A contemporaneous tape record of a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                       Page 39 of 66</span>\n\f      relevant conversation is a relevant fact and is\n      admissible under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_78\">section 8</a> of the Evidence Act. It is res\n      gestae. It is also comparable to a photograph of a\n      relevant incident. The tape recorded conversation is\n      therefore a relevant fact and is admissible under\n      <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_79\">section 7</a> of the Evidence Act.”\n\n\n9.5      The aforesaid test <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_80\">laid down by</a> this Court has become a\n\nlocus classicus on the issue of determining the admissibility of a\n\ntape-recorded conversation. The three-fold test of relevance,\n\nidentification and accuracy has to be satisfied before a Court\n\nadmits a recorded conversation in evidence. However, the fact\n\nthat the conversation was recorded without the consent and\n\nknowledge of the person speaking is not a prohibition on the\n\nadmissibility of the evidence, as <a href=\"/doc/1179783/\" id=\"a_81\">laid down by</a> the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_82\">Evidence Act</a>\n\nand read into the statutory provisions by this Court.</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">Applicability of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act to a\nproceeding for divorce:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">10. As explained above, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act deals\n\nwith two parts – compellability and permissibility. The facts of the\n\npresent case concern only the applicability of the second part of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 122</a>, i.e., the one dealing with permissibility. The\n\nhusband in this case would have ordinarily been barred from\n\ndisclosing any form of communication that was disclosed by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                        Page 40 of 66</span>\n\fwife to him by virtue of being a privileged communication under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 122</a>. But due to the exception provided in that Section,\n\nthe bar on the disclosure of such communication is lifted since\n\nthe communication sought to be disclosed in the present case is\n\nin a proceeding between the husband and the wife, i.e., the\n\npetition filed by the husband for divorce under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 13</a> of the\n\nHindu Marriage Act. Therefore, such a privileged communication\n\nis not barred from being disclosed and brought before the Court\n\nand the objection taken by the wife with respect to <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 122</a> of\n\nthe Evidence Act is not acceptable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">10.1   Looking at it from another angle, under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 122</a> of\n\nthe Evidence Act, what is barred in the present case is the\n\ndisclosure of the communication made by the wife to the\n\nhusband by the latter standing in the witness box. But the\n\ncommunication that was made to the husband is itself not\n\nbarred. The phone on which the conversation was recorded is no\n\ndifferent from an eavesdropper. The restriction under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 122</a>\n\ndoes not apply to the communication that was made by the wife\n\nto the husband and the same can also be proved by means other\n\nthan the husband himself coming to the witness box to disclose\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                     Page 41 of 66</span>\n\fthat communication. However, the overriding exception in the\n\nsecond part of the section with regard to disclosure in a\n\nproceeding between the spouses would apply; and under the\n\nexception, the doctrine of privileged communication would not\n\napply.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">10.2      Section 14 of the F.C. Act gives a wide discretion to the\n\nFamily Courts in deciding matrimonial disputes since they can go\n\nbeyond the strict rules of evidence in terms of relevance and\n\nadmissibility while admitting any evidence which they think is\n\nrelevant for the adjudication of the dispute at hand. However, we\n\ndo not think that adverting to Section 14 of the F.C. Act is\n\nrequired in the present facts when the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_91\">Evidence Act</a> itself permits\n\nsuch a communication to be admitted in evidence by way of an\n\nexception. The powers under Section 14 of the F.C. Act would\n\nnormally be resorted to in a scenario where the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_92\">Evidence Act</a>\n\ncreates    some   prohibition   with   respect   to   relevance        or\n\nadmissibility of any evidence. But if the Family Court is of the\n\nopinion that it is expedient to go beyond the procedural\n\ntechnicalities of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_93\">Evidence Act</a> for adjudicating the dispute, in\n\nsuch a case, the Family Court is allowed to take that evidence on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                       Page 42 of 66</span>\n\frecord, notwithstanding what is stated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_94\">Evidence Act</a>. But\n\nthe exercise of this extraordinary power under Section 14 of the\n\nF.C. Act is not warranted in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">10.3    Some arguments have been made by the learned amicus\n\nabout the fact that permitting such an evidence would jeopardise\n\ndomestic harmony and matrimonial relationship inasmuch as it\n\nwould encourage snooping on the spouse, thereby fracturing the\n\nvery objective of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act. We do not think\n\nsuch an argument is tenable. If the marriage has reached a stage\n\nwhere spouses are actively snooping on each other, that is in\n\nitself a symptom of a broken relationship and denotes a lack of\n\ntrust between them. The said snooping cannot be said to be a\n\nconsequence of the Court admitting the evidence obtained by\n\nsnooping. In fact, snooping between partners is an effect and not\n\na cause of marital disharmony. The privacy of communication\n\nexists between spouses, as has been recognised by <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 122</a>,\n\nbut the said right of privacy cannot be absolute and has to be\n\nread also in light of the exception provided in <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 122</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act. When <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 122</a> itself recognises and protects\n\nspousal privacy in the first part of the Section then, the said right\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                       Page 43 of 66</span>\n\fhas to be construed in terms of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 122</a> only and has to be\n\nsubject to the exception contained therein. In other words, when\n\nthe right to privacy of communication between spouses is the\n\nvery basis of <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 122</a> then the exceptions to these should also\n\nflow only from <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n10.4   During the years when this Court decided cases such as\n\nYusufalli Nagree and R.M. Malkani, bugging, snooping, tapping\n\nwere considered acts that had a clear element of invading the\n\nprivacy of an individual for the purpose of gathering concrete\n\nevidence. Devices like tape-recorders and microphones were\n\ncarefully placed in a space wherein the conversations could be\n\nsecretly recorded and the entire process was not as easy as\n\nclicking a button on a mobile phone. Even in those times, the\n\nCourts have encouraged the need for having better evidence for\n\nadjudication than to close the doors of technology and refuse to\n\naccept the material in front of them on the mere ground that\n\nprivacy would be breached.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">10.5   On the other hand, before a Court of law, a relevant piece\n\nof conversation available on an electronic device should not be\n\nallowed to be shut out when it is the best evidence available for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                     Page 44 of 66</span>\n\fdeciding the dispute. The erstwhile <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_102\">Evidence Act</a> is a legislation\n\nthat was more than a century old and therefore obviously could\n\nnot encapsulate all the technologically varied challenges which\n\nthe modern technology poses before us. Yet, what the said\n\nlegislation remarkably conveys is that the purpose of the law of\n\nevidence is not to create barriers but to break them to ensure\n\nthat a clearer picture is created in the mind of the judge so as to\n\ndecide a dispute before it. This is why when the evidence is not\n\ndirect, the legislation allows a judge to rely on circumstantial\n\nevidence; it allows presumptions of fact and law and adverse\n\ninferences to be drawn from the conduct of parties and witnesses\n\nso that a fair and reasonable conclusion can be reached from the\n\nmaterial on record. Now, in today’s day and age, when the\n\ntechnological advancement has made it easier to record and\n\nrecreate moments of past and present for reference in future,\n\nthen to say that such better forms of evidence and material\n\nwould not be admissible on the ground of they being in violation\n\nof the right to privacy would amount to defeating the very object\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_103\">Evidence Act</a>. That was the reason for the Parliament to\n\namend the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_104\">Evidence Act</a> by incorporating Section 65B which\n\nspecifically deals with electronic evidence.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                      Page 45 of 66</span>\n\f10.6   Section 65A deals with special provisions as to evidence\n\nrelating to electronic records.

Hence, it is\n\nnecessary to dilate upon the contours of the right to privacy in\n\nthe context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution with reference to the\n\nrecent dicta of this Court rendered by Constitution benches.\n\n\n11.2   In K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9J.) vs. Union of India\n\nreported in (2017) 10 SCC 1, (“Puttaswamy”), Chelameswar\n\nand Bobde JJ. enunciated that the constitutional right to privacy\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 21</a> is limited to the relationship between the citizen\n\nand the State. Bobde J. (as he then was) drew a distinction\n\nbetween ‘common law rights’ and ‘fundamental rights’ by\n\nobserving thus:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">    “397.…we can dismantle a core assumption of the\n    Union&#x27;s argument: that a right must either be a\n    common law right or a fundamental right. The only\n    material distinctions between the two….lie in the\n    incidence of the duty to respect the right and in the\n    forum in which a failure to do so can be redressed.\n    Common law rights are horizontal in their operation\n    when they are violated by one&#x27;s fellow man, he can be\n    named and proceeded against in an ordinary court of\n    law. Constitutional and fundamental rights, on the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                                      Page 51 of 66</span>\n\f    other hand, provide remedy against the violation of a\n    valued interest by the “State”…It is perfectly possible\n    for an interest to simultaneously be recognised as a\n    common law right and a fundamental right”.\n\n\n11.2.1      However, Nariman J. observed that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 21</a> was\n\ncouched in a negative form in order to interdict State action that\n\nfell afoul of its contours. But right to privacy being a fundamental\n\nright could be both against the government as well as private\n\nindividuals. The discussion in Puttaswamy was restricted to the\n\nright to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 21</a> primarily against State action.\n\n11.2.2     Kaul J. suggested horizontal application of the right to\n\nprivacy by holding that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">    “593...(in) today&#x27;s world, privacy is a limit on the\n    Government&#x27;s power as well as the power of private\n    sector entities”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">    Later in the judgement, he concluded that the right to\n\nprivacy is a fundamental right, and that it:\n\n    “644...is a right which protects the inner sphere of the\n    individual from interference from both State and non-\n    State actors”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">\n    Further, once again emphasising that technology has made it\n\npossible for non-State actors to ‘enter citizens’ houses’, he held\n\nthat:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                                       Page 52 of 66</span>\n\f    “646...privacy is one of the most important rights to be\n    protected both against State and non-State actors and\n    be recognised as a fundamental right”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">     However, Kaul J began his judgement by observing that:\n\n    “584...(the) right to privacy is claimed qua the State\n    and non-State actors. Recognition and enforcement of\n    claims qua non-State actors may require legislative\n    intervention by the State”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">\n    He thus recognised that in the status-quo, while enforcing\n\nthe right to privacy against private bodies might be desirable, it\n\nwas perhaps not yet possible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">\n11.2.3      The opinion by Chandrachud, J. (as he then was) was\n\nauthored on behalf of himself, Khehar J., Agrawal J. and Nazeer\n\nJ. Chandrachud J did not dilate as such on the public-private\n\naspect of the right to privacy as was done by the other Judges on\n\nthe Bench. He held that the protection of privacy as a\n\nconstitutional right embodies both ‘negative’ and ‘positive’\n\nfreedoms. From a negative perspective, it protects the individual\n\nfrom unwanted intrusions (note that here, Chandrachud J did\n\nnot limit it to intrusions by the State). From a positive\n\nperspective, it ‘obliges’ the State to adopt measures for protecting\n\nindividuals’ privacy. He then quoted the entry on the right to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                       Page 53 of 66</span>\n\fprivacy in the Max Planck Encyclopaedia of Comparative\n\nConstitutional Law as an ‘apt’ description of this facet. The entry\n\nopined that the ‘negative’ right to privacy entails protection\n\nagainst unwanted intrusion by both State and private actors.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"103640961\" id=\"span_109\">Chandrachud J, unlike Bobde J, did not separate common law\n\nand fundamental rights in terms of their enforceability against\n\nseparate bodies. Instead, he merely emphasised that simply\n\nbecause privacy was a common law/statutory right, it was not\n\nproscribed from also being recognised as a constitutional right.\n\n\n11.3    Subsequently, in <a href=\"/doc/103640961/\" id=\"a_127\">Kaushal Kishor vs. State of U.P.</a>\n\n(2023) 4 SCC 1 (“Kaushal Kishore”), one of the questions that a\n\nfive-judge     Constitution   bench   decided   was   whether         a\n\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_128\">Articles 19</a> or 21 could be claimed other\n\nthan         against    the     State/State     instrumentalities.\n\nRamasubramanian, J., writing for the majority, referred to\n\n‘Horizontal Effect’ as a constitutional concept, and proceeded to\n\nlist a number of cases where the Supreme Court had applied\n\nfundamental rights obligations horizontally. He then opined that\n\nin Puttaswamy, the Supreme Court had framed a ‘tool’ that\n\nestablishes guidelines for horizontal application. According to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                      Page 54 of 66</span>\n\fhim, this ‘tool’ was expressed in Bobde J’s opinion, the relevant\n\nextract of which has been reproduced above.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\n11.3.1      Ramasubramanian, J. relied on this separation of\n\ncommon law rights and fundamental rights to support his\n\nconclusion that Article 19/21 rights can indeed be enforced\n\nagainst non-State entities. While considering the question\n\nwhether a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_129\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_130\">21</a> can be\n\nclaimed   against    anyone    other     than   the    State     or      its\n\ninstrumentalities, it was clarified that the question is not about\n\n“claim” but about “enforceability”. The further question whether\n\nPart III of the Constitution has a “vertical” or “horizontal” effect\n\nwas also considered and it was observed that wherever\n\nconstitutional   rights   impact   the   relations    between    private\n\nindividuals, they are said to have “a horizontal effect”. When a\n\nconstitutional right regulates the Government and State actors in\n\ntheir dealings with private individuals, they are said to have “a\n\nvertical effect”. After discussing the approach of constitutional\n\ncourts in overseas jurisdiction on “verticality vs. horizontality”,\n\nreference was made to <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nwhich defines the expression “the State”. It was observed that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                         Page 55 of 66</span>\n\fthere are some Articles in Part III of the Constitution where the\n\nmandate is directly to the State and there are other Articles\n\nwhere without injuncting the State, certain rights are recognised\n\nto be inherited, either in the citizens of the country or in persons.\n\nReferring to Part III of the Constitution, it was observed that the\n\nArticles therein relate to citizens and persons. It was further\n\nobserved that the rights conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1732536/\" id=\"a_132\">Articles 15(2)(a)</a> and (b)<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_133\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_134\">,\n\n20(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">, 21</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_136\">, 23</a><a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_137\">, 24</a><a href=\"/doc/762902/\" id=\"a_138\">, 29(2)</a>, etc. are enforceable against non-State\n\nactors also. As already noted, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 21</a> deals, inter alia, with the\n\nright to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n11.3.2     While referring to Puttaswamy, it was observed that\n\nthe original thinking of this Court that the fundamental rights\n\ncan be enforced only against the State has changed over a period\n\nof time and that such rights can be enforced even against\n\nauthorities, instrumentalities of the State, agencies of the State,\n\nthose entities which enjoy monopoly status conferred by the\n\nState or where there is “deep and pervasive control” by the State\n\nwith regard to the “nature of duties/functions performed”.\n\nTherefore, Question No.2 was answered by the majority as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                       Page 56 of 66</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">\f     “A fundamental right under Articles 19/21 can be\n    enforced even against persons other than the State or\n    its instrumentalities.”\n\n\n11.3.4     In    the    aforesaid    judgment,   Question      No.3     was\n\nformulated thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">    “Whether the State is under a duty to affirmatively\n    protect the rights of a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 21</a> of the\n    Constitution of India even against a threat to the liberty\n    of a citizen by the acts or omissions of another citizen\n    or private agency?”\n\n\n    It was clarified by Ramasubramanian, J. that the word\n\n“citizen” ought to be read as “person” as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 21</a> states that “no\n\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty”. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_113\">In the\n\ncontext of personal liberty, it was observed that technological\n\neavesdropping     except    in      accordance   with    the   procedure\n\nestablished by law was frowned upon by this Court in People’s\n\nUnion for <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_142\">Civil Liberties (PUCL) vs. Union of India</a>, (1997) 1\n\nSCC 301.

The\n\ninfringement of the right to privacy by private players is now\n\nrampant and therefore, fundamental right to privacy can be\n\nenforced against non-State actors.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_114\">In this regard, reliance was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                                            Page 57 of 66</span>\n\fplaced on the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_143\">Maneka Gandhi vs.\n\nUnion of India</a>, (1978) 1 SCC 248 wherein it was observed that\n\nany law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy\n\na triple test : (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure\n\nmust withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights\n\nconferred under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 19</a> which may be applicable in a given\n\nsituation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with\n\nreference to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 14.</a> As the test propounded by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 14</a>\n\npervades <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 21</a> as well, the law and procedure authorising\n\ninterference with personal liberty and right of privacy must also\n\nbe right and just and fair and not arbitrary, fanciful or\n\noppressive.

However, the\n\nexception under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act has to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                       Page 58 of 66</span>\n\fconstrued in light of right to a fair trial which is also an aspect of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. When we weigh the\n\nrespective rights of the parties in a trial within the parameters of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act, we do not think that there is any\n\nbreach of right to privacy in the instant case. In fact, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 122</a>\n\nof the aforesaid Act does not recognise such a right at all. On the\n\nother hand, the said Section carves out an exception to right to\n\nprivacy between spouses and therefore cannot be applied\n\nhorizontally at all. In this regard, we reiterate that as per\n\nprocedure established by law, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act\n\ndoes not touch upon the aspect of right to privacy as envisaged\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, let alone invade upon such\n\nright. The reason is because <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act\n\nrecognises the right to a fair trial, right to produce relevant\n\nevidence and a right to prove one’s case against a spouse so as to\n\navail the relief sought for by a party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">\n12.1   As already discussed, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act\n\ndeals with both compellability as well as permissibility. The first\n\npart deals with compellability while the second part deals with\n\npermissibility. The second part dealing with permissibility is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                        Page 59 of 66</span>\n\ffollowed by two exceptions which are – a) proceedings in suits\n\nbetween married persons; and b) proceedings in which one\n\nmarried person is prosecuted for any crime committed against\n\neach other. Under the exception, the requirement of taking\n\nconsent from other spouse before disclosing the communication\n\nis done away with. Therefore, the exception has been carved out\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act itself to state that such\n\nprivilege between spousal communication does not extend to a\n\ncase of litigation between the spouses themselves. In such a\n\nsituation, the spouses would have the right to prove their\n\nrespective cases and therefore can let in such evidence which is\n\npermitted under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act, if one could use\n\nthe expression “spill the beans”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">\n12.2   However, in Kaushal Kishore, one of us (Nagarathna, J.)\n\nauthored a partly dissenting opinion by observing thus –\n\n    “260.3. While the content of a certain common law\n    right, may be identical to a fundamental right, the two\n    rights would be distinct in two respects : first,\n    incidence of the duty to respect such right; and second,\n    the forum which would be called upon to adjudicate on\n    the failure to respect such right. While the content of\n    the right violated may be identical, the status of the\n    violator, is what is relevant”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1731603\" id=\"span_118\">xxx\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                     Page 60 of 66</span>\n\f“263. Therefore, the primary object of Part III of the\nConstitution was to forge a new relationship between\nthe citizens and the State, which was the new site of\nGovernmental power. The realm of interaction between\ncitizens inter se, was governed by common law prior to\nthe enactment of the Constitution and continued to be\nso governed even after the commencement of the\nConstitution because as recognised hereinabove, the\ncommon rights and remedies were not obliterated even\nafter the Constitution was enacted. These inalienable\nrights, although subsequently placed in Part III of the\nConstitution, retained their identity in the arena of\ncommon law and continued to regulate relationships\nbetween citizens and entities, other than the State or\nits instrumentalities. It is therefore observed that the\nincidence of the duty to respect Constitutional and\nfundamental rights of citizens is on the State and the\nConstitution provides remedies against violation of\nfundamental rights by the State. These observations\nare in consonance with the recognition by this Court\nin People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of\nIndia [People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/1731603/\" id=\"a_162\">Civil Liberties v. Union of\nIndia</a>, (2005) 2 SCC 436] (“People&#x27;s Union for Civil\nLiberties”) that the objective of Part III is to place\ncitizens at centre stage and make the State accountable\nto them”.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">“264. On the other hand, common law rights regulate\nthe relationship between citizens inter se. Although the\ncontent of a common law right may be similar to a\nfundamental right, the two rights are distinct insofar\nas, the incidence of duty to respect a common law right\nis on citizens or entities other than State or its\ninstrumentalities; while the incidence of duty to respect\na fundamental right, except where expressly otherwise\nprovided, is on the State. Remedies against violation of\nfundamental rights by the State are constitutionally\nprescribed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_163\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_164\">226;</a> while common\nlaw remedies, some of which are statutorily recognised,\nare available against violation of common law rights.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                  Page 61 of 66</span>\n\fSuch remedies are available even as against fellow\ncitizens or entities other than State or its\ninstrumentalities. To this extent, horizontality is\nrecognised in common law. Further to some extent\ncertain fundamental rights are recognised statutorily\nand some others are expressly recognised in the\nConstitution as being applicable as horizontal rights\nbetween citizens inter se such as <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_165\">Articles 15(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_166\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_167\">, 23</a>\nand 24”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">                          xxx\n“268.7. Thus, recognising a horizontal approach of\nfundamental rights between citizens inter se would set\nat naught and render redundant, all the tests and\ndoctrines forged by this Court to identify “State” for the\npurpose of entertaining claims of fundamental rights\nviolations. Had the intention of this Court been to allow\nfundamental rights, including the rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_168\">Articles\n19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_169\">21</a>, to operate horizontally, this Court would\nnot have engaged in evolving and refining tests to\ndetermine the true meaning and scope of “State” as\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 12.</a> This Court would have simply\nentertained claims of fundamental rights violations\nagainst all persons and entities, without deliberating on\nfundamental questions as to maintainability of the writ\npetitions. Although this Court has significantly\nexpanded the scope of “State” as defined under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_171\">Article\n12</a>, such expansion is based on considerations such as\nthe nature of functions performed by the entity in\nquestion and the degree of control exercised over it by\nthe State as such. This is significantly different from\nrecognising horizontality of the fundamental rights\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_172\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_173\">21</a>, except while seeking a writ in\nthe nature of habeas corpus. Such a recognition would\namount to disregarding the jurisprudence evolved by\nthis Court as to the scope of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 12</a> of the\nConstitution”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                   Page 62 of 66</span>\n\f12.3   It must be reiterated that the content of a common law\n\nright may be similar to that of a fundamental right, but they are\n\ndistinguished by the incidence of their duties on private entities\n\nand the State respectively. Therefore, one can foist similar\n\nobligations on private bodies and the State, while separating the\n\navenues by which these obligations are enforced.\n\n\n12.4    In our view, <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act does not\n\nconcern itself with right to privacy vis-à-vis spouses which is\n\nevident on a reading of the Section and on discerning its plain\n\nmeaning. The 69th report of the Law Commission of India in 1977\n\nobserved that the section is “based on the abiding communication\n\nbetween the husband and wife, which is of such a nature that\n\ntheir mutual communications are not always to be regarded on the\n\nsame footing as communications between person who have no\n\nsuch intimate tie”. It prefaced this by noting that the law of\n\nevidence has generally demonstrated a “degree of solicitude\n\ntowards the sanctity of marriage”, and also referred to Best CJ’s\n\nopinion in Doker vs. Hasler, (1824) 171 E.M. 992, that “the\n\nhappiness of the marriage…requires that the confidence between\n\nman and his wife should be kept for ever inviolable”. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"114650506\" id=\"span_122\">Similarly,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                     Page 63 of 66</span>\n\fthe 1853 report of the English Commission on Common Law\n\nProcedure had observed that the ‘happiness’ of human life\n\ndepends on a large part upon the “inviolability” of domestic\n\nconfidence, and that the “alarm and unhappiness” caused to\n\nsociety    by   the   disclosure   of   confidential   communications\n\noutweighs the disadvantage in terms of a loss of evidence during\n\ntrials.1\n\n\n12.5       Therefore, the Delhi High Court observed in <a href=\"/doc/114650506/\" id=\"a_176\">RIT\n\nFoundation vs. Union of India</a>, 2022 SCC OnLine Del 1404,\n\nthat the Law Commission Report makes it clear that the “raison\n\nd&#x27;etre for the spousal privilege (is) the “higher degree of\n\nconfidence that goes with a marriage”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"894244\" id=\"span_124\">This was also the view\n\ntaken by the Delhi High Court in an earlier case – <a href=\"/doc/894244/\" id=\"a_177\">S.J.\n\nChoudhary vs. State</a> 1984 SCC OnLine Del 185 – where it held\n\nthat the “prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 122</a> of the Evidence Act is\n\nbased on the ground that the admission of such testimony is\n\nlikely to disturb the peace of the family and weaken the feeling of\n\nmutual confidence”.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">1</span>\n Report of the 69th <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_179\">Law Commission of India on the Indian Evidence Act,\n1872</a>, page 636.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                          Page 64 of 66</span>\n\f12.6     Clearly therefore, the founding rationale for <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 122</a>\n\nof the said Act, as has been recognised by the Law Commission\n\nand subsequently by certain High Courts, was to protect the\n\nsanctity of marriage and not the right to privacy of the\n\nindividuals involved. Therefore, in adjudicating situations where\n\nthe privilege under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 122</a> of the Act is not granted, as in\n\nsuits between a couple (an exception provided for in <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 122</a>\n\nitself), the right to privacy is not a relevant consideration, since it\n\nis not the rationale under which spousal communications were\n\ndeemed privileged under <a href=\"/doc/989396/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 122</a> of the Act.\n\nConclusion:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">13.
