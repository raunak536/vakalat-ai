Leave granted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The Bihar Public  Service  Commission  (for  short,  ‘the  Commission)\npublished advertisement No.6 of 2000 dated  10th  May,  2000  in  the  local\npapers of the State of Bihar declaring its intention to fill  up  the  posts\nof ‘State Examiner of Questioned Documents’, in Police Laboratory  in  Crime\nInvestigation Department, Government of Bihar,  Patna.   The  advertisement,\ninter alia, stated that  written  examination  would  be  held  if  adequate\nnumber  of  applications  were  received.   As  very   limited   number   of\napplications were received, the Commission, in terms of  the  advertisement,\ndecided against the  holding  of  written  examination.   It  exercised  the\noption to select the candidates for appointment to  the  said  post  on  the\nbasis of viva voce test alone.  The  Commission  completed  the  process  of\nselection and recommended the panel of selected candidates to the  State  of\nBihar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    One Saiyed Hussain Abbas Rizwi, respondent No.1  herein,  claiming  to\nbe a public spirited citizen, filed an  application  before  the  Commission\n(appellant herein) under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> (for short  “the\nAct”) on 16th December,  2008  seeking  information  in  relation  to  eight\nqueries.  These queries concerned the  interview  which  was  held  on  30th\nSeptember, 2002 and 1st October, 2002 by the Commission with regard  to  the\nabove advertisement.  These queries, inter alia, related  to  providing  the\nnames, designation and addresses of  the  subject  experts  present  in  the\nInterview Board, names and addresses of the  candidates  who  appeared,  the\ninterview statement with certified photocopies  of  the  marks  of  all  the\ncandidates, criteria for selection of the  candidates,  tabulated  statement\ncontaining average marks allotted to the candidates  from  matriculation  to\nM.Sc.  during  the  selection   process   with   the   signatures   of   the\nmembers/officers and certified copy of the  merit  list.   This  application\nremained pending with the Public Information Officer of the  Commission  for\na considerable time that led to filing  of  an  appeal  by  respondent  No.1\nbefore the State Information  Commission.   When  the  appeal  came  up  for\nhearing, the State Information Commission vide its order dated  30th  April,\n2009 had directed the  Public  Information  Officer-cum-Officer  on  Special\nDuty of the Commission that the information sought  for  be  made  available\nand the case was fixed for 27th August, 2009 when the  following  order  was\npassed :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           “The applicant is present.  A letter  dated  12.08.2009  of  the\n           Public Information Officer,  Bihar  Public  Service  Commission,\n           Patna has been  received  whereby  the  required  paragraph-wise\n           information which could be  supplied,  has  been  given  to  the\n           applicant.  Since the information which could  be  supplied  has\n           been given to the applicant, the proceedings  of  the  case  are\n           closed.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.    At this stage, we may also  notice  that  the  Commission,  vide  its\nletter dated 12th August, 2009, had furnished the information nearly to all\nthe queries of respondent No.1.  It also stated that no  written  test  had\nbeen conducted and that the name, designation and addresses of the  members\nof the Interview Board could not be furnished as they were not required  to\nbe supplied in accordance with the provisions of  <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_2\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>  of  the\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    Aggrieved from the said order of  the  Information  Commission  dated\n27th August, 2009, respondent No.1 challenged the same  by  filing  a  writ\nbefore the High Court of Judicature at  Patna.   The  matter  came  up  for\nhearing before a learned Judge of that Court, who, vide judgment dated 27th\nNovember, 2009 made the  following  observations  and  dismissed  the  writ\npetition :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           “If information with regard to them is  disclosed,  the  secrecy\n           and the authenticity of the process itself  may  be  jeopardized\n           apart from that information would  be  an  unwarranted  invasion\n           into  privacy  of  the  individual.   Restricting  giving   this\n           information has a larger public purpose behind  it.   It  is  to\n           maintain purity of the process of selection.  Thus, in  view  of\n           specific  provision  in  <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_3\">Section  8(1)(j)</a>,  in  my   view,   the\n           information could not be  demanded  as  matter  of  right.   The\n           designated authority in that organization also did not  consider\n           it right to divulge the information in larger  public  interest,\n           as provided in the said provision.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.    Feeling aggrieved, respondent No.1 challenged  the  judgment  of  the\nlearned Single Judge before the Division Bench of that Court  by  filing  a\nletters patent appeal being  LPA  No.102  of  2010.   The  Division  Bench,\namongst others, noticed the following contentions :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      (i)    that  third  party  interest  was  involved  in  providing  the\n      information asked for and, therefore,  could  properly  be  denied  in\n      terms of <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(n)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 8(1)(j)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_6\">11</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      (ii)  that respondent No.1 (the applicant) was a mere busybody and not\n      a candidate himself and was attempting to meddle with the  affairs  of\n      the Commission needlessly.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.   The Division Bench took  the  view  that  the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> were not attracted in the facts of the case  in  hand  inasmuch  as\nthis provision had application in respect of law enforcement agency and for\nsecurity purposes.  Since no such consideration arose with respect  to  the\naffairs of the Commission and its function was in public  domain,  reliance\non the said provision for  denying  the  information  sought  for  was  not\ntenable in law.  Thus, the Court in its  order  dated  20th  January,  2011\naccepted the appeal, set aside the order of the learned  Single  Judge  and\ndirected the Commission  to  communicate  the  information  sought  for  to\nrespondent No.1.  The Court directed the Commission to provide the names of\nthe members of the Interview Board, while denying  the  disclosure  of  and\nproviding photocopies of the papers containing the signatures and addresses\nof the members of the Interview Board.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">8.    The Commission challenging the legality and correctness of  the  said\njudgment has filed the present appeal by way of special leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">9.    The question that arises for consideration in the present case is  as\nto whether the Commission was duty bound  to  disclose  the  names  of  the\nmembers of the Interview  Board  to  any  person  including  the  examinee.\nFurther, when the Commission could take  up  the  plea  of  exemption  from\ndisclosure of information as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8</a>  of  the  Act  in\nthis regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19607639\" id=\"span_1\">10.   Firstly, we must examine the purpose and scheme  of  this  Act.   For\nthis purpose, suffice would it be to refer to the judgment of this Court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/19607639/\" id=\"a_9\">Namit Sharma v. Union of India</a> [2012 (8)  SCALE  593],  wherein\nthis Court has held as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           “27.   In terms of the Statement of Objects and Reasons  of  the\n           Act of 2002, it was stated that this law was enacted in order to\n           make the government more  transparent  and  accountable  to  the\n           public.  It was felt that in the present  democratic  framework,\n           free  flow  of  information  for  citizens  and   non-Government\n           institutions suffers  from  several  bottlenecks  including  the\n           existing legal framework, lack of infrastructure  at  the  grass\n           root level and an attitude of secrecy within the Civil  Services\n           as a result of the old framework of rules.  <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">The Act</a> was to  deal\n           with all such aspects.  The purpose and object was to  make  the\n           government more transparent and accountable to the public and to\n           provide freedom to every citizen to secure access to information\n           under the control of public authorities, consistent with  public\n           interest,  in  order  to  promote  openness,  transparency   and\n           accountability in administration  and  in  relation  to  matters\n           connected therewith or incidental thereto.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">11.   The scheme of the Act contemplates  for  setting  out  the  practical\nregime of right to information for citizens to secure access to information\nunder the control of public authorities, in order to  promote  transparency\nand accountability in the working of every public authority.  It was  aimed\nat  providing  free  access  to  information  with  the  object  of  making\ngovernance more transparent and accountable.  Another right  of  a  citizen\nprotected under the Constitution is the right to privacy.   This  right  is\nenshrined within the spirit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.   Thus,  the\nright to information has to be balanced with the right  to  privacy  within\nthe framework of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">12.   Where <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 3</a> of the Act grants right to citizens to have access to\ninformation,  there  <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_13\">Section  4</a>  places  an  obligation  upon  the   public\nauthorities to maintain records and  provide  the  prescribed  information.\nOnce an application seeking information is made, the same has to  be  dealt\nwith as per <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_15\">7</a> of the Act.  The request for information is to\nbe disposed of within the time postulated under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 7</a>\nof the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8</a> is one of the most important provisions of  the  Act\nas it is an  exception  to  the  general  rule  of  obligation  to  furnish\ninformation.  It gives the category of cases where the public authority  is\nexempted from providing the information.  To  such  exemptions,  there  are\ninbuilt exceptions under some of the provisions, where  despite  exemption,\nthe Commission may call upon the authority to furnish  the  information  in\nthe larger public interest.   This shows the wide scope of these provisions\nas intended by the  framers  of  law.   In  such  cases,   the  Information\nCommission has to apply its mind whether it is a case of  exemption  within\nthe provisions of the said section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">13.   Right to information is  a  basic  and  celebrated  fundamental/basic\nright but is not uncontrolled.  It  has  its  limitations.   The  right  is\nsubject  to  a  dual  check.    Firstly,  this  right  is  subject  to  the\nrestrictions  inbuilt  within  the  Act  and  secondly  the  constitutional\nlimitations emerging from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.   Thus,  wherever\nin response to an application for disclosure  of  information,  the  public\nauthority takes shelter under the provisions relating  to  exemption,  non-\napplicability or infringement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the  State\nInformation  Commission  has  to  apply  its  mind  and  form  an   opinion\nobjectively if the exemption claimed for was sustainable on  facts  of  the\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">14.   Now, we have to examine whether the Commission is a public  authority\nwithin the meaning of the Act. The expression ‘public authority’  has  been\ngiven an exhaustive definition  under  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_20\">section  2(h)</a>  of  the  Act  as  the\nLegislature has used the word  ‘means’  which  is  an  expression  of  wide\nconnotation. Thus, ‘public authority’ is defined as any authority  or  body\nor institution  of  the  Government,  established  or  constituted  by  the\nGovernment which falls in any of the stated categories under  <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  2(h)</a>\nof the Act.  In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 2(h)(a)</a>, a body or an institution which is\nestablished or constituted by or under the Constitution would be  a  public\nauthority.  Public Service Commission is established under <a href=\"/doc/1431095/\" id=\"a_23\">Article  315</a>  of\nthe Constitution of India and as such there cannot be any escape  from  the\nconclusion that the Commission shall be a public authority within the scope\nof this section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">15.   <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(f)</a> again is exhaustive  in  nature.   The  Legislature  has\ngiven meaning to the expression ‘information’ and has stated that it  shall\nmean any material in any form including papers, samples, data material held\nin electronic form, etc.  Right to information under <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 2(j)</a> means the\n‘right to information’ accessible under this Act which is held by or  under\nthe control of any public authority and includes the right to inspection of\nwork, documents, records, taking notes, extracts, taking  certified  sample\nof materials, obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies  and\nvideo cassettes, etc.  The right sought to  be  exercised  and  information\nasked for should fall within the  scope  of  ‘information’  and  ‘right  to\ninformation’ as defined under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">16.   Thus, what has to be seen is whether the information  sought  for  in\nexercise of right to information is one  that  is  permissible  within  the\nframework of law as prescribed under the Act.  If  the  information  called\nfor falls in any of the categories specified under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> or relates  to\nthe organizations to which the Act  itself  does  not  apply  in  terms  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1767825/\" id=\"a_27\">section 24</a> of the Act, the public authority can take such stand before  the\ncommission and decline to furnish  such  information.   Another  aspect  of\nexercise of this right is that where the information asked for  relates  to\nthird party information, the Commission is required to follow the procedure\nprescribed under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 11</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">17.   Before the High Court, reliance had been placed upon <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  8(1)(j)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 11</a> of the Act.  On facts, the controversy in the  present  case\nfalls within a very narrow compass.  Most of the details asked for  by  the\napplicant have already been furnished.  The  dispute  between  the  parties\nrelated only to the first query of the applicant, that is, with  regard  to\ndisclosure of the names and addresses  of  the  members  of  the  Interview\nBoard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">18.   On behalf of the Commission, reliance was placed upon <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 11</a> of the Act to contend that disclosure  of  the  names  would\nendanger the life of the members of the interview board and such disclosure\nwould also cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of  the  interviewers.\nFurther, it was contended that this  information  related  to  third  party\ninterest. The expression ‘third party’ has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(n)</a>  of\nthe Act to mean a person other  than  the  citizen  making  a  request  for\ninformation and includes a public authority.  For these reasons, they  were\nentitled to the exemption contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> and  were  not\nliable to disclose the required  information.   It  is  also  contended  on\nbehalf of the Commission that the  Commission  was  entitled  to  exemption\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 8(1)(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_36\">8(1)(g)</a> read together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">19.   On the contrary, the submission on behalf of the applicant  was  that\nit is an information which the  applicant  is  entitled  to  receive.   The\nCommission was not entitled to any exemption under any of the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 8</a>, and therefore, was obliged to disclose the said  information  to\nthe applicant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">20.   In the present case, we are not concerned  with  the  correctness  or\notherwise of the method adopted for selection of the candidates.  Thus, the\nfact that no written examination was held  and  the  selections  were  made\npurely on the basis  of  viva  voce,  one  of  the  options  given  in  the\nadvertisement itself, does not arise for our  consideration.   We  have  to\ndeal only with the plea as to whether the  information  asked  for  by  the\napplicant should be directed to be disclosed by the Commission  or  whether\nthe Commission is entitled to the exemption under the stated provisions  of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">21.   <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 8</a> opens with the non obstante language and is an exception to\nthe furnishing of information as is required under the relevant  provisions\nof the Act.  During the course of the hearing, it was not pressed before us\nthat the Commission is entitled  to  the  exemption  in  terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.  In view of this, we do not  propose  to  discuss  this\nissue any further nor would we deal with the correctness  or  otherwise  of\nthe impugned judgment of the High Court in that behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">22.   <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> provides an exemption from furnishing of  information,\nif the information available to a person is in  his  fiduciary  relationship\nunless the competent authority is  satisfied  that  larger  public  interest\nwarrants the disclosure of such information.  In terms of  <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_42\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>,\nthe public authority is not obliged to  furnish  any  such  information  the\ndisclosure of which would endanger  the  life  or  physical  safety  of  any\nperson or  identify  the  source  of  information  or  assistance  given  in\nconfidence for law enforcement and  security  purposes.   If  the  concerned\npublic authority holds the information in fiduciary relationship,  then  the\nobligation to furnish information is  obliterated.   But  if  the  competent\nauthority is still satisfied that in the  larger  public  interest,  despite\nsuch objection, the information should be furnished, it may  so  direct  the\npublic authority.  The term ‘fiduciary’ refers to a person having a duty  to\nact for the benefit of another, showing good faith and condour,  where  such\nother person reposes trust and special confidence in  the  person  owing  or\ndischarging the duty. The term ‘fiduciary relationship’ is used to  describe\na situation or transaction where one person places  complete  confidence  in\nanother person in regard to his affairs,  business  or  transactions.   This\naspect has been discussed in some detail in the judgment of  this  Court  in\nthe case of Central Board of Secondary Education (supra).  <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_43\">Section  8(1)(e)</a>,\ntherefore, carves out a protection in  favour  of  a  person  who  possesses\ninformation in his fiduciary relationship.  This protection can  be  negated\nby the  competent  authority  where  larger  public  interest  warrants  the\ndisclosure of such information, in which case, the authority is expected  to\nrecord reasons for its satisfaction.  Another very significant provision  of\nthe Act is 8(1)(j).  In terms of this provision, information  which  relates\nto personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to  any\npublic activity or interest or which would  cause  unwarranted  invasion  of\nthe privacy of the individual  would  fall  within  the  exempted  category,\nunless the authority concerned is  satisfied  that  larger  public  interest\njustifies the disclosure of such  information.   It  is,  therefore,  to  be\nunderstood clearly that it is a statutory exemption which must operate as  a\nrule and only in exceptional cases would disclosure be permitted, that  too,\nfor reasons to be recorded demonstrating satisfaction to the test of  larger\npublic interest.  It will not be in consonance  with  the  spirit  of  these\nprovisions, if  in  a  mechanical  manner,  directions  are  passed  by  the\nappropriate authority to disclose information  which  may  be  protected  in\nterms of the above provisions.   All  information  which  has  come  to  the\nnotice of or on record of  a  person  holding  fiduciary  relationship  with\nanother and but for such capacity, such  information  would  not  have  been\nprovided to that authority, would normally need to be  protected  and  would\nnot be open to disclosure keeping the  higher  standards  of  integrity  and\nconfidentiality  of such relationship.  Such exemption  would  be  available\nto such authority or department.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"41868\" id=\"span_2\">23.   The expression ‘public interest’ has to  be  understood  in  its  true\nconnotation so as to give complete meaning to  the  relevant  provisions  of\nthe Act.  The expression ‘public interest’ must  be  viewed  in  its  strict\nsense with all its exceptions  so  as  to  justify  denial  of  a  statutory\nexemption in terms of the Act.   In  its  common  parlance,  the  expression\n‘public interest’, like ‘public purpose’, is  not  capable  of  any  precise\ndefinition .

The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the  authorities  objectively\nand the consequences of such disclosure have to be weighed  with  regard  to\ncircumstances of a given case.  The decision has to be  based  on  objective\nsatisfaction recorded for ensuring that  larger  public  interest  outweighs\nunwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors stated  in  the  provision.\nCertain matters, particularly in relation to appointment,  are  required  to\nbe dealt with great confidentiality.  The information may come to  knowledge\nof the authority  as  a  result  of  disclosure  by  others  who  give  that\ninformation in confidence and with complete faith, integrity  and  fidelity.\nSecrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus,  bringing  it  within\nthe ambit of fiduciary capacity.  Similarly, there may be  cases  where  the\ndisclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest or it  may\neven cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of  the  individual.   All  these\nprotections have to be given their due implementation as  they  spring  from\nstatutory exemptions.  It is not  a  decision  simpliciter  between  private\ninterest and public  interest.   It  is  a  matter  where  a  constitutional\nprotection is available to a person with regard to  the  right  to  privacy.\nThus, the public interest has to be construed  while  keeping  in  mind  the\nbalance factor between right to privacy and right to  information  with  the\npurpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be  served  in  the\nlarger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge from  the\nconstitutional values under the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_3\">25.   First of all, the Court has to decide whether  in  the  facts  of  the\npresent case, the Commission  holds  any  fiduciary  relationship  with  the\nexaminee or the interviewers.

There are also certain relationships where both the parties\n           have to act in a fiduciary capacity treating the  other  as  the\n           beneficiary. Examples of these are: a partner vis-à-vis  another\n           partner and an employer  vis-à-vis  employee.  An  employee  who\n           comes  into  possession  of  business  or   trade   secrets   or\n           confidential information relating to the employer in the  course\n           of his employment, is expected to act as a fiduciary and  cannot\n           disclose it to others. Similarly,  if  on  the  request  of  the\n           employer or official superior or the head of  a  department,  an\n           employee furnishes his personal details and information,  to  be\n           retained in confidence, the employer, the official  superior  or\n           departmental head is expected to hold such personal  information\n           in confidence as a fiduciary, to be made  use  of  or  disclosed\n           only  if  the  employee’s  conduct  or  acts  are  found  to  be\n           prejudicial to the employer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           41. In a philosophical and very wide sense, examining bodies can\n           be said to act in a fiduciary capacity, with  reference  to  the\n           students who participate in an examination, as a Government does\n           while governing its citizens or as the present  generation  does\n           with reference to the future  generation  while  preserving  the\n           environment.

Other specialised examining bodies may simply  subject\n           the candidates to a process of verification by  an  examination,\n           to find out whether such person is  suitable  for  a  particular\n           post, job or assignment. An examining body, if it  is  a  public\n           authority entrusted with public functions, is  required  to  act\n           fairly, reasonably, uniformly and consistently for  public  good\n           and in public interest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"615635\" id=\"span_4\">43.

When   the   Examination   Board   conducts   an\n                 examination in discharge of its statutory function, it does\n                 not offer its ‘services’  to  any  candidate.  Nor  does  a\n                 student who participates in the  examination  conducted  by\n                 the Board, hire or avail of any service from the Board  for\n                 a  consideration.  On  the  other  hand,  a  candidate  who\n                 participates in the examination conducted by the Board,  is\n                 a person who has  undergone  a  course  of  study  and  who\n                 requests the Board to test him as to whether he has imbibed\n                 sufficient knowledge to be fit to  be  declared  as  having\n                 successfully completed the said course of education; and if\n                 so, determine his position or rank or competence  vis-à-vis\n                 other examinees.

The  examination\n                 fee paid by  the  student  is  not  the  consideration  for\n                 availment of any service,  but  the  charge  paid  for  the\n                 privilege of participation in the examination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                       13. … The fact that in the course of conduct  of  the\n                 examination, or evaluation of answer scripts, or furnishing\n                 of  marksheets  or  certificates,   there   may   be   some\n                 negligence, omission or deficiency, does  not  convert  the\n                 Board into a service  provider  for  a  consideration,  nor\n                 convert the examinee into a consumer….”\n\n           It cannot therefore be said that the  examining  body  is  in  a\n           fiduciary relationship either with reference to the examinee who\n           participates in the  examination  and  whose  answer  books  are\n           evaluated by the examining body.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                    XXX              XXX              XXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           49.

We, with respect, would follow the above reasoning of the Bench  and,\nthus, would have no hesitation in holding that in  the  present  case,  the\nexamining body (the Commission), is in no fiduciary relationship  with  the\nexaminee (interviewers) or the candidate interviewed.  Once  the  fiduciary\nrelationship is not  established,  the  obvious  consequence  is  that  the\nCommission cannot claim exemption as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 8(1)(e)</a>  of\nthe Act.   The  question  of  directing  disclosure  for  a  larger  public\ninterest, therefore, would not arise at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">27.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_49\">CBSE</a> case (supra), this Court had clearly stated the view that  an\nexaminer who examines the answer sheets holds the relationship of principal\nand agent with the examining body.  Applying the same principle, it has  to\nbe held that the interviewers hold the position of an ‘agent’ vis-a-vis the\nexamining body which is the ‘principal’.  This relationship per se  is  not\nrelatable to any of the exemption clauses but there  are  some  clauses  of\nexemption, the foundation of which is not a  particular  relationship  like\nfiduciary relationship.  Clause 8(1)(g) can come into play with any kind of\nrelationship.  It requires that where the disclosure of  information  would\nendanger the life or physical safety of any person or identify  the  source\nof information or assistance given in confidence  for  law  enforcement  or\nsecurity purposes, the information need not be provided.   The  High  Court\nhas rejected the application of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_50\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>  on  the  ground  that  it\napplies only with regard to law enforcement or security purposes  and  does\nnot have general application.  This reasoning of the High Court is contrary\nto the very language of  <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_51\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>.   <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>  has  various\nclauses in itself.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">28.   Now, let us examine the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_53\">Section  8(1)(g)</a>  with  greater\nemphasis on the expressions that are relevant to the  present  case.   This\nsection concerns with the cases where no obligation is cast upon the public\nauthority to furnish information, the disclosure of  which  would  endanger\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">(a) the life (b) physical safety of any person.  The  legislature,  in  its\nwisdom, has  used  two  distinct  expressions.   They  cannot  be  read  or\nconstrued as being synonymous.  Every expression used  by  the  Legislature\nmust  be  given  its  intended  meaning  and,   in   fact,   a   purposeful\ninterpretation.  The expression  ‘life’  has  to  be  construed  liberally.\n‘Physical safety’ is a restricted  term  while  life  is  a  term  of  wide\nconnotation.  ‘Life’ includes reputation of an individual as  well  as  the\nright to live with freedom.  The expression ‘ life’ also appears in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution and has been provided a wide meaning so as to  inter\nalia include within its ambit the right to  live  with  dignity,  right  to\nshelter, right to basic needs  and  even  the  right  to  reputation.   The\nexpression life under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_55\">section 8</a>(1(g) the Act, thus, has to be understood in\nsomewhat similar dimensions.  The term ‘endanger’ or  ‘endangerment’  means\nthe act or an instance of putting someone or something in danger;  exposure\nto peril or such  situation  which  would  hurt  the  concept  of  life  as\nunderstood in  its  wider  sense  [refer  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (Eighth\nEdition)]. Of course, physical safety would mean the likelihood of  assault\nto physical existence of a person.  If in  the  opinion  of  the  concerned\nauthority there is danger to life or  possibility  of  danger  to  physical\nsafety, the State Information Commission would be entitled  to  bring  such\ncase within the exemption of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the Act.  The disclosure of\ninformation which would endanger the life or physical safety of any  person\nis one  category  and  identification  of  the  source  of  information  or\nassistance given in confidence for law enforcement or security purposes  is\nanother  category.   The  expression  ‘for  law  enforcement  or   security\npurposes’ is to be read ejusdem generis only to the expression  ‘assistance\ngiven in confidence’ and not to any other clause of the  section.   On  the\nplain reading of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 8(1)(g)</a>, it becomes clear that the  said clause is\ncomplete in itself.  It cannot  be  said  to  have  any  reference  to  the\nexpression ‘assistance given in confidence for law enforcement or  security\npurposes’.  Neither the language of the  Section  nor  the  object  of  the\nSection requires such interpretation.  It would not further  the  cause  of\nthis section.  <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 8</a>  attempts  to  provide  exemptions  and  once  the\nlanguage of the Section  is  unambiguous  and  squarely  deals  with  every\nsituation, there is no occasion for the Court to frustrate the very  object\nof the Section.  It will amount to misconstruing the provisions of the Act.\n The High Court though has referred to <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> but  has,  in  fact,\ndealt with the language of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 8(1)(g)</a>.   The  reasoning  of  the  High\nCourt, therefore, is neither clear in reference to provision of the Section\nnor in terms of the language thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_6\">29.   Now, the ancillary question that arises is  as  to  the  consequences\nthat the interviewers or the  members  of  the  interview  board  would  be\nexposed to in the event their names and addresses or individual marks given\nby them are directed to be disclosed.  Firstly, the members  of  the  Board\nare likely to be exposed to danger  to  their  lives  or  physical  safety.\nSecondly, it will hamper  effective  performance  and  discharge  of  their\nduties as examiners.  This is the information available with the  examining\nbody in confidence with the interviewers.  Declaration of collective  marks\nto the candidate is one thing and that, in fact, has been permitted by  the\nauthorities as well as the High Court.  We see no error of jurisdiction  or\nreasoning in this regard.  But direction to furnish the names and addresses\nof the interviewers would certainly  be  opposed  to  the  very  spirit  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of  the  Act.   <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_62\">CBSE</a>  case  (supra)  has  given  sufficient\nreasoning in this regard and at this stage, we may refer to  paragraphs  52\nand 53 of <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_63\">the said judgment</a> which read as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">           “52. When an examining body engages the services of an  examiner\n           to evaluate the answer books, the  examining  body  expects  the\n           examiner not to disclose the information regarding evaluation to\n           anyone other than the examining  body.  Similarly  the  examiner\n           also  expects  that  his  name  and  particulars  would  not  be\n           disclosed to the candidates whose answer books are evaluated  by\n           him. In the event  of  such  information  being  made  known,  a\n           disgruntled examinee who is not satisfied with the evaluation of\n           the answer books, may act to the prejudice of  the  examiner  by\n           attempting  to  endanger  his  physical  safety.  Further,   any\n           apprehension on the part of  the  examiner  that  there  may  be\n           danger to his physical safety, if his identity becomes known  to\n           the examinees, may come in the way of effective discharge of his\n           duties. The above applies not only to the examiner, but also  to\n           the scrutiniser, co-ordinator and head examiner  who  deal  with\n           the answer book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           53. The answer book usually contains not only the signature  and\n           code number of the examiner, but also the  signatures  and  code\n           number  of  the  scrutiniser/co-ordinator/head   examiner.   The\n           information as to the names or particulars of the  examiners/co-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">           ordinators/scrutinisers/head examiners  are  therefore  exempted\n           from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the  RTI  Act,  on  the\n           ground that if such information is disclosed,  it  may  endanger\n           their physical safety. Therefore, if the  examinees  are  to  be\n           given access to evaluated  answer  books  either  by  permitting\n           inspection or by granting certified  copies,  such  access  will\n           have to be given only to that part of the answer book which does\n           not contain any information or signature  of  the  examiners/co-\n           ordinators/scrutinisers/head examiners, exempted from disclosure\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the RTI  Act.  Those  portions  of  the\n           answer   books   which   contain   information   regarding   the\n           examiners/co-ordinators/scrutinisers/head examiners or which may\n           disclose their identity with reference to signature or initials,\n           shall have to be removed, covered, or otherwise severed from the\n           non-exempted part of the answer books, under <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 10</a>  of  the\n           RTI Act.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">30.   The above reasoning of the Bench squarely applies to the present case\nas well.  The disclosure of names and  addresses  of  the  members  of  the\nInterview Board would ex facie endanger their  lives  or  physical  safety.\nThe possibility of a failed candidate attempting to take revenge from  such\npersons cannot be ruled out.  On the one hand, it is likely to  expose  the\nmembers of the Interview Board to harm and, on the other,  such  disclosure\nwould serve no fruitful much less any  public  purpose.   Furthermore,  the\nview of the High Court in the judgment under appeal that  element  of  bias\ncan be traced and would be crystallized only if the names and addresses  of\nthe examiners/interviewers are furnished is  without  any  substance.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_7\">The\nelement of bias can hardly be co-related with the disclosure of  the  names\nand addresses of the interviewers.  Bias is  not  a  ground  which  can  be\nconsidered for or against a party making an application to which  exemption\nunder <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8</a> is pleaded as a defence.  We  are  unable  to  accept  this\nreasoning of the High Court.  Suffice it to note that the reasoning of  the\nHigh Court is not in conformity with the principles stated by this Court in\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_68\">CBSE</a> case (supra).  The transparency that is expected to be  maintained\nin such process would not take within  its  ambit  the  disclosure  of  the\ninformation called for under query No.1 of the  application.   Transparency\nin such cases is relatable to the  process  where  selection  is  based  on\ncollective wisdom  and  collective  marking.   Marks  are  required  to  be\ndisclosed but disclosure of individual names would  hardly  hold  relevancy\neither to the concept of transparency or for proper exercise of  the  right\nto information within the limitation of the Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">31.
