Therefore, they requested the Commission to drop\nthe proceedings against them. In view of this, the HDFC Ltd. is dropped from\nthe memo of parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">7.     The counsel for ICICI Bank Ltd. reiterated the arguments made by him\non the last date of hearing i.e., 11.03.2022. He further added that the judgment\nof RBI Vs, Jayantilal N Mistry was not a complete code in itself wherein all\nexemption clauses were not discussed but only dwelt upon annual inspection\nreports/audit reports as such not being exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the\nRTI Act. He further argued that the issues which were not discussed in the said\njudgment were then squarely pending before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in W.P. (C) No. 1159/2019. The counsel for the ICICI Bank Ltd. further\nsubmitted that the information sought by the RTI applicant was completely\nexempted as the same contained data and information provided by bank about\nits clients and their functioning which were exempted from disclosure under\n<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_6\">8(1)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act as well. He further referred to\na circular dated 14.03.1998 of Reserve Bank of India vide which Inspection\nReport and Risk Assessment Report could not be disclosed to general public as\nthe same included capital adequacy, inherent risk, economic stability and a\ndialogue between the regulator and the bank which could not be disclosed under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act</a>. He emphasized that those reports were shared with the Directors\nonly during the deliberations in the Board and copies thereof were not provided\nto them. He further submitted that the FAA dismissed the first appeal without\neven considering the grounds raised in the First Appeal or satisfying himself\nabout the public interest in disclosure. Solely placing reliance on the judgement\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs Jayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors., in general,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                        Page 4 of 37</span>\n he has held that information sought must be disclosed without giving a reasoned\norder of rejecting various points raised in the objections. No findings were\ngiven regarding objections on account of various provisions of exemption under\n<a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act on the disclosure of the report as a\nwhole or various information interspersed in the report. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"98132808\" id=\"span_4\">He further stated that\nLd. FAA &amp; CPIO, had failed to rely on the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt, in the matter of CPIO, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/98132808/\" id=\"a_11\">India vs. Subhash Chandra\nAgarwal</a> (2020) 5 SCC 481 wherein it had been held that, CPIO, must apply the\n&#x27;public interest test&#x27; and satisfy himself as to how disclosure of third party\ninformation was required in overwhelming public interest. The counsel for the\nICICI Bank Ltd. further referred to the para nos.</span> 76 and 77 of Jayantilal N\nMistry&#x27;s case. He further objected that the CPIO, RBI had wrongly asked them\nto bring stay order from the CIC else they would disclose the information to the\nRTI applicant. The information sought was a dialogue between regulator and\nthe bank and even as per the RBI circular, that type of information could not be\ndisclosed under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">RTI Act</a>. He stated that the CPIO, RBI and FAA had\nviolated the principles of natural justice, as they had not given any personal\nhearing to them before passing their decisions in the matter. No reasons were\ngiven for not offering personal hearing in the first appeal. The counsel for the\nappellant prayed before the Commission that the FAA order should be set-aside\nfor want of reasons and/or should wait for the outcome of the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in W.P. No. 1159/2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">8.     The counsel for the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. submitted that the Ld.\nFAA had passed the Impugned Order without giving any opportunity of being\nheard to the Appellant Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and had inter alia failed to\nappreciate that the sought disclosure of the said Inspection Reports were\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005, more\nparticularly under <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>. Besides\nthe contents of the said Inspection Reports sought to be disclosed contained\nconfidential information pertaining to the Appellant, its customers as well as\ndetails of the Appellant&#x27;s commercial transactions, details of Appellant&#x27;s\nregulatory compliances bearing no relation with public activity/ larger public\ninterest, and disclosure of the same would cause prejudice to the Appellant, its\ncompetitive positionin the market and would also affect customer&#x27;s confidence\nin the Appellant Bank, it was argued. He further stated that the FAA did not\nissue notice/ letter indicating the hearing ofthe First Appeal and no opportunity\nof being heard was granted to the Appellant. The Impugned Order, therefore,\nwas vitiated by non-observance of the principles of natural justice. He further\ncontended that the bank was entitled to know the reasons for rejecting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                       Page 5 of 37</span>\n contentions made by it in an appeal by way of a reasoned order, however, the\nLd. FAA had mechanically passed the Impugned Order. He further submitted\nthat the Inspection Reports were part of an ongoing conversation / dialogue\nbetween the Appellant and RBI. The Inspection Reports sought were\nconfidential and sensitive information which were part of data examined by RBI\nought to be read in correct context. Single Inspection Report / piece- meal\ndisclosure of Inspection Report under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_17\">RTI Act</a> either by redacting some\nportions or otherwise would present a distorted picture of the business of the\nAppellant.Pertinently, disclosure of confidential information to public at large\nwould jeopardize the market value, goodwill and business plans of the\nAppellant. It was submitted that the disclosure of confidential/sensitive\ninformation furnished by the Appellant would result in disclosure of\nconfidential and private information of the customers of the bank. If such\ninformation was disclosed, it would have affected the trust reposed by people in\nprivate commercial bank. Needless to mention that would not only affect the\nfunctioning of the banking and financial services sector of the country, but such\ndisclosure would also prejudicially affect the Appellant&#x27;s functioning and would\ninfringe the Appellant&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; right to conduct /undertake business.\nThus, it was submitted that the disclosure of the Inspection Reports was in\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. The right to privacy of a person\nhas been recognized and upheld as a fundamental rightunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution by a nine justices&#x27; bench of the Apex Court in K.S.Puttaswamyv.\nUnion of India [Reported at (2017) 10 SCC 1]. The counsel further submitted\nthat the Appellant Bank has also filed an Intervention Application being\nIANo.71227 of 2021 in the matter and the same was pending before the Court.\nIn the meantime,if the information is disclosed by RBI as indicated by them in\ntheir letter dated 13th August 2021, irreparable damage would have been caused\nto the Appellant&#x27;s rights during the pendency of this Appeal and the said Writ\nPetitions. The Appellants had also filed an application for interim relief in the\nabove Appeal and till the issue was pending before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nand/or pendency of the Appeal the Commission should stay the Impugned\nOrder in the interest of justice and equity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_6\">9.     The counsel for the HDFC Bank Ltd. had also raised similar issues as\nmentioned above and was aggrieved by the decision of the CPIO and FAA. He\nstated that the CPIO without appreciating the contentions / objections raised by\nthe Appellant and rights of the Appellant, its customers and employees, passed\nan unreasoned and nonspeaking decision and communicated its intent to\ndisclose the details of the said Reports by the impugned Order. Pertinently, the\nCPIO did not deal with any objection raised by the Appellant in its reply with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                        Page 6 of 37</span>\n respect to <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11</a> Notice and hence, the decision arrived by the CPIO was\nissued in gross transgression of the principles of natural justice. He, further,\nsubmitted that while the Ld. FAA had relied upon the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s\nJudgment in Transferred Case <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_21\">No.91 of 2015 Reserve Bank of India V.\nJayantilal N. Mistry</a> for disclosure of inspections report, it was apposite to\nmention that the Appellant amongst other bank had filed Writ Petition being\nWrit Petition No.1095 of 2019 before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India inter\nalia challenging disclosure of vital information of the banks, including the\ninspection/ risk assessment reports. Thus, the issue pertaining to disclosure of\ninspection reports under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_22\">RTI Act</a> was sub-judice before the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court of India in the said Writ Petition filed by several banks.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"185686797\" id=\"span_8\">10. The counsel for the Bajaj Finance Ltd. submitted that they were\naggrieved by the order passed by the CPIO and FAA. He stated that the First\nAppellate Authority failed to appreciate that the scope, purport and application\nof <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_23\">the above decision</a> and othersrelating to regulatory and/ or supervisory\nmatters of RBI were pending consideration by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in a\nbatch of matters led by the case of <a href=\"/doc/185686797/\" id=\"a_24\">HDFC Bank Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. Union of India\n(WP (C)No.1159/</a> 2019.</span> He further contended that the First Appellate Authority\nfurther failed to notice the statutory provisions of Chapter III-B of the Reserve\nBankof India Act, 1943 relating to Appellant/ NBFC and mechanically applied\nthe decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal N. Mistry case which\ndealt with the inspection reports qua the Banks and not NBFCs like the\nAppellant Company. None of the issues raised by the Appellant Company were\nconsidered by the First Appellate Authority. He stated that the provisions\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_25\">Chapter III-B of the RBI Act</a> categorically demonstrates that the\nintent of the legislature was to keep the information shared between the RBI and\nthe concerned NBFC in strict confidence and was not to be disclosed to any\nthird party. The Preamble ofthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_26\">RTI Act</a> itself provides that the right to\ninformation and requirements for preservation of confidentiality of sensitive\ninformation were to be harmonised. Therefore, a purposive meaning ought to\nhave been given to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_27\">Special Act</a> such as the prohibition on\ndisclosure of information u/s 45-NB in <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_28\">Chapter III-B of the RBI Act</a>. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1505749\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"914491\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160740668\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"289362\" id=\"span_12\">The\ncounsel has further referred to the decisions of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India\nin <a href=\"/doc/289362/\" id=\"a_29\">Rangku Dutta Vs.

The counsel for the Indusind Bank Ltd. submitted that a second appeal\nbearing no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/135704 was filed by them wherein stay was\ngranted to them vide order dated 10.02.2022. The counsel for the bank further\nsubmitted that the CPIO had passed the non-speaking order and no finding was\ngiven on various issues raised by the appellant. He stated that the FAA should\nhave considered and applied the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_36\">RTI Act</a> more particularly\nprovisions relating to the exemptions from disclosure and provisions prohibiting\ndisclosure of certain information, while deciding the appeal of the appellant.\nSimply because the information which was being generated by the RBI or\navailable in possession with RBI, it could not be disclosed or given to the public\nwithout any further inquiry and examination/scrutiny under the provisions of the\nAct. He stated that the FAA having dismissed the appeal of the appellant by\napplying the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_37\">Reserve Bank\nof India &amp; Ors.

Jayantilal Mistry &amp; Ors</a> had violated the principles of\nnatural justice in as much as the appellate authority did not grant any\nopportunity to the appellant to submit its response to the applicability of said\njudgment. The information sought by the applicant was exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8(1)(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_39\">8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.

The counsel for IDFC Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. submitted that the\nbank prima facie raised its objections to the clubbing of the captioned matters\nand listing them for hearing on 30th March 2022 along with ICICI Bank&#x27;s\nAppeal. The appellant inter alia submitted that they were not aware about the\nfacts and circumstances involved in the ICICI Bank&#x27;s Appeal, or for that matter\nin the appeals of the other banks and financial institutions. The facts and\ncircumstances involved in the captioned Appeals may be entirely different from\nthat of IDFC Bank&#x27;s Appeal. In fact, the nature of information sought in ICICI\nBank&#x27;s Appeal and the captioned matters were highly different since the\ninspection reports prepared by RBI, in relation to each bank, were based on the\ninformation pertaining to the respective individual bank, and therefore,\ninformation contained in such inspection reports would highly vary from bank\nto bank. Moreover, the questions of law, submissions and/or other objections of\nIDFC FIRST Bank might differ from that of ICICI Bank&#x27;s Appeal. The\nappellant bank inter alia argued that the information sought by the RTI\napplication Shri Girish Mittal was exempted from disclosure under the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_40\">section 8 (1) (a)</a>, (d), (h) and (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_41\">RTI Act</a>; and that the\nSupreme Court&#x27;s judgment in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_42\">Reserve Bank of India v. Jayantilal N. Mistry\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                       Page 8 of 37</span>\n &amp;Anr.</a>[(2016) 3 SCC 525] did not deal with the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_43\">section 8 (1)</a></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">(d) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_44\">RTI Act</a>. They further stated that the inspection report contained\nconfidential and sensitive information in relation to the business of appellant\nincluding trade secrets and information of commercial nature. That the\ninspection reports contained information such as names and details of the\nclients, their transaction history, financial solvency, business model of the\nappellant, its solvency, disclosure of which in public domain would provide\ninformation to the competitors of the appellant, thereby causing commercial\ndisadvantage to the appellant. The appellant while claiming exemption under\n<a href=\"/doc/464173/\" id=\"a_45\">section 8 (1) (a)</a> of the RTI Act argued that the inspection reports contained\ncomplex business data which could not be comprehended by a layman. In fact,\neven a person with expertise would require context to correctly and rightly\nunderstand the inspections reports. Therefore, the wholesale disclosure of the\ninspection reports without any background could set panic in the depositors,\ninvestors and other stakeholders of the appellant bank which would\nconsequently have direct adverse effect on the functioning of financial services\nsector specifically and the economy generally. Hence, the disclosure of the\ninspection reports would affect the &quot;economic security&quot; of the country. The\nappellant while claiming exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_46\">section 8 (1) (d)</a> of the RTI Act relied\nupon the RBI Circular dated 14th March 1998 titled &quot;Inspection under <a href=\"/doc/222598/\" id=\"a_47\">section\n35</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949&quot;, wherein the RBI had directed the\ncommercial banks to not provide a copy of the inspections reports even to its\ndirectors. They contended that as per the circular even where a copy of the\ninspection reports were permitted to be given to the audit committee and/or\nstatutory auditors of the commercial banks, such copies would be retained by\ncommittee/auditors in strict confidence. Therefore, the information contained in\nthe inspection reports were of such nature that even the directors of the\ncommercial banks were not allowed to retain copies, the same under no\ncircumstance were supposed to be provided to a third person i.e. an RTI\napplicant with no interest or concern at all. The appellant while claiming\nexemption under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_48\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> of the RTI Act, argued that the information\ncontained material information relating to the customers against whom legal\nproceedings had been initiated and were sub judice. Therefore, the disclosure of\nthe information could adversely impact proceedings and investigations and\nrecovery of dues. Moreover, show cause notices issued by the RBI to the\nappellant was done by RBI under its regulatory and supervisory work. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_17\">Thus, the\ninformation was exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_49\">section 8 (1) (h)</a> of the RTI\nAct. The appellant while claiming exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_50\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI\nAct, argued that the information constituted &quot;personal information&quot; relating to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                      Page 9 of 37</span>\n the customers of the appellant bank. Therefore, the disclosure of the information\nwould violate right to privacy of the appellant and its customers. The appellant\nrelied upon the following observations made by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_51\">K.S.\nPuttaswamy vs. Union of India</a> [(2017) 10 SCC 1]:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;652.3.

Subhash\nChandra Aggarwal</a> [(2020) 5 SCC 481]:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;95.

However, this is not to\n       state that &quot;motive&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot; may not be relevant factor while\n       applying the public interest test in case of qualified exemptions governed\n       by the public interest test.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">13. In view of the above, the appellant Bank prayed that the order dated\n02.08.2021 passed by the FAA should be set aside by declaring that the\ninformation sought by the RTI applicant including the Inspections Reports/Risk\nAssessment Reports under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_55\">RTI Act</a> was exempted from disclosure under the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_56\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">14. The appellant State Bank of India while presenting his case inter alia\nsubmitted that the RBI in pursuant to the ratio in Jayantilal N Mistry case and\nthe Girish Mittal case, RBI disclosed complete RARs, of the Appellant Bank for\nthe years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, without complying with the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_57\">RTI Act</a> or the principles of natural justice, actions were completely arbitrary,\nand therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The Appellant bank\nfurther submitted that they were in the apprehension that the same might be\ndone in the instant case also. The appellant Bank alsosubmitted thatthe\nobservations recorded by the RBI in the documents ((Inspection Report/Risk\nassessment Report) were based on confidential information concerning the\nBank and its customers, which RBI had obtained in its capacity as the banking\nregulator/ supervisor of the country. Further, the observations could be best\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                        Page 10 of 37</span>\n handled by specialists in the subject and making it available to public at large\nmight lead to erroneous interpretations and consequentially, to unwarranted and\navoidable impact on the standing of the entire banking system- SBI being a\nDomestic Systemically Important Bank (DSIB) and also otherwise being the\nleading financial institution of the country. Accordingly, the appellant\ncontended that the disclosure would prejudicially affect the economic interests\nof the State (India) thereby harming the overall public sentiment also. Hence,\nthe entire information sought was exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_59\">section 8(1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">(a) of the Act. In additional to the above, the appellant bank stated that major\npart of the information contained in the Documents were personal information\nof customers of the appellant&#x27;s Bank, held in the fiduciary capacity and in the\nabsence of any details as to how disclosure of which would have a constructive\nimpact on public activity or interest, its disclosure would cause unwarranted\ninvasion into the privacy of the individuals/customers. Therefore, the\ninformation sought by the RTI applicant was exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_60\">section 8 (1) (e)</a>\n&amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">RTI Act</a>. It was also argued that the exemption had to be seen from\nthe standpoint of SBI and not RBI. The appellant informed that the contents of\nthe Documents were reflective and contained particulars of their internal\npositions, control systems and procedures. Disclosure of the information\ncontained therein would adversely impact the appellant Bank&#x27;s repute and would\nharm the standing &amp; image of the Bank in the public eye and accordingly it\nwould harm the competitive position of a third party, viz (appellant Bank).\nAccordingly exemption was claimed under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_62\">section 8(1) (d)</a> of the Act. The\nappellant bank humbly submitted that the Documents comprises of Risk\nAssessment, Major areas of financial divergence, findings on capital and\nearnings and major areas of non-compliance. The Annexure mentioned in the\nReports give statistical data which was most sensitive information for SBI and\nwas exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 8(1) (d)</a> of the RTI Act. The appellant bank also\nsubmitted that the directions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court to RBI in the Girish\nMittal case had been misconstrued by RBI. The appellant contended that the\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the Jayantilal N Mistry case and the Girish Mittal case\nwere presented with a limited perspective, as the parties which were central to\nthe entire process and arguably one of the primary stakeholders who stand\naffected by the said Judgments i.e. the banks and the financial institutions (such\nas the Appellant Bank herein), were not party to the proceedings / the above\nsaid Judgments, and hence, the Appellant Bank herein never had an opportunity\nto put forth its stand before the Hon&#x27;ble Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">15. The counsel for the appellant Bank i.e. Bank of Baroda while presenting\nthe case inter alia submitted that providing the RAR (Risk Assessment Report)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                      Page 11 of 37</span>\n of the Bank might hamper the Bank&#x27;s competitive position and would cause\nprejudice to Bank&#x27;s commercial interest, hence, the disclosure thereof was\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_64\">section 8 (1) (d)</a> of the RTI Act. The appellant bank further\ncontended that RAR and Inspection Report contained third party/customer\ninformation, held by the bank in fiduciary capacity and disclosure of\ninformation to the RTI applicant might jeopardize the banker-customer relation\nand might amount to infringement of their fiduciary relation hence the same was\nexempted under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_65\">section 8 (1) (e)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_66\">RTI Act</a>. Besides, the appellant\nbank vehemently argued that the CPIO of RBI while conveying his intention to\ndisclosure the information, had failed to explain as to how the information\nsought would have served the larger public interest. Furthermore, the appellant\nBank submitted that the RBI while forwarding Risk Assessment Report of any\nBank placed the following restrictions on disclosure of the same which was not\nrescinded by the RBI: &quot;The supervisory rating is issued in strict confidence for\nrestricted information of the TOP Management only. The Bank should not quote\nthis for raising deposits or loans or in any other communications. Divulgence of\nthis information to any authority under law is permissible only after written\napproval from the RBI. &quot; <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89964630\" id=\"span_22\">In addition to the above, the appellant Bank relied\nupon the case: a writ petition (civil) No. 786 of 2021- <a href=\"/doc/89964630/\" id=\"a_67\">Bank of Baroda vs.\nUnion of India &amp; ORS</a> before Hon&#x27;ble SC and made the following prayers:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (a) &quot;Issue a writ in the nature of writ, order of directions to CPIO and\n       RBI not to disclose the confidential and sensitive information and strike\n       down the said Impugned Actions taken by the CPIO, RBI as against the\n       petitioner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       (b) Declare that information obtained by RBI in course of its\n       inspections as well as in the course of its regulatory and functions related\n       to banks and the financial institutions including information relating to\n       customer/employees, information in relation to the management, business\n       plan, trade secret and risk ratings of the petitioner bank, requirement &amp;\n       regulatory intervention any unpublished price sensitive information are\n       exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_68\">section 8 (1)</a> of the RTI Act cannot be\n       disclosed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (c) Direct the respondent not to disclose any reports or any\n       information whether in full or in part, contained in them which are\n       exempted from disclosure under relevant provisions of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_69\">section 8</a> of the\n       RTI Act, and /or under any other law(s) for the time being in force.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       (d) Direct the respondents to forthwith forbear from disclosure to\n       applicants or otherwise information obtained by RBI in the course of it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                       Page 12 of 37</span>\n        Inspections as well as in the course of its regulatory and related functions\n       relating to banks and financial institutions.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">It was informed by the appellant bank that aforesaid writ petition was pending\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court for considerations.

The counsel for the RTI applicant i.e. Shri Girish Mittal submitted that\nthe respondent Reserve Bank of India was duty bound to disclose the\ninformation sought by the applicant in his RTI application as per Jayantilal\nMistry case. He stated that the Reserve Bank of India was creator of reports and\nit acted as a guardian of public interest. Banks worked in the interest of public\nand it was the public money that had been invested in banks, therefore, there\nwas a larger public interest in disclosing the information. Therefore, as per the\njudgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India dated 16.12.2015 and as per order\ndated 28.04.2021 complete information should be disclosed to the RTI\napplicant. He stated that there was no ambiguity in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and\nthere was a larger public interest in disclosing the information. On query from\nthe Commission, the counsel for the applicant submitted that Shri Girish Mittal\nhas also been impleaded in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nother tagged matters which were pending before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of\nIndia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"89279518\" id=\"span_24\">17.

The\nFAA had also dismissed the first appeals of the banks summarily. Being\naggrieved by the orders of the FAA, some banks had filed second appeals\nbefore this Commission. On the other hand, the RTI applicant insisted for\ndisclosure of information as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The CPIO, Reserve\nBank of India also intended to disclose the information sought after invoking\n<a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 10</a> of the RTI Act.

They further argued\nthat orders simpliciter almost identical in various cases irrespective of the\ndifferent objections raised by them apparently lacked application of mind or\nreasons. Rejection or acceptance of the specific objections raised by them were\nnot spelt out in the orders which have been passed without giving an\nopportunity of hearing to them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">19. The Commission further noted the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\nReserve Bank of India V/s Jayantilal N. Mistry case made observations\nwhich read as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       &quot;the RBI does not place itself in a fiduciary relationship with the\n       Financial institutions because, the reports of the inspections, statements\n       of the bank, information related to the business obtained by the RBI are\n       not under the pretext of confidence or trust. In this case neither the RBI\n       nor the Banks act in the interest of each other. By attaching an additional\n       &quot;fiduciary&quot; label to the statutory duty, the Regulatory authorities have\n       intentionally or unintentionally created an in terrorem effect. RBI is a\n       statutory body set up by the <a href=\"/doc/462219/\" id=\"a_84\">RBI Act</a> as India&#x27;s Central Bank. It is a\n       statutory regulatory authority to oversee the functioning of the banks and\n       the country&#x27;s banking sector. Under <a href=\"/doc/587034/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 35A</a> of the Banking\n       Regulation Act, RBI has been given powers to issue any direction to the\n       banks in public interest, in the interest of banking policy and to secure\n       proper management of a banking company. It has several other far-\n       reaching statutory powers&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">It clarifies that the functional relationship between a regulator and a regulated\nentity is not fiduciary. On the other hand the relationship is based on a statutory\nobligation to ensure operational discipline and support remedial framework.\nHence its observations, guidance, directions or remedial actions are an outcome\nof own functioning.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                       Page 15 of 37</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\"> 20. On the other hand, the Commission takes note of the submissions made\nby the Banks and Financial Institutions that large amount of data relating to its\nclients including their identity, business plans, decisions and financial\ntransactions as well as institutional data such as business plans, trade secret, risk\nrating, requirement of regulatory intervention, any unpublished price sensitive\ninformation etc. of banks and financial institutions is shared with the regulator,\nwithout any redaction or withholding the information, in good faith that these\nwill be objectively analysed in discharge of their statutory obligations to make\nfair judgment on their functioning without affecting their competitive position.\nThe Commission also appreciates that these institutions function in highly\ncompetitive, complex and global environment and the data being sought by the\nregulator is with the intention to draw conclusions on their functioning rather\nthan disclosing the data shared by them in breach of right to privacy of\nindividuals or cause adverse effect to their competitive position vis-à-vis others.\nTo this extent, there is an element of trust and confidence in sharing the data,\nboth financial and operational, between the RBI and the Financial\nInstitutions.The information and data of the clients in the hands of\nBanks/Financial Institutions also has the element of trust and confidence that\nsuch data will not be disclosed or shared against their right to\nprivacy/commercial interest and it is undisputed that clients enjoy fiduciary\nrelationship with the Banks/Financial Institutions irrespective of these being\npublic or private entities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">21. The Commission observes that it is already a settled position in Jayantilal\nMistry&#x27;s case that RBI is not fiduciary in relationship with the banks and\nfinancial instution irrespecitve of these being public or private entities. But\ncontents of those reports viz. names of depositors/ borrowers, their transaction\nand financial history etc., mentioned in above para 20, entrusted by the clients\nto their respective banks or financial institutions are interspersed in these reports\nand have to be examined in the light of para nos. 77 of the same judgment and\nvarious other judicial pronouncements protecting right to privacy and protection\nof commercial interests. Therefore, the CPIO, Reserve Bank of India has rightly\ninvited objections but not expressed his reasoned view that to what extent he is\nagreeing or disagreeing by the objections of the Banks while sharing the\nproposed redacted report for disclosure in some cases. The Commission is of\nthe view that it is not a simple set of information as inspection and audit report\nconsists of data about client, borrowers and institution as mentioned in previous\npara beside, its analysis, judgment and observations on the analysis on the data\nprovided by the banks on its functioning, regulatory compliance, deficiencies\nand strengths, suggestions for course of correction, penal action as per\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                         Page 16 of 37</span>\n provisions of the law etc., and may be much more which the Commission may\nnot be in a position appreciate in toto at this stage. The Commission further\nobserves that the Reserve Bank of India also acknowledged this and hence have\nopted for appropriate redaction. Even the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\nJayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case had observed that &quot;71. We also understand that the\nRBI cannot be put in a fix, by making it accountable to every action taken by it.\nHowever, in the instant case the RBI is accountable and as such it has to\nprovide information to the information seekers under <a href=\"/doc/1699935/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 10(1)</a> of the RTI\nAct, which reads as under:&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1699935/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 10(1)</a> Severability --Where a request for\naccess to information is rejected on the ground that it is in relation to\ninformation which is exempt from disclosure, then, notwithstanding anything\ncontained in this Act, access may be provided to that part of the record which\ndoes not contain any information which is exempt from disclosure under this\nAct and which can reasonably be severed from any part that contains exempt\ninformation.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_29\">22.

The term `fiduciary&#x27; and `fiduciary relationship&#x27; refer to different\n        capacities and relationship, involving a common duty or obligation. 20.1)\n        Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (7th Edition, Page 640) defines `fiduciary\n        relationship&#x27; thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      A relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of\n      the other on matters within the scope of the relationship. Fiduciary\n      relationships - such as trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, agent-\n      principal, and attorney-client - require the highest duty of care. Fiduciary\n      relationships usually arise in one of four situations : (1) when one person\n      places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result gains\n      superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes\n      control and responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty\n      to act for or give advice to another on matters falling within the scope of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                      Page 17 of 37</span>\n       the relationship, or (4) when there is a specific relationship that has\n      traditionally been recognized as involving fiduciary duties, as with a\n      lawyer and a client or a stockbroker and a customer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;39. The term &quot;fiduciary&quot; refers to a person having a duty to act for the\n      benefit of another, showing good faith and candour, where such other\n      person reposes trust and special confidence in the person owing or\n      discharging the duty. The term &quot;fiduciary relationship&quot; is used to\n      describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary) places\n      complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs,\n      business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a person who holds a\n      thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in\n      confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the beneficiary, and use\n      good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things\n      belonging to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to\n      the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust or to execute certain acts in regard\n      to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in\n      confidence and is expected not to disclose the thing or information to any\n      third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_31\">While taking into consideration the fact that the customers give their financial\ninformation to the banks in confidence and with complete faith that may not be\ndivulged as a result of disclosure by others, the following observations passed\nby the Supreme in Court <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_89\">Bihar Public Service Commission v.

The decision has to be based on\n      objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring that larger public interest\n      outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the\n      provision. Certain matters, particularly in relation to appointment, are\n      required to be dealt with great confidentiality. The information may come\n      to knowledge of the authority as a result of disclosure by others who give\n      that information in confidence and with complete faith, integrity and\n      fidelity. Secrecy of such information shall be maintained, thus, bringing it\n      within the ambit of fiduciary capacity. Similarly, there may be cases\n      where the disclosure has no relationship to any public activity or interest\n      or it may even cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual.\n      All these protections have to be given their due implementation as they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                        Page 18 of 37</span>\n       spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between\n      private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional\n      protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy.\n      Thus, the public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the\n      balance factor between right to privacy and right to information with the\n      purpose sought to be achieved and the purpose that would be served in\n      the larger public interest, particularly when both these rights emerge\n      from the constitutional values under the Constitution of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_33\">As emphasized by the Supreme Court in the judgment of Central Public\nInformation Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_90\">India vs. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>\nin its judgment dated 13.11.2019, right to privacy and right to information have\nto be treated as co-equals and none can take precedence over the other, rather a\nbalance needs to be struck.

The ratio decidendi has to be ascertained by an\n      analysis of the facts of the case and the process of reasoning involved in\n      the major consisting of a pre-existing rule of law, either statutory or\n      judge made, and minor premise consisting of the material facts of the\n      case under immediate consideration&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"388259\" id=\"span_46\">In <a href=\"/doc/388259/\" id=\"a_125\">Dalbir Singh v.

The only thing in a Judge&#x27;s decision binding a party is the\n      principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is\n      important to analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. In\n      the leading case of Qualcast (Wolverhampton) Ltd. v.

The other two elements in the\n      decision are not precedents.

In transfer case number 93 of 2015, the RTI applicant sought copies of\ninspection reports of NABARD. In transfer case number 95 of 2015 details of\nShow Cause notices of fines imposed by RBI on various banks were sought.\nThe main contention of the RBI was that they were in fiduciary relationship\nwith the banks and that disclosure of the information sought in respect of\nvarious banks could have destabilised financial position of the banks and could\nhave adversely affected the economic interest of the county. Besides, the\nrevelation of the information could have adversely affected the competitive\nposition of the bank.

While not doing so, the CPIO has not passed any reasoned order\ncovering his deliberations on their objections, his understanding of law or\njurisprudence in deciding specific objections, in favor of disclosure or redaction\netc. Orders passed by the CPIO in all the cases are cryptic, almost identical\nwithout any reference to objections raised by the Banks/Institutions which are\ndefinitely not identical. Similarly, the FAA instead of passing a speaking order\nhave also given a cryptic, almost identical orders to the appellant banks. The\nCPIO and the FAA are expected to apply their mind before issuing the order of\nintent of disclosing the information. Further, no opportunity of personal hearing\nwas given to the appellant nor speaking order have been passed by FAA for not\ngiving opportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for accepting /not\naccepting their objections in his decisions in these various appeals. The\nCommission is of the view that every objection should be dealt and\nrejected/accepted with a reason and reasons for not giving opportunity of\npersonal hearing should be well reasoned too in view of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">35. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicants has\nto be adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institutions,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                                                      Page 30 of 37</span>\n various judicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts\nproviding guidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should necessarily\nbe provided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise should be\nreasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, such orders should enumerate\nthe principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of reports or various types of\ndata, personal information, commercially sensitive information of clients or\ninstitutions, specifically excluded disclosures under various Acts, etc. which\nwill be applied at the time of redaction of contents of these inspection/audit\nreports. Where it is observed that the RBI is willing to share the redacted reports\nproposed to be disclosed with the Institutions, the very thought process gone\nbehind is should be mentioned in the orders of CPIO or FAA in their orders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165184810\" id=\"span_57\">36.

Nevertheless, if, in any case,\n      the CPIO does not implement the order passed by the appellate authority\n      and the appellate authority feels that intervention of higher authority is\n      required to get his order implemented, he should bring the matter to the\n      notice of the officer in the public authority competent to take against the\n      CPIO.

It was\n       argued that a review petition would require consideration of the matter\n       on merits in case there is an error apparent on the face of record.\n       Whereas, recall applications are entertained only in case the judgment is\n       passed without jurisdiction or without an opportunity of hearing being\n       given to the affected party. All the judgments that are cited on this point\n       are cases where petitions for recall were entertained when a person\n       directly affected by the judgment was not heard. In the instant case, the\n       dispute relates to information to be provided by the RBI under the Act.\n       Though the information pertained to the banks, it was the decision of the\n       RBI which was in challenge and decided by this Court. No effort was\n       made by any of the applicants in the miscellaneous applications to get\n       themselves impleaded when the transferred cases were being heard by\n       this Court. The applications styled as recall are essentially applications\n       for review.

Therefore, we are\n       of the considered opinion that these applications are not maintainable.\n       We make it clear that we are not dealing with any of the submissions\n       made on the correctness of the judgment of this Court in Jayantilal N.\n       Mistry (supra). The dismissal of these applications shall not prevent the\n       applicants to pursue other remedies available to them in law&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">39. A comprehensive view has to be taken on the objection filed by the\ninstitutions. These objectives has to be deliberated and adjudicated in the light\nof Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and other judicial pronouncements relevant in such\nmatter, some of which have been referred by the Commission in the above parts\nas well. The Commission while examining various objections realize that the\nWrit Petitions filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India is seeking\ndirections of the Supreme Court for non-disclosure of certain aspects of these\naudit/inspection report and any such guidance in these Writ Petitions will have\ndirect bearing and provide further clarity to the CPIO/FAA in adjudicating\nvarious aspects of disclosure/non-disclosure of reports or the information/data\nwhich are part of these reports under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_174\">RTI Act</a>. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                                      Page 33 of 37</span>\n Commission takes note that all the cases/second appeals filed herein are based\non interpretations of RBI Vs. Jayantilal Mistry case and other relevant judicial\npronouncements requesting for full disclosure vis-à-vis with exemptions under\n<a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act for non-disclosure of full or parts of these reports.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">40. In view of the above observations, the Commission is of the view that the\nreports generated in the hands of regulatory public authority in discharge of its\nstatutory obligations are information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the RTI Act, as the\nregulator and the regulated entities are not governed by fiduciary relationship.\nThe orders of the Commission to their effect has been upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case and the position is unchanged even\ntoday. Various objections filed by banks/financial institutions, to be examined,\nanalyzed and adjudicated upon, are related to various data and information\nsubmitted to the Reserve Bank of India by these financial institutions explaining\ntheir operations, commercial decisions, clients data etc. under statutory\nobligations can be disclosed as such. There are apparently two set of such\ninformation which have been shared by the institutions with the regulator under\nstatutory obligation. First is the information/data of clients relating to their\nbusiness/commercial operations, financial transactions, business and\ncommercial strategy which is shared by clients with financial institutions in full\ntrust and confidence and is held by them in fiduciary capacity, protected from\ndisclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_177\">RTI Act</a> in their hands. Second set is the information\nrelating to business strategy, decisions, transactions, other operational data etc.\nof financial institutions have been bearing on their competitive position which\nalso enjoys the exemption from disclosure in their hands, if it is a public\nauthority or otherwise, under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_178\">RTI Act</a>. Some of such data, on case to case\nbasis be sensitive enough for protection of national interest. The Commission is\nof the view that the protection of disclosure of information under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 8(1)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 in the hands of financial institutions does not evaporate\nonce such data/information is shared, in good faith and trust, with the regulator\nunder statutory obligation.Various observations of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nJayantilal Mistry&#x27;s case also does not indicate so and decision of the regulator to\nconsider redacting such data/information while disclosing the reports is aligned\nwith this and other judicial pronouncements of Supreme Court and High Courts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">41. The Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the conduct of the\nCPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the opinion that due care\nhas to be taken by according opportunity of personal hearing and making\nreasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands of the CPIO and\nlater in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the CPIO will be\nrequired to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the observations of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                       Page 34 of 37</span>\n the Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the CPIO will take\nview on various objections filed by the Banks and Financial Institutions and\nsubmissions made by applicant to reach the decision in favour or against\nredaction of various parts of the report on case to case basis. He has to factor the\nobservation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Jayantilal Mistry case and other\nrelevant judgments, some of which have been referred in this order as well.\nHence, with these observations the orders passed by the CPIO and FAA in these\nmatters are set aside and the cases are being remanded to the CPIO for\nadjudication afresh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">42. It is amply clear that Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged are admitted in Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court wherein guidance and\ndirection has been sought on non-disclosure of certain type of information\nwhich are essentially the part of the Annual Inspection Report/RAR, etc. These\npetitions also seek protection of interim communication between regulator and\nthe regulated entity in the process of finalization of these reports or otherwise. It\nis obvious that decision in these Writ Petitions will provide clarity and guidance\nto the Public Authority on redaction/non-disclosure of a set of information\ninspite of being part of these reports which are open to disclosure. At this stage,\nany decision by the Public Authority will amount to pre-judging the issues\npending admitted Writ Petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Various\nbanks, financial institutions, respondent public authority and the RTI applicant\nhave already impleaded party and are presenting their arguments before the\nApex Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">43. Hence, any decision of redaction or disclosure of information, without\nwaiting for decision in the Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and 768/2021 and\nothers tagged may cause irrevocable damage against right of privacy and\nprotection of commercial interest. Hence, the respondent public authority if\nexpedient may wait for the outcome in Writ Petition Nos. 1159/2019 and\n768/2021 and others tagged or seek clarification from the Hon&#x27;ble Court and\naccordingly decide these RTI applications by following process as enumerated\nin the earlier paras by the Commission in the interest of principles of natural\njustice. While disclosing the information they should be cautious in taking a\nconsiderate view balancing right to privacy, protection of national and\ncommercial interest on one hand vis-à-vis larger public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38822192\" id=\"span_63\">44.
