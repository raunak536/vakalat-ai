To understand the concept of reputation, the distinction between\n                                character and reputation needs to be emphasized as it is reputation\n                                and not character which the law aims to protect. Character is what a\n                                person really is; reputation is what he seems to be. One is composed\n                                of the sum of the principles and motives which govern his conduct.\n                                The other is the result of observation of his conduct, the character\n                                imputed to him by others. The right to reputation in its vital aspect, is\n                                not concerned with fame or distinction. It has regard, not to\n                                intellectual or other special acquirements, but to that repute which is\n                                slowly built up by integrity, honorable conduct, and right living. One&#x27;s\n                                good name is therefore, as truly the product of one&#x27;s efforts as any\n                                physical possession; indeed, it alone gives the value as source of\n                                happiness, to material possessions. It is, therefore, reputation alone\n                                that is vulnerable; character needs no adventitious support.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Digitally Signed          CS(OS) 2033/2007 &amp; CS(OS) 2034/2007                                Page 15 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">By:VIKAS ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Signing Date:11.06.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">14:20:12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                           42.    Kinkead on Torts, i, 759 succinctly states the difference between\n                                character and reputation. It was observed that they are not\n                                synonymous, rather they may be directly contrary to each other. A\n                                man may have a good character and a bad reputation, being unjustly\n                                judged by the public; or he may have a bad character and a good\n                                reputation, standing in a false light before the public. In most cases,\n                                reputation reflects actual character. Since the right is only to respect\n                                so far as it is well founded, it is obviously not infringed by a truthful\n                                imputation. But the law justly deems any derogatory imputation false\n                                until it is shown to be true. Moreover, while the law requires a certain\n                                degree of proof to overcome this presumption, it also recognizes the\n                                human mind&#x27;s propensity to believe evil upon slight evidence; hence\n                                those representations which tend to influence public opinion in that\n                                respect are deemed to have done so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                          43.

It is nobility in itself which a conscientious man would never\n                           barter with all the tea of China or for that matter all the pearls of the sea.\n                           When reputation is hurt, a man is half-dead. It is an honour which deserves\n                           to be equally preserved by the downtrodden and the privileged. No one\n                           would like to have his reputation dented, and it is perceived as an honour\n                           rather than popularity.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">                          45.

Thus, in Civil proceedings, the malicious intention of a person\n                          making an imputation is immaterial; when a statement is untrue and is\n                          defamatory by its very nature as there is a presumption of ―Malice in Law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">                          55.   Given the presumption of        ―Malice in Law, what needs to be\n                          considered is the nature and extent of injury to invite an action for\n                          defamation. Fundamentally, injury to the reputation being the gist of the\n                          action; evidence of loss of reputation is necessary        as without some\n                          evidence, it would not be clear that reputation had in fact, been injured.

It is pertinent to observe that though the Reply may have been filed\n                          subsequently, but it only enumerates all the past acts which had transpired in\n                          the Ministry and had eventually led to the discharge of the plaintiff. The\n                          Reply merely narrated the what had transpired prior in time in the Ministry\n                          and explained the circumstances which led to the discharge of the plaintiff.\n                          The Reply infact, corroborates and reinforces that what had got reported in\n                          the News Articles was the truthful narration of past events. It is clearly\n                          borne out that some Tapes were received in the Department, on which an\n                          inquiry had been initiated by the Additional Secretary, but when the matter\n                          was brought to the knowledge of the Foreign Minister, he directed\n                          immediate discharge, since the plaintiff was still in probation as it was felt\n                          that the message had to be loud and clear that such misconduct which sullies\n                          the image of Foreign Ministry, cannot be tolerated. The Newspaper Report\n                          reflect that this information which found its reflection in the articles, was\n                          based on the verified sources and this is also a fact that all this which had\n                          transpired in the Ministry, had ultimately led to the discharge of the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">                          88.   It may be thus, concluded that the Newspaper Articles have in the\n                          neutral/truthful manner have simply reported the news on the basis of the\n                          information collected from the verified sources.          The Reply that got\n                          subsequently filed by Union of India corroborates the truthfulness of the\n                          reported News and it cannot be said that the reporting was either malicious\n                          or not made in good faith. The defendants have merely discharged their duty\n                          of bringing news in public domain of which the public at large, has a right to\n                          information.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">Digitally Signed          CS(OS) 2033/2007 &amp; CS(OS) 2034/2007                                  Page 34 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">By:VIKAS ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signing Date:11.06.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">14:20:12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">                           89.    In the end, it may be observed that the plaintiff may have genuine\n                          grievance against the woman whose conversations were allegedly contained\n                          in the Tapes received in the Ministry, but apparently, the plaintiff is already\n                          pursuing his independent remedy against her. If it is any solace, one may\n                          observe that reputation is not so fragile that it can be ruined or demolished\n                          by some unsavory incident which happened in the beginning of the career of\n                          the plaintiff. Reputation is what one builds over a period of time by his\n                          conduct and work. The entire incident may have left the plaintiff completely\n                          shattered and distraught, but it is his conviction in his truthfulness that gave\n                          him the courage to stand for his rights and approach the Central\n                          Administrative Tribunal to win back his honour by reinstatement in his job.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">                          90.    Balancing the right of information of the public with the duty of the\n                          Media of truthful reporting and the individual right of protection of his\n                          reputation, it is held that the Articles which are the subject matter of the two\n                          suits, are not per se defamatory.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">                          91.

The suit had been filed by the plaintiff initially as an indigent petition\n                          which was allowed vide Order dated 25.09.2007, wherein it was held that as\n                          per the Report of the SDM, CP, the plaintiff had the total assets of\n                          Rs.28,740/-.
