This wicked\n practice has destroyed the happiness of my life. It comes between me and that\n thing which I prize above all others—study and mental cultivation. Without the least\n fault of mine I am doomed to seclusion; every aspiration of mine to rise above my\n ignorant sisters is looked upon with suspicion, and is interpreted in the most\n uncharitable manner.” 1\n\n                                                                                           ~ Rukhmabai\n\n\n\nI.

The Petitioner has approached this court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution to\n\n       raise an issue which has been debated in our nation for over one and a half\n\n       centuries. The Petitioner is an NGO that has worked extensively against child\n\n       marriage. The Petitioner’s primary grievance is that despite the enactment of\n\n       the <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_8\">Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</a> 2006 2, the rate of child marriages in India\n\n       is alarming. The Petitioner seeks to address the failure of authorities to prevent\n\n       child marriages. The Petitioner has sought stronger enforcement mechanisms,\n\n       awareness programs, the appointment of Child Marriage Prohibition Officers,\n\n       and comprehensive support systems for child brides – including education,\n\n       healthcare, and compensation, to ensure the protection and welfare of\n\n       vulnerable minors. Accordingly, the Petitioner prays for the issuance of effective\n\n       guidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> 1</span>\n     Extracted from a letter written by Rukhmabai to the Times of India on 26 June 1885.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> 2</span>\n     ‘PCMA’\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                                            Page 6 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                                      PART I\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2. Child marriage is a social evil, and its commission is a criminal offence. Despite\n\n    the near-universal agreement on the ills of child marriage, its commission and\n\n    prevalence have been sobering. Child marriage is the phenomenon of children\n\n    being married before they attain the minimum legal age under the law. Globally,\n\n    children continue – despite legal norms to the contrary – to be married before\n\n    they reach the age of eighteen years. Patriarchy, gender inequality, poverty and\n\n    lack of education and employment lead to child marriage. 3 The UN Convention\n\n    on the Rights of the Child regards child marriage as a violation of human rights 4.\n\n    While both sexes are inflicted with the violence of child marriages, the\n\n    prevalence of child marriage globally among boys is one-sixth that of girls. 5\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3. Elimination of child, early and forced marriages has been committed to by one\n\n    hundred and ninety-three nations, including India under target 5.3 6 of the\n\n    Sustainable Development Goals 7. <a href=\"/doc/40808/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 2</a> <a href=\"/doc/902105/\" id=\"a_10\">8</a> of PCMA defines child marriage\n\n    as a marriage to which either of the contracting parties is a child. Girls below\n\n    the age of eighteen and boys below the age of twenty-one are deemed to be\n\n    children under the PCMA. 9\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">3</span>\n  UNICEF (2023).

The data is based on a survey of women aged 20-24 and men aged\n\n     25-29. This is a reduction from the 2015-2016 NFHS-4 which showed that\n\n     26.8% of girls and 20.3% of boys marry under the legal age of marriage. Child\n\n     marriage has been on a steady decline in India. The prevalence of child\n\n     marriages in India has halved since the enactment of the PCMA in 2006 from\n\n     47% to 27% in 2015-16 and 23.3% in 2019-2021.13 The decline in child\n\n     marriage in India is in line with the global trend. In the past decade, the\n\n     proportion of girls married as children has dropped by 15%.14 Despite these\n\n     enormous strides globally and in India, no region in the world is on track to attain\n\n     the SDG-5 target. 15 It is estimated that the progress in reducing child marriage\n\n     would need to be twelve times faster than the rate observed in the past decade\n\n     to achieve the SDG-5 target. 16\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">5. The term child marriage is an oxymoron. A child implies a person whose\n\n     capacity to make legal decisions is not fully developed. On the other hand,\n\n     marriage is an institution with legal standing.

Child marriage often deprives children of intellectual, social and\n\n        psychological development and carries life-threatening risks.

However, findings from HAQ - Centre for Child Rights 19 show\n\n          that CMPOs are often tasked with multiple responsibilities, limiting their\n\n          capacity to focus on child marriage prevention. Many States designate\n\n          officials holding other substantial roles, such as Child Development Project\n\n          Officers 20 or District Welfare Officers as the CMPO. This leads to CMPOs\n\n          prioritising their duties in the discharge of other roles – defeating the\n\n          purpose of appointing CMPOs - as they would not have the time, monetary\n\n          and human resources to carry out the responsibilities enumerated in the\n\n          Act.

A vicious cycle: socio-economic determinants and effects of child marriage\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">  12. All child marriages are forced marriages. Many parents wish to marry their girl\n\n       child early to guard against any aspersions on the girl’s virtue of virginity and to\n\n       mitigate the economic costs associated with raising a child, payment of dowry\n\n       and conducting a wedding. The economic factors of child marriage are borne\n\n       out by studies that reflect that child marriage in India predominantly occurs in\n\n       less educated, rural and poor families. 26 Parents in such families are informed\n\n       by a survivalist and patriarchal mindset that responds to social, cultural and\n\n       religious norms and economic necessity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">  13.

By placing\n\n     an overemphasis on these constructed virtues, a false sense of protectionism\n\n     is generated to safeguard girls against their ability of self-exploration and to\n\n     form meaningful bonds on their own. Honour, purity, and decisional incapacity\n\n     are presented as the domain of womanhood and its protection is laid in the\n\n     institution of marriage. Parents marry their daughters early to meet the\n\n     prescription of a society rooted in parochial norms of controlling a woman’s\n\n     sexuality. While patriarchy promises respect to its adherents, it only leads to the\n\n     subordination of women who are deprived of any meaningful avenue to develop\n\n     their agency and exercise their autonomy. The malleability of a girl child and\n\n     her inability to form informed opinions are looked up to as desirable qualities.\n\n     These qualities are understood to earn her favour in the eyes of her in-laws in\n\n     serving them as they see fit. 27 In less educated, rural and poor setups, members\n\n     of the community lack effective opportunities and life chances. Investing in the\n\n     education and development of a girl is seen as unworthy and unrealistic. The\n\n     lack of alternative means for education, employment and skill development for\n\n     women also incentivises parents to give their daughters away in child marriage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">14. Parents also believe that their daughters would be saved from pregnancy out\n\n     of wedlock and be guarded against unsolicited advances by men if she were to\n\n     be married early.

The\n\n     compounding of one evil to emerge out of patriarchy with another solution\n\n     rooted in patriarchy has the effect of culturally stunting society and depriving\n\n     children, girls in particular, of any avenue to exit from the cycle of generational\n\n     oppression.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">15. Notably, the very causes of child marriage ensure that members of the marital\n\n     union and their families are stuck in the vicious cycle of social and economic\n\n     oppression. Early marriage in girls, places a burden on them to discharge their\n\n     duty of giving offspring to the family. Sexual activity within the marital union is\n\n     unregulated and even encouraged. A child, forced to prove her fertility, is\n\n     exposed to enormous health risks. Her body is mentally and physically\n\n     unprepared for sexual engagement which is forced upon her. Girls in child\n\n     marriage report early, frequent and unplanned pregnancies which are linked to\n\n     increased risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">16. Adolescent mothers are also likely to experience fistula, pregnancy\n\n     complications and death during childbirth.28 Women married as children are\n\n     likely to have their first child before the age of eighteen and are likely to have\n\n     had at least three or more childbirths and a repeat childbirth in less than twenty-\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">28</span>\n   Anita Raj, Niranjan Saggurti, Donta Balaiah, Jay G Silverman (2009).

It has\n\n       travelled centuries, and its opposition seems to have only incremental\n\n       successes each time. Still widely prevalent, 39 the first movement against child\n\n       marriage in modern India began in the latter part of the nineteenth century.\n\n       Social reformers were trying to build public opinion against child marriage. Two\n\n       concerns primarily animated the call against child marriages by early reformers.\n\n       The first was the high number of early widows. 40 Because the rate of mortality\n\n       was low, many girls found themselves in widowhood in the early years of their\n\n       lives. The second reason behind seeking child marriage reform was to protect\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">  36</span>\n     Government of India (2011).

Reformers like Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar had successfully advocated for\n\n     widow remarriage which was hitherto believed to be impermissible under Hindu\n\n     law. These efforts led to the enactment of the Hindu Widows’ <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_22\">Remarriage Act</a>\n\n     1856. However, the demands against child marriages were not immediately\n\n     realised. Child marriage, an aversion to widow remarriage and the low mortality\n\n     rate combined and morphed into a lethal destructive element in the Indian\n\n     society. 42\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">21. To address the devastation caused, in particular to women and girls, social\n\n     reformers called for raising the minimum age of consent for women in penal\n\n     rape statutes. The idea behind the demand for raising the age of consent was\n\n     to avoid the bodily harm inflicted on girls by their often-elderly husbands. A\n\n     person below the age of consent could not legally consent to any sexual activity\n\n     thereby throwing any sexual conduct within the confines of statutory rape. Such\n\n     laws already existed in the presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay\n\n     as early as 1828.43 The laws in these presidency towns stipulated the age of\n\n     consent for girls to be eight years and the offence of rape against a girl below\n\n     the age of consent was punishable with death.44 In 1847, when the Law\n\n     Commission was drafting the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">Indian Penal Code</a> it decided, for the first time, to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">41</span>\n   Jaya Sagade.

Raising the age of consent was seen as undue interference by the colonial\n\n          legislature into the personal laws of Indians. 47 The movement gained a\n\n          groundswell of support because of efforts by Behramji Malabari, a journalist\n\n          from Bombay, who began publishing his ‘notes’ in his newspaper the ‘Indian\n\n          Spectator’ in 1884. 48 He highlighted the consequences of ‘infant marriages’ and\n\n          ‘enforced widowhoods’ by recounting anecdotal accounts of victims.

This led Rukhmabai to\n\n     refuse to live with Dadaji. 50 In 1884, Dadaji instituted a suit for restitution of\n\n     conjugal rights.

The decision of Justice Pinhey was much ahead of its time. At a time when child\n\n   marriage was the norm and the legal standard of consent was inapplicable to\n\n   marital laws, Justice Pinhey’s judgment was a bold declaration of the rights of\n\n   Indian women to make their own life choices. Unfortunately, the success was\n\n   short-lived. The judgement had caused an uproar in the public and Dadaji filed\n\n   an appeal before the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. The Division\n\n   Bench set aside the judgment of Justice Pinhey and directed Rukhmabai to join\n\n   Dadaji within a month at the pain of penalty to undergo six months’\n\n   imprisonment. The court reasoned that incompatibility was no defence under\n\n   Hindu law against a petition for restitution of conjugal rights. Firm as she was,\n\n   Rukhmabai refused to join Dadaji and declared that she would subject herself\n\n   to the maximum penalty admissible under the law, rather than to live with her\n\n   husband. The sight of a Hindu woman being imprisoned shocked the public\n\n   conscience. Dadaji entered a compromise and did not press for the execution\n\n   of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights against an amount of Rs 2000/-.\n\n   Rukhmabai went on to study medicine in the UK and became one of India’s\n\n   earliest women doctors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                                              Page 22 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                              PART IV\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_88\">25.

Her\n\n       assertion of womanhood and agency in refusing to go with a wayward husband\n\n       whom she was given to in marriage opened up new ways for women to imagine\n\n       their autonomy. Writing to the editor of the Times of India on 26 June 1885,\n\n       under the pseudo name ‘A Hindu Lady’, Rukhmabai eloquently drew the\n\n       differential plains on which the experiences of boys and girls in a child marriage\n\n       are placed. She wrote:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_89\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                          “The general apathy towards social improvements\n                          which characterizes our people has been telling\n                          upon the whole community, but tells most heavily\n                          upon the female sex.

Religion or social custom\n                          does not, in any way, interfere with their liberty.\n                          Marriage does not interpose any insuperable\n                          obstacle in the course of their studies.

But the case with\n                          women is the very reverse of this.

The Bill\n\n     was an amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a> and raised the age of consent from ten years to\n\n     twelve years. The Age of Consent Act was passed in 1891. The marital rape\n\n     exception had come to the defence of Hari. Raising the age of consent by two\n\n     years meant that any sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of twelve\n\n     would be statutory rape regardless of the marital status of the aggressor with\n\n     the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_98\">\nB.

In 1921, the League of Nations held a conference on the trafficking of women\n\n     and recommended raising the age of consent to twenty-one years for girls. In\n\n     1922, Bakshi Sohanlal unsuccessfully tried to raise the age of consent to 14 by\n\n     introducing a Bill. Bills that sought to raise the age of consent were introduced\n\n     and thrown out regularly for five years thereafter. Among these bills was an Age\n\n     of Marriage Bill which was sought to be introduced by Ranglal Jajodia in 1924\n\n     in the Legislative Assembly. 57 The Bill prescribed a minimum age before which\n\n     no marriage could take place. This was a shift from the approach taken by other\n\n     reformers and legislators of not interfering with the age of marriage but to\n\n     merely protect girls from forced sex by raising the age of consent in penal laws.\n\n     While this Bill was never introduced, a similar Bill was introduced by Haribilas\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">56</span>\n   Ishita Pande (2020).

The committee submitted its report dated 20\n\n     June 1929.

The committee\n\n     reasoned that marriage was an act of public knowledge and many persons had\n\n     a chance to notice the age of the couple.

It did so by making women the object of the legislation but never its\n\n       spectator. Women and their bodies were made a subject of legislation without\n\n       any meaningful attempt to attract the perspectives of women, their experiences\n\n       or their desires. The law did not concern itself with issues of autonomy, agency\n\n       and individualised dignity of a woman. This had been manifested from the days\n\n       of the reform movement on the age of consent laws. As Dr Jaya Sagade argues\n\n       in her book Child Marriage in India: Socio-legal and Human Rights Dimensions,\n\n       the law on consent was nailed purely to the physical capability of women and\n\n       alien from their aspirations or choices.

The PCMA has repelled this criticism by specifically\n\n     providing for the maintenance of women and children in a child marriage\n\n     notwithstanding a decree of nullity being granted under <a href=\"/doc/1389458/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 3</a> of the Act.\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/323064/\" id=\"a_71\">The Act</a> further protects a child born from a child marriage by declaring that\n\n     such a child, begotten or conceived of a child marriage, shall be deemed\n\n     legitimate for all purposes under the law. 85\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">81</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/1033469/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 5(1)</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">82</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/1033469/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 5(2)</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">83</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/1033469/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 5(3)</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">84</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/1033469/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 5(4)</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">85</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/152520/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 6</a>, PCMA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_152\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                                          Page 36 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART V\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_153\">48.

It further recognises the innocence of\n\n      the children who end up in broken families due to no fault of theirs. The status\n\n      of these universally recognised vulnerable persons is further made tragic in a\n\n      child marriage because all child marriages are forced marriages. Children are\n\n      made to enter into matrimony before arriving at the age of intelligent consent\n\n      and are often unaware of the responsibilities, duties and rights which accrue to\n\n      members of the marital union in the eyes of the law as well as society. When\n\n      the party to a child marriage ends up in a situation which is not of their making,\n\n      the vulnerability of the child born from such marriage is heightened.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">49. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115162892\" id=\"span_129\">In <a href=\"/doc/115162892/\" id=\"a_77\">Union of India v.

These provisions seek to safeguard the interest of the vulnerable stakeholders\n\n       involved in a child marriage, namely, a child bride and any child born from a\n\n       child marriage.

Unlike many\n\n       social legislations, the PCMA does not prescribe a mandatory minimum\n\n       punishment for committing an offence under the Act. The effect of this is that a\n\n       judge would be at liberty to nominally punish the accused who are convicted\n\n       under the Act. The non-prescription of a minimum mandatory sentence has led\n\n       to ineffective enforcement of the PCMA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">87</span>\n   <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 9</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">88</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/725643/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 10</a>, PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">89</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">\n   <a href=\"/doc/1542330/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 11</a>, PCMA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_166\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                                           Page 38 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                           PART V\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">53. Section 15 of the PCMA stipulates that all offences under the Act are cognizable\n\n   and non-bailable. This is a deviation from CMRA which initially did not make the\n\n   offence of child marriage cognizable. The effect of this was to make the\n\n   prevention of child marriage entirely contingent on the private initiative of\n\n   citizens to file a complaint before the magistrate and be examined under oath.\n\n   The CMRA also initially required a security bond to be executed by the\n\n   complainant to sustain their bona fides. This requirement made the\n\n   enforcement of the Act illusory. The requirement of executing a mandatory\n\n   security bond was eliminated by the Child Marriage Restraint (Second\n\n   Amendment) Act 1938. The offences under the CMRA were further made\n\n   partially cognizable through an amendment in 1978. Section 15 of PCMA is\n\n   therefore a welcome step which aims to better enforce the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_168\">54. <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 9</a> of the PCMA prescribes that a man above the age of eighteen, who\n\n   enters into a marriage with a minor girl is liable to be punished with rigorous\n\n   imprisonment which may extend to two years or with a fine which may extend\n\n   to one lakh rupees or both. The court is accordingly empowered to penalise an\n\n   accused under <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 9</a> with imprisonment or a fine or both. The court is at\n\n   liberty to exercise its options of imposing punishment based on the gravity of\n\n   the offence, the circumstance of the marriage and the socio-economic power of\n\n   the male over his child bride. In many instances, the marriage between a child\n\n   bride and aged groom occurs at the instance of the groom incentivising the\n\n   family of the girl to marry her off. The provision deals with such situations but\n\n   also recognises the relative lack of involvement of a man who may be a young\n\n   adult and enters into matrimony with a minor. The option of imprisonment and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                                       Page 39 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART V\n\n      fine is a deviation from the other two penal provisions in the PCMA which\n\n      mandate both, a fine and imprisonment, to be imposed on guilty convicts. The\n\n      rationale of this option is to allow the judge a degree of latitude in assessing the\n\n      culpability of the groom under <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 9</a> and impose a proportionate criminal\n\n      sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_169\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_170\">55. Despite the age of majority for a man to enter into a marriage being prescribed\n\n      as twenty-one under <a href=\"/doc/920853/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act, his criminal liability for entering into\n\n      a child marriage with a minor woman begins at eighteen. Therefore, two\n\n      positions of law emerge from <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 9</a>. First, a woman, regardless of her age\n\n      is not liable for entering into a child marriage. Second, a man above the age of\n\n      eighteen but under the age of twenty one is liable for marrying a girl who is\n\n      under the age of eighteen. The legislative intent behind making a groom liable\n\n      for entering child marriage is to recognise the relative control of the agency that\n\n      a groom may have in relation to his marriage as opposed to a girl.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">56. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169642291\" id=\"span_137\">In <a href=\"/doc/169642291/\" id=\"a_89\">Hardev Singh v.

Therefore, no child as defined\n\n   in <a href=\"/doc/920853/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 2(a)</a> of the PCMA is liable under <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 9</a> for marrying an adult\n\n   person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">57. <a href=\"/doc/725643/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 10</a> of PCMA stipulates that a person who performs, conducts, directs\n\n   or abets any child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which\n\n   may extend to two years and shall be liable to a fine which may extend to one\n\n   lakh rupees. The provision, unlike <a href=\"/doc/87689/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 9</a>, does not allow the court to choose\n\n   the option of imposing a fine or sentencing a term of imprisonment or both. A\n\n   court adjudicating under <a href=\"/doc/725643/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 10</a> is mandated to impose a sentence of\n\n   imprisonment as well as impose a fine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">58.

Similar to the provision under <a href=\"/doc/725643/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 10</a> of the PCMA, <a href=\"/doc/1542330/\" id=\"a_101\">Section\n\n   11</a> also prescribes a mandate to the sentencing court to impose a sentence of\n\n   imprisonment as well as a fine. The provision uses the word ‘and’ between the\n\n   two punishments and the judge does not have the liberty to pick a certain\n\n   punishment to the exclusion of the other. The person liable under <a href=\"/doc/1542330/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 11</a>\n\n   may be the parents of the child or a guardian or any other person or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                                           Page 42 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART V\n\n   organisation. Further, the means by which a person may have the charge of the\n\n   child is immaterial as the provision stipulates that the charge may be ‘lawful or\n\n   unlawful’. The section seeks to penalise any person or organisation involved in\n\n   a child marriage. Its expansive scope allows for the prosecution of any person\n\n   who may have unlawfully taken the custody of a child and thereafter promoted,\n\n   permitted or failed to prevent the child marriage. <a href=\"/doc/1542330/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 11</a> also deals with\n\n   organisations, such as orphanages or schools or hostels, which may have the\n\n   charge of a child and under whose watch the child is married off.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">61. The intention of the provision is to place an obligation on any person who has\n\n   the charge of a child to ensure that the offence of child marriage is not\n\n   committed. The provision not only penalises the active participation of the\n\n   person having charge of a child but also penalises the omission on the part of\n\n   such a person to prevent child marriage. The provision recognises that children\n\n   lack the ability to form intelligent consent and may not necessarily know the full\n\n   ambit of the activity which they are about to commit. Further, children may lack\n\n   the ability and grit to defend themselves and refuse to participate in the\n\n   marriage against the pleasure of their custodians or parents.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">62. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1542330/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 11</a> raises a presumption.

In addition to the power of the Judicial Magistrate of the first class or a\n\n      Metropolitan Magistrate to issue injunctions, Section 13 also stipulates the role\n\n      of the District Magistrate in the prevention of child marriages. Clause (4) of\n\n      Section 13 stipulates that a District Magistrate is deemed to be a CPMO on\n\n      certain days to prevent the solemnization of child marriages. The District\n\n      Magistrate may exercise all the powers which accrue to the CMPO under the\n\n      PCMA. 104 The intent of empowering the District Magistrate is in recognition of\n\n      the fact that child marriages may take place in higher numbers on certain days.\n\n      Since many communities in India believe that marriages may be beneficial if\n\n      conducted on auspicious days, the authorities may preventively earmark these\n\n      days for the application of Clauses (4) and (5) of Section 13 of the PCMA.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">100</span>\n    Section 13(7), PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">101</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">\n    Section 13(8), PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">102</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">\n    Section 13(9), PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">103</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">\n    Section 13(10), PCMA.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">104</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_222\">\n    Section 13(4), PCMA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_223\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                                                             Page 48 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                             PART V\n\n   Clause (5) of the PCMA stipulates that the District Magistrate shall have\n\n   additional powers to stop or prevent the solemnisation of child marriages, for\n\n   which he may take appropriate measures and use the minimum force required.\n\n\nChild Marriage Prohibition Officers\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_224\">70. In addition to injunctions, the PCMA also prescribes the appointment of CMPOs\n\n   for the prevention of child marriage. One of the primary critiques of the CMRA\n\n   was that the law was dependent on the private initiative of public-spirited\n\n   citizens to avoid child marriages. The offences under the CMRA were only\n\n   partially cognizable and its enforcement was met with severe social penalty and\n\n   the wrath of the two families whose wards were made to tie the knot. The PCMA\n\n   sought to better enforce its provisions by stipulating the appointment of a\n\n   CMPO. <a href=\"/doc/1913586/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 2(d)</a> of PCMA defines a CMPO as an officer appointed by the\n\n   State Government under Section 16(1) of PCMA. Section 16 empowers the\n\n   State Government to issue a notification in the official gazette appointing a\n\n   CMPO for the specified jurisdiction. Under Clause (2) of Section 16 of PCMA,\n\n   the State may also request a respectable member of the locality with a record\n\n   in social service or an officer of the Gram Panchayat or Municipality or an officer\n\n   of the Government or any public sector undertaking or a non-governmental\n\n   organisation to render assistance to the CMPO. The CMPO is mandated to\n\n   carry out the duties stipulated in Clause (3) of Section 16 of PCMA. These\n\n   duties are as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_225\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">     (i) to prevent solemnisation of child marriages by taking such action as he\n\n        may deem fit;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                                                         Page 49 of 141</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">\f                                                                                PART V\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">         (ii) to collect evidence for the effective prosecution of persons contravening\n\n             the provisions of the Act;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_229\">         (iii) to advise either individual cases or counsel the residents of the locality\n\n             generally not to indulge in promoting, helping, aiding or allowing the\n\n             solemnisation of child marriages;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_231\">         (iv) to create awareness of the evil which results from child marriages;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_232\">         (v) to sensitise the community on the issue of child marriages;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">         (vi) to furnish such periodical returns and statistics as the State Government\n\n             may direct; and\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">         (vii)    to discharge such other functions and duties as may be assigned to\n\n             him by the State Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_235\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\">71.

The Petitioner has submitted that the practice widely prevalent is to appoint an\n\n       officer with multifarious duties as the CMPO. The task of the CMPO is doled out\n\n       as an additional task to officers who are already burdened with their primary\n\n       duties. This leads to ineffectiveness and allows many child marriages to slip\n\n       through the cracks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_241\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">74. The data provided by the Union in its additional affidavit sheds light on the\n\n       prevalence of officers holding additional charges as CMPOs at the district level.\n\n       In states like Haryana and Chhattisgarh, officials such as Sub-Divisional\n\n       Magistrates 107 and District Social Welfare Officers are appointed as CMPOs but\n\n       may also hold other responsibilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">75. As argued by the Petitioner, the appointment of CMPOs who are inundated with\n\n       other multifarious duties impedes the effectiveness of child marriage prevention\n\n       measures. Officers with multiple duties might struggle to dedicate sufficient time\n\n       and resources to their role as CMPOs, potentially hindering the effectiveness\n\n       of child marriage prevention efforts. The appointment of CMPOs is not a mere\n\n       statutory formality as part of an ornate virtue signalling. These officers are in\n\n       charge of prosecution of child marriages, counselling of stakeholders and\n\n       spreading awareness and sensitization in the community. An effective CMPO\n\n       must make efforts to find their roots in the community, engage with communities\n\n       and organisations in the area and carry out the painstaking, and sometimes\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">107</span>\n      ‘SDM’\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                                                            Page 51 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                            PART V\n\n   thankless, task of reporting specific factors affecting child marriages in the\n\n   district.

Additionally, the level at which CMPOs are designated—whether at the district,\n\n   Block, or Gram Panchayat level—is also a critical concern. For instance, states\n\n   like Karnataka have appointed 58,522 officers across thirty one districts, and\n\n   Maharashtra has appointed 25,562 officers across thirty six districts, extending\n\n   appointments down to the Gram Panchayat level. Andhra Pradesh has\n\n   appointed 16,590 officers from the village or ward level up to the district level,\n\n   including District Magistrates at the district level. However, Uttar Pradesh has\n\n   designated only one CMPO per district, with 75 CMPOs for seventy-five\n\n   districts. Although high numbers of appointments may suggest extensive\n\n   coverage, this alone does not ensure effectiveness unless there are exclusive\n\n   officers dedicated solely to CMPO duties, free from additional responsibilities.\n\n   For example, at the Gram Panchayat level, Panchayat Secretaries, Village\n\n   Revenue Officers, and Patwaris are often given CMPO duties in addition to their\n\n   primary roles, which dilutes their ability to focus solely on child marriage\n\n   prevention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_247\">77.

We accordingly hold that, given the significant obligations expected to be\n\n      discharged by a dedicated CMPO, no officer with other responsibilities shall be\n\n      appointed as the CMPO. States or UTs shall appoint exclusive CMPOs in each\n\n      district in addition to any CMPOs already serving in a dual capacity, and they\n\n      shall equip these officers with adequate resources for the effective discharge of\n\n      their functions. If a State or UT concludes that instances of child marriage have\n\n      decreased to the extent that appointing exclusive CMPOs is no longer\n\n      necessary, it may file an application before this Court, seeking leave to appoint\n\n      a CMPO who also holds other duties at the District level.\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_123\">B.

In the context of child marriage, the principles enunciated\n\n   in the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_160\">JJ Act</a> as well as the framework established under it are vitally important.\n\n   Children who are at risk of marriage at the hands of their family or relatives are\n\n   expressly recognised as CNCP under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_161\">The JJ Act</a> further prescribes for\n\n   their protection, rehabilitation and development.

The formation of SJPUs reflects a refreshing outlook toward police work,\n\n   one which is imperative in liberal democracies’ treatment of vulnerable groups.\n\n   Law with a touch of humanity and law enforcement with a boost of sensitivity\n\n   and empathy are the cornerstone of the law on children. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_163\">The JJ Act</a> therefore\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                                                         Page 58 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART V\n\n      forms an important instrument in the contemporary legal framework concerning\n\n      child marriages in India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_274\">\nD.

For example,\n\n      some States conduct regular meetings with school authorities to identify and\n\n      reintegrate school dropouts, using education as a key tool to prevent child\n\n      marriages. States like Assam collaborate with NGOs and CBOs to rehabilitate\n\n      victims, provide compensation, and facilitate home visits through DCPU staff.\n\n      Several states have also drafted action plans: Uttar Pradesh has District Action\n\n      Plans for ending child marriage and adolescent empowerment, incorporating\n\n      and adapting activities from the State Action Plan. Rajasthan introduced its\n\n      State Action Plan in 2017 152, anchoring multiple interventions and activities to\n\n      address the root causes of child marriage.

Impact analysis of State schemes\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_325\">112. The data reveals that a comprehensive, multifaceted approach involving\n\n     training schemes, awareness programs, and financial incentives is essential for\n\n     effectively combating child marriage. However, not all States have adopted this\n\n     three-pronged strategy. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Bihar\n\n     showcase strong alignment with this multifaceted approach. For instance, the\n\n     financial incentive schemes in Telangana and Bihar effectively incentivize\n\n     families to delay marriage. States like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh\n\n     focus on training and awareness. The absence of direct financial support could\n\n     limit their schemes’ impact on economically vulnerable communities. While\n\n     these efforts contribute to raising awareness and promoting societal change,\n\n     families facing financial hardships may still lean toward early marriage without\n\n     economic support for educational or vocational opportunities. The absence of\n\n     direct financial assistance may limit the reach and impact of otherwise well-\n\n     designed training and awareness programs, as families in economically\n\n     challenged communities may not feel the immediate benefits of delaying\n\n     marriage without addressing financial constraints.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">153</span>\n    Karnataka’s online portal ‘Surakshini’ keeps track of the child’s status, and every department official\ninvolved has to log in regularly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_326\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                                                                          Page 70 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                           PART V\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_327\">113. The data on child marriages across various States and UTs shows a range\n\n   of outcomes in both prevention and prosecution efforts over the last three years.\n\n   Several states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and West Bengal, report\n\n   a high number of cases, though many of these cases were prevented before\n\n   the marriages could be solemnized. Karnataka documented 8,348 child\n\n   marriage cases, preventing 7,306 of these, while Andhra Pradesh reported\n\n   3,413 cases, with 3,136 successfully prevented. This reflects a proactive\n\n   approach to preventing child marriages in some states, where authorities\n\n   intercept and prevent a significant portion of cases before, they are formalized.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_328\">114. Some States illustrate discrepancies between the number of child marriage\n\n   cases reported, the number prevented, and the number of FIRs filed.\n\n   Maharashtra reported 2043 cases prevented but registered 178 FIRs,\n\n   suggesting limited legal follow-through. Similarly, Telangana reported 4440\n\n   cases of child marriage, of which only 149 FIRs were filed. Andhra Pradesh,\n\n   despite having 3,416 cases registered, filed 10 FIRs. These gaps highlight\n\n   potential obstacles in prosecution and a possible need for streamlined\n\n   cooperation   between    child   marriage   prevention    authorities   and   law\n\n   enforcement agencies. Tamil Nadu presents a more comprehensive approach,\n\n   where both prevention and FIR filing are high; with 8,966 reported cases, the\n\n   state successfully prevented 6,436 marriages and filed 2,392 FIRs.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_329\">115. Interestingly, several States and UTs, such as Dadra and Nagar Haveli,\n\n   Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, reported no cases of child marriage over\n\n   the last three years. While this might indicate minimal occurrences of child\n\n   marriage in these areas, it could also suggest underreporting or a lack of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                                                       Page 71 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                              PART VI\n\n     awareness of the issue among authorities and communities. Furthermore,\n\n     States and UTs like Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh and Puducherry, which reported\n\n     very low figures or none at all, raise questions about the consistency and\n\n     accuracy of data reporting processes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">  116. A more comprehensive look across all regions also includes variations in the\n\n     effectiveness of interventions. In addition, the number of cases leading to FIRs\n\n     is relatively low across most states compared to the number of marriages\n\n     reported, highlighting potential gaps in legal action and prosecution efforts.\n\n     Even in states with high intervention rates, the limited legal action suggests that\n\n     additional support may be needed to ensure accountability and deterrence.\n\n\nVI.

Recognizing that such marriages\n\n       are often non-consensual and perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality, the\n\n       international community began drafting conventions aimed at setting protective\n\n       standards for marriageable age and conditions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_339\"> ii.

The court found that Mali’s Family Code was incompatible with its\n\n      obligations under multiple international instruments, including the Maputo\n\n      Protocol, the ACRWC and CEDAW. 185 Specifically, the Family Code’s\n\n      provisions on minimum marriage age and the lack of mandatory consent were\n\n      seen as violations of these treaties, which seek to eliminate harmful practices\n\n      and ensure gender equality and child protection.186 Consequently, the court\n\n      ordered Mali to amend its Family Code to align it with these international\n\n      standards by setting a minimum marriage age of eighteen, ensuring free\n\n      consent to marriage, and providing equal inheritance rights for all children,\n\n      including those born outside of marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_366\">130.

It is a right that is based on the\n\n      free will, equality and autonomy of the partners and involves special mutual\n\n      obligations, with the official ceremony of marriage serving to substantiate the\n\n      marriage through a formal act. 196\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_379\">135.

They can determine\n\n       the living arrangements of married minors without considering their marital\n\n       status, ensuring that decisions prioritize the child&#x27;s best interests under IHRL 197.\n\n       Protecting minors from early marriage aligns with the state&#x27;s duty to uphold life\n\n       and physical integrity under <a href=\"/doc/1788096/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 2(2)</a> of the German Basic Law and\n\n       addresses       the   need   to   eliminate   disadvantages   faced    by    women.\n\n       As a result, the court ordered the legislature to amend the law by 30 June 2024,\n\n       to address these gaps, thus providing legal clarity on the status of such\n\n       marriages and offering a pathway for validation after reaching adulthood. 198\n\n       This case illustrates the complexities involved in addressing child marriage\n\n       within Europe, particularly in the context of refugees and migration. While the\n\n       German law aimed to protect minors, the Federal Constitutional Court\n\n       emphasized the need for balance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_383\">136. In India, the PCMA protects child brides and any child born from a child\n\n       marriage by prescribing for their maintenance, residence and custody. Further,\n\n       any child born from such a marriage is deemed legitimate. These provisions\n\n       apply even when the marriage has been nullified at the instance of the minor\n\n       contracting party. India therefore does not have the same legal gap that the\n\n       Federal Constitutional Court observed in German law. Protections of\n\n       maintenance, residence and custody under family law are a recognition of the\n\n       responsibilities that society places on families after marriage. The philosophy is\n\n       that a law must not merely penalise criminal action – in this case child marriage\n\n       – but must also compensate and address the harm meted out to the victim.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">197</span>\n      Ibid.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">198</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_384\">\n      Ibid, Para 190-192.</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                                                                              Page 82 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                                  PART VI\n\niii.

In other words,\n                     the focus is on consent to marriage. For\n                     example, the International Covenant on Civil and\n                     Political Rights (&quot;ICCPR”) states that “No\n                     marriage shall be entered into without the free\n                     and full consent of the intending spouses”.\n                     Similarly, the Convention on the Elimination of\n                     All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\n                     (“CEDAW”).

International human rights\n                     law bodies have recognized that forced marriage, as\n                     defined under international human rights law, can\n                     take place both in peacetime and in armed conflict.\n                     International criminal law similarly recognizes the\n                     deprivation of relational autonomy through the\n                     imposition of a “conjugal union” on a victim. This\n                     union need not be marriage as recognized under\n                     domestic law, as it also includes relationships in\n                     which the victim is forcibly attached to a particular\n                     person outside of the context of domestic marriage\n                     law.

The issue of forced marriage is intricately linked to child marriage, as both\n\n      practices deny individuals, particularly minors, the fundamental right to make\n\n      autonomous decisions regarding their lives. The imposition of forced marriage\n\n      reflects the broader systemic issue of coerced relationships that deny the\n\n      victims agency and autonomy. This lack of agency is heightened in the context\n\n      of child marriage, where children are subjected to societal and familial\n\n      pressures that undermine their ability to give informed consent.

What is crucial is the nature of the\n                          activity, not its site. While recognising the unique\n                          worth of each person, the Constitution does not\n                          presuppose that a holder of rights is as an isolated,\n                          lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied\n                          and socially disconnected self.

The overarching theme emerging from these judgments is that India has a\n\n      dual obligation: to respect its commitments under international treaties and to\n\n      interpret domestic laws in a manner consistent with international human rights\n\n      standards. This is particularly relevant concerning child marriage, as India has\n\n      ratified several international instruments that set the minimum age for marriage\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_366\">251</span>\n    This position has been reiterated by various other decisions of this Court.

Moreover, even if India is not\n\n         a party to certain regional conventions that address child marriage directly, the\n\n         principles of non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, and the right to\n\n         free and informed consent should guide national legislation and policy in this\n\n         area.

As Prof. Rangita De Silva-De Alwis argues in her report, Child Marriage and\n\n         the Law – Legislative Reform Initiative Paper Series 255 child marriage must be\n\n         treated as a human rights issue to highlight its seriousness and prompt state\n\n         parties to amend their laws and policies accordingly. 256 She also emphasises\n\n         that framing child marriage within international treaties compels States to be\n\n         accountable for their inaction on this issue. If a treaty establishes a monitoring\n\n         body or a mechanism to address complaints, any non-compliant state party may\n\n         face public rulings against it. 257 We believe that such public scrutiny can\n\n         pressure the state to implement effective measures that protect children from\n\n         the harmful effects of early marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_459\">\nVIII.

Child marriage deprives children of their agency, autonomy and right to fully\n\n   develop and enjoy their childhood. The right to free choice and autonomy in\n\n   marriage encompasses three fundamental rights: the right to free and informed\n\n   consent, the right against gender based violence, and the right to sexual\n\n   autonomy. These interconnected rights form the foundation for ensuring that\n\n   marriage is a consensual partnership rather than a coercive arrangement,\n\n   particularly when addressing the issue of child marriage.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_470\">174. Girls who are married off early are not only denied their childhood but are\n\n   also forced into social isolation on account of being cut off from their natal\n\n   family, friends and other support systems. They are left to the mercies of their\n\n   marital home and in-laws and denied their innocence which is native to a\n\n   meaningful childhood experience. Boys who are married early are forced to take\n\n   up more responsibilities and are pressured to play the role of a provider to the\n\n   family, earlier in life. Patriarchy requires members of a marital union to play\n\n   specific roles. It forces men to play the public role in a marriage and fend for the\n\n   family by being responsible for its economic and occupational development.\n\n   Both sexes are adversely affected by forced and early marriage.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_378\">                                                                        Page 100 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                            PART VIII\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_471\">175. In India, marriage has traditionally been a religious ceremony organised by\n\n   the families of the bride and groom. The union is looked at as an integration of\n\n   the two families and the object of facilitating an organically compatible\n\n   relationship between the bride and the groom is inconsequential. The mandate\n\n   to recreate a patriarchal family structure is tied to social norms and\n\n   expectations. One of the primary manifestations of this is the control over\n\n   sexuality. While social norms rooted in a patriarchal mindset seek to control the\n\n   sexuality of all persons, its nexus with child marriage is undeniable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_472\">176. Patriarchy offends the most basic rights of people by creating a hierarchy-\n\n   based order of subjugation and static power distribution in society. When an\n\n   institution of patriarchy operates, it never denies rights in a unidimensional way.\n\n   The frontal assault of patriarchal institutions is in, all at once, denying any\n\n   deviance and valuing some over others. In the instance of child marriage, the\n\n   right to sexuality of a person is systematically dismantled. The assault starts\n\n   with the sexualisation of the child at a tender age. As we have stated above,\n\n   marriage is an institution with legal standing in which sexual conduct is\n\n   legitimised and promoted by the State and society. Marrying in childhood has\n\n   the effect of objectifying the child. The practice of child marriage imposes\n\n   mature burdens on children who are not physically or mentally prepared to\n\n   comprehend the significance of marriage. When women are forced into\n\n   marriages to protect their ‘chastity’ and ‘virginity’ she is denied her right to\n\n   sexuality, bodily autonomy and the freedom to make choices for herself as she\n\n   sees fit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_473\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_379\">                                                                       Page 101 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                           PART VIII\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_474\">177.

At an\n\n      age which must be instructed by the ability to make mistakes and learn from life\n\n      experiences, children are stunted and forcibly fit into boxes. The multi-\n\n      dimensional assault of child marriage is therefore not only oppressive to\n\n      heterosexual girls and boys but also to all gender and sexual minorities.\n\n      Choices in matters of sexuality are integral to human desire. Our Constitution\n\n      recognises the right a person has over all aspects of their sexuality. 259 The\n\n      control of the sexuality of a girl child from orthodox moral virtues restricts her\n\n      ability to experience life in its fullest dimension. Sexuality is not only the\n\n      orientation a person may have in matters of romance and intimacy but also the\n\n      ability to navigate the desires of a person regardless of their choice of partner\n\n      or the option not to have a partner. Men and women alike are victimised by\n\n      compulsory heterosexuality. In child marriage, their limited agency within\n\n      heteropatriarchy is also taken away in infancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_476\">178.

A good\n\n   childhood is marked by limitless imagination and the ability to dream big. The\n\n   audacity to envision futures filled with success, happiness, divergence and\n\n   enjoyment occurs naturally to all – but is manifested most authentically in\n\n   childhood. The right to childhood is the right to be able to develop the\n\n   experiences of childhood into tangible life skills and intellectual pursuits. It is\n\n   marked by the expectation of the child that they are not on their own but are\n\n   entitled to the supportive network of their parents, siblings, family, friends and\n\n   the entire society. As the saying goes – it takes a village to raise a child. The\n\n   foremost method by which society commits to developing a child is by imparting\n\n   education. Institutions of learning are centres for society to channel knowledge\n\n   and experience and make them available to children.

Education allows a person to develop and articulate their thoughts and learn\n\n   the language of global engagement. It is a call for greater emancipation of the\n\n   mind. Education breathes life into intellect, dimension into perspective and\n\n   openness in minds. It opens doors to employment opportunities and enables\n\n   people to stand on their own feet in professional and personal pursuits of life.\n\n   The detrimental effect of not being educated affects girls most starkly since they\n\n   are already vulnerable to agents of oppression on account of their gender.\n\n   Marriage for most women in patriarchal societies is an announcement of\n\n   educational conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_501\">191. It is uncommon for women to continue education after marriage without the\n\n   express approval and wish of the in-laws and husband. The imposition of a\n\n   marital family on the education of women may be an experience common to all\n\n   women. But when the woman is married as a child, her education is arrested in\n\n   place during a pivotal period of brain development.

Child marriage is one such threat.

Many people,\n                       including parents and educators, hold conservative\n                       views that discussing sex is inappropriate, immoral, or\n                       embarrassing. This societal stigma creates a\n                       reluctance to talk openly about sexual health, leading\n                       to a significant knowledge gap among adolescents.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">                       239. One prevalent misconception is that sex\n                       education encourages promiscuity and irresponsible\n                       behaviour among youth. Critics often argue that\n                       providing information about sexual health and\n                       contraception will lead to increased sexual activity\n                       among teenagers. However, research has shown that\n                       comprehensive sex education actually delays the onset\n                       of sexual activity and promotes safer practices among\n                       those who are sexually active.

This view has led to resistance from\n                       various state governments, resulting in bans on sex\n                       education in schools in some states.

Additionally, there is a misconception that sex\n                  education only covers biological aspects of\n                  reproduction. Effective sex education encompasses a\n                  wide range of topics, including consent, healthy\n                  relationships, gender equality, and respect for diversity.\n                  Addressing these topics is crucial for reducing sexual\n                  violence and promoting gender equity.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">196. In the context of child marriage, we have demonstrated the heightened risk\n\n   of health complications to arise out of adolescent sex and childbearing. While\n\n   girls married as children have to bear the consequences of this, they are not\n\n   the only party to the sexual relation which causes negative health outcomes.\n\n   Boys married at young age equally feel pressures associated with sexual\n\n   performance. Often, the only resource available to them is their peer group. The\n\n   performance of sexual activity is an avenue for men to exhibit their masculinity.\n\n   Because of their tender mind and patriarchal notions of masculinity and sexual\n\n   dominance, they are likely to fall into egregious misinformation by their peers\n\n   and commit violence on their child brides. The issue of approaching boys in\n\n   child marriage with care, compassion and affection is unfortunately lost in some\n\n   mainstream discourse on child marriage. While girls are undoubtedly affected\n\n   by child marriage disproportionately, we ought to also account for the tender\n\n   minds of men who are forced into marriages as children.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_510\">197.

Under IHRL, the State has a concrete, enforceable obligation to prevent and\n\n       eliminate child marriage by ensuring that laws, policies, and social services\n\n       align with international standards such as those in the CRC and the CEDAW.\n\n       The state must establish and enforce a legal framework that explicitly prohibits\n\n       child marriage, accompanied by robust mechanisms for implementation and\n\n       redress.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_512\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_513\">199. States also have an obligation to monitor and enforce compliance with these\n\n       laws and to work closely with civil society organizations to implement effective\n\n       interventions. The State&#x27;s role is not limited to merely punishing offenders but\n\n       extends to creating an enabling environment where children can exercise their\n\n       rights freely.

The provisions <a href=\"/doc/45905651/\" id=\"a_334\">referred to above</a> and other\n                   provisions of international conventions indicate that the\n                   rights have been guaranteed to the children and those\n                   rights carry corresponding State obligations to respect,\n                   protect and fulfil the realisation of children&#x27;s rights. The\n                   obligation to protect implies the horizontal right\n                   which casts an obligation on the State to see that it\n                   is not violated by non-State actors.

Way forward\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_524\">  207. In light of the foregoing analyses, we seek to formulate specific guidelines\n\n     for achieving the elimination of child marriage while bearing in mind the delicate\n\n     socio-economic interplay. The Union submits that the PCMA focuses on two\n\n     key pillars: (a) raising awareness and (b) prosecution. Despite progress in\n\n     awareness campaigns, there is still a pressing need to enhance accountability\n\n     mechanisms, ensure mandatory reporting, and rehabilitate minors affected by\n\n     child marriages. Further attention is required to make the legal framework more\n\n     effective by addressing loopholes and ensuring swift action against offenders,\n\n     particularly in areas with high child marriage prevalence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_525\">  208. Addressing child marriage requires an intersectional approach that\n\n     acknowledges the overlapping vulnerabilities experienced by children,\n\n     especially girls from marginalized communities. Intersectionality involves\n\n     considering factors like gender, caste, socioeconomic status, and geography,\n\n     which often increase the risks of early marriage. Preventive strategies should\n\n     therefore be tailored to the unique needs of various communities and focus on\n\n     addressing the root causes of child marriage, such as poverty, gender\n\n     inequality, lack of education, and entrenched cultural practices.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_526\">  209. The PCMA as a social legislation will only succeed through the collective\n\n     efforts of all stakeholders to address the issue within a broader social\n\n     framework which emphasises the need for multi-sectoral coordination. This\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_430\">                                                                         Page 116 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                             PART IX\n\n   necessitates the enhancement of reporting mechanisms, expansion of public\n\n   awareness campaigns, and investment in the training and capacity-building of\n\n   law enforcement officers and related actors. It is also crucial to regularly monitor\n\n   the implementation of the Act, conduct evaluations to identify gaps, and\n\n   establish feedback mechanisms to continually refine and improve responses to\n\n   child marriage. As we issue these directions, we emphasize the need for more\n\n   comprehensive approaches and community-driven strategies to ensure the\n\n   complete eradication of child marriages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_527\">210. We frame the following guidelines for the effective and useful\n\n   implementation of the PCMA. The orientation of these guidelines is to prioritise\n\n   prevention before protection and protection before penalisation. We are\n\n   cognizant of the impact that criminalisation has on families and communities.\n\n   To ensure effective use of penal provisions in the PCMA, it is imperative that\n\n   there is widespread awareness and education about child marriage and the\n\n   legal consequences of its commission. We therefore direct that the following\n\n   guidelines be interpreted to expand effective implementation of the preventive\n\n   measures under PCMA analysed in Part V(A)(iii) of this judgment.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_528\">211. We must not be understood to discourage prosecution of those who commit\n\n   illegal acts. However, the aim of the law enforcement machinery must not be\n\n   solely focused on increasing prosecutions without making the best efforts to\n\n   prevent and prohibit child marriage. The focus on penalisation reflects a harms-\n\n   based approach which waits for a harm to occur before taking any steps. This\n\n   approach has proven to be ineffective at bringing about social change.

This portal will include features for\n\n       anonymous reporting, allowing victims and concerned citizens to easily\n\n       lodge complaints and access support services; and\n\n\n   1.2. The portal will serve as a centralized platform for collecting and analyzing\n\n       data on child marriage incidents, enabling targeted interventions. It will\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_454\">                                                                       Page 135 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                          PART IX\n\n      enhance accessibility, transparency, and accountability by ensuring that all\n\n      reports are addressed promptly by enforcement agencies and CMPOs.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_585\">2. Leveraging Technology for Support Services\n\n\n  2.1. Each State and UT shall make all endeavours to disseminate information\n\n      against child marriage across all print, digital and social media – with a\n\n      focus on regions where child marriages are likely to occur in high numbers.\n\n      They shall also consider the viability of data analytics to identify high-risk\n\n      areas and patterns of child marriage, enabling swift interventions.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_586\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91025075\" id=\"span_455\">3. Technology-Driven Monitoring of Attendance\n\n\n  3.1. The Ministry for Women and Child Development, in coordination with the\n\n      relevant State Ministries, shall consider the viability of a technology-driven\n\n      monitoring system to track daily attendance for school-going girls up to the\n\n      12th grade, ensuring compliance with the privacy standards outlined in the\n\n      Supreme Court judgment in <a href=\"/doc/91025075/\" id=\"a_339\">KS Puttaswamy (9J</a>) (supra).\n\n\nI. Funding and Resources</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_587\">1. Dedicated Annual Budget Allocation\n\n\n  1.1. The relevant ministries of the Union Government are directed to\n\n      recommend the allocation of a dedicated yearly budget for each State\n\n      specifically aimed at preventing child marriage and supporting affected\n\n      individuals. This budget should encompass:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_588\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">     1.1.1.

Juvenile Justice Fund Institutionalization\n\n\n   2.1. The State Governments are directed to institutionalize the Juvenile Justice\n\n      Fund established under <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 105</a> of the JJ Act. This fund will provide\n\n      financial assistance in the form of scholarships and stipends specifically for\n\n      girls at imminent risk of child marriage or whose marriages have been\n\n      annulled, promoting their educational and social empowerment.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_592\">3. Compensation for Girls Opting Out of Marriage\n\n\n   3.1. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is requested to consider the\n\n      viability of providing compensation to girls who opt out of marriage upon\n\n      reaching the age of majority under the NALSA Victim Compensation\n\n      Scheme or respective State Victim Compensation Schemes. This\n\n      compensation should be equivalent to that provided to rape victims,\n\n      ensuring adequate support for those who have escaped child marriage.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_457\">                                                                      Page 137 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                           PART X\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_593\"> 4. Identification and Support for At-Risk Children\n\n\n    4.1. Superintendents of Police and Collectors are directed to identify instances\n\n        of child marriage and monitor children at risk of dropping out of school due\n\n        to socio-economic challenges or threats of early marriage. This initiative\n\n        should ensure:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_594\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">       4.1.1.

Provision of stipends and fellowships to support their continued\n\n            education and mitigate the factors contributing to child marriage.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_595\">X. Suggestions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_596\"> 212. In the course of this judgment, we have traced the full breadth of the law\n\n against child marriage. The PCMA is the central legislation governing the issue on\n\n the subject. In light of the Constitutional guarantees accruing to children, we\n\n observe certain gaps in the PCMA. Absent a Constitutional challenge or a case\n\n being argued, we resist from making declarations and restrict ourselves to making\n\n suggestions for the scrutiny of the Union. The legal question on these issues,\n\n however, is kept open if it were to come before a Constitutional court in an\n\n appropriate proceeding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_597\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_458\">                                                                      Page 138 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART X\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_598\">213. The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child\n\nmarriage under the PCMA has been a subject of some confusion. The Union in its\n\nnote of submission filed after the judgment was reserved in the case has stated\n\nthat this Court may direct that the PCMA prevails over personal law. The note\n\nstates as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_599\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">                     “9. As a way forward, Ministry of Women &amp; Child\n                     Development has following inputs to provide for kind\n                     consideration of the Hon’ble Court –\n\n                      i.      There are conflicting pronouncements by\n                      various High Courts about the precedence of the\n                      <a href=\"/doc/790355/\" id=\"a_341\">Prohibition of Child Marriage Act</a> (PCMA), 2006 over\n                      the personal laws. Hence, Hon’ble Court may\n                      consider issuing directions pronouncing that the\n                      PCMA will prevail over the personal laws governing\n                      marriage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">                      …”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_600\">214. Details of the conflicting opinions were not furnished in the submissions by\n\neither party to these proceedings. The PCMA states nothing on the validity of the\n\nmarriage as we have noted above. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amending)\n\nBill 2021 was introduced in Parliament on 21 December 2021. The Bill was referred\n\nfor examination to the Department Related Standing Committee on Education,\n\nWomen, Children, Youth and Sports. The Bill sought to amend the PCMA to\n\nexpressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The\n\nissue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_601\">215. Lastly, we note that while the PCMA seeks to prohibit child marriages, it\n\ndoes not stipulate on betrothals. Marriages fixed in the minority of a child also have\n\nthe effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood.\n\nIt takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_459\">                                                                            Page 139 of 141</span>\n\f                                                                           PART XI\n\n  and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW\n\n  stipulates against betrothals of minors. Parliament may consider outlawing child\n\n  betrothals which may be used to evade penalty under the PCMA. While a betrothed\n\n\n  child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_342\">JJ Act</a>,\n\n  the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination.\n\n\nXI.
