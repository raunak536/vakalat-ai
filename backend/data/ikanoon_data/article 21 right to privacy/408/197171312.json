Learned Senior Counsel Ms. Aparajita Singh,\n\n         instructed to appear in CWJC No. 5542 of 2023, led the\n\n         arguments on behalf of the petitioners. Referring to Annexure-\n\n         P/1 notification dated 06.06.2022, which initiated the caste\n\n         survey and the instructions issued from the Principal Secretary\n\n         to the District Collectors, followed up with directions from the\n\n         District Collectors to the Block Development Officers\n\n         (Annexure- P/2 and P/3 respectively) and the guidelines issued\n\n         through Annexue-P/4 notification, the learned Senior Counsel\n\n         raised objections specifically regarding the queries raised under\n\n         the three heads of religion, caste and monthly income. Reliance\n\n         was placed on K.S. Puttaswamy II (Aadhaar) v. Union of\n\n         India; (2019) 1 SCC 1 to point out that these three aspects are\n\n         very sensitive personal information which defines the identity,\n\n         autonomy, dignity and privacy of every individual. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\n         Supreme Court in Justice K.S.Puttaswamy I v. Union of India;\n\n         (2017) 10 SCC 1 specifically dealt with these aspects and held it\n\n         to be sacrosanct; the infringement of which would also fall foul\n\n         of the constitutional guarantees to preserve fundamental rights\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                          7/101\n\n\n\n\n         and never to be impinged; other than by way of reasonable\n\n         restrictions, conforming to strict standards of scrutiny. The State\n\n         by the above survey conducted amongst the residents of Bihar is\n\n         imposing a caste status on every citizen, whether he desires it or\n\n         chooses to distance himself/herself from it. The guidelines at\n\n         Annexure-P/5 are specifically read out which depict the manner\n\n         in which the details are to be obtained from the individuals\n\n         through the Government Officers, called the Enumerators. In\n\n         collecting the details of religion, there is a specific option, to be\n\n         counted as not falling under the enumerated six religions; who\n\n         will be classified under the heading &#x27;other religion&#x27; and even\n\n         those who express no religious beliefs to be classified under the\n\n         head &#x27;no religion&#x27;. Such an option is not available insofar as the\n\n         caste status and it is specified that under no instance the\n\n         mother&#x27;s caste will be recorded. This brings in a situation where,\n\n         even a person who does not nurture any religious belief would\n\n         be classified as a person belonging to one or other caste; which\n\n         can only be that of the father. As far as monthly income is\n\n         concerned, there is an estimation possible of the total income\n\n         received by the members of the family in the whole year divided\n\n         by 12 months; which, it is argued, is quite artificial and not the\n\n         real income derived by an individual. It is argued that the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                          8/101\n\n\n\n\n         survey, as it is intended, would be completely out of focus and\n\n         there would be no possibility of verification of any of the details\n\n         supplied by the individual citizen, especially in matters of\n\n         religion, caste and monthly income.\n\n                     3. It is specifically argued that the power to carry out\n\n         a census is exclusively on the Union Parliament as provided\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 246</a> of the Constitution of India read with Entry 69\n\n         of List-1, Seventh Schedule. In the year 2011, though not under\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_2\">Census Act, 1948</a>; as brought out by the Union Parliament\n\n         under Entry 69 of the 1st List, a socio-economic caste census\n\n         (SECC) was carried out by the Central Government by invoking\n\n         its power under <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 73</a> of the Constitution. The methodology\n\n         and the fall out of the same has been emphasized by the learned\n\n         Senior Counsel with reference to Annexure-P/9, a reply affidavit\n\n         filed on behalf of the Central Government in a writ petition\n\n         before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. The counter affidavit has\n\n         emphasized that the Central Government has given up a caste\n\n         wise enumeration, as a matter of policy from 1951 onwards and\n\n         decided to carry out only an enumeration of the Scheduled\n\n         Castes (S.C) and Scheduled Tribes (S.T), notified under the\n\n         Constitution. Except that of S.C and S.T, it is asserted that no\n\n         census was carried out in 1951 or in the succeeding six census,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                          9/101\n\n\n\n\n         of any information about the caste of the citizen. The counter\n\n         affidavit further indicates that enumeration of the Other\n\n         Backward Class Communities has posed extremely complex\n\n         impediments. When such data was collected in the pre-\n\n         independence period, the data suffered from lack of\n\n         completeness and accuracy and a census of the Backward\n\n         Classes has been found to be administratively difficult and\n\n         cumbersome. When such a conscious policy decision was taken\n\n         by the Central Government, it is very difficult to perceive and\n\n         accept the decision of the State Government to proceed with\n\n         such an enumeration; when the resources of the State is not as\n\n         large as that of the Centre.\n\n                     4. Specific reference is made to the general guidelines\n\n         issued which enable the enumerators and supervisors to get\n\n         information regarding the caste from the head of the family,\n\n         which again would not be authentic and would also impinge\n\n         upon the personal choices of an individual regarding disclosure\n\n         of his caste status. It is emphasized that there is no law brought\n\n         out by the State to collect such sensitive data and that, in any\n\n         event, there is no competence in the State to carry out a caste\n\n         census in the guise of a survey. It is further emphasized that the\n\n         objective of enabling affirmative action, to those marginalized\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         10/101\n\n\n\n\n         communities, is not specifically stated in the notifications\n\n         issued. Mohinder Singh Gill v. The Chief Election\n\n         Commissioner, New Delhi; 1978 (3) SCR 272 is relied on to\n\n         rubbish the contention of the object now declared of aiding\n\n         affirmative action, which object is only an afterthought at the\n\n         time of preparation of the counter affidavit. There is total\n\n         absence of statement of such objective in the notification itself\n\n         and what had not been thought of or stated at the time the\n\n         decision was taken to initiate a caste-based survey cannot now\n\n         be supplanted as an objective by way of a counter-affidavit.\n\n                     5. It is vehemently argued that any individual has the\n\n         right to choose or renounce his caste and there is no justification\n\n         or legitimate aim, as disclosed from the notifications, to profile\n\n         an individual on the basis of his caste, religion or income.\n\n         Shafin Jahan v. Asokan K.M.; (2018) 16 SCC 368 is relied on\n\n         to argue that the Constitution recognizes the liberty and\n\n         autonomy which inheres in each individual and this includes\n\n         decision on aspects defining one&#x27;s person. There can be no\n\n         enumeration of the required details, as is permitted under the\n\n         guidelines, either from the head of the family or from\n\n         neighbours and persons of a locality, which would not be\n\n         accurate and would also violate the right to define oneself,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         11/101\n\n\n\n\n         which inheres in the right to privacy.\n\n                     6. The power to carry out a Census, especially of\n\n         caste, religion and monthly income can only be traced to Entries\n\n         19, 69, 81 and 94 of the Union List under Schedule-VII of the\n\n         Constitution. Entries 20, 23, 24, 30 and 45 under the Concurrent\n\n         List, as relied on by the State, can be resorted to only insofar as\n\n         it does not impinge into the field exclusively reserved for the\n\n         Union Parliament. The distinction of Census and Survey is\n\n         specifically urged to further impress upon us that the exercise\n\n         attempted, is in measure and effect a census; thus, impinging\n\n         upon the exclusive power of the Union Parliament. It is also\n\n         urged that the restrictions and protection available to a citizen\n\n         insofar as ensuring the integrity of the data collected and\n\n         providing for its security, are not available in the present\n\n         exercise. The State, which is the protector of fundamental rights\n\n         under the Constitution, has turned its might against the citizen to\n\n         collect data forcibly and surreptitiously, thus, infringing upon\n\n         the citizens&#x27; valuable right to privacy, identity, autonomy and\n\n         dignity. It is summed up that, to uphold the exercise as legal,\n\n         there should be competence in the State and if competent, then a\n\n         valid law should be in existence, under which the exercise can\n\n         be carried out, motivated by a legitimate goal or aim; which has\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         12/101\n\n\n\n\n         to be judged under the highest standards of scrutiny. If such a\n\n         legitimate aim or goal is available, even then there should be\n\n         narrow tailoring to ensure that nothing beyond what is necessary\n\n         is done by the State. Again, if there is an alternative method\n\n         available; which in this case the State has by way of appointing\n\n         Commissions, to aid the affirmative action, such alternatives\n\n         have to be resorted to rather than involve in an exercise leading\n\n         to infringement of fundamental rights. Further, the test of\n\n         proportionality necessarily has to be satisfied and in the present\n\n         case, there can be no balance found to sustain the arbitrary\n\n         action, clearly leading to infringement of fundamental rights,\n\n         without any declared purpose or goal. The lack of security also\n\n         assumes importance insofar as the State having not placed\n\n         anything on record to indicate any audit having been conducted\n\n         for ensuring the protection of the data collected. Reference is\n\n         also made to a notification issued by the State Government,\n\n         which the State Government itself relied on before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n         Supreme Court, wherein prescribed action was threatened in\n\n         case of deliberate wrong information being supplied by any\n\n         person. This assumes relevance especially in the context of the\n\n         State having not directed the enumerator to collect the\n\n         information required at the survey, from the individuals\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         13/101\n\n\n\n\n         themselves and goes against the assertion of the disclosure in\n\n         the survey being voluntary.\n\n                     7. Sri Abhinav Srivastava, learned counsel appearing\n\n         for some of the petitioners adopted the arguments already\n\n         addressed and assailed the impugned survey primarily on lack\n\n         of legislative competence, disregard of the right to privacy\n\n         which is also enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and\n\n         alternatively the absence of a legislation sanctioning such\n\n         survey. It is specifically argued that <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 162</a> only extends to\n\n         the legislative power conferred on the State and insofar as caste\n\n         census is concerned, there is absolute lack of it. The object of\n\n         the exercise asserted by the State; to further the development of\n\n         the downtrodden communities is a mirage brought in at the\n\n         second phase of the exercise. For identification of other\n\n         backward communities (OBC) or the extremely weaker\n\n         backward communities (EWBC), there is sufficient power\n\n         available with the States under <a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 15 (4)</a> <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_7\">&amp; 16 (4)</a> of the\n\n         Constitution of India. In Bihar, there is also a legislation\n\n         identifying the OBCs and EWBCs, which is the Bihar\n\n         Reservation of Vacancies in Posts And Services (SC/ST, OBC)\n\n         Act, 1991. Schedules 1 and 2 of that Act enumerates the various\n\n         castes which are entitled to such benefits. There is also power\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         14/101\n\n\n\n\n         on the State to identify those castes which are marginalized and\n\n         are downtrodden by appointment of Commissions which is\n\n         sanctioned by Indra Sawhney v. Union of India; (1992) Supp.\n\n         (3) SCC 217. In achieving a constitutional goal, the learned\n\n         counsel asserts, the State has to adopt constitutional means and\n\n         cannot otherwise proceed. Annexure-1, the initial notification\n\n         and Annexures 2 and 3, insists upon collection of the data\n\n         specified, from each and every individual belonging to all\n\n         religions and communities and there is nothing stated as to an\n\n         option regarding disclosure of caste, to be voluntary. The said\n\n         option now asserted by the State is an afterthought which has\n\n         been stated in the counter affidavit filed by the State and not in\n\n         any of the notifications issued or the guidelines brought out.\n\n         Reliance is placed on the Constitution Bench decision of the\n\n         Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy I &amp; Aadhaar to\n\n         urge the significance and importance of the right to privacy as\n\n         highlighted by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court reversing two earlier\n\n         decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court itself. While K.S\n\n         Puttaswamy I upheld the right to privacy as a right protected by\n\n         the Constitution, being an intrinsic part of the right to personal\n\n         liberty and right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a>, the Aadhaar judgment\n\n         defined the contours within which such right could be infringed.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         15/101\n\n\n\n\n         The Aadhaar judgment stressed upon the need for existence of a\n\n         law which had a legitimate aim, the least infringement being\n\n         occasioned &amp; the test of proportionality being satisfied. The\n\n         exercise carried out by the State fails on all three counts. If for\n\n         arguments sake, it can be sustained under <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 162</a>, the action\n\n         is bad for the complete lack of guidelines on how the exercise is\n\n         to be carried out. It is reiterated that be it the exercise of\n\n         legislative power or an executive fiat; necessarily it should be\n\n         preceded by a legitimate object which is not discernible from\n\n         any of the notifications issued. The exercise of a caste survey is\n\n         being initiated without any definite objective and carried out\n\n         without a proper direction and the result of the culmination of\n\n         such collection of data, even now, is elusive. It is specifically\n\n         pointed out that even in the interim order passed, this Court had\n\n         expressed concern about protection of data; the details of which\n\n         are not disclosed.\n\n                     8. Pointing out the specific details to be collected\n\n         under the 17 identified heads as per Annexure-4 notification; it\n\n         is pertinently pointed out that the survey itself has been named\n\n         with one of such details; as &#x27;the caste survey&#x27;. The intention is\n\n         very clear from the nomenclature given to the survey and it is\n\n         the objective of the State to find out the number of persons\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         16/101\n\n\n\n\n         belonging to a caste, presumably for forging alliances and\n\n         carving out areas for narrow political ends; least of all is the\n\n         development or upliftment of the down trodden. It is further\n\n         pointed out from the guidelines regarding collection of data that\n\n         many of the guidelines are autocratic and arbitrary. It is\n\n         specifically pointed out that as per the guidelines in no event the\n\n         mother&#x27;s caste is to be recorded. It is also directed that an\n\n         individual&#x27;s caste or other personal details can be ascertained\n\n         from the head of the family. A woman who refuses to disclose\n\n         the father of her child would be forced in the presence of a male\n\n         member to disclose it.\n\n                     9. The very attempt of the State to record the caste of\n\n         each and every individual smacks of arbitrariness and displays\n\n         scant respect for the dignity of an individual. It is specifically\n\n         pointed out that while the Constitutional goal is to efface the\n\n         caste identity, it also promotes affirmative action for upliftment\n\n         of the downtrodden and marginalized. A declaration of caste or a\n\n         demand to disclose it arises only when a benefit flows from it to\n\n         an individual. All the members of an identified downtrodden\n\n         community would not be availing the benefits of the affirmative\n\n         action of the State, sanctioned by the Constitution, that flow\n\n         only because of the caste identity. Even a member of the S.C or\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         17/101\n\n\n\n\n         S.T, if not intending to seek the benefits of reservation, cannot\n\n         be forced to declare his caste status. It is in this context that the\n\n         test of proportionality has to be applied on the attempt of the\n\n         State to make every individual disclose his caste in the survey\n\n         conducted by government officials. The learned counsel would\n\n         emphasize that the mere presence of a government official is an\n\n         indirect coercion on the individual who is questioned, to\n\n         disclose the details under the seventeen heads, including the\n\n         identification of that individual in a particular caste. The\n\n         enumerators have been directed to ascertain the caste of an\n\n         individual from the head of the family or from the neighbours or\n\n         the people of the locality which, in effect, is a measure\n\n         employed to ferret out the caste identity even of an individual\n\n         who refuses to disclose it.\n\n                     10. The learned counsel relying on paragraph 148 to\n\n         157 of the decision in Aadhaar emphasized the need to ensure\n\n         the proposed survey to be one for a designated legitimate\n\n         purpose, the measures adopted having a rational connection to\n\n         the fulfillment of the purpose, there being no alternative\n\n         measures available to achieve the very same purpose with a\n\n         lesser degree of invasion/intrusion into individual rights and\n\n         there existing a balance between the need to achieve the purpose\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         18/101\n\n\n\n\n         and preventing any infringement of a constitutional right. It is\n\n         also pointed out from Aadhaar that, what stood permitted by the\n\n         Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, was after specifically taking into\n\n         account the precautionary measures to ensure the security of the\n\n         data; which have been detailed in the leading judgment.\n\n                     11. Shri Dinu Kumar, learned counsel appearing in\n\n         CWJC No. 8796 of 2023, while adopting the arguments already\n\n         addressed before this Court, commenced with a reference to the\n\n         counter affidavit of the State, speaking of a similar exercise\n\n         having been carried out by a number of States; which, however,\n\n         is stated to be only through a proper legislative exercise of\n\n         having a Commission for making recommendations for the\n\n         upliftment of the Backward Class communities. The learned\n\n         counsel would specifically refer to the series of documents\n\n         produced along with the reply affidavit to specifically point out\n\n         the provisions in the States of Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra\n\n         and Orissa. The functions of the Commissions are specifically\n\n         referred to from the legislations produced. It is also pointed out\n\n         that on similar lines there exists a legislation in the State of\n\n         Bihar and that makes the present exercise a futile one and an\n\n         unnecessary waste of public money. It is specifically pointed out\n\n         that an individual centric identification of the backward class\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                           19/101\n\n\n\n\n         communities has been only carried out by Karnataka and Orissa.\n\n         A Division Bench judgment of the Kerala High Court in WP(C)\n\n         No. 35220 of 2017, Manava Aikyavedhi v. Union of India, was\n\n         relied on, in which directions were issued to the Union and the\n\n         State Governments to finalize a report of socio-economic study\n\n         taking into account all parameters required for identification of\n\n         socially and educationally backward classes within the State of\n\n         Kerala and submit a report to the statutorily constituted\n\n         Commission; thus, coming within the contours of the decision\n\n         of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney, which did not\n\n         sanction an individual enumeration of caste status as\n\n         distinguished from an identification of social classes or\n\n         groupings for the purpose of ameliorating social and economic\n\n         backwardness. But for the assertion in the counter affidavit of\n\n         the State, that the disclosure of the 17 aspects identified for\n\n         enumeration from individuals is voluntary, there is nothing\n\n         discernible      from       the     various   notifications   and   the\n\n         communications addressed in furtherance of the exercise of a\n\n         caste survey, which substantiate such an assertion.

P-23\n\n         produced is specifically referred to as the socio-economic caste\n\n         census carried out by the Central Government in the year 2011,\n\n         the details of which have not yet been disclosed and as argued\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         20/101\n\n\n\n\n         by the other learned counsel, the Central Government had\n\n         encountered many problems in proceeding with such an\n\n         exercise.\n\n                     12. It is also urged that there is no reason, purpose or\n\n         necessity for the exercise carried out in the name of a caste\n\n         survey and it is on the mere ipse dixit of the State Government.\n\n         There had to be a legitimate purpose for initiating such an\n\n         exercise and there should also be a legitimate method followed,\n\n         informed with reason. M.P. Oil Extraction and Another v. State\n\n         of M.P.; (1997) 7 SCC 592, East Coast Railway v. Mahadev\n\n         Appa Rao; (2010) 7 SCC 678 and Census Commissioner v.\n\n         R.Krishnamurthy; (2015) 2 SCC 796, were relied on to argue\n\n         that the executive authority of the State must be held to be\n\n         within its competence to frame a policy for the administration of\n\n         the State; which policy should also be absolutely free of caprice\n\n         and informed by reason, failing which it could be held to be\n\n         arbitrary and on the mere ipse dixit of the executive\n\n         functionaries. If there was a purpose for the survey adopted and\n\n         disclosure was to be voluntary then it should have come out\n\n         from the scheme of things formulated by the executive authority\n\n         and it cannot later be supplanted by a counter affidavit before\n\n         this Court. <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_10\">The Census Act</a> is specifically pointed out and Ext.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         21/101\n\n\n\n\n         P-12, produced along with IA No. 1 of 2023, is referred to\n\n         where the reference to a &#x27;JANGANANA&#x27; meaning census; for\n\n         which there is no competence on the Executive Government of\n\n         the State. It is also urged that there was unnecessary expenditure\n\n         and there is no clarity as to how the funds were sourced from.\n\n                     13. Shri. Yadunandan Bansal, learned counsel\n\n         appearing in CWJC No. 4650 of 2023, went one step ahead to\n\n         allege that the survey intends only to rebuild a society on the\n\n         principle of divide and rule, with an eye on vote bank politics. It\n\n         is pointed out that the data collected cannot be verified, is not\n\n         conclusive and there is absolutely no authenticity attached to the\n\n         same. It is specifically pointed out that the measure of\n\n         enumeration from the head of the family and the people of the\n\n         locality gives credibility to hearsay information. The preamble\n\n         of the Constitution is read out to contend that it condemns the\n\n         caste system and the State intends to perpetuate what the\n\n         constitution framers intended to efface.\n\n         THE STATE IN SUPPORT OF THE SURVEY :-\n\n                     14. Learned Advocate General commenced his\n\n         arguments with the statement that everyone should realize that\n\n         we have not yet attained the ideal goal of equality for all and an\n\n         egalitarian society is still a mirage. It is to achieve that, the State\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         22/101\n\n\n\n\n         strives, for which the exercise of a caste survey was initiated;\n\n         challenged on personal predilections and vested interests. It is\n\n         asserted that the purpose is very clear and it is the upliftment of\n\n         the downtrodden and the marginalized for which the State has\n\n         ample powers to conduct a survey of the nature now proposed;\n\n         that too with the sanction of the entire legislature. The\n\n         arguments raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners, of\n\n         the State having no competence to proceed on the exercise of a\n\n         survey and the violation of their right to privacy have no legal\n\n         framework and are mere assumptions, presumptions and\n\n         hypothesis. It is submitted that the law has to be applied on facts\n\n         and there is no material produced by the petitioners to\n\n         demonstrate a compulsion or coercion to disclose details, in the\n\n         survey carried out. It is pointed out that 80% of the survey is\n\n         over and there is not even one instance of an objection from the\n\n         subjects of survey, regarding the disclosure of the details,\n\n         including      that     of    caste.     The   notifications   and   the\n\n         communications are misread and the argument of a compulsion\n\n         having been exercised by the State is misleading, especially\n\n         when there is no consequence for non-disclosure. It is\n\n         emphatically urged that the writ petition is not based on any\n\n         empirical data; especially in a public interest litigation where\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         23/101\n\n\n\n\n         there is an onerous duty on the petitioners to disclose materials\n\n         to substantiate the arbitrariness or illegality alleged and the\n\n         consequential public interest involved, so as to invoke the extra-\n\n         ordinary remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226.</a>\n\n                     15. Dwelling upon the argument of the petitioners that\n\n         there is no legislative power in the State, which is denuded by\n\n         Entry 69 and Entry 94 of List I of the Seventh Schedule; it is\n\n         contended that the source of power to legislate does not flow\n\n         from the Entries in the three lists, which are mere fields of\n\n         legislation, and it is sourced from <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 246</a> of the Constitution\n\n         of India. Even according to the petitioners, the census carried\n\n         out by the Central Government in 2011 was neither under Entry\n\n         69 nor under the <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_13\">Census Act</a> and it was by an executive fiat\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 73</a> of the Constitution of India. If that be so, it is\n\n         pointed out that Entry 45 in List III, akin to Entry 94 of List-I,\n\n         confers power on the State to collect statistics for the purpose of\n\n         verification of details, to achieve the goal under Entry 20 of List\n\n         III. The exercise cannot at all be construed as a Census under\n\n         Entry 69 of List I and the State has the power to proceed under\n\n         the aforesaid Entries in List III.\n\n                     16. It is argued that while broad submissions are made\n\n         about infringement of privacy, it is not stated as to disclosure of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         24/101\n\n\n\n\n         which information leads to such infringement of a right\n\n         protected under Part-III of the Constitution. It is also argued that\n\n         the information sought for by the State is already in the public\n\n         domain by way of declarations made by the very same citizens\n\n         and when there is no provision for mandatory disclosure or a\n\n         consequence on failure so to do; it can only be implied as a\n\n         voluntary disclosure. It is argued that both the decisions cited,\n\n         K.S. Puttaswamy I and Aadhaar are cited out of context and the\n\n         challenge upheld in the latter, was only with respect to very\n\n         personal details sought for, of biometrics and iris identification.\n\n                     17. It is submitted that caste is by birth and is not by\n\n         way of choice of an individual. There is neither infringement of\n\n         privacy nor lack of competence on the State to carry out an\n\n         enumeration of the details as attempted under the caste survey,\n\n         for which heavy reliance is placed on Indra Sawhney. It is\n\n         pointed out that the State had been waiting for the disclosure of\n\n         the information collected by the Central Government under the\n\n         2011 Census which, unfortunately, has not materialized. It was\n\n         in this circumstance that the State Legislature unanimously\n\n         decided on the caste survey to further the goal as declared by the\n\n         Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney. The dictionary\n\n         meaning of &#x27;census&#x27; and &#x27;survey&#x27; are not relevant in the context\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         25/101\n\n\n\n\n         of the specific power conferred on the State under <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 246</a>\n\n         and the Entries in the concurrent list. The State sources its\n\n         power also from <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_17\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_18\">16</a> and the learned\n\n         Advocate General points out that now there is a further category\n\n         added by way of extremely weaker sections, identification of\n\n         which section can only happen by collection of data. The\n\n         exercise is intended at fulfilling the constitutional ideals and is\n\n         not merely intended for an affirmative action. The State by the\n\n         aforesaid exercise does not intend to, nor has the power to\n\n         include or exclude castes from the Schedules under the\n\n         Constitution. Other than affirmative action, there are many\n\n         welfare schemes which are formulated by the State for the\n\n         upliftment of those backward class communities identified in\n\n         the survey. The aim and objective is the collection of data for\n\n         the purpose of future use by the Welfare State; by inviting\n\n         recommendations from the various Commissions constituted or\n\n         an informed analysis made by the State Government itself.\n\n                     18. The learned Advocate General pointed out that\n\n         affirmative action is a dynamic concept and since upliftment of\n\n         the backward communities is what the Constitution ordains,\n\n         necessarily, there should be empirical data before the State, to\n\n         include those communities which require a helping hand as also\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         26/101\n\n\n\n\n         affirmative action. Even certain communities which have been\n\n         enjoying reservation for long could be considered for exclusion,\n\n         if the general social, educational &amp; fiscal conditions with\n\n         respect to such communities have improved over the years. It is\n\n         pointed out that in Bihar, prior to the judgment in Indra\n\n         Sawhney, Mungerilal Commission was appointed. Later to the\n\n         decision in Indra Sawhney, the Backward Commission Act\n\n         came into force and the Bihar Reservation Act, 1991 was\n\n         promulgated. For better dissemination of welfare measures, the\n\n         State has to collect data and it is not the Commission&#x27;s duty to\n\n         collect such data. The Backward Commissions Act and the\n\n         provisions thereof, especially, the functions of the Commission\n\n         are pointed out to urge that a Commission appointed could only\n\n         make recommendations based on the data produced before it;\n\n         for which purpose the State machinery has to be employed. This\n\n         is the exercise now attempted by the State which is only to\n\n         attain the constitutional goal of removing inequality and\n\n         bringing in equality and thus pave the path to an egalitarian\n\n         society.\n\n                     19. It is pointed out that the details sought for by the\n\n         State in its survey especially the three aspects of religion, caste\n\n         and income on which specific objection has been raised by the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         27/101\n\n\n\n\n         petitioners cannot be construed to be an integral personal aspect\n\n         of an independent nature, the disclosure of which will be an\n\n         infringement of his or her privacy. It is reiterated that there is no\n\n         compulsion on the individual to disclose any details and it can\n\n         be demonstrated that it is only a voluntary disclosure that is\n\n         attempted by the State. The learned Advocate General takes us\n\n         through the material supplied to the enumerators to impress\n\n         upon us the voluntary nature of disclosures by individuals. It is\n\n         pointed out that there is a four-stage hierarchy created for the\n\n         purpose of the survey with the enumerator at the grass root level\n\n         and the Supervisor, the Charge Officer and the Nodal Officer in\n\n         the ascending positions of hierarchy. There is absolutely no\n\n         substance in the contention that the aspects disclosed by the\n\n         head of the family would not be at the option of the various\n\n         individuals comprising the family. It is pointed out that the head\n\n         of the family, as the survey defines, is not the eldest one or the\n\n         one who brings income to the family and is the person who is\n\n         given the position of respect in the family and handles the day-\n\n         to-day affairs of the family. It is also pointed out that there is no\n\n         gender specification and either a male member or female\n\n         member of the family can give the details to the enumerator.\n\n         The hierarchical officers ensure that any clarification can be\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         28/101\n\n\n\n\n         obtained by the enumerator immediately and rectified. The\n\n         details supplied by the head of the family or those not within the\n\n         knowledge of an individual; if collected from other sources, are\n\n         put to the individual before it is recorded. It is also pointed out\n\n         that despite the petitioners having pointed out a provision which\n\n         speaks of prescribed action in case of failure to disclose the\n\n         details; there is no such prescription made. The ground of\n\n         coercion and mandatory disclosure, is only on a truncated\n\n         reading of the various documents. Even the income disclosure is\n\n         not the exact income received by an individual and the details\n\n         collected is only of the range in which an individual has income\n\n         from various sources. In the event of there being no definite\n\n         income, it is also stipulated that an estimated income based on\n\n         the professional activity carried on, can be recorded. It is\n\n         pointed out that what is intended is only the collection of\n\n         approximate        estimations,      which   though   not   absolutely\n\n         verifiable, however, would provide the State with a platform and\n\n         enable it to decide upon the socio-economic status of families\n\n         and thereby the communities/castes to which they belong.\n\n                     20. As to the competence, the learned Advocate\n\n         General specifically refers to the distinction as discernible from\n\n         the words employed in Clauses (3) and (4) of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 16</a> and the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         29/101\n\n\n\n\n         authoritative pronouncement in Indra Sawhney. It is pointed\n\n         out that Indra Sawhney had asserted the power of the State to\n\n         make laws which, looking at the definition of &#x27;State&#x27; and &#x27;laws&#x27;\n\n         as available in the Constitution was held to be including even\n\n         orders, rules, regulations and notifications. The 72nd and 73rd\n\n         amendment giving a Constitutional status to the local self-\n\n         government institutions and providing for reservation to such\n\n         local bodies were specifically pointed out. To satisfy the\n\n         Constitutional goal of providing equal opportunities to the\n\n         backward and unrepresented communities to be represented in\n\n         the local self government, the contemporaneous empirical data\n\n         about such communities assume relevance. K. Krishna Murthy\n\n         (Dr.) v. Union of India; (2010) 7 SCC 202 is relied on to\n\n         contend that the collection of data is not the duty of the\n\n         Commission and it is for the State to collect such data and\n\n         provide it to the Commission for the purpose of making\n\n         recommendations. Vikas Kishanrao Gawali v. State of\n\n         Maharashtra; (2021) 6 SCC 73 was also relied upon to urge\n\n         that collecting adequate materials and documents to identify\n\n         Backward Classes for the purpose of reservation by conducting\n\n         a contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature\n\n         and implications of backwardness in the local areas concerned is\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n                                         30/101\n\n\n\n\n         the foremost requirement. Reliance was also placed on M.\n\n         Nagaraj v. Union of India; (2006) 8 SCC 212.\n\n                     21. <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_20\">The Collection of Statistics Act, 2008</a> was\n\n         specifically referred to and the provisions therein to contend that\n\n         the caste survey initiated by the State of Bihar is perfectly\n\n         within the scope and ambit of that Act. The prohibition in\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3 (a)</a> is only with respect to any matter falling under any\n\n         of the entries specified in List-I in the Seventh Schedule to the\n\n         Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(c)</a> on the other hand, restricts the Central\n\n         Government from issuing any directions for collection of such\n\n         statistics which are being collected by the State Government or\n\n         Union Territories on the basis of prior directions issued by such\n\n         Governments. <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 32</a> of the Act of 2008 is also emphatically\n\n         pointed out to assert the power of the State to conduct a census\n\n         or survey as defined under the definition clause of Statistical\n\n         Survey [<a href=\"/doc/1566345/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(g)</a>], despite it being inconsistent with any\n\n         other law for the time being in force.\n\n                     22.

From the counter affidavit, the tedious task of\n\n         preparation of caste list prior to the decision made by the\n\n         Cabinet, the purpose for which it was initiated and the data\n\n         security ensured were specifically referred to.

It was after considerable time that the petitioners\n\n         had approached the High Court and that too after the exercise\n\n         had proceeded to a considerable extent. The two stages as\n\n         contemplated was specifically pointed out which ensured the\n\n         collection of data extensively, precisely and without any\n\n         coercion exercised on the subjects of the survey.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"197038546\" id=\"span_2\">23.

The\n\n         caste survey as planned and implemented by the Bihar State\n\n         looks at the larger public good and is an endeavor to further\n\n         public interest and cannot at all be termed as a political gimmick\n\n         furthering vested interests. It is prayed that the actions of the\n\n         State may not be invalidated merely on individual perceptions,\n\n         especially when the exercise is sanctioned by the Constitution;\n\n         precisely Articles-14, 15, 16, 243-D, 243-T and Article-246 read\n\n         with entries 20, 23, 24 and 45 of List-III.

The learned Senior Counsel would\n\n         specifically point out that eye-brows are raised only because of\n\n         there being a caste enumeration; which, the objectors fail to\n\n         realize, is a reality and reflected in every fabric of the society.\n\n         The learned Senior Counsel would also specifically point out\n\n         that there is no concern of privacy since the citizens have come\n\n         forward voluntarily to disclose the details under the seventeen\n\n         enumerated heads. When there is abject poverty, as is indicated\n\n         from the lowest per capita income in the State of Bihar, there is\n\n         a requirement for enumeration of the backward communities\n\n         and castes to further the reservation process and bring\n\n         development within the State and also to its citizens, especially\n\n         when the statistics now available upon which the 1991\n\n         Reservation Act came into force are outlandish and obsolete. It\n\n         is pointed out that of the 215 castes enumerated in the survey,\n\n         only ten are now represented in the local bodies and the\n\n         objections against the enumeration reveals the undercurrent of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         35/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         paranoia displayed by the communities holding hegemony over\n\n         every aspect of political and social life within the State.\n\n         Reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/141126788/\" id=\"a_29\">S.R.

It is also\n\n         pointed out from the Collection of Statistics Rules, 2011 that\n\n         Rule 5(5) makes it mandatory inter alia to disclose subject and\n\n         purpose of collection of statistics which is not evident in the\n\n         present exercise, at least in the initial stage of the notification;\n\n         bringing forth to the public the intention of the Cabinet to carry\n\n         out a caste survey.

It was found that two\n\n         earlier writ petitions filed on similar lines were closed on the\n\n         submission of the learned Advocate General that the\n\n         supplementary budget stands presented and passed by the\n\n         Legislative Assembly of Bihar. It was observed that one of the\n\n         earlier writ petitions was filed by the very same Advocate who\n\n         has filed CWJC No. 4624 of 2023, which is one of the writ\n\n         petitions considered herein, in which there was no specific\n\n         contention challenging or doubting the veracity of the\n\n         submission made by the then Advocate General.

Viewed in that perspective of the wider\n\n         definition of State in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 12</a>, it was held that it is not\n\n         reasonable, possible and practical to say that the Parliament or\n\n         Legislature of the State itself, should provide for reservation of\n\n         post/appointments in the services of all such bodies, besides\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                         44/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         providing for reservation in services under the Central/State\n\n         Government. Reading the definition of State along with <a href=\"/doc/15421639/\" id=\"a_75\">Article\n\n         13(3)(a);</a> the definition of &#x27;law&#x27;, it was held that a &#x27;provision&#x27; as\n\n         contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 16(4)</a> can be provided not only by\n\n         the Parliament or Legislature but also by the Executive in\n\n         respect of Central/State services and by the local bodies and\n\n         other authorities coming within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 12;</a> in\n\n         respect of their respective services. We are conscious of the fact\n\n         that the said declarations on the ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 16</a>\n\n         was specifically on the power conferred with respect to\n\n         affirmative actions by every entity coming under the definition\n\n         of State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                     34. If such affirmative action is permitted by all such\n\n         entities coming within the definition of State, then as a corollary\n\n         it has to be held that the decision-making process, in so far as\n\n         bringing forth such affirmative actions, would include the\n\n         identification of socially and educationally backward classes\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 15</a> and backward classes under <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 16.</a> It was\n\n         so held in Indra Sawhney, Paragraph 736-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                               &quot;...

If\n                     the executive includes, for collateral reasons,\n                     groups or classes not satisfying the relevant\n                     criteria, it would be a clear case of fraud on\n                     power.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">                     35. The above extract answers the question raised in\n\n         Paragraph 736, in so far as the possibility of abuse of power by\n\n         the political executive; the adequate safeguard against which\n\n         misuse was found in <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 16(4)</a> itself. Hence, before an\n\n         affirmative action is taken by the State, there should be\n\n         satisfaction of the relevant criteria by which the backwardness\n\n         can be defined and for that purpose the social standing of the\n\n         groups or communities which take in various factors; like the\n\n         social capital as also the financial &amp; educational capacity of the\n\n         members of such communities, has to be ascertained. The\n\n         ascertainment of social capital would include representation in\n\n         the various administrative services, legislative &amp; governing\n\n         bodies, enrollment in educational institutions and the general\n\n         living standards and so on, as prevalent among the members of\n\n         the various communities within a local area. Hence, when\n\n         affirmative action can be provided by the various entities\n\n         coming under the definition of State, the executive branch of the\n\n         Government who also has been conferred with the power to\n\n         bring in such affirmative actions; can adopt such measures for\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                         46/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         better understanding the living conditions, social, economic and\n\n         educational status of the various communities, existing within\n\n         its boundaries. For the State Governments to take up the cause\n\n         of backward communities, as a welfare state is wont to do, there\n\n         should be collection of empirical data, on which would be based\n\n         the affirmative actions and the various schemes and projects to\n\n         uplift the marginalized masses and bring them to the\n\n         mainstream.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">                     36.

The State Government&#x27;s power to determine the\n\n         extent of such reservation on the basis of empirical data such as\n\n         population surveys was clearly emphasized; the guiding\n\n         principle being the principle of &#x27;proportionate representation&#x27;.\n\n         The rotational policy envisaged under the two provisions was\n\n         also held to be a safeguard against the possibility of a particular\n\n         office being reserved in perpetuity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                     40.

The need for contemporaneous\n\n         empirical inquiry to identify the quantum of reservation qua\n\n         local bodies was emphasized and this is the task which the State\n\n         is embarking upon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                     42. While the three-pronged test as stated herein\n\n         above speaks of a dedicated Commission to conduct an\n\n         empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of\n\n         backwardness, it has to be pertinently observed that Indra\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                         54/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         Sawhney emphasized that the appointment of Commissions is\n\n         not the only procedure, method or approach to be adopted in\n\n         identification of backwardness and there is no such thing as a\n\n         standard or model procedure/approach. It was declared that &#x27;It\n\n         is for the authority (appointed to identify) to adopt such\n\n         approach and procedure as it thinks appropriate, and so long as\n\n         the approach adopted by it is fair and adequate, the Court has\n\n         no say in the matter&#x27; (sic para 783). It is also emphatically\n\n         stated that &#x27;...if a Commission or Authority begins the process\n\n         of identification, with castes (among Hindus) and occupational\n\n         groupings among others, it cannot by that reason alone be said\n\n         to be constitutionally or legally bad&#x27; (sic para 783). Hence, not\n\n         only qua local bodies, for identifying backwardness; for the\n\n         purpose of affirmative action or schemes or projects to ensure\n\n         their upliftment as also providing adequate representation in\n\n         governance there can be a method adopted, a reasonable method\n\n         and procedure, for the purpose of identifying the backwardness\n\n         in society, which could also be on the basis of caste.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                     43. We have also looked at the various statutes\n\n         produced in C.W.J.C. No.4624 of 2023 for the constitution of\n\n         Commissions for Backward Classes. The functions of the\n\n         Commissions as seen from the statutes are more or less the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                         55/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         same. We specifically look at the Bihar State Commission for\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/637725/\" id=\"a_118\">Backward Classes Act, 1993</a>, wherein the function of the\n\n         Commission is to examine requests for inclusion of any class of\n\n         citizens as a backward class in the list and hear complaints of\n\n         over inclusion or under inclusion of any Backward Class in this\n\n         list and tender such advice to the State Government as it seems\n\n         appropriate. The advice of the Commission is also declared to\n\n         be ordinarily binding on the State Government. It would be\n\n         futile to expect the Commission to carry out the collection of\n\n         empirical data and it cannot be said that the request of inclusion\n\n         or exclusion of any class can only come from individuals or\n\n         representatives of such backward classes or groups. The Welfare\n\n         State having appointed the Commission should also further the\n\n         object of upliftment of such backward communities and the\n\n         State cannot be a mute spectator, waiting to put its imprimatur\n\n         on the recommendations of the Commission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                     44. If the State machinery is put to use for collecting\n\n         empirical data, which we have found is possible and\n\n         constitutionally permissible, the appointment of a Commission\n\n         or the power to such appointment of Commissions cannot\n\n         deprive the State from carrying out a survey, for collecting\n\n         empirical data, aimed at identifying backwardness to further the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                         56/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         cause of backward communities including the Scheduled Castes\n\n         and Scheduled Tribes. We specifically notice that the Karnataka\n\n         State had brought in an amendment by way of <a href=\"/doc/13228711/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 9</a> to\n\n         conduct survey of social and educational status of the citizens of\n\n         India and to identify the socially and educationally backward\n\n         classes for the purpose of recommendation to the State\n\n         Government, of necessary measures. If the State had the\n\n         legislative power to carry out such an exercise, then necessarily,\n\n         the Executive Government could also bring out notifications\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 162</a> of the Constitution, when there is no\n\n         legislation existing on that count, either of the Parliament or the\n\n         State Legislature; when the matter is one which comes within\n\n         List III of the Seventh Schedule under the Constitution. The\n\n         appointment of a Commission is one of the modes for\n\n         identifying backward communities and the collection of\n\n         empirical data by the Government is only furthering the process\n\n         of upliftment of the backward communities; which data\n\n         collected could also be placed before the Commission for an\n\n         independent recommendation as to inclusion and exclusion of\n\n         various communities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">                     45.

The objection raised, which another Division\n\n         Bench (authored by myself) upheld on a prima facie\n\n         consideration at the interim stage, was also of the generic\n\n         meanings assigned to census and survey. It was the petitioners&#x27;\n\n         contention that what the State attempts is a census under the\n\n         garb of a survey, which is a legislative power clearly conferred\n\n         on the Union Parliament as per Entry 69 of List-I of the Seventh\n\n         Schedule. Much was also argued of the nomenclature under\n\n         which the survey was published; being Caste Survey, having\n\n         disclosed the surreptitious, nefarious political game of the\n\n         Executive Government to identify the caste equations in the\n\n         State so as to hatch political alliances and even carry out\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                         58/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         delimitation of constituencies. We have to immediately notice\n\n         the caution expressed in Indra Sawhney so far as the power\n\n         conceded to even the executive arm of the State Government as\n\n         also the various entities coming under the definition of State to\n\n         carry out an affirmative action within its services. The mere\n\n         possibility of an abuse of power cannot lead to restriction of a\n\n         provision in the Constitution, curtailing its full effect and\n\n         reducing its fullest amplitude. As has been held, the action of\n\n         the State should be informed with reason and an objective\n\n         satisfaction of the relevant criteria; which stage we have not yet\n\n         reached. The attempt of the petitioners is to say that the State\n\n         cannot collect such data in which case the power conceded to\n\n         the State Legislature and its executive arm, to give the fullest\n\n         effect to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_121\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_122\">16</a> would be curtailed\n\n         and frustrated. We are unable to accept the contention of the\n\n         petitioners that the State Legislature is devoid of the power to\n\n         attempt a survey in the manner in which it has now been\n\n         attempted for reason of only of lack of competence. When the\n\n         power of the Legislature and the Executive Government is clear\n\n         from the Constitution, there is no purpose in looking at the\n\n         generic definitions of the term and solely on that ground, set\n\n         aside an action of the Government which is otherwise valid\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                         59/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         under the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                     47. It has been noticed in the interim order that\n\n         census, as the term is generically defined, gives forth the\n\n         connotation of accurate facts and verifiable details while a\n\n         survey brings forth only abstract opinions and perceptions of the\n\n         subjects of the survey. We have to notice that the State\n\n         Government in collecting the data, especially in finding out the\n\n         social, educational and financial situation of the various\n\n         communities within the State is not looking at exactitude nor\n\n         can mathematical precision be the norm in such data collection\n\n         from the entire citizenry within a State. In fact, no affirmative\n\n         action or a beneficial legislation or schemes and measures to\n\n         uplift the backward community can be made if there has to be\n\n         collection of exact data. As has been rightly pointed out by the\n\n         learned Advocate General, what is intended by the survey is\n\n         collection of broad estimates based on which the State can\n\n         initiate legislative action and implement beneficial schemes\n\n         even by an executive fiat so as to ensure the development of the\n\n         backward communities within its State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">                     48.

It is, however, clear\n\n         that a census under the <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_124\">Census Act, 1948</a> can only be carried out\n\n         by the Central Government wherein even the staff of the local\n\n         authorities have to be made available to carry on the nitty gritty\n\n         of interphase with the citizens and collection of data. The\n\n         mandate of an active cooperation of the State Government is\n\n         also very clear from <a href=\"/doc/1420029/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 7</a>, wherein the District Magistrate\n\n         or such authority as the State Government appoints in this\n\n         behalf, being empowered to call upon any person within the\n\n         State to give such assistance as has been specified in the order,\n\n         towards the taking of a census of the persons, who are at the\n\n         time of such census, occupying their lands or working in their\n\n         premises or residing within the areas in which local authorities\n\n         are established.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                     49. The question is as to whether Entry 69 prohibits\n\n         any survey to be conducted which could also result in\n\n         enumeration of details that could be collected under the <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_126\">Census\n\n         Act, 1948</a>. In this context, we have to specifically notice the\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_127\">Collection of Statistics Act, 2008</a> brought in by the Union\n\n         Parliament which specifically defines statistical survey as a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                         61/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         &#x27;census&#x27; or a &#x27;survey&#x27;, whereby information is collected from all\n\n         the informants in the field of inquiry or from a sample thereof,\n\n         by an appropriate authority under the Act. The word &#x27;census&#x27;\n\n         and &#x27;survey&#x27; have been used interchangeably with reference to\n\n         appropriate governments of the Union, State or Union\n\n         Territories, making it very clear that the inclusion of &#x27;census&#x27;\n\n         under Entry 69, does not prohibit any State Government from\n\n         collecting live data, as collected in a census, for the purpose of\n\n         implementing welfare schemes within the State and also\n\n         carrying out affirmative action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">                     50. We need not dwell upon the source of power from\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_128\">Collection of Statistics Act</a>, since we have otherwise found\n\n         competence on the State. Though there is a gazette notification,\n\n         it does not speak of sourcing the power from that Act. The\n\n         learned Advocate General pointed out that even if the source of\n\n         power is not specified in the notification, if the State is\n\n         conceded such power under an enactment, the Court cannot set\n\n         it aside only for reason of the source having not been referred to\n\n         in the notification. We are quite conscious of the said principle,\n\n         but we notice that a notification under the <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_129\">Collection of\n\n         Statistics Act</a> requires certain details to be provided, as is\n\n         mandated under Rule 5 of the Collection of Statistics Rules,\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                         62/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         2011. Rule 5(5) of the Rules of 2011 specify that a notification\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 3</a> of the Act shall contain inter-alia the subject\n\n         and purpose for collection of statistics and the obligation of the\n\n         informant which definitely is not available in the notification.\n\n         We hasten to add that we are not dealing with the contention of\n\n         there being no legitimate aim for the attempted survey, at this\n\n         stage, and we only notice the absence of the purpose for\n\n         collection of statistics, in the notification, which is a mandate\n\n         under the Rules of 2011. The State could have proceeded under\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_131\">Collection of Statistics Act</a>; under the proviso (c) to <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_132\">Section\n\n         3</a> or based on the authority we found earlier from the various\n\n         constitutional provisions, to carry out a survey of the instant\n\n         nature; both of which could be treated as valid. Proviso (a) to\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 3</a> prohibits a State Government or Union Territory\n\n         Administration from issuing any direction with respect to\n\n         collection of statistics relating to any matter falling under any of\n\n         the entries specified in List 1 of the Seventh Schedule of the\n\n         Constitution. Proviso (b) also prohibits any State Government or\n\n         Union Territory Administration from issuing any direction\n\n         similar to that issued by the Central Government, till the\n\n         collection of statistics by the Central Government is completed.\n\n         Proviso (c) likewise restrains the Central Government from\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                         63/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         issuing any similar direction, when a State Government or\n\n         Union Territory Administration has issued a direction under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/84306/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 3</a> for the collection of statistics relating to any matter.\n\n         Collection of statistics is hence a power conferred on the Union,\n\n         States and the Union Territories. The blanket prohibition is only\n\n         insofar as the States and U.Ts being disabled to carry out a\n\n         survey with respect to matters in List I and even otherwise,\n\n         when the Central Government is in the process of collecting any\n\n         statistics. With respect to matters not included under List I, the\n\n         prohibition applies equally, depending on who; whether the\n\n         Centre or the State having first initiated the process. We notice\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/1501815/\" id=\"a_135\">Collection of Statistics Act</a> only to emphasize that the\n\n         inclusion of Census under Entry 69 of List I does not restrict a\n\n         survey of the very same details that could be collected under the\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/774283/\" id=\"a_136\">Census Act</a>, unless it is with reference to any matter under List I\n\n         or of such statistics which the Centre is in the process of\n\n         collecting.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">                     51.

Coming back to the question of\n                         identification, the fact remains that one has to\n                         begin somewhere -- with some group, class\n                         or section. There is no set or recognised\n                         method. There is no law or other statutory\n                         instrument prescribing the methodology. The\n                         ultimate idea is to survey the entire populace.\n                         If so, one can well begin with castes, which\n                         represent     explicit     identifiable   social\n                         classes/groupings, more particularly when\n                         <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 16(4)</a> seeks to ameliorate social\n                         backwardness. What is unconstitutional with\n                         it, more so when caste, occupation poverty\n                         and social backwardness are so closely\n                         intertwined in our society? [Individual survey\n                         is out of question, since <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 16(4)</a> speaks\n                         of class protection and not individual\n                         protection]. This does not mean that one can\n                         wind up the process of identification with the\n                         castes. Besides castes (whether found among\n                         Hindus or others) there may be other\n                         communities,        groups,      classes    and\n                         denominations which may qualify as\n                         backward class of citizens. For example, in a\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                         76/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n                         particular State, Muslim community as a\n                         whole may be found socially backward. (As a\n                         matter of fact, they are so treated in the State\n                         of Karnataka as well as in the State of Kerala\n                         by their respective State Governments).\n                         Similarly, certain sections and denominations\n                         among Christians in Kerala who were\n                         included among backward communities\n                         notified in the former princely State of\n                         Travancore as far back as in 1935 may also\n                         be surveyed and so on and so forth.

Caste has been found to be an important indicator to\n\n         understand backwardness since historically the deprivations\n\n         visited on communities were based on their caste names. The\n\n         constitutional goal we see from the aforesaid discussions is not\n\n         intended at effacing caste but aimed at erasing once and for all,\n\n         discrimination       based      on    caste.   The   mere   unfortunate\n\n         circumstance of birth within one caste cannot lead to a man or\n\n         woman being excluded from the privileges and benefits enjoyed\n\n         by the other members of society and when it becomes the\n\n         accepted normal &amp; the general norm, then there can be no claim\n\n         of equality within the society. It is hence, the Constitution\n\n         framers felt that <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_159\">16</a> which ensures prohibition of\n\n         discrimination on grounds inter alia of caste and assures\n\n         equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, should\n\n         be impelled with a condition to uplift the marginalized sections\n\n         of society and bring them at par with the privileged class, who\n\n         have equal representation in administration, governance,\n\n         educational institutions and every facet of quality social\n\n         existence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                     65.

The\n\n         impecunious circumstances or the educational backwardness of\n\n         an individual cannot be rectified by the protections under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_162\">Articles 15</a> <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_163\">&amp; 16.</a> It is hence, the emphasis on un-equals not\n\n         being treated equally and those suffering deprivations, as a\n\n         group or class, having been conferred with special privileges\n\n         and benefits to uplift them and to provide them with a quality of\n\n         life at par with any other, opening up the opportunities equally\n\n         to them and thus, bringing in dignity of life to every member of\n\n         the community, at par with others in the larger society. This is\n\n         not to be dismissed as a futile search for the pot of gold, at the\n\n         end of a rainbow or a useless pursuit of a mirage; but it is the\n\n         path to attainment of an egalitarian society, which is the\n\n         Constitutional goal, which every State and its instrumentalities\n\n         should endeavor to achieve and realize and so is a duty cast on\n\n         the citizens at large.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">         VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE &amp; PRIVACY : -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">                     66. It is true that there is nothing stated in the\n\n         notification as to the disclosure being voluntary, however, it has\n\n         to be noticed that, admittedly, 80% of the survey is over and not\n\n         even one instance has come forth where a complaint was raised\n\n         of coercion to divulge the details sought for in the survey.

As has been argued, there is no element of\n\n         coercion discernible from the various notifications issued or the\n\n         guidelines brought out to guide the process of enumeration.\n\n         Looking at the 17 heads under which the collection of data is\n\n         attempted, it cannot be disputed, that they bring forth the social,\n\n         economic and educational situation in which the individual\n\n         families exist and the identification of the caste of such families\n\n         enable identification of the classes or groups based on caste\n\n         identity, which are backward. We again emphasize the caution\n\n         expressed by Indra Sawhney that the protection offered under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_165\">16</a> is to a class/group and not individual oriented.\n\n         In collecting the data as provided under the 17 heads, it is also\n\n         evident that the occupational groups also could be identified as\n\n         per the details collected in the survey.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                     67.

The State in its counter affidavit also\n\n         speaks of having had discussions with the various Commissions\n\n         appointed by the State for the different classes and groups and\n\n         the identification of castes or groups were done based on the\n\n         recommendations of the respective Commissions; which were\n\n         also put through the district administration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">                     68.

Informational privacy is the aspect on which there\n\n         was an emphasis by the learned counsel for the petitioners. As is\n\n         discernible from the above extracts, there are certain aspects of\n\n         personal information, which fall under the phrase &#x27;none of your\n\n         business&#x27;, meaning none other can seek such an information\n\n         mandatorily from the citizens; especially not the State which has\n\n         the might of its authority, which permeates to every Government\n\n         officer. In the present case, we have already found that there is\n\n         absolutely no coercion applied, neither is it discernible from any\n\n         of the guidelines put forth nor is there a single complaint made\n\n         regarding coercion to disclose the details. The data sought from\n\n         the subjects of the survey, the citizens within the State of Bihar,\n\n         are also details which are available in the public domain, but\n\n         still difficult to be extracted. It is for the purpose of identifying\n\n         the Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n\n         with the aim of uplifting them and ensuring equal opportunities\n\n         to them, not only by an affirmative action, but also in providing\n\n         employment, ensuring admission to educational institutions as\n\n         also representation in local bodies, and formulating schemes and\n\n         projects targeted at specific classes or groups, that the instant\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                         90/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         survey is carried out, is the contention of the State; which\n\n         cannot be brushed aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">                     73. It has been argued that wherever there is a\n\n         declaration sought of personal details like religion, caste and\n\n         income, there is a benefit conferred on the citizen. In the caste\n\n         survey also, there is a definite privilege sought to be conferred\n\n         on the individuals, who are eventually identified to be belonging\n\n         to the backward communities, by way of preferential action of\n\n         the State targeted at the specified class/group. Though the caste\n\n         survey and collection of data would not by itself confer any\n\n         benefit on the citizen, the statistics which are collated could be\n\n         placed before the various statutory Commissions, which would\n\n         result in recommendations, definitely inuring to the benefit of\n\n         the individuals in the identified classes/groups when schemes\n\n         and projects are formulated for their upliftment. We cannot, but\n\n         reiterate with emphasis that there can be no coercion found and\n\n         there is no complaint of such a coercion having been applied by\n\n         the Government officers in getting the details from the citizens;\n\n         especially when 80% of the work of collecting data is said to be\n\n         over. We have also seen the survey of the National Health\n\n         Mission which also seek the specific details as sought for in the\n\n         instant survey.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                         91/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                     74.

We cannot find such a mandatory pressure applied on\n\n         the subjects of survey merely for reason of the Aadhaar details\n\n         being made optional and specified so in the format of survey;\n\n         which definitely is to ensure that there is no violation of the\n\n         principles of right to privacy, as <a href=\"/doc/377237/\" id=\"a_174\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n         Supreme Court.

India has\n\n         many instances of persons belonging to the same caste\n\n         practicing different religions and despite the religions other than\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5542 of 2023 dt.01-08-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                         98/101</span>\n\n\n\n\n         the Hindu religion, not practicing caste system as such; those\n\n         converted groups, in the other communities also are conferred\n\n         with backward status and enabled privileges and benefits by the\n\n         State. The details sought for in the survey are not individual\n\n         centric and is not aimed at targeting an individual, which in the\n\n         context of the details collected from the head of the family; is\n\n         virtually impossible, as the law exists today.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">                     80.

The caste status sought\n\n         to be collated is not intended at taxing, branding, labeling or\n\n         ostracizing individuals or groups; but it is to identify the\n\n         economic, educational and other social aspects of different\n\n         communities/classes/groups, which require further action by the\n\n         State for its upliftment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">         SECURITY CONCERNS :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">                     81.
