Most people do not have\nthe money to purchase meat from other cities or other States and bring it to\nAhmedabad. Almost all meat-eaters get their meat from the local butcher shop in\nthe city, usually from a shop which is close to their residence. Hence, closure\nof the slaughter house, in substance, means compelling the non-vegetarians to\nbecome vegetarians for 9 days&quot;-- Supreme Court in Hinsa Virodhak Sangh&#x27;s case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">\tThese observations made by the Supreme Court will set the tone for these\njudgments.  In these batch of writ petitions the competing interests of shop-\nkeepers claiming right to sell fish and fowl in various wards within the limits\nof the town panchayat with conditions of licence and the desire of the town\npanchayat to relocate them to its shopping area located outside its limits are\nclashing with each other.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\t2.The petitioners in these batch of writ petitions are all traders in\nselling in meat, poultry and fish within the Town Panchayat limits of\nSathankulam Selection Grade Town Panchayat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t3.In all these writ petitions, the petitioners were aggrieved by the\nnotices issued by the Town Panchayat by the Executive Officer of the Town\nPanchayat. The petitioners informed that the Town Panchayat in its meeting held\non 19.08.2008, passed a resolution No.277 by which the Town panchayat had\ndecided to shift all the meat shops to the newly constructed complex constructed\nby the Town Panchayat. It was the stand of the panchayat that the decision was\ntaken for maintaining the hygienic condition of the locality.  Pursuant to the\nresolution an advertisement was also put up and informed that the shops owners\nwere given notice since the notices were not complied with a final warning was\nissued by the impugned action of the town pancahyat stating that if they have\nnot removed their shops in which they were selling fish, meat and poultry and if\nthey do not remove the shops within 7 days and locate the shop into the newly\nbuilt shopping complex, necessary restraint action will be taken for the\npetitioners from continuing the public health hazard and further action will be\ntaken against the petitioners.  Aggrieved by the notices, the writ petitions\ncame to be filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\t4.Pending the writ petitions, this Court granted interim orders. On notice\nfrom this Court in some of the writ petitions, the first respondent Town\nPanchayat has filed counter affidavits, dated 28.11.2008. Since the issue\ninvolved in these writ petitions are identical, they were grouped together and a\ncommon order is passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t5.Mr.G.Prabhu Rajadurai, learned counsel for the petitioners contended\nthat the action initiated by the Panchayat was illegal and contrary to the\nprovisions of the Act.  No doubt, the petitioners have located their shop in a\nprivate campus but under the <a href=\"/doc/65273137/\" id=\"a_7\">Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act</a> on a\nlicence, they can carry on the trade of selling or storing for the purpose of\nsale of preservation of flesh and fish. Unless and until, any contravention of\nlicence conditions, the authorities cannot make an omnibus embargo on the\nselling sale of items and they are not contraband items. It is not the case of\nthe town panchayat that the petitioners were having activities akin to a\nslaughter house in which case, the local body is entitled to  indicate the area\nin which such activities can be located. In the present circumstance, there is\nno necessity for the petitioners to go to far off places for the purpose of\nselling flesh and fish as the case may be. It is also stated that the right of\nevery citizen to have a choice of his own to eat and consume and it should be\nmade available within a reasonable price and at a reasonable distance.\n</p>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t6.He further submitted that under the guise of imposing reasonable\nrestriction, the respondent town panchayat imposed fetters on the right to carry\non  trade. He further submitted that the allegations made in the counter\naffidavit that there were complaints from the general public especially from one\nself help group of women is concerned, there was no specific allegations made\nregarding contravention of licence conditions.  It was always open to the town\npanchayat to take appropriate action against the particular traders but that\ncannot be a rule to remove all the shop keepers from the existing places of\nbusiness. Therefore, the present resolution should not bar the petitioners from\nselling flesh and fish in the shops hired by them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">\t7.Mr.G.Prabhu Rajadurai further submitted that it was one thing to state\nthat henceforth no flesh or fish can be sold except in the market identified by\nthe town panchayat and that no licences will be given for selling such items in\nother places.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">\t8.For this purpose, the panchayat must take a reasonable decision. In\nparagraph 2 of the counter affidavit all that has been mentioned was relating to\nmeat vendors and not other items of sale ie., selling of poultry or fish within\nthe town panchayat limits. In any event, in the counter affidavit, there is no\nclarity in the stand of the respondents. Under the said circumstances, the\nlearned counsel stated that the omnibus resolution of the panchayat and\nconsequent action taken by the Executive Officer must be set aside by this\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\t9.The learned counsel placed reliance upon a decision of the Supreme Court\nin Ganpati Singhji Vs.State of Ajmer and another reported in AIR 1995 SC 188 to\ncontend that the right to hold a trade of his own land is a fundamental right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and it can be restricted only by the restriction provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 19(5).</a> Such reasonable restrictions can be made only in the\ninterest of general public. In the absence of the municipal law empowering the\ncouncil to impose a ban, no such power can be assumed by the municipal\nauthorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">\t10.The learned counsel also  placed reliance upon  <a href=\"/doc/55917484/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 269 (1)</a> of the\nTamil Nadu District Municipalities Act wherein it only prohibits unlicensed\nplaces to be used for selling or storing for the sale of preservation of flesh\nand fish. The other learned counsels for the petitioners M/s.G.Thalaimutharasu\nand M.P.Senthil adopted the same arguments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">\t11.Per contra, Mr.T.S.Mohammed Mohideen, learned Additional Government\nPleader contended that the town panchayat was entitled to establish private\nmarkets in respect of <a href=\"/doc/192235748/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 264</a> of the Act. In the absence of any licence for\na private market, no person can vend anything that he may chose. The council has\ngot full powers to decide the location for vending any substance in public\nplace. Under <a href=\"/doc/174151902/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 267</a> of the Act, the council has got power to close any\nprivate markets.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">\t12.The learned Additional Government Pleader further submitted that there\nis no dispute regarding  any private market. It was a trade by the individual in\nthe hired places/shops of their choice. It must be  stated that there is no\npower to carry on business without proper municipal licence. The action of the\nauthorities were based upon concrete materials received from the public. It was\nalso authorised by a resolution passed by the panchayat as early as on\n02.08.2006.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\t13.In the present case, there is no complaint that the petitioners were\nslaughtering any cattle in their shop premises. In which case, the fundamental\nright claimed by the petitioners cannot apply as the municipal law ultimately\nprohibits slaughter of animals for sale as food except within the licenced\npremises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\t14.The only question was whether either after slaughter of animal, the\nflesh can be sold by way of retail vending in a licenced premises that too not\nnecessarily in a public market established by the municipality and whether the\ntrade relating to the poultry in such shops can be carried on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">\t15.A reading of the counter affidavit filed in W.P.(MD)No.9883 of 2008,\ndated 28.11.2008 shows that the resolution related to only meat vendors. A copy\nof the resolution was not produced before this Court. Therefore, this Court has\nto proceed only on the basis of the averments made in the affidavit sworn to by\nthe Executive Officer. In the absence of the respondent town panchayat\nfurnishing the materials under which the decision was taken and also the\nprovisions under which the decision to shift the meat shops outside the town\npanchayat, this Court is not willing to decide the issue on the basis of the\nrival pleadings and assertions made at the bar with reference to the choice of\nfood and the fundamental right of the petitioners for carrying on their trade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\t16.There is no doubt true that the relevant municipal law namely the Tamil\nNadu Municipalities Act provides for a contingency with reference to the selling\nof flesh and fish and slaughter houses. No one can contend that they have an\nunrestricted right to carry on trade without a municipal licence. At the same\ntime, the council on their ipse dixit cannot refuse to grant licence on the\nbasis of unsubstantiated allegations or that a policy decision was taken by the\ncouncil. Ultimately, it is for the council to decide the issue depending upon\npublic health and the interest of  consumers who would like to purchase the food\nat a reasonable price and within a reasonable distance. But the right of the\ntraders which are subject to regulations and reasonable restrictions based upon\nthe Constitution and the municipal laws. Since the text of the resolution was\nnot produced and the petitioner alleges the resolution only related to meat\nshops, this Court was obliged to interfere with the impugned notices issued by\nthe town panchayat and to remit the matter for fresh disposal by the council. It\nmust take into account  the interests of the various traders and decide the\nquestion of permission to sell the flesh and fish in terms of proviso to <a href=\"/doc/55917484/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n269(1)</a> of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act. If any decision is taken\nthe same could be notified. But before taking a decision, the town panchayat\nmust take into account all relevant circumstances and must strictly act in terms\nof the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t17.In this context, it is necessary to refer to a judgment of the\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court  in Municipal Corporation of the City of\nAhmedabad and others Vs.Jan Mohammed Usmanbhai and another reported in (1986) 3\nSCC 20. In that case, the Supreme Court was dealing with the power of a\nMunicipal Corporation under <a href=\"/doc/61722966/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 466(1)(D)</a> of the Bombay Provincial Municipal\nCorporation Act, 1949 as well as the power of the Municipal Commissioner to\nimpose reasonable restriction in the matter of opening of slaughter houses and\nclosing down of shops on particular dates. In that context, the Supreme Court\nobserved that under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(6)</a> a law is protected which imposed in the\ninterest of general public reasonable restrictions on the right conferred under\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> But it was also stated that it is left to the Court in cases\nof a dispute to determine the reasonableness of the restriction imposed by the\nlaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">\t18.The Supreme Court further observed that while determining the question,\nthe Court cannot proceed on a general notion of what is reasonable in the\nabstract or even on a consideration of what is reasonable from the point of view\nof the person or persons on whom the restrictions are imposed. The right\nconferred under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(1)(g)</a>, will not become an absolute one and what the\nCourt has to do is to consider whether the restrictions imposed are reasonable\nin the interest of general public. The term &#x27;in the interests of general public&#x27;\nis wide import comprehending public order, public health, public security,\nmorals, economic welfare of the community and as well as the objects mentioned\nin Part IV of the Constitution. The very same judgment, also referred to the\nwisdom of the legislature in making a reasonable classification on the basis of\nthe usefulness to the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\t19.Subsequent to the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Quareshi&#x27;s\ncase, the Supreme Court had an occasion to consider a similar matter in its\njudgment in Hashmattullah Vs.State of Madhya Pradesh reported in 1996 (4) SCC\n391=AIR 1996 SC 2076 after referring to Quareshi&#x27;s case (cited supra), the\nSupreme Court in paragraph 15 held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t15.Three different Constitution Benches of this Court in Mohd. Hanif\ncase1, Abdul Hakim case2 and Mohd. Faruk case3 have held that total ban on\nslaughter of bulls and bullocks is ultra vires the Constitution. The submissions\nwhich have now been made and seem to have found favour with the High Court, with\nreference to the usefulness and merits of cattle dung and the part which it\nplays in the rural economy, has been dealt with at length by this Court in Mohd.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">Hanif case1. The right of the butchers to practise their trade has been upheld\nin these decisions and because there is a short supply of milch cattle, total\nban on their slaughter was upheld as being a reasonable restriction in the\ninterest of general public. But it was held in no uncertain terms that a total\nban on the slaughter of useless cattle, which involves a wasteful drain on the\nnation&#x27;s cattle fodder, which itself was in short supply and which would deprive\nthe useful cattle of much needed nourishment, could not be justified as being in\nthe interest of general public\n.....\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\t16......it was observed at p. 18 that the prescription of the age of 16\nyears could: (SCC p. 18, para 17)\n&quot;... be said to be reasonable, looking to the balance which has to be struck\nbetween public interest, which requires useful animals to be preserved and\npermitting the different appellants before us to carry on their trade and\nprofession&quot;.\t(emphasis added)\nThis Court, therefore, in Haji Usmanbhai case4 once again reiterated the\nprinciple of striking a balance between the right of the butchers and the public\ninterest&quot;.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\t20.However, the Supreme Court also struck a note of warning to the writ\nCourts to be careful in accepting about the datas to be accepted and relied upon\nif there were to be bona fide disputes between the parties regarding the\ncorrectness of the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"560071\" id=\"span_1\"><a href=\"/doc/560071/\" id=\"a_18\">21.In Hinsa Virodhak Sangh v. Mirzapur Moti Kuresh Jamat</a> reported in\n(2008) 5 SCC 33, the Supreme Court dealt with the decision of the Municipal\nauthorities decision to close down slaughterhouses and the right of the traders\nand consumers came to be considered. Though it dealt with temporary closure of\nslaughterhouses the decision travel beyond the issue raised and dealt with the\nright of competing interests and the people&#x27;s choice about their food\npreferences. Hence, it will be worthwhile to quote paragraph 27 and 72 from the\njudgment which are as follows:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t&quot;27.Had the impugned resolutions ordered closure of municipal\nslaughterhouses for a considerable period of time we may have held the impugned\nresolutions to be invalid being an excessive restriction on the rights of the\nbutchers of Ahmedabad who practise their profession of meat selling. After all,\nbutchers are practising a trade and it is their fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_19\">Article\n19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution which is guaranteed to all citizens of India.\nMoreover, it is not a matter of the proprietor of the butchery shop alone. There\nmay be also several workmen therein who may become unemployed if the\nslaughterhouses are closed for a considerable period of time, because one of the\nconditions of the licence given to the shop-owners is to supply meat regularly\nin the city of Ahmedabad and this supply comes from the municipal\nslaughterhouses of Ahmedabad. Also, a large number of people are non-vegetarian\nand they cannot be compelled to become vegetarian for a long period. What one\neats is one&#x27;s personal affair and it is a part of his right to privacy which is\nincluded in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution as held by several decisions of this\nCourt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_21\">R. Rajagopal v. State of T.N.7</a> (vide SCC para 26 : AIR para 28) this\nCourt held that the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and\nliberty guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">\t72. As already stated above, it is a short restriction for a few days and\nsurely the non-vegetarians can remain vegetarian for this short period. Also,\nthe traders in meat of Ahmedabad will not suffer much merely because their\nbusiness has been closed down for 9 days in a year. There is no prohibition to\ntheir business for the remaining 356 days in a year. In a multi-cultural country\nlike ours with such diversity, one should not be oversensitive and overtouchy\nabout a short restriction when it is being done out of respect for the\nsentiments of a particular section of society. It has been stated above that the\ngreat Emperor Akbar himself used to remain a vegetarian for a few days every\nweek out of respect for the vegetarian section of the Indian society and out of\nrespect for his Hindu wife. We too should have similar respect for the\nsentiments for others, even if they are a minority sect&quot;.\t[Emphasis added]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">\t22.Therefore, in the light of the rival contentions and in the light of\nthe legal <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_23\">precedents <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_24\">referred to above</a></a>, this Court is of the view that in the\nabsence of any correct details with reference to the selling of fowl or fish, as\nrequired under <a href=\"/doc/55917484/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 269(1)</a> by license shop, and because of the vague\naverments in the counter affidavit filed by the town panchayat, the matter will\nhave to go back to the town panchayat for a fresh consideration. It must take\ninto account all the relevant circumstances of the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\t23.Hence, all the writ petitions are disposed of with a direction to the\nfirst respondent town panchayat to place the matter before the town panchayat\ncouncil for a proper determination. Once such a decision is taken, it will be\nnotified for public attention.
