Accordingly, at the request of the RBI, the first respondent-Institute, f or the last fifteen years used to prepare a panel of qualified auditors for auditing the accounts of the nationalised banks and rural banks and submit such panel every year to the RBI who on receipt of such panel, scrutinise the same and allot audit work of the nationalised banks and rural banks to the qualified auditors as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/34973/\" id=\"a_44\">sections 29</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_45\">30(1)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_46\">30</a>(1 A) and 31 of the <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_47\">Banking Regulation Act</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">8. It is therefore, clear that the Register maintained by the Institute under <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_48\">section 19(1)</a> of the Act, read with regulation 3 of the Regulations, the List of Members published by the Institute under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_49\">section 19(3)</a> of the Act, read with regulations 185 and 186 and the empanelment of Chartered Accountants for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/34973/\" id=\"a_50\">sections 29</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_51\">30(1)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_52\">30(1A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1972853/\" id=\"a_53\">31</a> of the Banking Regulation Act are all quite distinct from each other.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">9. It appears that the President of the Institute received a letter dated 25-9-1998 from the RBI enclosing a representation dated 19-8-1999 from one Badyala &amp; Co., a firm of Chartered Accountants, explaining the necessity of elimination of bogus firms from the empanelment.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">10. Taking note of the above letter of the RBI alleging mushroom growth of bogus audit firms the Institute, by exercising their powers under <a href=\"/doc/822455/\" id=\"a_54\">section 17(2)</a> of the Act, constituted a Committee called Professional Development Committee, the second respondent in W.P. Nos. 12479 and 12480 of 1999, to suggest appropriate recommendations to eliminate any malpractice by any members to weed out the mushroom growth of bogus firms and to cull out the authentic and correct information from the Chartered Accountants.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">11. The Committee after taking note of the fact that in recent times apart from the banking sector, several other authorities have shown interest in obtaining panel of auditors from the Institute for carrying out their audit work and other assignments and the necessity to cheek the mushroom growth of bogus audit firms to arrest malpractice in furnishing false and incorrect particulars by the audit firms, and to prepare a panel of genuine and bona fide firms, in the broader interest of the society at large decided to prepare a multipurpose empanelment by way of a composite data based information to satisfy the requirements of the RBI and other authorities to facilitate the allotment of audit and other diversified assignments and, accordingly, recommended a comprehensive application form requiring all relevant and material details and documents for the multipurpose empanelment.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">12. The Council in their meeting held in &#x27;April and May 1999, approved the recommendations of the second respondent Committee and invited the members to apply in a composite format for the purpose of empanelment with all relevant details and documents required therein. The comprehensive application format was, thus, published in the Journal of the Chartered Accountants of India, June 1999 and notified the last date as 31-4-1999, notifying that no extension of time beyond the aforesaid time limit would be granted.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">13. The application form consists of five parts.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">13.1 Part 1 contains the.basic information such as Code Number, Name of the Concern with Status, Firm Registration Number, PAN/GIR No., Service-tax Registration Number, Address, Telephone Number, E-mail etc.\n \n\n13.2 Part II deals with the relevant information for the purpose of empanelment of auditors for different branches of public sector undertakings; banks and statutory and central branches of regional and rural banks.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">13.3 Part 111 deals with the information for updating the database of the Institute.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">13.4 Part 1V enumerates the list of documents to be attached along with the application form, viz-\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">(i) a copy of the latest financial statements of the partnership firm or of the sole proprietary concern or individual, as the case may be;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_48\">(ii) a copy of the statement of income forming part of the latest income-tax return of the firm /proprietor/ individual along with a copy of acknowledgement;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">(iii) a copy of the latest available assessment order for the firm /proprietor/ individual;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">(iv) a copy of the statement of income forming part of the latest income-tax return of each of the partners along with a copy of acknowledgement;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">(v) a copy of the latest available assessment order for each of the partners; and\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">(vi) a copy of the partnership deed.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">13.5 Part V provides for a declaration to be furnished by the applicant.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">14. That apart, the Committee also enlisted nine discrepancies that were noticed while processing the applications for empanelment during the previous years, putting the members on notice that the applications would be rejected on account of these discrepancies: viz.,-\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">(i) Applications that were not signed in the manner required;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">(ii) Applications made by the partners /proprietors on behalf of more than one firm;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_57\">(iii) Applications containing incomplete information relating to their establishment/ membership number and year of enrolment not given, complete details of partners/ proprietor of the concern not filled in, interest in other partnership firms /sole proprietary concern/ individual practice not disclosed, applications not in the prescribed format, etc.;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">(iv) Applications that were not legible;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">(v) Applications that were made by the partners of the firm in their individual names /proprietary concern&#x27;s name in spite of clear instructions that no partner of a concern shall apply in his individual or proprietary name when he is a partner in a firm and that applications in such cases shall be in the name of partnership firm only;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">(vi) Multiple applications - Different applications made by the members of the same firm and later on requested for withdrawal of one or more of the same;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">(vii) Applications that were received after the last date;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">(viii) Applications received from the members whose main occupation was not practice; and\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_63\">(ix) Applications with incorrect information.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">15.

Similarly, the Controller and Auditor-General of India (&#x27;C&amp;AG&#x27;), the first respondent in W.P. Nos. 12630 and 12631 to 1999, a constitutional authority appointed by the President of India, by a warrant issued under article 148 of the Constitution of India, while discharging his duties under article 149, read with section 619(3), of the Companies Act, 1956, is empowered to appoint auditors for auditing the accounts of the Government Companies and Public Sector Undertakings and also empowered to direct the manner in which the accounts of such Government Companies and Public Sector Undertakings shall be audited by the auditors so appointed by the C &amp; AG.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">19.

If the application forms are not supported with specific documentary evidence, they are liable to be rejected summarily and no correspondence will be entertained in that regard. Firms already empanelled must also send their particulars in the prescribed format, enclosing the attested true copies of the certificates as well as other documents required as per the application form. The firms which are already empanelled, but do not send their particulars afresh are liable to be suspended from the panel and they are not eligible afresh and, consequently, the audits if any allotted to the existing firms which are under the panel but which do not fulfil any of the criteria for the empanelment, would be withdrawn.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">20.1 The notification also prescribed the eligibility criteria for empanelment in Special Regions, such as, Jammu. &amp; Kashmir, Orissa, North-Eastern States, Sikkim, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Island, as well as other regions anywhere in the country. The eligibility criteria are as follows:\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">Special Regions:\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(i) Sole Proprietorship Firms: Sole proprietorship firm whose proprietor is an FCA and is engaged full-time with the firm,\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">(ii) Partnership Firms .

Points have been given for the experience of the firm; for the partners of the firm; for the long association of the partners; and for the employees of the firm.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(d) The selection of statutory auditors for the audit of major Public Sector Undertakings falling in sectors specified in the Annexures to the application form would be done through a judgmental process taking into consideration the firm&#x27;s seniority, number of partners/ number of Chartered Accountant employees in the firm and the experience of the firm in the requisite areas as given in the Annexure.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">20.3 The application form also clearly states that in case of two or more firms having partners in common, only one of the firms would be considered for empanelment. While determining the ranking of the empanelled firm, no point will be given on account of partners sharing with other (sister) firms. The application also provides columns to mention the details of the technically qualified employees, viz., Engineers, Cost Accountants, Lawyers, Valuers, Surveyors and also the non-technical staff and their qualifications. The applicants should also give the particulars indicating the name of the company audited, whether it is a public limited company or a private limited company, the turnover of the company, nature of business, years of audit, etc.\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">21. Thereafter, in the letter dated 1-7-1999 issued in the Southern India Regional Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Vol. 25, published in July 1999, the C &amp; AG required the attested true copies of the following documents:\n</p> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(a) Latest income-tax returns of the firm as well as or the partners,\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(b) Latest partnership deed, and\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(c) Latest financial statement of the firm along with its schedules.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">22. The petitioners complain that the details and the documents required to be furnished as per the comprehensive application forms, notified by the Institute and C &amp; AG referred to above, have no nexus to the object of preparing a multipurpose empanelment; violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_57\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">21</a> of the Constitution and also ultra vires the provisions of the Act as well as Chapter X of the Regulations and, hence, the above writ petitions.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\">23. The grievance of the petitioners, legal contentions and the reliefs sought f or in the above writ petitions are identical in nature and, therefore, all the above writ petitions are heard together.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">24. Mr. Arvind P. Datar, the learned counsel for the petitioners, contends that certain information sought for and the documents to be enclosed with the application form are more personal in nature and they are not in any way either related or relevant to the professional competency required for the preparation of the panel, nor for any statistical purpose, much less, to update the same; these informations and documents cannot be the yardstick to assess the professional proficiency or competency, of the petitioners or their technical ability, the informations and documents hitherto called for by the Institute for the purpose of preparation of the panel themselves are self-sufficient; and the existing system of preparation of panel was going on smoothly for all these years without any grievance or complaint from any quarter.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">24.1 Mr. Arvind P. Datar contends that the information and documents already furnished by the members for the maintenance of the Register as required under <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_59\">section 19(1)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/216578/\" id=\"a_60\">section 2(1)(g)</a>, of the Act as well as regulation 3, read with Form T in Schedule A to the Regulations and the information and details furnished in the List of Members prepared under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_61\">section 19(3)</a> of the Act, read with regulations 185 and 186(1) themselves are self-sufficient for the purpose of empanelment. Assuming that the Council proposes to prescribe any other particulars in order to maintain the status and standard of the professional qualification of the members of the Institute as required under <a href=\"/doc/275739/\" id=\"a_62\">section 30(2)(c)</a> or for the purpose of maintaining the said Register of the Members of the Institute under <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_63\">section 19(1)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/616379/\" id=\"a_64\">sections 19(2)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/275739/\" id=\"a_65\">30(2)(b)</a>, (a), (e) and (h) or for publishing such list of members under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_66\">section 19(3)</a> of the Act or for any other matter to achieve the object of the Act as per <a href=\"/doc/275739/\" id=\"a_67\">section 30(2)(1)</a> of the Act, the same shall be given effect to only by framing appropriate regulation, getting the approval of the Central Government as per <a href=\"/doc/1624026/\" id=\"a_68\">section 30(3)</a>, notifying the same in the Gazette of India by exercising powers under <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_69\">section 30(1)</a> and tabling the same as per section 30B. Otherwise, the prescription of such particulars would suffer from want of authority of law.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">24.2 According to Mr. Arvind P. Datar, there is no necessity to insist for the details and production of the documents relating to the income-tax returns of the firm as well as the personal income of the individual partners of the firm and that of the companies audited with their respective net worth/turnover, income-tax returns and assessment order, except as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1448409/\" id=\"a_70\">section 138</a> of the Income Tax Act; the requirement to furnish the income-tax returns and assessment orders of the audit firms and the partners as well are highly arbitrary and irrational; and similarly there is no requirement for furnishing the particulars relating to the indebtedness and the credit card details of the individual partners of the firm, professionals employed in the firm such as Cost Accountants, Engineers, Lawyers, etc., and other employees of the firm.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1542937\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"557586\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"342680\" id=\"span_3\">24.3 Mr. Arvind P. Datar further contends that except a bald allegation, no material is placed before this Court as to the alleged malpractice of furnishing false or incorrect particulars by the audit firms for the empanelment; nor any details are available as to the alleged mushroom growth of bogus firms or as to the misuse of their office by filing wrong declaration for the purpose of empanelment. Placing reliance on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/342680/\" id=\"a_71\">Laxmi Khandsari v. State of UP.</a> AIR 1981 SC 873; <a href=\"/doc/557586/\" id=\"a_72\">Municipal Corpn. v.

Bar Council of India</a> (1995) 1 SCC 732, it is contended that the onus of proving to the satisfaction of the Court that the restriction imposed is reasonable lies upon the State. However, it is contended that the respondents have not discharged their onus to establish the mischief in the existing system.</span></span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_74\">24.4 Mr. Arvind P. Datar complains that rendering those who do not furnish such information and documents contemplated under the impugned applications as ineligible for empanelment is punitive, unreasonable, arbitrary and violates articles 14 and 19(1)(g) as they would, consequently, be deprived of the opportunity of being considered for appointment as auditors of the nationalised banks and regional rural banks under the control of the RBI as well as that of Public Sector Undertakings under the control of C &amp; AG.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1542937\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"342680\" id=\"span_5\">24.5 Mr. Arvind P. Datar contends that the refusal to empanel the members who do not comply with the requirements under the impugned application forms and the consequential classification created among the members whose names are found in the Register prepared under <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_74\">section 19(1)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/216578/\" id=\"a_75\">section 2(1)(g)</a> as well as regulation 3 read with Form T in schedule A to the Regulations and those names found in the List of Members prepared under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_76\">section 19(3)</a>, read with regulations 185 and 186 (1), cannot be said to be reasonable under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_77\">article 19(6)</a> inasmuch as the respondents have not discharged their onus to prove that the information and documents are relevant for multipurpose empanelment and in this regard, Mr. Arvind P. Datar has relied on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/342680/\" id=\"a_78\">Laxyni Khandsari</a>&#x27;s case (<a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_79\">supra) and Indian Council of Legal Aid &amp; Advice</a>&#x27;s case (supra).</span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">24.6 Even though the respondents would contend that the above particulars and documents called for from the members would be kept secret, the respondents have also reserved their right to use such information and documents sought to be furnished by the petitioners for any other purpose they deem fit, which is arbitrary and unreasonable and such reservation is punitive and violates the principles of natural justice.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"407511\" id=\"span_6\">24.7 Mr. Arvind P. Datar, while elaborating his arguments, further contends that the particulars relating to the professionals employed in the firm, previous experience as statutory auditor of companies other than Government Companies and Banks and Insurance Companies, partners/ Proprietors those who have signed the audit report/ conducted the audit, previous experience as statutory auditor of Head/Central Office(s) or branches of Insurance Companies, partners/ proprietor those who have signed the Audit Report/ conducted the Audit, experience as Concurrent/ Internal Auditor of Head/Central Office/Branches of Insurance Companies and the details of partners/ proprietor who have signed the audit report/ conducted the audit, previous experience in rendering professional services to Government Companies and the details of partners/proprietor who signed the Audit Report/rendered the relevant service, and previous experience in rendering professional services to Co-operative Institutions including Co-operative Banks and the details relating to the concern and partners/ proprietor who signed the audit report/ rendered the relevant services vide Annexures J, K, L, M, N and 0, have no relevance to the object of preparation of panel. The creation of a category of foreign firms will obviously discriminate against Indian firms not fulfilling the foreign criteria. Even assuming that the object and purpose behind insisting on furnishing such information and documents are noble and laudable, the Institute have no legal sanctity or authority to insist on the same for the purpose of empanelment, without following the procedure known to law. Placing reliance on (<a href=\"/doc/407511/\" id=\"a_80\">i) State of UP. v. Singhara Singh</a> AIR 1964 SC 358 and (ii) State of U.P. v. Kishori Lal Minocha AIR 1980 SC 680, it is contended that since there is no law under which the Institute could ask for these informations and documents from the applicants, the applicants cannot be compelled to furnish such particulars and documents by informing them that unless such informations and documents are furnished, their applications will not be considered f or empanelment. It is further contended that the Institute cannot seek such particulars through the impugned application form indirectly which the Institute cannot seek directly under Form - A of Schedule &quot;I&quot;.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_78\">24.8 Mr. Arvind P. Datar contends that the Act itself intends to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountants and, therefore, these particulars and documents are not at all relevant for assessing the professional and technical competency of the applicants for the purpose of empanelment. The details relating to personal financial status of the members by any stretch of imagination cannot be construed as a legitimate yardstick to assess the professional and technical competency of the members; nor such criteria can be said to weigh the status and standard of professional qualification of members of the Institute.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"407511\" id=\"span_7\">24.9 Mr. Arvind P. Datar further contends that even assuming that the Institute requires these particulars and documents in order to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountants and to maintain the standard of profession, the Institute can call for these particulars and documents only by framing appropriate regulation in that regard, approving the same by the Central Government as per <a href=\"/doc/1624026/\" id=\"a_81\">section 30(3)</a>, tabling the same before each House of Parliament as per section 30B and notifying the same in the Gazette of India as per <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_82\">sections 30(1)</a> and 30B, but not by enlarging the powers conferred under regulation 186(2). The ratio laid down in <a href=\"/doc/407511/\" id=\"a_83\">Singhara Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra) has been relied on in this regard.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">24.10 Mr. Arvind P. Datar further contends that since the Act and Regulations itself provide for taking appropriate disciplinary action against the erring members who furnish false and incorrect information for preparing the list under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_84\">section 19(3)</a>, read with regulations 185 and 186(1), there is no necessity to call for these informations and documents through the impugned application forms from all the Chartered Accountants in the country. That apart, in the absence of any guidelines as to how these particulars are to be used for the purpose of empanelment, the requirement of such particulars by the Institute is arbitrary and unreasonable.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832598\" id=\"span_8\">24.11 Referring to the decisions in (<a href=\"/doc/832598/\" id=\"a_85\">i) Neera Mathur v.

Per Conira, Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the Institute, at the outset, raised a preliminary objection that the above writ petitions are not maintainable for the following reasons:\n</p> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">(i) Firstly, the decision of the Professional Development Committee, as approved by the Counsel of the Institute, requiring the members to furnish the details and documents as per the impugned application form for the multipurpose empanelment as well as such decision of the C &amp; AG are policy decisions of statutory/ constitutional expert bodies, respectively, and such policy decisions cannot be challenged by seeking a writ of declaration, and in such a case, the only proper remedy for the petitioners is to seek a writ of certiorari. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"511868\" id=\"span_10\">In this regard, Mr. N.R.

State of UP.</a> AIR 1985 SC 167.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">(ii) Secondly, it is contended that many of the members of the petitioner societies have already submitted their application forms furnishing the required particulars and documents and, therefore, the petitioners have no locus standi to maintain the above writ petitions.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">25.1 Assuming the above writ petitions are maintainable, Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that the RBI is under a statutory obligation to appoint auditors to audit the accounts of the nationalised banks and regional rural banks, as per <a href=\"/doc/34973/\" id=\"a_94\">sections 29</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_95\">30</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1972853/\" id=\"a_96\">31</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Similarly, as per <a href=\"/doc/1143121/\" id=\"a_97\">section 619(2)</a> of the Companies Act, C &amp; AG has an obligation to appoint the auditors to the Public Sector Undertakings. Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, points out that these appointment of auditors should satisfy <a href=\"/doc/780853/\" id=\"a_98\">section 226</a> of the Companies Act. It is optional for the members to apply for empanelment and same is not compulsory or mandatory as the empanelment is totally different from the Register maintained by the Institute under <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_99\">section 19(1)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/216578/\" id=\"a_100\">section 2(g)</a> as well as regulation 3 read with Form 1 in Schedule A to the Regulations and the list prepared under <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_101\">section 19(3)</a> read with regulations 185 and 186(1).\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_85\">25.2 According to Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, the empanelment of auditors is, thus, prepared by the Institute and C &amp; AG for the past 15 years. However, by experience, the Institute has come across certain failures on the part of the members in disclosing certain material facts known to them, which are necessary to make their financial statements not misleading; failure to report the material mis-statement known to them to appear in financial statement with which they are concerned in professional capacity; failure to notify attention to any material departure from the generally accepted procedure of audit application to the circumstances, etc., and other discrepancies like filing multiple applications by the firms having common partners, filing applications by members whose main occupation is not practising, etc. Taking note of these failures and discrepancies, the Council, by exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/822455/\" id=\"a_102\">section 17(2)</a> of the Act, appointed an expert body, viz., Professional Development Committee, the second respondent in W.P. Nos. 12479 and 12480 of 1999, to go into the above failures and discrepancies and provide appropriate recommendations for preparing a multipurpose empanelment of the Chartered Accountants as per the requirements of the statutory authorities and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">25.3 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel explains that these particulars and supporting documents are required to cheek certain alleged malpractices that were brought to the notice of the Professional Development Committee.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_87\">25.4 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that since the requirement of these particulars and documents does not amount to a new regulation, there is no reason to test the same by the doctrine of mischief.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_88\">25.5 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel further contends that these particulars are though diverse in nature relevant to the assessee, the professional competency and experience of the Chartered Accountants.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">25.6 Placing reliance on the <a href=\"/doc/511868/\" id=\"a_103\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/511868/\" id=\"a_104\">laid down in</a></a> Somanna v. Subba Rao AIR 1958 AP 200 that the income-tax returns and assessment orders are public documents, Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that the requirement to produce such income-tax returns and assessment orders will not, in any way, offend the personal rights and privacy of the petitioners inasmuch as they are intended to avoid multiple applications and to facilitate equal distribution of work to more members, nor section 138 prohibits such disclosure. It is, therefore, clear that the impugned requirements have a direct nexus to the object of preparation of multipurpose empanelment and, hence, it cannot be complained that the requirement of these details and documents suffers from want of nexus.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">25.7 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel further contends that the disciplinary powers available under the Act and Regulations cannot be a bar for requiring the members to furnish the above details and documents to prepare a full panel of auditors in order to achieve the object of the Act; the requirement of such details and documents, therefore, would not amount to a professional misconduct, nor a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_105\">article 14</a> of the Constitution and the reservation of right to use the information received from the members for any purpose also cannot be complained of as punitive and arbitrary.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1542937\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"557586\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"342680\" id=\"span_13\">25.8 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that as the petitioners have no right to appointment merely because they were empanelled as notified by the Institute, there is no violation of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_106\">article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution and, consequently, there is no necessity for the respondents to prove that these details and documents required under the impugned applications are reasonable nor to prove that the refusal to empanel the members for want of such details and documents amounts to a reasonable restriction, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_107\">article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution. Hence, the ratio laid down in <a href=\"/doc/342680/\" id=\"a_108\">Laxmi Khandsaris</a> case (<a href=\"/doc/557586/\" id=\"a_109\">supra), Municipal Corpn.</a>&#x27;s case (<a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_110\">supra) and Indian Council of Legal Aid &amp; Advice</a> case (supra) is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.</span></span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_92\">25.9 Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel further contends that the question of providing an opportunity before rejecting the application for empanelment forwant of details and documents does not arise as such a decision is only ministerial in nature, but not a quasi-judicial decision inasmuch as even the inclusion of the members in the panel itself does not confer any right f or allotment of audit to the petitioner, and as such, <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_111\">article 19(1)(g)</a> is not attracted.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1887454\" id=\"span_14\">25.10 Placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1887454/\" id=\"a_112\">Mohammed Shuiat Ali v.

Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that the right to be considered for promotion is a condition of service, but the mere chance of promotion is not a condition of service. Quoting the above ratio, Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, argues that the petitioners get only a change of allotment of work by being empanelled and, therefore, such chance of allotment of work by being on the panel or denial of work by not being on the panel, in any way, will not attract <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_113\">article 19(1)(g)</a> as the right to practice is not in any way curtailed and the mere inconvenience in the profession cannot be a ground for widening the scope of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_114\">article 19(1)(g).</a></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"77295\" id=\"span_15\">25.11 Again, relying on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/77295/\" id=\"a_115\">Dr. Haniraj Chulani v.

Mr. T. Srinivasamoorthy, the learned counsel for the respondents in W.P. Nos. 12630 and 12631 of 1999, adopting the arguments of Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that these details and documents are required to assess the capability and suitability of the members and to test not only the qualification but also to ensure that they are not disqualified in other aspects; there is no compulsion for the petitioners to seek empanelment under any provision of the Act; nor the petitioners have any right for allotment of audit work on the basis of empanelment; and in any event, quoting the averment in the counter/affidavit furnished by C &amp; AG, the learned counsel states that if the information furnished by the firms are found to be incorrect, C &amp; AG would give a show-cause notice to the Chartered Accountants before refusing to empanel them.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_99\">27. In reply, Mr. Arvind P. Datar, the learned counsel for the petitioners, contends that the particulars and documents that are required under the impugned application forms for the purpose of empanelment are outside the scope and object of the Act and the Regulations and, therefore, the same is ultra vires the Act and Regulations as well as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_129\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_130\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_131\">21</a> of the Constitution and as such, the petitioners can very well challenge the same by way of a writ of declaration. Even assuming that the petitioners have prayed for an improper relief of a writ of declaration, this Court, exercising its extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_132\">article 226</a>, can entertain the writ petitions, mould the relief sought for by the petitioners and grant appropriate relief as deemed fit and necessary on the facts and circumstances of the case. Mr. Datar further contends that assuming many of the members of the petitioner-societies apply for empanelment as per the impugned application form, the petitioners can still maintain the above writ petitions as it is well-settled in law that there is no waiver of fundamental rights.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"293896\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1256541\" id=\"span_25\">27.1 Mr. Arvind P. Datar strongly disputes the case of the respondents that the details and documents are required for assessing the professional competency and potentiality of the Chartered Accountants, the reasons explained in the counter-affidavit cannot be substituted to substantiate the decision of the respondents as there is no material before the Court to satisfy that these details and documents are reasonable and related to professional expertise; since the respondents could disqualify the members for empanelment for want of information and documents required under the application, the petitioners would not be considered for appointment of auditors in the Nationalised Bank/Regional Rural Bank as well as Public Sector Undertakings and, therefore, their right conferred under the articles is certainly infringed, attracting <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_133\">article 19(1)(g)</a>, and such right protected under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_134\">article 19(1)(g)</a> could be infringed for want of such details and documents unless they are proved to be reasonable and relevant within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_135\">article 19(6)</a> and, hence, the onus lies on the respondents to place substantial materials before this Court to prove that the required details and documents are reasonable and relevant, as protected under <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_136\">article 19(6).</a> Mr. Datar, therefore, contends that the phrase &#x27;reasonable restriction&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_137\">article 19(6)</a> implies an intelligent care and deliberation, i.e., the choice of a course which reason dictates as held by the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1256541/\" id=\"a_138\">Chintaman Rao v. State of M.P.</a> AIR 1951 SC 118 and further relying upon the decision in <a href=\"/doc/293896/\" id=\"a_139\">R.M. Seshadri v. Distt Magistrate</a> AIR 1954 SC 747, contends that any condition which is more in the nature of an imposition than a restriction, is held to be abnoxious and unreasonable and cannot be considered as reasonable restriction within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_140\">article 19(6)</a> of the Constitution. Relying on the above ratio, Mr. Datar contends that the particulars and the documents required by the respondents are in no way relevant for assessing the professional competency, as they are very personal and, therefore, rendering the members disqualified for want of such details and documents which are irrelevant to assess the professional competency amounts to imposition but not a reasonable restriction.</span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_101\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79972\" id=\"span_26\">27.2 Mr. Datar distinguished the decision in <a href=\"/doc/79972/\" id=\"a_141\">Krishnan Kakkanth</a>&#x27;s case (supra) and contends that the petitioners are entitled to challenge the policy decision of the respondents if the decision of the respondents requiring the petitioners to furnish the details and documents has no nexus for the object to be achieved and the same is arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable and, therefore, violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_142\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_143\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_144\">21.</a></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1542456\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"194009576\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1993685\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"222410\" id=\"span_30\">27.3 Mr, Arvind P. Datar further replies that the details and documents required are attracted by the Wednesbury principles of irrationality and perversity. Hence, it is contended that the decisions relied upon by the respondents, viz., <a href=\"/doc/222410/\" id=\"a_145\">S. Narayan Iyer</a>&#x27;s case (<a href=\"/doc/1993685/\" id=\"a_146\">supra), Sham Babu Verma</a>&#x27;s case (<a href=\"/doc/194009576/\" id=\"a_147\">supra), Tala Iron &amp; Steel Co.

Placing reliance on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_153\">Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner</a> AIR 1978 SC 851 and Commissioner of Police v. Gordhandas Bhanji AIR 1952 SC 16, contends that in the absence of reasons transparent on the Notification, the Institute of C &amp; AG are not entitled to supplement fresh reasons by filing a counter affidavit substantiating their action. Therefore, they should have disclosed materials and reasons for requiring these details and documents; or otherwise, such requirements are held to be perverse, capricious and arbitrary, attracting <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_154\">article 14</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173649\" id=\"span_32\">27.5 Mr. Datar further contends that the respondents are not entitled to seek fishing information relating to personal and private affairs of the individual partner with regard to their indebtedness and credit cards, as they are unrelated to professional competency and potentiality. In this regard, he places reliance on the decision of D.B.S. Financial Services (P.) <a href=\"/doc/173649/\" id=\"a_155\">Ltd. v. Smt. M. George</a> (1994) 207 ITR 1077 (Bom.).

Nos. 12479 and 12480 of 1999, the petitioner seeks a writ of declaration, challenging the decision of an expert body, namely, the Professional Development Committee, as approved by the counsel of the Institute, requiting the details and documents under the impugned application for the empanelment of the Chartered Accountants. Similar decision of the C &amp; AG, a constitutional authority, has been challenged by the petitioner in W.P. Nos. 12630 and 12631 of 1999. The petitioners allege that the details and documents required in the impugned application in the above writ petitions are arbitrary, perverse and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_159\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_160\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_161\">21</a> of the Constitution and also violative of the principles of natural justice and ultra vires the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1826871/\" id=\"a_162\">Chartered Accountants Act</a> and Chapter X of the Regulations framed thereunder. Argued Mr. N.R. Chandran, learned senior counsel, placing reliance on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/511868/\" id=\"a_163\">Prabodh Verma</a>&#x27;s case (supra) that a writ of declaration can be prayed only where constitutional validity of the decision of a State or the authority is raised, but not otherwise.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_109\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"511868\" id=\"span_34\">30.2 In <a href=\"/doc/511868/\" id=\"a_164\">Prabodh Verma</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the petitioners sought for a writ of certiorari to declare an Act or an Ordinance as unconstitutional and void, but the Apex Court held that where the petitioners contend that an Act or an Ordinance is unconstitutional or void, the appropriate relief for them is to seek only a writ of declaration and not a writ of certiorari which can be granted only against the inferior courts or Tribunals or authorities to transmit the records of the proceedings pending before them for scrutiny of the same by the High Court or the Supreme Court, if necessary, and for quashing the same. Inviting my attention to the observation of the Apex Court that in such case, the High Court ought not to have proceeded to hear and dispose of the writ petition without insisting upon the petitioner to amend the prayer in the writ petition, Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, contends that the petitioner, having challenged the policy decision of the expert committee which has culminated in the impugned application form required by the Institute and the C &amp; AG in exercise of their statutory powers, ought to have sought for a writ of certiorari instead of a writ of declaration, as constitutional validity of the impugned application form does not arise and, therefore, argues that the above writ petitions are liable to be dismissed for improper relief sought for.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1515069\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"4354\" id=\"span_36\">30.3 There is no dispute on the issue that the recommendations of the Professional Development Committee, an expert body, for a comprehensive application form seeking the impugned details and documents, had been approved by the statutory authority, viz., the Institute in W.P. Nos. 12479 and 12480 of 1999 and a similar decision had also been taken by the constitutional authority, viz., C &amp; AG in W.P. Nos. 12630 and 12631 of 1999, is the subject-matter in all these writ petitions. It may be noted that the said policy decision of the statutory /constitutional authorities is challenged not only on the ground that the same is unreasonable, unfair, arbitrary, capricious, violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_165\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_166\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_167\">21</a> of the Constitution and also violative of the principles of natural justice, but also as ultra vires the provisions of the Act and Chapter X of the Regulations, as pointed out by Mr. Arvind P. Datar, the learned counsel for the petitioners. Therefore, taking into consideration the substantial grounds raised in the above petitions, it may not be proper for this Court to dismiss the above writ petitions merely because they have prayed for an improper relief. Hence, in order to meet the ends of justice instead of refusing to hear the aggrieved party purely on a technical and narrow procedural ground, the petitioners are required to be heard on merits, as the powers conferred on the courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_168\">article 226</a> of the Constitution are wide and flexible to mould the relief sought for, as held in <a href=\"/doc/4354/\" id=\"a_169\">Charanfit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of India</a> AIR 1951 SC 41, B.R. Ramabhadriah v. Secretary, F &amp; A Depl., Andhra Pradesh <a href=\"/doc/1515069/\" id=\"a_170\">AIR 1981 SC 1653, M V Elisabeth v.

Income Tax Officer AIR 1966 SC 81 and such a power of judicial review can elastically be exercised to render &#x27;justice&#x27; wherever injustice is complained of; and, therefore, the exercise of judicial review need not be restricted for want of proper relief. Hence, in my considered opinion, these writ petitioners deserve to be heard on merits irrespective of the cob-webs of technicalities; otherwise, the petitioners would be let down to a bottomless pit.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_111\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"761967\" id=\"span_38\">30.4 Similarly, where the petitioners complain that their fundamental rights are infringed, it is well-settled in law that there cannot be any waiver f or breach of the fundamental rights, as held in <a href=\"/doc/761967/\" id=\"a_172\">Basheshar Nath v. CIT</a> AIR 1959 SC 149. Therefore, refusing to hear the petitioners merely on a technical ground that some of the petitioners have already applied in a prescribed form, would render the powers of judicial review of this Court conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_173\">article 226</a> of the Constitution to suffer from judicial shackle.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">30.5 Point No. (i) is answered accordingly.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">31. Point No. (it) whether the impugned details and documents required in the impugned application violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_174\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_175\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_176\">21</a> of the Constitution of India as well as the principles of natural justice? <a href=\"/doc/780853/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 226</a> of the Companies Act, contemplates that a person shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a company unless he is a Chartered Accountant within the meaning of the <a href=\"/doc/1826871/\" id=\"a_178\">Chartered Accountants Act</a> and is not disqualified for such appointment as prescribed therein. Therefore, apart from the &#x27;Register&#x27; maintained by the Institute as per <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_179\">section 19(1)</a> and the &#x27;list&#x27; prepared as per <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_180\">section 19(3)</a>, the Institute is also required to prepare a panel of Chartered Accountants as per the requirement contemplated under section 226 for appointment of auditors in the Nationalised Banks and Regional Rural Banks by the RBI. Similarly, the C &amp; AG is required to prepare a panel for appointing auditors, in the Public Sector Undertakings. Necessarily, the details and documents required by the Institute and C &amp; AG need not be the same as required for the purpose of maintaining the Register as per <a href=\"/doc/1196752/\" id=\"a_181\">section 19(1)</a> and for preparing the list as per <a href=\"/doc/594720/\" id=\"a_182\">section 19(3)</a>.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">32. It appears that certain discrepancies were brought to the notice of the Institute by the RBI as well as to the C &amp; AG in furnishing information for empanelment of auditors. It is also felt by the Institute as well as the C &amp; AG that the informations furnished by the auditors in the existing system are insufficient for preparing the panel as per the requirement of law or give way for growth of bogus firms, depriving the legitimate rights of the qualified auditors. These alleged malpractices include (a) showing members as partners who are not in fact associated with the functioning of the firm; (b) showing branch office/head office at places where they are not actually functioning; (c) inclusion of members who are in full-time employment as partners without disclosing the f act of their employment; (a) showing the members as in-charge of the branch office without fulfilling the prescribed conditions and (c) showing the members as partners who are also engaged in other occupations without disclosing the fact about the engagement. Unmistakably, these malpractices are considered as detrimental not only to the public image of the profession of Chartered Accountants but also to the very interest of the society at large.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">33. The Professional Development Committee, in order to check the mushroom growth of bogus audit firms, to arrest malpractice in furnishing false, incorrect and misleading particulars by the audit firms and to prepare a panel of genuine and bona fide firms to protect the interests of the financial institutions in the larger interest of the society, recommended to seek the impugned details and documents in a composite application form from the members of the Institute who apply for empanelment, which are relevant for the appointment of Auditors in Nationalised Banks and Regional Rural Banks by the RBI. After the approval of the Council, the Institute invited the impugned details and documents in a prescribed format from the members of the Institute for empanelment of Chartered Accountants, for the appointment of auditors of the banks, notifying that the applications which do not contain the impugned details and documents would not be considered for empanelment.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">34. These details and the documents required under the impugned application as well as in the Annexures G, H, 1, J, K, L, M, N and 0 are related to the income and net worth of the firms as well as the individual partners; the constitution of the firm; the name of their bankers; credit limit and bank account number; latest balance sheet; standing of the firms with the details of empanelment with RBI and C &amp; AG, length of empanelment; past assignment; maximum size of project handled and value of the project and infrastructure, manpower with list of senior executives and other professionals like Cost Accountants, lawyers, engineers, etc. These particulars are required to prepare a fool-proof panel of auditors supported with authenticated information from the applicants themselves, which would enable the Institute to check the malpractice at the threshold and also to hold the erring members with accountability and, therefore, there is no reason to feel either aggrieved or prejudiced by such measures which are purely intended to ensure credibility to the empanelment mechanism and to enhance the image of the profession in the eye of public. Further, as rightly pointed out by Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, the details of indebtedness including the outstandings in respect of credit cards which exceeds Rs. 1,000 of the Public Sectors Banks/Regional Rural Banks, as required in Annexure G and the details of directorship in Public Sector Banks/Regional Rural Banks, as required in Annexure H, are required to ensure that the applicants are in no way disqualified under section 226. Similarly, particulars, as required in Annexures 1, K, L, M, N and 0 with the details of partners who have signed the audit report, are required to assess the quantum of work they had undertaken, professional competency and their association with Public Sector Banks/ Regional Rural Banks so that the conflict of interest between the banks and the applicants could be avoided. The particulars of professionals employed in the firm, as required in Annexure J, are relevant to assess the professional potentiality, 1 am satisfied that these details are neither intended to favour any multinational firms nor to interfere with the personal right of the individual member, much less the privacy, but they are intended to assess the qualification, experience, competency, as well as to ensure that they are not disqualified in any manner as per section 226. Similarly, I am satisfied that the documents to be attached with the application, viz., the partnership deed, the balance sheet, profit and loss account, latest income-tax returns and assessment order of the firms as well as individual partners, are necessary to cross-verify the details that are relevant for the purpose of appointment of the auditors to the Public Sector Undertakings and the banks and that the production of income-tax returns and the assessment orders of the firm as well as individual partners would enable the Institute to (a) shortlist the applications by avoiding multiple applications, and (b) to avoid the members who are actually not practising, so that the practising members would get job, thus, in overall, the members who are actually practising would be benefited and the work would be distributed equally and impartially. Consequently, the concentration of work with a few members who are partners in different firms would be avoided in order to facilitate equal distribution of work to more members, according to their professional competency. No doubt, the income-tax returns and the assessment orders, per se, would enable the Institute to verify and eliminate the dummy and non-practising partners and to enlist the genuine and bona fide members in the panel, by cross-checking the information and the supporting documents of the firms as well as individual partners. I am also unable to appreciate the contention of Mr. Arvind P. Datar that the requirement of such information relating to income-tax returns and the assessment orders of the firms and the individual partners cannot be caused to be disclosed, except as ordered under section 138. Section 138 enables the authorities mentioned therein, to furnish or cause to be furnished such information received or obtained by any income-tax authorities. That are necessary to perform his or its functions under the law mentioned therein, as per clause (1) of section 138, and further authorities the Central Government to direct by appropriate Notification in the Official Gazette that no information or document shall be furnished or produced by a public servant in respect of such matters relating to such class of the assessees or except such authorities, as may be specified in the order.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">Notwithstanding anything contained under section 138(1) or any other law for the time being in force, as per section 138(2). Section 138, thus, enables the authorities mentioned therein or the Central Government to pass appropriate order in the matter of disclosure of the particulars of the assessees, notwithstanding anything contained in any law in force. Therefore, in the absence of any Notification by the Central Government under section 138(2), the Institute and C &amp; AG are not barred to seek disclosure of information relating to the assessees. When such information is relevant and necessary to suit other statutory requirements for empanelment of the Chartered Accountants for the appointment of auditors in the Nationalised Banks and Public Sector Undertakings as per section 226 and to achieve the object of the <a href=\"/doc/1826871/\" id=\"a_183\">Chartered Accountants Act</a>, viz- to regulate the profession of the Chartered Accountants, and, hence, such disclosures would not in am way run counter to section 138 as rightly pointed out by Mr. N.R. Cliandrall. To contend that such details would prejudice the persorial rights and privacy in my considered opinion is unsustainable in law as the income-tax returns and the assessment orders are public documents as held in Somanna&#x27;s and, therefore, the production of the same could not be said to prejudice any one.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">35. I am, therefore, satisfied that there are sufficient and tangible reasons to justify the requirement of the impugned details and documents. The Professional Development Committee and the Council of the Institute are competent to take appropriate decision requiring all relevant particulars for preparing a multipurpose empanelment and such efforts could not be termed either as irrelevant or unwise attempt; nor would amount to framing of new regulation, requiring it to be notified in the Official Gazette as per <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_184\">section 30(1)</a>; not to be approved by the Central Government as per <a href=\"/doc/1624026/\" id=\"a_185\">section 30(3)</a> nor to be laid before each House of Parliament as per section 30B and, therefore, the requirement of the impugned details and documents are not in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1153380/\" id=\"a_186\">sections 30(1)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1624026/\" id=\"a_187\">30(3)</a> and 30B.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_119\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_39\">36. As 1 am satisfied that the requirement of impugned details and documents has strong nexus with the object to be achieved under the Act and rendering the members disqualified for want of impugned details and documents, the same could not be said to be unreasonable, arbitrary and perverse, attracting <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_188\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_189\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_190\">21.</a> Further, as observed in detail, the Notification of the Institute as well as of the C &amp; AG apparently discloses the reasons for seeking the impugned details and documents. Nine discrepancies that were noticed while processing the applications submitted by the members of the firms and seventeen points that are to be taken note of by the applicants while filling up the applications for empanelment are expressly stated in the Notification. Therefore, 1 do not find any merit in the contention of Mr. Arvind P. Datar that the impugned Notifications do not reflect any reason and that the respondents had f ailed to place materials to satisfy this Court for requiring the impugned details and documents. Hence, 1 do not find any force in the arguments of Mr. Arvind P. Datar, relying on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_191\">Mohinder Singh Gill</a>&#x27;s case (supra) and Gordhandas Bhanfl&#x27;s case (supra) that the respondents are trying to supplement fresh reasons by filling counter to substantiate their action.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">37. The ratio laid down by the Apex Court in Dutta Associates (P.) Ltd. (1997) 1 SCC 53 that the decision-making process should be transparent, fair and open and that the authorities have public accountability to maintain the fairness in their action without giving room for abuse of powers for extraneous reasons, are not in any way attracted in the instant case.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"194009576\" id=\"span_40\">38. I am also not impressed with the submission of Mr. Arvind P. Datar, placing reliance on D.B.S. Financial Services (P.) <a href=\"/doc/194009576/\" id=\"a_192\">Ltd.</a>&#x27;s case (supra), that the respondents seek&#x27; fishing information&#x27; relating to personal and private affairs. Even though the impugned details and documents are related to personal and private affairs, it cannot be disputed that these details and documents reflect the indebtedness of the members, which is directly relevant to ensure that they are not in a way disqualified under section 226.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"832598\" id=\"span_41\">Hence, I do not agree that the impugned details and documents relating to the personal income and credit cards of the petitioners offend the right to life and liberty of the petitioners, attracting <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_193\">article 21</a> and, therefore, the reliance placed in <a href=\"/doc/832598/\" id=\"a_194\">Neera Mathurs</a> case (supra) and R.

Various decisions cited by Mr. Arvind Datar, viz., <a href=\"/doc/342680/\" id=\"a_195\">Laxmi Khandsaris</a> case (<a href=\"/doc/557586/\" id=\"a_196\">supra), Municipal Corpn.s</a> case (<a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_197\">supra) and Indian Council of Legal Aid &amp; Advice</a>&#x27;s case (supra), unmistakably support the proposition that, where there is a clear violation of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_198\">article 19(1)(g)</a>, the State has to justify, by acceptable evidence, inevitable consequence or sufficient materials that the restrictions, whether partial or incomplete, is in the public interest and contains the quality of reasonableness; when the exercise of fundamental right is prohibited, the burden of providing that a total ban on the exercise of the right alone may ensure the maintenance of the interest of general public, lies heavily upon the State; but the question as to what are the reasonable restrictions, would naturally depend on the natural circumstances of the case, character of the statute, object which it seeks to serve, and the existence of the circumstances. Therefore, to decide on violations of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_199\">article 19(1)(g)</a> in terms of any reasonable restriction, &#x27;keeping the public interest as a parameter&#x27; should be the cardinal principle; but not the mere inconvenience of the individuals as complained.</span></span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"603874\" id=\"span_45\">40. The principles <a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_200\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/603874/\" id=\"a_201\">Papnasam Labour Union v. Madura Coats Ltd.</a> (1995) 1 SCC 501 that the restriction sought to be imposed on the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_202\">article 19</a> must not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature so as to go beyond the requirement of felt need of the society and object sought to be achieved; and that there must be a direct and proximate nexus or a reasonable connection between the restriction imposed and the object sought to be achieved; cannot have universal application in all cases, as the question of reasonableness varies from case to case. The reason that weighed for requiring the impugned details and documents in the instant case, does not, in any way, derogate the well-found principles <a href=\"/doc/603874/\" id=\"a_203\">laid down in</a> the case <a href=\"/doc/603874/\" id=\"a_204\">referred to above</a>.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1542937\" id=\"span_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"557586\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"342680\" id=\"span_48\">41. As rightly contended by Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, the mere disciplinary powers available under the Act, cannot, in any way, disable the Institute to seek the impugned details and documents from &amp; members who desire to apply for empanelment, in order to avoid any malpractice at the threshold, and to achieve the object of the Act and to satisfy the requirement of the statutory authorities. Since the Institute itself requires the members to furnish the details relating to the names of companies audited by the members and their networth and turnover, furnishing of such details would not amount to a professional misconduct; but a member shall be deemed to be guilty of professional misconduct only if he does not supply the information called for. Further, reservation of right to use the information received from the members for any purpose in the interest of profession in addition to submitting the same to the appropriate authorities also cannot be complained of as arbitrary, unreasonable, mala fide and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_205\">article 14.</a> From the Notification, 1 find that the Institute does not undertake any responsibility with regard to the allotment of audit or other assignment to any of the applicants and, therefore, as explained by Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, the empanelment will not confer any right for appointment of auditors. in other words, the members who apply for empanelment have no right of appointment as auditors automatically, by virtue of such empanelment. Therefore, the refusal to consider the petitioners who have not furnished the required details and documents, will not, in any way, violate <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_206\">article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. Consequently, there is no necessity for the respondents to satisfy that these required details and documents amount to reasonable restriction within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_207\">article 19(6).</a> Hence, I am unable to appreciate the arguments of Mr. Datar, basing on the <a href=\"/doc/603874/\" id=\"a_208\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/603874/\" id=\"a_209\">laid down in</a></a> (<a href=\"/doc/342680/\" id=\"a_210\">i) Laxmi Khandkaris</a> case (<a href=\"/doc/557586/\" id=\"a_211\">supra), (ii) Jan Mohamed Usmanbhais</a> case (<a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_212\">supra), and (iii) Indian Council of Legal Aid &amp; Advice</a>&#x27;s case (supra), that the onus lies on the respondent-lnstitute/ C &amp; AG to place the materials before the Court, to prove that the impugned details and documents required are reasonable, relevant and necessary for the multipurpose empanelment. In any event, there are substantial, relevant and tangible reasons to justify the requirement of these details and documents for. preparing the multipurpose empanelment. Further, as rightly contended by Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, if <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_213\">article 19(1)(g)</a> is not attracted, there isno obligation for the respondents to produce the materials to satisfy that the impugned details and documents are reasonable and relevant.</span></span></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"293896\" id=\"span_49\">42. As I am satisfied with the corporeal reasons for the requirement of the impugned details and documents, the <a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_214\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/1542937/\" id=\"a_215\">laid down in</a></a> Chintaman rao&#x27;s case (supra) as well as in <a href=\"/doc/293896/\" id=\"a_216\">R.M Seshadris</a> case (supra) that &#x27;reasonable restriction&#x27; required within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_217\">article 19(6)</a> should be based on intelligent care, what the reason dictates and that any condition which is more of nature imposition than a restriction is held to be abnoxious, cannot be considered as reasonable within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_218\">article 19(6)</a>, do not come in aid of the petitioners.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">43. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77295\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/77295/\" id=\"a_219\">Dr. Haniraj Chulani</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the Apex Court has held that the rule restricting the entry of persons already carrying on other professions for the enrolment as Advocate neither could fail foul on the alter of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_220\">articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_221\">19(1)(g)</a>, read with <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_222\">article 19(6)</a>, nor could be said that unguided and unchartered powers are handed over on a plater to the Bar Council for regulating entry to the legal profession. Applying the above ratio to the instant case, the impugned proposal of carving out and shortlisting the Chartered Accountants in the light of the details and documents to be furnished with the impugned application form, cannot be complained as arbitrary and unreasonable, attracting <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_223\">articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_224\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, as such details and documents are required to prepare a multipurpose empanelment of auditors germane to high and exacting the standards of auditing and to maintain the status and standard of professional qualification of the members of the Institute. Therefore, refusing to consider the applications for want of such relevant details and documents, in my considered opinion, will not amount to&#x27;conferring&#x27;unguided and unchartered powers on the Institute or C &amp; AG. On the other hand, taking note of the reasonableness, relevancy and necessity of these details and documents into consideration, it could be safely concluded that the same is found to be well-sustainable in law, not attracting <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_225\">articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_226\">19(1)(g)</a> and once such conclusion is reached, the absolute requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_227\">article 21</a> would be out of way, and the petitioners, therefore, cannot be said to have been deprived of their right to livelihood by not being empanelled for want of such details and documents and, therefore, the requirements under the impugned application cannot be faulted on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_228\">article 2 1.</a></span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1542937\" id=\"span_51\">44.

Narayanyer</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the Apex Court has held that the subscriber, under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_241\">Telegraphic Act</a>, is not entitled to maintain the writ petition challenging the increase in telephone tariff rates recommended by the Tariff Enquiry Committee which was subsequently placed before the House in the shape of budget proposal. The Apex Court observed that the Parliament, having gone into all the budget proposals and sanctioned the same, such tariff ratio had become the legislative policy as well as the legislative process and, therefore, the Court has no jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_242\">article 226</a> to go into the reasonableness of such rates, which are decided as policy matters in fiscal planning, which cannot be subjected to any judicial determination. Applying the <a href=\"/doc/222410/\" id=\"a_243\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/222410/\" id=\"a_244\">laid down in</a></a> <a href=\"/doc/222410/\" id=\"a_245\">the above decision</a> to the facts and circumstances of the instant case, 1 am satisfied that the impugned application form, having been recommended originally by an expert body and subsequently approved by the Council as required by the statutory and constitutional authorities, viz., Institutes and C &amp; AG as the matter of policy decision, cannot be questioned by the petitioners by way of Judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_246\">article 226</a> of the Constitution and the Court, therefore, would not interfere with the decision of the body of experts in the absence of any unreasonableness. The requirement of reasonableness in the action of the authorities is one of the most active criteria but not a mere empty formality and the same would mean not what the authorities like but what they ought, by ascertaining and following the course which reason directs, which could be conveniently explained as a test of &#x27;Wednesbury principles of reasonableness&#x27;. In other words, mere discretion of the authorities to take appropriate decision on a particular subject and exercise of such discretion itself would not be sufficient, if such discretion is exercised not satisfying the principles of reasonableness. The discretion, which does not stand the test of reasonableness, would thwart and run counter to the object of conferring such discretion on the authorities. Any policy decision derived as a result of such defective exercise of discretion for want of reasonableness, is not entitled to the protection of the Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"194009576\" id=\"span_55\">If the decision of requiring the impugned details and documents is tested by the &#x27;Wednesbury principles of rationality&#x27;, 1 am satisfied that there are sufficient and strong reasons f or requiring such details and documents in order to satisfy the requirement of statutory/ constitutional authorities, viz., RBI &amp; C &amp; AG. The impugned policy decision which stands the test of reasonableness, cannot thereafter, be challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_247\">article 226</a> of the Constitution, by way of judicial review, as held in (<a href=\"/doc/194009576/\" id=\"a_248\">i) Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co.

That apart I am of the firm opinion that the mere inconvenience would not amount to a legal prejudice and such inconvenience cannot be a ground to allege violation of articles 14,19(1)(g), 21 of the Constitution.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">46. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79972\" id=\"span_56\">In <a href=\"/doc/79972/\" id=\"a_249\">Krishnan Kakkants</a> case (supra), the Apex Court has upheld the decision of the Government that the subsidy can be paid only to the approved dealers, and such decision, being a policy decision, cannot be challenged by way of a judicial review on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_250\">article 14.</a> Applying the above ratio, 1 have no option except to hold that if the petitioners want to be empanelled, they have to furnish the details and documents in accordance with the terms and conditions of the application, inasmuch as the same are reasonable, relevant and, therefore, required in the public interest to assess the professional competency and potentiality as explained above. The reasonableness of such requirement has to be determined in an objective manner by a standpoint of the interest of the general public and not by a standpoint of the interest of individuals upon whom the requirements were contemplated on abstract arid imagine/inconvenience.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"175829\" id=\"span_57\">47. The allegation that the petitioners would be prejudiced by furnishing the details and documents required in the impugned application form is nothing but imaginary surmise and hypothetical, and not based on reasons, and such a grievance cannot be gone into under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_251\">article 226</a> unless the petitioners are legally prejudiced, and this Court, rather, cannot act as a Court of appeal on such issues as per the <a href=\"/doc/79972/\" id=\"a_252\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/79972/\" id=\"a_253\">laid down in</a></a> <a href=\"/doc/175829/\" id=\"a_254\">Madan Lal</a>&#x27;s case (supra).</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175829\" id=\"span_58\">48. As discussed in details, the decision taken by the Institute and the C &amp; AG in conformity with the respective provisions of the Act as well as the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_255\">Companies Act</a>, for substantial and tangible reasons <a href=\"/doc/175829/\" id=\"a_256\">referred to above</a>, to avoid the discrepancies in preparing the panel of auditors as per the statutory requirements of RBI and C &amp; AG and to prepare a fool-proof panel of Chartered Accountants for the appointment of auditors in the Nationalised Banks and Regional Rural Banks as well as in Public Sector Undertakings, in my considered opinion, cannot be complained of that the said authorities, viz., RBI and C &amp; AG have acted in the manner not conferred on them.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"407511\" id=\"span_59\">Therefore, the arguments of Mr. Arvind Datar, placing reliance on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/407511/\" id=\"a_257\">Singhara Singh</a>&#x27;s case (supra), following the decision in Taylor v. Toylor (1876) 1 Ch. D. 426 that, where the power is given to do certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be done in that way or not at all and other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden, does not fit into the facts of the instant case. Since the impugned decision of the Institute and C &amp; AG is intended to avoid malpractice by the bogus firms, to weed out the mushroom growth of bogus firms and to cull out the authentic and correct information from Chartered Accountants taking note of the discrepancies that were experienced by the Institute and C &amp; AG during the previous years, 1 am unable to appreciate the contention of Mr. Datar that the impugned requirement of details and documents are attracted by Heydon&#x27;s rule, as the Institute and C &amp; AG have not explained the mischief in the existing system.</span> Similarly, the argument of Mr. Datar, placing reliance on the decision in Kishori Lal Minocha&#x27;s case (supra), that the requirement of the details and documents by the Institute and C &amp; AG has no authority of law, cannot be accepted, as the source of authority for such decision is distinctly traceable under the provisions of the Act, read with sections 226 and 619.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">49. In my well-considered opinion, audition of the Nationalised Banks/ Regional Rural Banks and the Public Sector Undertakings is a matter of statutory necessity. It has a direct bearing on the financial and economic management of the country. As the allotment of such audit by RBI and C &amp; AG, has a driving force in the country&#x27;s fiscal operation, the preparation of panel of the Chartered Accountants for such allotment has become an integral part of the statutory obligation of the concerned authorities. Discharging the vital role of empanelment of Chartered Accountants by the Institute and C &amp; AG, therefore, cannot be complained of as lacking statutory source of authority. Where the statutory and constitutional authorities, in exercise of their powers, are of the expert opinion that the existing system suffers from stigma and lacks required strength to fully integrate with the statutory demands and, therefore, the existing framework needs complete renovation to suit the statutory requirements, the efforts of the Institute and the C &amp; AG to develop and strengthen the institutional facilities and infrastructure in order to provide a &#x27;Zero Detect &#x27;panel of auditors as per the statutory requirements, cannot be said to be devoid of nexus. If a particular system is found to be defective, by experience, no arbitrariness, much less perversity, could be attributed in removing such defects and finding a solution for giving equal opportunity to all similarly placed Chartered Accountants. Our intelligentsia should not be either misunderstood or underestimated, as many Indians have proved equally good or excelled whenever and wherever they are given equal opportunity. The defects observed, by experience, in the existing system, if warranted to be rectified, by an expert body, as Saner thought will always throw more light even on the same subject, and the consequential policy decision intending to remove disparity among the similarly placed Chartered Accountants in order to provide adequate and equal opportunity to all qualified Chartered Accountants, cannot be quoted as arbitrary or perverse, attracting articles 14,19(1)(g) and 21. Failure to take such efforts by the Institute and the C &amp; AG alone would paralyse the progress in the system and cause stagnation in the financial and economic management of the country, which in turn, would affect the standard of living and quality of life from all concerns. I am, therefore, satisfied that there is a need to search for a remedial measure to rectify the defects in the existing system, which even if causes any inconvenience or hassles to some individuals, including the petitioners, the same will not, in any way, amount to violation of the fundamental rights conferred under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_258\">articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_259\">, 19(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_260\">21.</a>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_133\">50. Whether the details and documents required under the impugned application violates the principles of natural justice, and if so, to what extent, remains to be answered. If the &#x27;principles of reasonableness&#x27; are held to be the most active, conspicuous and substantial ground to challenge the action of the authorities on the substantive side, the violation of the principles of natural justice is equally a dynamic weapon to attack the action of the authorities on the procedural side. Of course, no one can complain of violation of principles of the natural justice in the matter of legislative or policy-making powers of the State or the authorities. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to complain for want of any opportunity, much less reasonable opportunity, against the impugned policy decision of the Institute and C &amp; AG. Argued Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, that the petitioners are not entitled for an opportunity before refusing to empanel them for want of details and documents, as such rejection is only ministerial in nature. Of course, the ministerial act can be performed in a given set of facts and in a prescribed manner, in obedience of the mandate of law, without having regard to his own judgment on the propriety of the act of being done and, therefore, the ministerial duty is simply an administrative duty, which could be exercised without any discretion. In other words, the discretionary act is distinguishable from that of a ministerial act as the discretionary act requires to be exercised, not as a matter of routine, but it should stand to the test of reasonableness in the Wednesbury sense and in compliance it the principles of natural justice. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1887454\" id=\"span_60\">Even though Mr. N.R. Chandran, the learned senior counsel, rightly contends that there is no compulsion for the petitioners to apply for empanelment, not- the empanelment, b &#x27; v itself, will confer any right for allotment of audit, it cannot be concluded that the petitioners are not aggrieved in any way, by not being empanelled out rightly, as the right of allotment of audit flows from empanelment. Thus, in my considered opinion, the principles of natural justice come in aid of the petitioners, where their right to be considered for allotment, by not being on the panel, is at stake and, therefore, the petitioners are entitled to be ensured with a reasonable opportunity by the Institute and C &amp; AG before the petitioners are refused to be empanelled. The principles of natural justice are violated, not while the Institute and C &amp; AG take a policy decision requiring the particulars under the impugned application form, but when refusing them empanelment for want of all or any of the particulars, as required under the impugned application form, as such refusal, ultimately offends the right of Chartered Accountants to be considered for allotment of audit, guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_261\">article 19(1)(g).</a> Hence, the compliance of the principles of naturaI justice in the matter of empanelment cannot be lightly disregarded, as the empanelment, even if it does not confer any right for allotment still confers a right for being considered for allotment by being on the panel, and the same is definitely protected within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_262\">article 19(1)(g)</a>, as held in <a href=\"/doc/1887454/\" id=\"a_263\">Moliallitnad Shuiat Ah</a>&#x27;s case (supra). Therefore, such right to be considered for allotment of audit by being on the panel, as guaranteed tinder <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_264\">article 19(1)(g)</a>, necessarily mandates the Institute and C &amp; AG to provide an opportunity to the petitioners if the information furnished by thein is found to be incorrect, before refusing to empanel them, as rightly weighed by the C &amp; AG. Denial of such opportunity to the petitioners by the Institute before refusing them empanelment for want of details and documents required in the impugned application, in my opinion, violates the principles of natural justice.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">51.
