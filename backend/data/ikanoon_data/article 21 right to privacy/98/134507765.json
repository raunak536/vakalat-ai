These rights\n                  are recognised by the Constitution as inhering in each individual as an\n                  intrinsic and inseparable part of the human element which dwells within;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                  (C) Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from\n                  the guarantee of life and personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">                  Elements of privacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets of\n                  freedom and dignity recognised and guaranteed by the fundamental rights\n                  contained in Part III;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">                  (D) Judicial recognition of the existence of a constitutional right of privacy is\n                  not an exercise in the nature of amending the Constitution nor is the Court\n                  embarking on a constitutional function of that nature which is entrusted to\n                  Parliament;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                  (E) Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. Privacy has both a\n                  normative and descriptive function. At a normative level privacy sub-serves\n                  those eternal values upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom\n                  are founded. At a descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of\n                  entitlements and interests which lie at the foundation of ordered liberty;\n\n                  (F) Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the\n                  sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation.\n                  Privacy also connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual\n                  autonomy and recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects\n                  of his or her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to\n                  privacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and\n                  diversity of our culture. While the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary\n                  from the intimate zone to the private zone and from the private to the public\n                  arenas, it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered\n                  merely because the individual is in a public place. Privacy attaches to the\n                  person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the human being;\n\n                  (G) This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive enumeration or a\n                  catalogue of entitlements or interests comprised in the right to privacy. The\n                  Constitution must evolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the\n                  challenges thrown up in a democratic order governed by the rule of law. The\n                  meaning of the Constitution cannot be frozen on the perspectives present\n                  when it was adopted. Technological change has given rise to concerns which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">8</span>\n    Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 dated 24.08.2017.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                                       13</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                         Criminal Appeal No. 18 of 2016</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99734213\" id=\"span_47\"><a href=\"/doc/99734213/\" id=\"a_68\">Rabin Burman v. State of Sikkim</a>\n\n      were not present seven decades ago and the rapid growth of technology may\n      render obsolescent many notions of the present. Hence the interpretation of\n      the Constitution must be resilient and flexible to allow future generations to\n      adapt its content bearing in mind its basic or essential features;\n\n      (H) Like other rights which form part of the fundamental freedoms protected\n      by Part III, including the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 21</a>,\n      privacy is not an absolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will\n      have to withstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental\n      rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 21</a> an invasion of privacy must be justified on\n      the basis of a law which stipulates a procedure which is fair, just and\n      reasonable. The law must also be valid with reference to the encroachment on\n      life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21.</a> An invasion of life or personal liberty\n      must meet the three -fold requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the\n      existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate state aim; and (iii)\n      proportionality which ensures a rational nexus between the objects and the\n      means adopted to achieve them; and (I) Privacy has both positive and\n      negative content. The negative content restrains the state from committing\n      an intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive content\n      imposes an obligation on the state to take all necessary measures to protect\n      the privacy of the individual.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">      4 Decisions rendered by this Court subsequent to Kharak Singh, upholding the\n      right to privacy would be read subject to the above principles.\n\n      5 Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to\n      privacy in an age of information can originate not only from the state but\n      from non -state actors as well. We commend to the Union Government the\n      need to examine and put into place a robust regime for data protection. The\n      creation of such a regime requires a careful and sensitive balance between\n      individual interests and legitimate concerns of the state. The legitimate aims\n      of the state would include for instance protecting national security, preventing\n      and investigating crime, encouraging innovation and the spread of knowledge,\n      and preventing the dissipation of social welfare benefits. These are matter s\n      of policy to be considered by the Union government while designing a\n      carefully structured regime for the protection of the data. Since the Union\n      government has informed the Court that it has constituted a Committee\n      chaired by Hon&#x27;ble Shri Justice B N Sri krishna, former Judge of this Court, for\n      that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with appropriately by the Union\n      government having due regard to what has been set out in this judgment....&quot;\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">30.          <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of India, inter alia, provides\n\n  that the State shall in particular direct its policy towards securing\n\n  that the tender age of children are not abused and their childhood\n\n  and youth are protected against exploitation and they are given\n\n  facilities to developed in a healthy manner and in conditions of\n\n  freedom and dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">31.

In re: Ms. Eera Through Dr. Manjula Krippendorf v. State\n\n  (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) &amp; Anr.1 (supra) the Apex Court held:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">        &quot;18. The purpose of referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons and\n        the Preamble of the POCSO Act is to appreciate that the very purpose of\n        bringing a legislation of the present nature is to protect the children from the\n        sexual assault, harassment and exploitation, and to secure the best interest of\n        the child. On an avid and diligent discernment of the preamble, it is manifest\n        that it recognizes the necessity of the right to privacy and confidentiality of a\n        child to be protected and respected by every person by all means and through\n        all stages of a judicial process involving the child. Best interest and well being\n        are regarded as being of paramount importance at every stage to ensure the\n        healthy physical, emotional, intellectual and social development of the child.\n        There is also a stipulation that sexual exploitation and sexual abuse are\n        heinous offences and need to be effectively addressed. The statement of\n        objects and reasons provides regard being had to the constitutional mandate,\n        to direct its policy towards securing that the tender age of children is not\n        abused and their childhood is protected against exploitation and they are\n        given facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom\n        and dignity. There is also a mention which is quite significant that interest of\n        the child, both as a victim as well as a witness, needs to be protected. The\n        stress is on providing child-friendly procedure. Dignity of the child has been\n        laid immense emphasis in the scheme of legislation. Protection and interest\n        occupy the seminal place in the text of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_77\">POCSO Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151036912\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99734213\" id=\"span_52\">35.
