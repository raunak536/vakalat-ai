The acquittal of the accused further\n          strengthens the presumption of innocence;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">          8.2. The Appellate Court, while hearing an\n\n\n\n\n\n          appeal against acquittal, is entitled to re-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">          appreciate  the oral     and   documentary\n          evidence;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">          8.3. The Appellate Court, while deciding an\n\n          appeal against acquittal, after re-appreciating\n\n          the evidence, is required to consider whether\n          the view taken by the Trial Court is a possible\n          view which could have been taken on the\n          basis of the evidence on record;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">          8.4. If the view taken is a possible view, the\n          Appellate Court cannot overturn the order of\n          acquittal on the ground that another view was\n          also possible; and\n\n\n\n\n          8.5. The Appellate Court can interfere with the\n\n\n\n\n\n          order of acquittal only if it comes to a finding\n          that the only conclusion which can be\n          recorded on the basis of the evidence on\n\n\n\n\n\n          record was that the guilt of the accused was\n          proved beyond a reasonable doubt and no\n          other conclusion was possible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">        9. Normally, when an Appellate Court exercises\n        appellate jurisdiction, the duty of the Appellate\n        Court is to find out whether the verdict which is\n        under challenge is correct or incorrect in law\n        and on facts. The Appellate Court normally\n        ascertains whether the decision under challenge\n        is legal or illegal. But while dealing with an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                       ::: Downloaded on - 25/09/2024 20:31:47 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                    11</span>\n                        Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:9093 )\n\n\n\n\n        appeal against acquittal, the Appellate Court\n        cannot examine the impugned judgment only to\n\n\n\n\n                                                          .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">        find out whether the view taken was correct or\n\n\n\n\n\n        incorrect. After re-appreciating the oral and\n        documentary evidence, the Appellate Court\n\n\n\n\n\n        must first decide whether the Trial Court&#x27;s view\n        was a possible view. The Appellate Court cannot\n        overturn acquittal only on the ground that after\n        re-appreciating evidence, it is of the view that\n\n\n\n\n\n        the guilt of the accused was established beyond\n        a reasonable doubt. Only by recording such a\n        conclusion an order of acquittal cannot be\n\n        reversed    unless      the   Appellate       Court       also\n\n        concludes    that    it    was    the     only      possible\n        conclusion. Thus, the Appellate Court must see\n        whether the view taken by the Trial Court while\n\n\n\n        acquitting an accused can be reasonably taken\n        on the basis of the evidence on record. If the\n\n\n\n\n        view taken by the Trial Court is a possible view,\n        the Appellate Court cannot interfere with the\n\n\n\n\n\n        order of acquittal on the ground that another\n        view could have been taken.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">        10. There is one more aspect of the matter. In\n        many   cases,     the     learned    Trial    Judge       who\n        eventually passes the order of acquittal has an\n        occasion to record the oral testimony of all\n        material witnesses. Thus, in such cases, the Trial\n        Court has the additional advantage of closely\n        observing the prosecution witnesses and their\n        demeanour. While deciding about the reliability\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                         ::: Downloaded on - 25/09/2024 20:31:47 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                          12</span>\n                              Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:9093 )\n\n\n\n\n                of the version of prosecution witnesses, their\n                demeanour remains in the back of the mind of\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">                the learned Trial Judge. As observed in the\n\n\n\n\n\n                commentary by Sarkar on the Law of Evidence,\n                the demeanour of a witness frequently furnishes\n\n\n\n\n\n                a clue to the weight of his testimony. This aspect\n                has to be borne in mind while dealing with an\n                appeal against acquittal.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">    18.         Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the\n\n    scope of interference by an Appellate Court for reversing\n\n    the judgment of acquittal rendered by the learned trial\n\n    Court has to be exercised within the four-corners of the\n\n    following principles:-\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                a)     That the judgment of acquittal suffers\n                       from patent perversity;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                b)     That   the    same     is   based    on\n\n\n\n\n                       misreading/omission to consider material\n                       evidence on record;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                c)     That no two views are possible and only\n                       the view consistent with the guilt of the\n                       accused is possible from the evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n                       available on record.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                d)     The Appellate Court in order to\n                       interference with the judgment of\n                       acquittal would have to record pertinent\n                       findings on the above factors, if it is\n                       inclined to reverse the judgment of\n                       acquittal rendered by the trial Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">    19.

At the outset, it needs to be observed that\n\n\n\n\n\n    rape is the most morally and physically reprehensible\n\n\n\n\n\n    crime in a society, as it is an assault on the body, mind\n\n    and privacy of the victim. While a murderer destroys\n\n    the physical frame of the victim, a rapist degrades and\n\n    defiles the soul of a helpless female. Rape reduces a\n\n    woman to an animal, as it shakes the very core of her\n\n    life. By no means can a rape victim be called an\n\n    accomplice.
