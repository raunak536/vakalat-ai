The petitioner relies upon the instructions issued by the\n\nCentral Government on 18.5.1966 laying down that a government\n\nservant should not canvass or otherwise interfere with or use his\n\ninfluence in connection with or take part in an election to any\n\nLegislature or Local authority. The petitioner also relies upon another\n\ninstructions dated 30.11.1966 to submit that participation in the activities\n\nof RSS would attract the provisions of Rule 5 of the Rules of 1964. The\n\ninstructions issued by Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs\n\nvide Memo No.25/59/52-Estt, dated the 30th June, 1955 read as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                    &quot;(5)   Government servant proposing/seconding the\n                    nomination of a candidate at an election or acting as\n                    polling agent, not permissible - Attention is invited to\n                    Rule 5 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       5</span>\n\n\n\n\n                  which lays down that a Government servant should not\n                  canvass or otherwise interfere or use his influence in\n                  connection with, or take part in, any election to a\n                  legislative body.

Many affidavits and returns have been filed from time to\n\ntime by different set of respondents, but in return filed on 2.8.2016 on\n\nbehalf of respondent No.10 an objection has been raised that the petition\n\nin public interest is not maintainable. Reliance is placed upon judgments\n\nreported as <a href=\"/doc/161999/\" id=\"a_1\">State of Uttaranchal Vs.

After arguments were addressed by the Learned Counsel for\n\nthe parties, learned counsel for the petitioner sought adjournment to file\n\nrejoinder. Such request is declined for the reason that the returns were\n\nfiled in the month of February, March or August 2016, but for more than\n\na year, no rejoinder was filed. We see no reason to grant any time to file\n\nrejoinder, as on the basis of pleadings in the writ petition itself, we find\n\nthat the same is not maintainable, for the reasons recorded hereinafter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">10.          The petitioner has sought action against respondent Nos. 7\n\nto 9, all of them are employees of Government or its agencies or\n\ninstrumentalities. We find that when petitioner seeks action against the\n\nemployees of the Central or State Government or Corporations, public\n\ninterest litigation is not maintainable. The initiation of disciplinary\n\nproceedings against an employee is prerogative of the employer. The\n\nmatter relating to appointment, promotion, seniority and disciplinary\n\naction are all different facets of service matter.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                         7</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">11.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1830927\" id=\"span_9\">In a Judgment reported as <a href=\"/doc/1830927/\" id=\"a_3\">Janata Dal Vs. H.S.\n\nChoudhary</a>, (1992) 4 SCC 305, the scope and purpose of public interest\n\nlitigation was dealt with. It was held that the courts have to be careful to\n\nsee that the member of the public, who approaches the court in public\n\ninterest is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or\n\npolitical motivation or other oblique consideration. The court must not\n\nallow its process to be abused by politicians and others to delay\n\nlegitimate administrative action or to gain a political objective.

The court must not allow its process to\n                    be abused by politicians and others to delay legitimate\n                    administrative action or to gain a political objective.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">             95.    However, Venkataramiah, J.

There are many such matters\n                    in which have no &#x27;locus standi&#x27; to ask for relief. By way\n                    of illustration, lawyers cannot question the\n                    establishment of a new court on the ground that their\n                    professional prospects would be affected thereby. .... &quot;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">97.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112850760\" id=\"span_11\">In short, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_4\">S.P.

While this Court has laid down a chain of notable decisions\nwith all emphasis at their command about the importance and\nsignificance of this newly developed doctrine of PIL, it has also\nhastened to sound a red alert and a note of severe warning that\ncourts should not allow its process to be abused by a mere\nbusybody or a meddlesome interloper or wayfarer or officious\nintervener without any interest or concern except for personal gain\nor private profit or other oblique consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">109.   It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide and\nhaving sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have\na locus standi and can approach the Court to wipe out the tears of\nthe poor and needy, suffering from violation of their fundamental\nrights, but not a person for personal gain or private profit or\npolitical motive or any oblique consideration.

The\n                   other interesting aspect is that in the PILs, official\n                   documents are being annexed without even indicating\n                   as to how the petitioner came to possess them. In one\n                   case, it was noticed that an interesting answer was\n                   given as to its possession.

In fact, as has\n             been seen, even the people who are in service for their seniority\n             and promotion have preferred public interest litigations.

Privacy postulates\n            the reservation of a private space for the individual, described as\n            the right to be let alone. The concept is founded on the autonomy\n            of the individual. The ability of an individual to make choices\n            lies at the core of the human personality. The notion of privacy\n            enables the individual to assert and control the human element\n            which is inseparable from the personality of the individual. The\n            inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in the\n            ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human life. The\n            autonomy of the individual is associated over matters which can\n            be kept private. These are concerns over which there is a\n            legitimate expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are\n            inseparable elements of the human personality. The integrity of\n            the body and the sanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation\n            that each individual possesses an inalienable ability and right to\n            preserve a private space in which the human personality can\n            develop. Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of\n            the personality would be in doubt. Recognizing a zone of privacy\n            is but an acknowledgment that each individual must be entitled\n            to chart and pursue the course of development of personality.\n            Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts\n            and behavioural patterns which are intimate to an individual are\n            entitled to a zone of privacy where one is free of social\n            expectations. In that zone of privacy, an individual is not judged\n            by others. Privacy enables each individual to take crucial\n            decisions which find expression in the human personality. It\n            enables     individuals   to    preserve   their   beliefs,   thoughts,\n            expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices against\n            societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic\n            recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be\n            different and to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a\n            zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\n            searching glare of publicity in matters which are personal to his\n            or her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to the place\n            where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the foundation of all\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                             17</span>\n\n\n\n\nliberty because it is in privacy that the individual can decide how\nliberty is best exercised. Individual dignity and privacy are\ninextricably linked in a pattern woven out of a thread of diversity\ninto the fabric of a plural culture.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">169.    Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity.\nDignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an\nintrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement or a\nconstitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental\nfacet, dignity and freedom are inseparably inter-twined, each\nbeing a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability of the\nindividual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realization of\nthe full value of life and liberty. ....... .      The freedoms under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to\ndecide upon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have a choice of\npreferences on various facets of life including what and how one\nwill eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a\nmyriad other matters on which autonomy and self-determination\nrequire a choice to be made within the privacy of the mind. The\nconstitutional right to the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 25</a>\nhas implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom\nto express or not express those choices to the world. These are\nsome illustrations of the manner in which privacy facilitates\nfreedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The\nConstitution does not contain a separate article telling us that\nprivacy has been declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have\nwe tagged the provisions of Part III with an alpha suffixed right\nof privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot\nexist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values\nof life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has\nrecognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of\nthe individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across\nthe spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the\nindividual a zone of choice and self-determination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">-       Privacy represents the core of the human personality and\nrecognizes the ability of each individual to make choices and to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                            18</span>\n\n\n\n\ntake decisions governing matters intimate and personal. Yet, it is\nnecessary to acknowledge that individuals live in communities\nand work in communities. Their personalities affect and, in turn\nare shaped by their social environment. The individual is not a\nhermit. The lives of individuals are as much a social\nphenomenon. In their interactions with others, individuals are\nconstantly engaged in behavioural patterns and in relationships\nimpacting on the rest of society. Equally, the life of the\nindividual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social\nvalues imbibed from living in the community. This state of flux\nwhich represents a constant evolution of individual personhood\nin the relationship with the rest of society provides the rationale\nfor reserving to the individual a zone of repose. The lives which\nindividuals lead as members of society engender a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. The notion of a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy has elements both of a subjective and objective nature.\nPrivacy at a subjective level is a reflection of those areas where\nan individual desire to be left alone. On an objective plane,\nprivacy is defined by those constitutional values which shape the\ncontent of the protected zone where the individual ought to be\nleft alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the\nindividual has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the other, the\nexercise of individual choices is subject to the rights of others to\nlead orderly lives. For instance, an individual who possesses a\nplot of land may decide to build upon it subject to zoning\nregulations. If the building bye laws define the area upon which\nconstruction can be raised or the height of the boundary wall\naround the property, the right to privacy of the individual is\nconditioned by regulations designed to protect the interests of the\ncommunity in planned spaces. Hence while the individual is\nentitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only on the\nsubjective expectation of the individual but on an objective\nprinciple which defines a reasonable expectation.</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">\nT: Our Conclusions\n\n               xxx                    xxx             xxx\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                       19</span>\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                   (F) Privacy includes at its core the preservation of\n                   personal intimacies, the sanctity of family life,\n                   marriage, procreation,     the home and sexual\n                   orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be left\n                   alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and\n                   recognises the ability of the individual to control\n                   vital aspects of his or her life. Personal choices\n                   governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                   Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the\n                   plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\n                   legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the\n                   intimate zone to the private zone and from the\n                   private to the public arenas, it is important to\n                   underscore that privacy is not lost or surrendered\n                   merely because the individual is in a public place.\n                   Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential\n                   facet of the dignity of the human being;......... &quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">20.          In the aforesaid judgment, it has been held that the privacy\n\npostulates reservation of a private space for an individual, described as\n\nright to be let alone. In such right, the autonomy of the individual is\n\nassociated over matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\n\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The individuals\n\nhave right to preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideals,\n\nideologies, preferences and choices against societal demands of\n\nhomogeneity. The liberty ensured under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> enables an individual\n\nto have a choice of preferences on various facets of life, including what\n\nand how one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse.\n\nSuch liberty will include right to meet a person of his choice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">21.

Though the officers had denied that they had met the Head of\n\nRSS, but we find that the larger issue as to whether a citizen, including a\n\nGovernment Officer, do have a right to meet any person. Has he has\n\nright of privacy to meet a person of his choice?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">22.          We find that a citizen of this Country including a\n\nGovernment employee has right to meet any person of his choice. A\n\nGovernment servant does not violate Rule 5 of the Conduct Rules, which\n\nprohibits that the Government servant should not canvass or otherwise\n\ninterfere or use his influence in connection with, or take part in, any\n\nelection to a legislative body. The meeting is said to have taken place in\n\nthe office of RSS at Keshav Kutir. Meeting a Head of a Group does not\n\nshow that such Government servant was canvassing or otherwise\n\ninterfering or using his influence in connection with any election. There\n\nis no allegation that the Government servant has influenced any of his\n\nsubordinates to vote in a particular manner. Therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat any Government servant has used his influence in connection with\n\nthe election. Every citizen, including Government servant, is a voter for\n\nelections to parliament, assembly, urban and rural local bodies. While\n\nexercising the right of vote, he obviously votes for one or the other\n\npolitical party. The Government servant is not prohibited to vote in the\n\nelections. Therefore, interaction by a Government servant with Head of a\n\ngroup cannot be said to be in violation of any Conduct Rules. By\n\nmeeting a Head of the Group, the Government servant is not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                       21</span>\n\n\n\n\nparticipating in the activities of RSS.
