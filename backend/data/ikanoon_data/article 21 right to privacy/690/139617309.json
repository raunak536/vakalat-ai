With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns of Ms. Pushpa Thadani, this\nCommission refers to the judgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India in SLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_7\">Girish Ramchandra\nDeshpande v. Central Information Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein, it has been\nheld as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n         censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n         as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The\n         performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily\n         a matter between the employee and the employer and normally\n         those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under\n         the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n         no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the\n         other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n         invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n         the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                        Page 2 of 6</span>\n           Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n          larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n          appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n          those details as a matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n          &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n          under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n          larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n          the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n          satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n          such information.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_4\">7.      Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger public\ninterest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated 11-06-2015\nrendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 8753 of 2013\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_11\">Shailesh Gandhi v. The Central Information Commission</a>, wherein, it\nhas been observed as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          &quot;16...The Petitioner possibly being aware of the said position has\n          therefore sought to contend that filing of the Income Tax Returns\n          is a public activity. I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n          misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n          imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n          which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n          said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n          fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n          unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_5\">8.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to\n      the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n      W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n      returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n      Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n      Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and information\n      provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my\n      view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited.

The\n     expression &quot;public activity&quot; would denote activity done for the public\n     and/or in some manner available for participation by public or some\n     section of public. There is no public activity involved in filing a\n     return or an individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held that the same\n     was justified &quot;in the larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144795012\" id=\"span_7\">9.
