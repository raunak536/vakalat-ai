It falls within the\njurisdiction of District administration. As far as restriction\nof movement of people/goods by horse cart/tongas is\nconcerned, there is no policy/guidelines to restrict the\nmovement. Such horse carts/tongas are allowed to enter\nafter thorough checking at SSB check-post to prevent\nsmuggling     of     contraband       items,    arms/ammunition,\nnarcotics, wildlife crime, human trafficking etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">11.         The respondent no.4 has filed the counter\naffidavit.

Learned     counsel       for    the    petitioner     has\nvehemently argued that the Indian authorities have failed\nto regulate the entry of horse carts/tonga entering from\nNepal to India. The horses are not medically examined. The\nfare and freight are not regulated. He has referred to the\ntreaty signed in the year 1991, revised in 2009. According\nto the treaty, the            contracting party may impose\nrestrictions for protecting public morals, protecting human,\nanimal and plant life, safeguarding national treasures. He\nhas also argued that there is overloading in the horse\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         5</span>\n\n\ncarts/tonga going from India to Nepal and vice-versa. The\nanimals are treated with cruelty. The horses are abandoned\nin the Indian Territory. He then argued that the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_1\">Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960</a> and the rules\nframed thereunder and the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/190092014/\" id=\"a_2\">Prevention and\nControl of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals\nAct, 2009</a> have not been enforced. He also argued that the\nanimals are transported in violation of Transport of\nAnimals Rules, 1978. The animals are transported on foot\nto long distances causing immense pain and suffering to\nthem. He also prayed that the entire animal kingdom may\nbe conferred status of legal entity/legal person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">13.          Learned Advocates for the respondents have\nargued that the SSB is undertaking necessary checking\nand frisking in the border areas. However, the SSB cannot\nmedically check-up the horses. It cannot prescribe the fare\nto be charged for carrying the passengers from Nepal to\nIndia and vice-versa. According to the respondent no.1, it is\nto be done by the District Administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">14.

Images according to Hindu authorities, are of two kinds: the\n      first is known as Sayambhu or self-existent or self-revealed, while the other\n      is Pratisthita or established. The Padma Purana says: &quot;the image of Hari\n      (God) prepared of stone earth, wood, metal or the like and established\n      according to the rites <a href=\"/doc/1891877/\" id=\"a_25\">laid down in</a> the Vedas, Smritis and Tantras is called\n      the established images...where the self- possessed Vishnu has placed\n      himself on earth in stone or wood for the benefit of mankind, that is styled\n      the self-revealed.&quot; (B.K. Mukherjea -Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable\n      Trusts: 5th Edn.) A Sayambhu or self-revealed image is a product of nature\n      and it is Anadi or without any beginning and the worshippers simply\n      discover its existence and such images do not require consecration or\n      Pratistha but a manmade image requires consecration. This manmade\n      image may be painted on a wall or canvas. The Salgram Shila depicts\n      Narayana being the Lord of the Lords and represents Vishnu Bhagwan. It is\n      a Shila - the shalagram form partaking the form of Lord of the Lords\n      Narayana and Vishnu.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">      16. The observations of the Division Bench has been in our view true to the\n      Shastras and we do lend our concurrence to the same. If the people believe\n      in the temples&#x27; religious efficacy no other requirement exists as regards\n      other areas and the learned Judge it seems has completely overlooked this\n      aspect of Hindu Shastras - In any event, Hindus have in Shastras &quot;Agni&quot;\n      Devta; &quot;Vayu&quot; Devta - these deities are shapeless and formless but for every\n      ritual Hindus offer their oblations before the deity. The Ahuti to the deity is\n      the ultimate - the learned Single Judge however was pleased not to put any\n      reliance thereon. It is not a particular image which is a juridical person but\n      it is a particular bent of mind which consecrate the image.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">      19. God is Omnipotent and Omniscient and its presence is felt not by\n      reason of a particular form or image but by reason of the presence of the\n      omnipotent: It is formless, it is shapeless and it is for the benefit of the\n      worshippers that there is manifestation in images of the Supreme Being.\n      &#x27;The Supreme Being has no attribute, which consists of pure spirit and\n      which is without a second being, i.e. God is the only Being existing in\n      reality, there is no other being in real existence excepting Him - (see in this\n      context Golap Chandra Sarkar, Sastri&#x27;s Hindu Law: 8th Edn.). It is the\n      human concept of the Lord of the Lords - it is the human vision of the Lord\n      of the Lords: How one sees the deity: how one feels the deity and recognises\n      the deity and then establishes the same in the temple upon however\n      performance of the consecration ceremony. Shastras do provide as to how to\n      consecrate and the usual ceremonies of Sankalpa and Utsarga shall have to\n      be performed for proper and effective dedication of the property to a deity\n      and in order to be termed as a juristic person. In the conception of\n      Debutter, two essential ideas are required to be performed: In the first\n      place, the property which is dedicated to the deity vests in an ideal sense in\n      the deity itself as a juristic person and in the second place, the personality\n      of the idol being linked up with natural personality of the shebait, being the\n      manager or being the Dharam karta and who is entrusted with the custody\n      of the idol and who is responsible otherwise for preservation of the property\n      of the idol. The Deva Pratistha Tatwa of Raghunandan and Matsya and Devi\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                           18</span>\n\n       Puranas though may not be uniform in its description as to how Pratistha\n       or consecration of image does take place but it is customary that the image\n       is first carried to the Snan Mandap and thereafter the founder utters the\n       Sankalpa Mantra and upon completion thereof, the image is given bath with\n       Holy water, Ghee, Dahi, Honey and Rose water and thereafter the oblation\n       to the sacred fire by which the Pran Pratistha takes place and the eternal\n       spirit is infused in that particular idol and the image is then taken to the\n       temple itself and the same is thereafter formally dedicated to the deity. A\n       simple piece of wood or stone may become the image or idol and divinity is\n       attributed to the same. As noticed above, it is formless, shapeless but it is\n       the human concept of a particular divine existence which gives it the shape,\n       the size and the colour. While it is true that the learned Single Judge has\n       quoted some eminent authors but in our view the same does not however,\n       lend any assistance to the matter in issue and the Principles of Hindu Law\n       seems to have been totally misread by the learned Single Judge.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">72.            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1478973\" id=\"span_22\">In AIR 2000 SC 1421, their Lordships of Hon.\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1478973/\" id=\"a_26\">&#x27;Shiromani Gurudwara\nPrabandhak Committee, Amritsar v. Shri Som Nath Dass &amp;\nothers</a>&#x27; have held that the concept &#x27;Juristic Person&#x27; arose\nout of necessities in the human development- Recognition\nof an entity as juristic person- is for subserving the needs\nand faith of society. In paragraph nos.11, 13 and 14, their\nLordships held as under: -</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">&quot;11. The very words &quot;Juristic Person&quot; connote recognition of an entity to be in law a\nperson which otherwise it is not. In other words, it is not an individual natural\nperson but an artificially created person which is to be recognised to be in law as\nsuch. When a person is ordinarily understood to be a natural person, it only means\na human person. Essentially, every human person is a person. If we trace the\nhistory of a &quot;Person&quot; in the various countries we find surprisingly it has projected\ndifferently at different times. In some countries even human beings were not\ntreated to be as persons in law. Under the Roman Law a &quot;Slave&quot; was not a person.\nHe had no right to a family. He was treated like an animal or chattel. In French\nColonies also, before slavery was abolished, the slaves were not treated to be legal\npersons. They were later given recognition as legal persons only through a statute.\nSimilarly, in the U.S. the African-Americans had no legal rights though they were\nnot treated as chattel.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">13. With the development of society, &#x27;where an individual&#x27;s interaction fell short, to\nupsurge social development, co-operation of a larger circle of individuals was\nnecessitated. Thus, institutions like corporations and companies were created, to\nhelp the society in achieving the desired result. The very Constitution of State,\nmunicipal corporation, company etc. are all creations of the law and these &quot;Juristic\nPersons&quot; arose out of necessities in the human development. In other words, they\nwere dressed in a cloak to be recognised in law to be a legal unit.\nCorpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LXV, page 40 says:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">Natural person. A natural person is a human being; a man, woman, or child, as\nopposed to a corporation, which has a certain personality impressed on it by law\nand is called an artificial person. In the C.J.S. definition &#x27;Person&#x27; it is stated that\nthe word &quot;person,&quot; in its primary sense, means natural person, but that the\ngenerally accepted meaning of the word as used in law includes natural persons\nand artificial, conventional, or juristic persons.\nCorpus Juris Secundum, Vol. VI, page 778 says:\nArtificial persons. Such as are created and devised by human laws for the purposes\nof society and government, which are called corporations or bodies politic.\nSalmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edn., 305 says:\nA legal person is any subject-matter other than a human being to which the law\nattributes personality. This extension, for good and sufficient reasons, of the\nconception of personality beyond the class of human being is one of the most\nnoteworthy feats of the legal imagination.... Legal persons, being the arbitrary\ncreations of the law, may be of as many kinds as the law pleases. Those which are\nactually recognised by our own system, however, are of comparatively few types.\nCorporations are undoubtedly legal persons, and the better view is that registered\ntrade unions and friendly societies are also legal persons though not verbally\nregarded as corporations. ... If, however, we take account of other systems than our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                            19</span>\n\nown, we find that the conception of legal personality is not so limited in its\napplication, and that there are several distinct varieties, of which three may be\nselected for special mention...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">1. The first class of legal persons consists of corporations, as already defined,\nnamely, those which are constituted by the personification of groups or series of\nindividuals. The individuals who thus form the corpus of the legal person are\ntermed its members....1\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">2. The second class is that in which the corpus, or object selected for\npersonification, is not a group or series of persons, but an institution. The law may,\nif it pleases, regard a church or a hospital, or a university, or a library, as a person.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">That is to say, it may attribute personality, not to any group of persons connected\nwith the institution, but to the institution itself....\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_111\">3. The third kind of legal person is that in which the corpus is some fund or estate\ndevoted to special uses - a charitable fund, for example or a trust estate...\nJurisprudence by Paton, 3rd Edn. page 349 and 350 says:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">It has already been asserted that legal personality is an artificial creation of the\nlaw. Legal persons are all entities capable of being right-and-duty-bearing units -\nall entities recognised by the law as capable of being parties to legal relationship.\nSalmond said: &#x27;So far as legal theory is concerned, a person is any being whom the\nlaw regards as capable of rights and duties...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">...Legal personality may be granted to entities other than individual human beings,\ne.g. a group of human beings, a fund, an idol. Twenty men may form a corporation\nwhich may sue and be sued in the corporate name. An idol may be regarded as a\nlegal persona in itself, or a particular fund may be incorporated. It is clear that\nneither the idol nor the fund can carry out the activities incidental to litigation or\nother activities incidental to the carrying on of legal relationships, e.g., the signing\nof a contract: and, of necessity, the law recognises certain human agents as\nrepresentatives of the idol or of the fund. The acts of such agents, however (within\nlimits set by the law and when they are acting as such), are imputed to the legal\npersona of the idol and are not the juristic acts of the human agents themselves.\nThis is no mere academic distinction, for it is the legal persona of the idol that is\nbound to the legal relationships created, not that of the agent. Legal personality\nthen refers to the particular device by which the law creates or recognizes units to\nwhich it ascribes certain powers and capacities.&quot; Analytical and Historical\nJurisprudence, 3rd Edn. At page 357 describes &quot;person&quot;;\nWe may, therefore, define a person for the purpose of jurisprudence as any entity\n(not necessarily a human being) to which rights or duties may be attributed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">14. Thus, it is well settled and confirmed by the authorities on jurisprudence and\nCourts of various countries that for a bigger thrust of socio-political-scientific\ndevelopment evolution of a fictional personality to be a juristic person became\ninevitable. This may be any entity, living inanimate, objects or things. It may be a\nreligious institution or any such useful unit which may impel the Courts to\nrecognise it. This recognition is for subserving the needs and faith of the society. A\njuristic person, like any other natural person is in law also conferred with rights\nand obligations and is dealt with in accordance with law. In other words, the entity\nacts like a natural person but only through a designated person, whose acts are\nprocessed within the ambit of law. When an idol, was recognised as a juristic\nperson, it was known it could not act by itself. As in the case of minor a guardian is\nappointed, so in the case of idol, a Shebait or manager is appointed to act on its\nbehalf. In that sense, relation between an idol and Shebait is akin to that of a\nminor and a guardian. As a minor cannot express himself, so the idol, but like a\nguardian, the Shebait and manager have limitations under which they have to act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">Similarly, where there is any endowment for charitable purpose it can create\ninstitutions like a church hospital, gurudwara etc. The entrustment of an endowed\nfund for a purpose can only be used by the person so entrusted for that purpose in\nas much as he receives it for that purpose alone in trust. When the donor endows\nfor an Idol or for a mosque or for any institution, it necessitates the creation of a\njuristic person. The law also circumscribes the rights of any person receiving such\nentrustment to use it only for the purpose of such a juristic person. The\nendowment may be given for various purposes, may be for a church, idol, gurdwara\nor such other things that the human faculty may conceive of, out of faith and\nconscience but it gains the status of juristic person when it is recognised by the\nsociety as such.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"608365\" id=\"span_24\">73.

Pain informs an animal\nwhich stimuli it needs to avoid and suffering informs it\nabout a situation to avoid. Their Lordships have held that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                          21</span>\n\n\nevery species has a right to life and security, subject to the\nlaw of the land, which includes depriving its life, out of\nhuman necessity. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, while\nsafeguarding the rights of humans, protects life and the\nword &quot;life&quot; has been given an expanded definition and any\ndisturbance from the basic environment which includes all\nforms of life, including animal life, which are necessary for\nhuman life, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution.

Duties of persons having charge of animals.--It shall be the duty of every\n      person having the care or charge of any animal to take all reasonable\n      measures to ensure the well-being of such animal and to prevent the\n      infliction upon such animal of unnecessary pain or suffering.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">  36. We will now examine whether the second limb of <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 3</a> which casts a\n  duty on the person in charge or care of animal to prevent the infliction upon an\n  animal, unnecessary pain or suffering, discharges that duty. Considerations,\n  which are relevant to determine whether the suffering is unnecessary, include\n  whether the suffering could have reasonably been avoided or reduced, whether\n  the conduct which caused the suffering was in compliance with any relevant\n  enactment. Another aspect to be examined is whether the conduct causing the\n  suffering was for a legitimate purpose, such as, the purpose for benefiting the\n  animals or the purpose of protecting a person, property or another animal, etc.\n  Duty is to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering, meaning\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                      22</span>\n\nthereby, no right is conferred to inflict necessary/unnecessary pain or suffering\non the animals. By organising Jallikattu and bullock cart race, the organisers\nare not preventing the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering, but they are\ninflicting pain and suffering on the bulls, which they are legally obliged to\nprevent. <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 3</a> is a preventive provision casting no right on the organisers,\nbut only duties and obligations. <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3</a>, as already indicated, confers\ncorresponding rights on the animals as against the persons in charge or care,\nas well as AWBI, to ensure their well-being and be not inflicted with any\nunnecessary pain or suffering. Jallikattu or bullock cart race, from the point of\nthe animals, is not an event ensuring their well-being or an event meant to\nprevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering, on the contrary, it is an\nevent against their well-being and causes unnecessary pain and suffering on\nthem. Hence, the two limbs of <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3</a> of the PCA Act have been violated while\nconducting Jallikattu and bullock cart race.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">40. Pain and suffering are biological traits. Pain, in particular, informs an\nanimal which specific stimuli, it needs to avoid and an animal has pain\nreceptors and a memory that allows it to remember what caused the pain.\nProfessor of Animal Welfare, D.M. Broom of the University of Cambridge in his\narticles appearing in chapter fourteen of the book Animal Welfare and the Law,\nCambridge University Press (1989) says:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">             &quot;Behavioural responses to pain vary greatly from one species to\n             another, but it is reasonable to suppose that the pain felt by all of\n             these animals is similar to that felt by man.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">Suffering has the same function, but instead of informing the animal about\nstimuli to avoid, it informs it about a situation to avoid. An animal might be\nregarded as suffering, if it is in pain, distress, or acute or unduly prolonged\ndiscomfort. Consequently, to experience the suffering, the animal needs an\nawareness of its environment, the ability to develop moods that coordinate a\nbehavioural response, and the capacity to change adverse situation or avoid\nthem. Reports submitted by AWBI clearly indicate that bulls are being treated\nwith extreme cruelty and suffering, violating the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/101749505/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 11(1)</a> of\nthe PCA Act. Over and above, <a href=\"/doc/101749505/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 11(1)</a> clauses (b) to (o) also confer various\nduties and obligations, generally and specifically, on the persons in charge of or\ncare of animals which, in turn, confer corresponding rights on animals, which,\nif violated, are punishable under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/101749505/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 11(1)</a> of the PCA Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">55.

No\n             creature is superior to any other. Human beings should not be above\n             nature. Let no one species encroach over the rights and privileges of\n             other species.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">In our view, this is the culture and tradition of the country, particularly the\nStates of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">56. <a href=\"/doc/374796/\" id=\"a_46\">The PCA Act</a> has been enacted with an object to safeguard the welfare of the\nanimals and evidently to cure some mischief and age old practices, so as to\nbring into effect some type of reform, based on eco-centric principles,\nrecognising the intrinsic value and worth of animals. All the same, the Act has\ntaken care of the religious practices of the community, while killing an animal\nvide <a href=\"/doc/149960518/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 28</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">International approach to animals welfare\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">57. We may, at the outset, indicate unfortunately, there is no international\nagreement that ensures the welfare and protection of animals. The United\nNations, all these years, safeguarded only the rights of human beings, not the\nrights of other species like animals, ignoring the fact that many of them,\nincluding bulls, are sacrificing their lives to alleviate human suffering,\ncombating diseases and as food for human consumption. International\ncommunity should hang their head in shame, for not recognising their rights all\nthese ages, a species which served the humanity from the time of Adam and\nEve. Of course, there has been a slow but observable shift from the\nanthropocentric approach to a more nature&#x27;s rights centric approach in\ninternational environmental law, animal welfare laws, etc. Environmentalist\nnoticed three stages in the development of international environmental law\ninstrument, which are as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">(a) The First Stage: Human self-interest reason for environmental\nprotection\n57.1. The instruments in this stage were fuelled by the recognition that the\nconservation of nature was in the common interest of all mankind.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_124\">57.2. Some of the instruments executed during this time included the\nDeclaration of the Protection of Birds Useful to Agriculture (1875), Convention\nDesigned to Ensure the Protection of Various Species of Wild Animals which are\nUseful to Man or Inoffensive (1900), Convention for the Regulation of Whaling\n(1931) which had the objective of ensuring the health of the whaling industry\nrather than conserving or protecting the whale species.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                        23</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">57.3. The attitude behind these treaties was the assertion of an unlimited right\nto exploit natural resources--which derived from their right as sovereign\nnations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">(b) The Second Stage: International Equity\n57.4. This stage saw the extension of treaties beyond the requirements of the\npresent generation to also meet the needs of future generations of human\nbeings. This shift signalled a departure from the pure tenets of\nanthropocentrism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">57.5. For example, the 1946 Whaling Convention which built upon the 1931\ntreaty mentioned in the Preamble that &quot;it is in the interest of the nations of the\nworld to safeguard for future generations the great natural resource\nrepresented by the whale stocks&quot;. Similarly, the Stockholm Declaration of the\nUN embodied this shift in thinking, stating that &quot;man ... bears a solemn\nresponsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future\ngenerations&quot; and subsequently asserts that &quot;the natural resources of the earth\n... must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations\nthrough careful planning and management&quot;. Other documents expressed this\nshift in terms of sustainability and sustainable development.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">(c) The Third Stage: Nature&#x27;s own rights\n57.6. Recent multinational instruments have asserted the intrinsic value of\nnature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">57.7. UNEP Biodiversity Convention (1992) &quot;Conscious of the intrinsic value of\nbiological diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic, educational,\ncultural, recreational and aesthetic values of biological diversity and its\ncomponents ... [we have] agreed as follows: ....&quot; The World Charter for Nature\nproclaims that &quot;every form of life is unique, warranting respect regardless of its\nworth to man&quot;. The Charter uses the term &quot;nature&quot; in preference to\n&quot;environment&quot; with a view to shifting to non-anthropocentric human-\nindependent terminology.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1081254\" id=\"span_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1725193\" id=\"span_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1725193\" id=\"span_32\">58.

Protection of animals has been guaranteed by the\nConstitution of Germany by way of an amendment in 2002 when the words\n&quot;and the animals&quot; were added to the constitutional clauses that obliges &quot;State&quot;\nto respect &quot;animal dignity&quot;. Therefore, the dignity of the animals is\nconstitutionally recognised in that country. German Animal Welfare Law,\nespecially <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 3</a> provides far-reaching protections to animals including inter\nalia from animals fight and other activities which may result in the pain,\nsuffering and harm for the animals. Countries like Switzerland, Austria,\nSlovenia have enacted legislations to include animal welfare in their national\nConstitutions so as to balance the animal owners&#x27; fundamental rights to\nproperty and the animals&#x27; interest in freedom from unnecessary suffering or\npain, damage and fear.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">60. The Animals Welfare Act of 2006 (UK) also confers considerable protection\nto the animals from pain and suffering. The Austrian Federal Animal Protection\nAct also recognises man&#x27;s responsibilities towards his fellow creatures and the\nsubject &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1726510/\" id=\"a_52\">Federal Act</a>&quot; aims at the protection of life and well-being of the\nanimals. The Animal Welfare Act, 2010 (Norway) states:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">              &quot;3. General requirement regarding the treatment of animals.--\n              Animals have an intrinsic value which is irrespective of the usable\n              value they may have for man.

Training, showing, entertaining and competition.--Any person\n              who trains animals and who uses animals which are used for\n              showing, entertainment and competitions, including those who\n              organise such activities, shall ensure that the animals:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">              (a)-(c)         *       *      *\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">              (d) are not trained for or used in fights with other animals or people.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">64. Chapter 7.1.2 of the Guidelines of OIE, recognises five internationally\nrecognised freedoms for animals, such as:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">    (i) freedom from hunger, thirst and malnutrition;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">    (ii) freedom from fear and distress;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">    (iii) freedom from physical and thermal discomfort;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">    (iv) freedom from pain, injury and disease; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">    (v) freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                   24</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) in its &quot;Legislative and Regulatory\nOptions for Animal Welfare&quot; indicated that these five freedoms found their\nplace in Farm Welfare Council 2009 UK and is also called &quot;Brambell&#x27;s Five\nFreedoms&quot;. These five freedoms, as already indicated, are considered to be\nthe fundamental principles of animal welfare and we can say that these\nfreedoms find a place in <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_54\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1763700/\" id=\"a_55\">11</a> of the PCA Act and they are for\nanimals like the rights guaranteed to the citizens of this country under Part\nIII of the Constitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">65. Animals are worldwide legally recognised as &quot;property&quot; that can be\npossessed by humans. On deletion of <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19(1)(f)</a> from the Indian\nConstitution, right to property is (sic no) more a fundamental right in India,\nthis gives Parliament more a leeway to pass laws protecting the rights of\nanimals. Right to hold on to a property which includes animals also, is now\nonly a legal right not a fundamental right. We have also to see the rights of\nanimals in that perspective as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">66. Rights guaranteed to the animals under <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_57\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1763700/\" id=\"a_58\">11</a>, etc. are only\nstatutory rights. The same have to be elevated to the status of fundamental\nrights, as has been done by few countries around the world, so as to secure\ntheir honour and dignity. Rights and freedoms guaranteed to the animals\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1763700/\" id=\"a_60\">11</a> have to be read along with <a href=\"/doc/1644544/\" id=\"a_61\">Articles 51-A(g)</a> and (h)\nof the Constitution, which is the magna carta of animal rights.\nHumanism\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">68. <a href=\"/doc/560422/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 51-A(h)</a> says that it shall be the duty of every citizen to develop\nthe scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.\nParticular emphasis has been made to the expression &quot;humanism&quot; which\nhas a number of meanings, but increasingly designates as an inclusive\nsensibility for our species. Humanism also means, to understand\nbenevolence, compassion, mercy, etc. Citizens should, therefore, develop a\nspirit of compassion and humanism which is reflected in the Preamble of\nthe PCA Act as well as in <a href=\"/doc/1243675/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1763700/\" id=\"a_64\">11</a> of the Act.

Contemporary\n      public concern for protecting nature&#x27;s ecological equilibrium should lead to\n      the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own\n      preservation. See Stone, Should Trees Have Standing? -- Toward Legal\n      Rights for Natural Objects, 45 S. Cal. L. Rev. 450 (1972). This suit would\n      therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v.

The corporation\n      sole -- a creature of ecclesiastical law -- is an acceptable adversary and large\n      fortunes ride on its cases.

The river as plain-tiff speaks for the ecological\n      unit of life that is part of it. Those people who have a meaning-ful relation to\n      that body of water -- whether it be a fisherman, a canoeist, a zoologist, or a\n      logger -- must be able to speak for the values which the river represents and\n      which are threatened with destruction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">      Mineral King is doubtless like other wonders of the Sierra Nevada such as\n      Tuolumne Meadows and the John Muir Trail.

Those who have that intimate relation with the inanimate object\n      about to be injured, polluted, or other-wise despoiled are its legitimate\n      spokesmen.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">      The voice of the inanimate object, therefore, should not be stilled. That does\n      not mean that the judiciary takes over the managerial functions from the\n      federal agency. It merely means that before these price-less bits of\n      Americana (such as a valley, an alpine meadow, a river, or a lake) are\n      forever lost or are so transformed as to be reduced to the eventual rubble of\n      our urban environment, the voice of the existing beneficiaries of these\n      environmental wonders should be heard.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      Perhaps they will not win.

I would reverse that judgment and, instead, approve the judgment of the\n      District Court which recognized standing in the Sierra Club and granted\n      preliminary relief. I would be willing to do this on condition that the Sierra\n      Club forthwith amend its complaint to meet the specifications the Court\n      prescribes for standing. If Sierra Club fails or refuses to take that step, so be\n      it; the case will then collapse. But if it does amend, the merits will be before\n      the trial court once again. As the Court, . . ., so clearly reveals, the issues on\n      the merits are substantial and deserve resolution. They assay new ground. *\n      * *. They raise important ramifications for the quality of the country&#x27;s public\n      land management. They pose the propriety of the &quot;dual permit&quot; device as a\n      means of avoiding the 80-acre &quot;recreation and resort&quot; limitation imposed by\n      Congress in 16 U. S. C. § 497, an issue that apparently has never been\n      litigated, and is clearly substantial in light of the congressional expansion of\n      the limitation in 1956 arguably to put teeth into the old, unrealistic five-acre\n      limitation. In fact, they concern the propriety of the 80-acre permit itself and\n      the consistency of the entire, enormous development with the statutory\n      purposes of the Sequoia Game Refuge, of which the Valley is a part. * * *.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">      2. Alternatively, I would permit an imaginative expansion of our traditional\n      concepts of standing in order to enable an organization such as the Sierra\n      Club, possessed, as it is, of pertinent, bona fide, and well-recognized\n      attributes and purposes in the area of environment, to litigate\n      environmental issues. This incursion upon tradition need not be very\n      extensive. Certainly, it should be no cause for alarm. * * *. It need only\n      recognize the interest of one who has a provable, sincere, dedicated, and\n      established status.

English law recognizes two categories of persons in this legal\nsense: &#x27;natural persons&#x27; and &#x27;artificial persons&#x27;. Natural persons are those animate\nbeings which possess a capacity to own legal rights and to owe legal duties;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">artificial persons are those inanimate entities which possess such a capacity.\nArtificial persons are sometimes also described as &#x27;legal&#x27; or &#x27;juristic&#x27; persons, but\nthis usage can be confusing, as the latter terms are also used of both animate\nbeings and inanimate entities, to denote the fact that they have an existence as\nlegal actors, rather than the fact that they exist only in the legal, and not in the\nbiologicial sphere.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\">(b) Natural persons\n3.19 The only animate beings currently recognized by English law as natural\npersons are human beings. Other animals have not been thought capable of\nbearing legal responsibility for their actions since the thirteenth century, although\nthe idea that a non-human animal or indeed an inanimate object should itself be\npunished for causing the death of a human being underlay the old rule, which was\nnot abolished until 1846, that in such circumstances the animal or object should\nbe forfeit as &#x27;deodand&#x27; to the Crown or other franchise-holder. English law has\nnever regarded non-human animals as possessing the capacity to enjoy legal rights,\nalthough the argument has been made by some theorists that in principle they\nshould be regarded as possessing this capacity. In the case of human beings,\nEnglish law assigns them &#x27;status&#x27;, or standing in law, according to their individual\nattributes and characteristics, and a human being&#x27;s legal rights and duties are then\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis by reference to relevant aspects of his status.\nThus, for example, a human being&#x27;s capacity to enter a contract can be affected by\nwhether he is a minor or full age, bankrupt or solvent, mentally capable or\nincapable. Questions going to the attributes and characteristics of a human being\nwhich may or may not have legal significance in different circumstances include: (i)\nhas he been born? (ii) has he acquired full age? (iii) has he died? (iv) what is his\ngender? (v) is he legitimate, illegitimate, or adopted? (vi) is he single, married,\ndivorced, or in an unmarried cohabiting relation (heterosexual or homosexual)? (vii)\nis he a British citizen, a foreign national, a foreign diplomat, or a refugee? (viii) is he\nbodily capable? (ix) is he mentally capable? (x) is he a prisoner? (xi) is he solvent?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">(xii) is he a layperson or a cleric? (xiii) is he a member of the armed forces? (xiv) is\nhe a Member of Parliament? (xv) is he a member of the Royal Family?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">(c) Artificial persons\n3.20 Prior to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, the Admiralty courts\nsometimes ascribed artificial personality to ships, as a means of circumventing the\nwrits of prohibition issued by the common law courts to restrain the expansion of\nthe Admiralty in personam jurisdiction. However, the theory that the ship is the real\ndefendant in an Admiralty action in rem fell into decline after 1873, and the only\nbodies now recognized by English law as artificial persons are &#x27;groups or series of\n[human] individuals&#x27;, conceptualized as abstract entities, but possessing &#x27;an\nessentially animate content&#x27;. Thus, English law currently ascribes artificial\npersonality to certain private groups of associates, as discussed in the following\nparts of this chapter, to various public bodies, religious bodies, and their officers,\nand also to various foreign states and international organizations.\nHowever, &#x27;formidable conceptual difficulties&#x27; would lie in the English courts&#x27; way if\nthey wished to recognize a tangible inanimate object as an artificial person,\n&#x27;something [like a Hindu temple] which on one view is little more than a pile of\nstones&#x27;. They would also find it difficult to permit an action by or against an\nabstraction such as a fund of money, for as a general rule this is &#x27;a form of\nproceeding unknown to English law&#x27;. Thus, for example, English law does not\nconsider a trust estate to possess the capacity to sue or be sued, and requires trust\nfunds to be vested in trustees with the personal capacity to sue (and to be sued) in\ntheir own names in the course of administering the trust business, executors and\nadministrators (collectively termed personal representatives) perform a similar\nfunction with respect to a deceased person&#x27;s estate, as do receivers and liquidators\nwhen a company goes into receivership or liquidation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">(d) The nature of personality\n3.22 Many legal theorists have written on the nature of personality, and have\naddressed themselves to such questions as whether personality entails anything\nmore than the possession of a set of duty-owing, right-owning capacities, and\nwhether the possession of such capacities is necessarily a legal construct or can\nderive from some extra-legal source. Questions of this sort do not often strike the\nEnglish courts as having a practical bearing on the cases which they must decide,\nand even when they declare themselves to be &#x27;concerned with abstract\njurisprudential concepts [so far as these] assist towards clarity of thought&#x27;, they\ngenerally recoil from discussing them in any detail. In consequence, they have not\noften expressly considered, still less committed themselves to, any particular\njurisprudential theory of personality. However, it has rightly been observed that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                           30</span>\n\n&#x27;realist theories of the company in which the company is viewed as a real person\nhave had a limited influence on the development of [English company law, by\ncomparison with]... Continental Europe, where that theory has been much more\nsignificant&#x27;, and some recent judicial statements confirm that the English courts\nhave no liking for realist theories of artificial personality in general.\n3.23 In Bumper Development Corp Ltd. v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Purchas\nLJ approved the statement in Salmond on Jurisprudence, that [artificial] persons,\nbeing the arbitrary creations of the law, may be of as many kinds as the law\npleases&#x27;, and went on to hold that a Hindu temple recognized as an artificial person\nby the law of Tamil Nadu could therefore be a party to proceedings in the English\ncourts, even though it would not be recognized as a person by English Law. In\nMeridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission, Lord\nHoffmann stated that &#x27;a company exists because there is [legal] rule... which says\nthat a persona ficta shall be deeded to exist,&#x27; and that although &#x27;a reference to\ncompany...[there] is in fact no such thing as the company as such, no Ding an sich,\nonly the applicable rules&#x27; which enable the shareholders of the company to conduct\ntheir collective activities through the medium of the corporate form. And writing\nextrajudicially, Lord Cooke has since interpreted Lord Hoffmann&#x27;s reference to &#x27;Ding\nan sich&#x27; in the Meridian case as an allusion to Kant&#x27;s noumenon, a thing whose\nexistence is postulated but ultimately unknowable as it is in itself, and also as a\n&#x27;dig&#x27; at Viscout Haldane LC&#x27;s supposed acceptance of German realist theory in\nLennard&#x27;s Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd, where he spoke of a company\npossessing an &#x27;active and directing will&#x27;. In Lord Cooke&#x27;s view, however, &#x27;too much\nhas been ascribed to alleged metaphysics by Viscount Haldane&#x27;, and it is &#x27;very\ndoubtful&#x27; whether his exposition in the Lennard&#x27;s case was in fact influenced by the\nGerman realists.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">(e) The use of the terms &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27; in English legal practice\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">(i) The possession of personality does not entail the possession of a fixed set of legal\ncapacities\n3.24 Three broad observations should be made here about the English legal terms\n&#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27;. First, the question whether a human being or abstract\nentity should be regarded as possessing the capacity to enforce a particular right,\nor to owe a particular duty, is one that lawmakers can rationally answer by\nconsidering the nature of the right or duty in question, by looking at the character\nof the fruitfully, have approached the question by considering instead whether it\nlies in the public interest to fix a company with criminal liability for, say, personal\ninjuries or deaths caused by particular types of corporate actions or omissions; on\na positive answer being given, they could then have formulated a new set of rules to\ngovern the determination of corporate liability in terms reflecting the reality that\nhuman being or entity in question, and by assessing in the light of these matters,\nwhether it would be consistent with the goals of society at large, and of the legal\nsystem in particular, to give a positive answer. But the need to approach the\nquestion in this way can be overlooked if the terms &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27; are\nused carelessly. A human being or entity which has been said by Parliament or the\ncourts to be capable of enforcing a particular right, or of owing a particular duty,\ncan properly be described as a person with that particular capacity. But it can be\neasy to forget the qualifier, and to assume when the question later arises, whether\nthe individual or entity has the further capacity to enforce some other right, or to\nowe some other duty, that this must be so because he or it has previously been\nsaid to be a person with an unlimited set of capacities, or to be a person who\npossesses the &#x27;powers normally attendant on legal personality&#x27;. In other words, the\ncareless use of the terms &#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;personality&#x27; can create the false impression\nthat a particular human being or entity has been said to possess a larger set of\nright-owning, duty-owning capacities than is in fact the case.\n3.25 Thus, for example, English registered companies are frequently said to\npossess &#x27;personality&#x27;, but it would be wrong to infer from this that they necessarily\npossess the capacity to enjoy a privilege against self-incrimination, or the capacity\nto perjure themselves, or the capacity to be the subject of defamatory statements,\nor the capacity to enjoy a right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 8</a> of the European\nConvention on Human Rights. Whether they possess these or any other capacities\nmust be considered from first principles when the question arises. To say that a\nhuman being or entity possesses the &#x27;powers normally attendant on legal\npersonality&#x27; is to suggest that the ascription of personality entails the ascription of\na generally agreed and particularized set of capacities, possession of which can be\nsafely assumed of every natural and artificial person. But this is not so. Different\nhuman beings and entities may properly be characterized as natural or artificial\npersons for different purposes even though they possess different capacities from\none another.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">80.            Mr. David R. Boyd, in the latest book &quot;The Rights\nof Nature&quot;, has dealt with various issues of understanding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                           31</span>\n\n\nanimal minds including emotions, intelligence, language,\nmemory, culture, co-operation, foresight, self-awareness,\naltruism. Learned author has discussed the intelligence,\nemotions, self-awareness, altruism of animals as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">&quot;Emotions\nIn her book How Animals Grieve, Barbara J. King defines grief as &quot;when a survivor\nanimal acts in ways that are visibly distressed or altered from the usual routine, in\nthe aftermath of the death of a companion animal who had mattered to him or her.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">Dolphins, primates, and elephants exhibit behavior that clearly appears to be grief.\nAccording to Jeffrey Kluger, writing in Time magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s well established that\nelephants appear to mourn their dead. They will linger over a family member&#x27;s body\nwith what looks like sorrow, and African elephants have a burial ritual, covering\ndead relatives&#x27; bodies with leaves and dirt. Elephants show great interest-some\nscientists suggest it may even be respect-when they come across the bones of dead\nelephants, examining them closely, with particular attention to the skull and\ntusks.&quot; Similarly, great apes will remain close to a dead troop mate for days.\nThere are stories from Africa and Asia of elephant herds and tigers taking revenge\non targeted human settlements or hunters for having slaughtered members of their\nfamilies, stolen their food, or attempted to kill them. Baby elephants sometimes\nthrow what can only be described as temper tantrums if their mothers deny them\nmilk. In addition to observation, scientists can now use physiological data to track\nchanges in the emotional state of animals. Recent studies have demonstrated that\ndogs feel elation in their owners&#x27; presence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">Intelligence\nScientists believe that the large brains of primates, cetaceans, and elephants\nevolved for dealing with social complexity--recognizing friends and foes, engaging in\nlifelong social relationship, co-operating for mutual benefit, and developing unique\ncultures. Humans were supposed to have the biggest brains, and thus the gold\nmedal, in animal intelligence. Not so fast. The brains of Homo sapiens are\noutweighed by those of dolphins, elephants and whales. In our defence, we\ncunningly deemed brain weight to be an unfair comparison, so we calculated brain-\nto-body-weight ratios. Then the tree shrew bests us, so that can&#x27;t be right. Despite\nbeing smaller than whale brains, human brains have more neurons (aha!), but\nwhale brains have more glia, specialized cells used in information processing.\nThere is no question that dolphins, whales, primates, and elephants are highly\nintelligent. Dolphins not only have big brains, but possess extraordinary abilities\nsuch as sonar or echolocation, with which they send out sound waves that bounce\nback as echoes, providing extensive information about their surroundings.\nEcholocation enables dolphins to &quot;see&quot; through solid objects, like a superhero&#x27;s X-\nray vision. For example, dolphins can tell if another dolphin, or a human, is\npregnant, using their sonar to detect two separate heartbeats. A few years ago,\nscientists discovered that dolphin brains contain large numbers of specialized\nspindle neurons, previously thought to be unique to great apes. These neurons are\nbelieved to rapidly transmit important social/emotional information. In fact,\ndolphins&#x27; brains have more spindle neurons than humans&#x27;. Dale Peterson writes in\nThe Moral Lives of Animals that dolphins &quot;have excellent memories and high levels\nof social and self-awareness, are excellent at mimicking the behavior of others and\ncan respond to symbolic presentations, form complex and creatively adaptive social\nsystems, and show a broad capacity for the cultural transmission of learned\nbehaviours.&quot; In short, dolphins are really smart.\nThe phrase &quot;bird brain&quot; has long been employed as a put-down, but may now be\nseen as a compliment. In 2004, scientists completely renamed the parts of avian\nbrains based on new knowledge about their evolution. The brains of birds, contrary\nto previous understanding, are structurally similar to mammal brains. Despite\nhaving relatively small brains, crows, ravens, and jays--members of the corvid\nfamily--have proven to be talented problem solvers and tool users. In one\nexperiment, a New Caledonian crow overcame a series of eight obstacles before\nacquiring a piece of aluminum and bending it with uncanny accuracy into a hook\nthat it used to retrieve a morsel of food. The crow accomplished this feat on its first\nattempt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">Intelligence is not limited to primates, cetaceans, and birds. Archerfish can\ninstantly calculate complicated mathematics of distance, speed, and time when\nblasting their prey with jets of water. They can learn to be better hunters by\nwatching skilled individuals of their species. Many species, from monarch\nbutterflies and humpback whales to Pacific salmon and Arctic terns, undertake\namazing migrations every year without map, compass, or GPS.\nA variety of different species practice deception, behaving in ways intentionally\ndesigned to mislead predators or even members of their own group. In his best-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                           32</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">seller The Parrot&#x27;s Lament, Eugene Linden chronicles acts of deception by parrots,\nelephants, orangutans, dolphins, and hawks. Some birds feign injury to lead\npredators away from their nests. Jays will not cache food when other animals are\nwatching, or will subsequently re-cache the food in a different location.\nChimpanzees and gorillas will pretend not to notice desired food items when\naccompanied by more dominant members of their family. The less dominant\nprimates will return later, unaccompanied, to collect the food. The zone-tailed hawk\nimitates the flying style of a vulture, a scavenger that poses no threat to other\nbirds, then dives to attack unsuspecting birds. These uses of deception suggest\nthat some species may have the ability to understand what other animals are\nthinking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">Self-Awareness\nSelf-awareness refers to the ability to recognize oneself as an individual distinct\nfrom the environment and other individuals. In 1838, Charles Darwin watched an\norangutan at the London Zoo looking at herself in a mirror. He naturally wondered\nwhat she was thinking. More than a century later, scientists inspired by Darwin\nbegan placing animals in front of mirrors to explore the question of self-awareness.\nAnimals are marked on their head or body (with paint or a sticker, for example) and\nthen exposed to a mirror. If they touch the mark on themselves rather than on the\nmirror, scientists conclude that the animal perceives the reflected image as itself,\nrather than another animal. Experiments indicate that dolphins, orcas, Eurasian\nmagpies, elephants, and some primates recognize themselves in mirrors.\nOther scientists bristle at the notion that animals responding to seeking themselves\nin a mirror should be an indicator that they possess self-awareness. For example,\nin Beyond Words, conservationist Carl Safina argues that the day-to-day behavior\nof many different species provides clear evidence of self-awareness. He concludes\nthat &quot;maybe a mirror is mainly a test for which species is the greatest marcissist.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">Altruism\nAltruism involves behavior benefitting someone who is not a close relative, despite\nsome personal cost or risk. Field researchers in Africa have observed chimpanzees\nassisting unrelated chimps without expecting favours in return. Lab tests done\ndecades ago demonstrated that rhesus monkeys will consistently choose to go\nhungry if their decision to secure food would result in another unrelated rhesus\nmonkey being subjected to an electrical shock. Dolphins have saved humans and\nseals from sharks and helped rescue whales stranded on rocks or beaches. In The\nMoral Lives of Animals, Dale Peterson recounts stories of a wild elephant in Kenya\nthat defended an injured man from a herd of wild buffalo, a bonobo in an English\nzoo that saved a starling that had crashed into a window, and a gorilla at Chicago&#x27;s\nBrookfield Zoo that rescued a three-year old who fell into her exhibit, landing on a\nconcrete floor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">In 2016, the journal Marine Mammal Research published a remarkable article about\nthe seemingly altruistic behavior of humpback whales. In dozens of recorded\nobservations from around th world, humpbacks responded to the distress calls of\nother species--including seals, sea lions, and grey whales--that were being\nattacked by groups of killer whales. In each case, the humpback whales disrupted\nthe hunt by harassing the orcas and driving them away. Scientists cannot find any\nplausible biological explanation for why the humpbacks would place themselves at\nrisk on behalf of other species, and are left to speculate that this is an example of\naltruism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">These studies mark huge leaps in our scientific understanding or animal\nintelligence and consciousness in recent decades. From elephants and cetaceans to\nants and fish, animals clearly fell, think, and reason. They are scientist creatures,\nnot machines. As humans, we may never fully understand the intelligence,\nemotions, or morality of other species. We can study other types of animals,\nobserve their behavior, analyze their DNA, carry out sophisticated experiments, and\nattempt to imagine what goes on inside their minds, but knowing is probably an\nimpossible task.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">In 2012, a multi-disciplinary group of scientists who study how brains work\nproduced the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, stating, &quot;The weight of\nevidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological\nsubstrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all\nmammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess\nthese neurological substrates.&quot; The declaration noted that many animals experience\npain in ways similar to humans--the same chemical reactions in the brain and\nbody (such as the production of adrenalin and other hormones) and the same\nobservable physical reactions (like dilated pupils and elevated heart rates). Scientist\nPhilip Low, one of the authors of the declaration, said that numerous colleagues\napproached him afterwards and said, &quot;We were all thinking this, but were afraid to\nsay it.&quot; Reviewing the evidence, the New York Times concluded, &quot;The overwhelming\ntendency of all this scientific work, of its results, has been toward more\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                          33</span>\n\nconsciousness. More species having it, and species having more of it than\nassumed.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">From a scientific perspective, the myths of human superiority and exceptionalism\nhave been repeatedly and convincingly debunked. As Charles Darwin observed\nalmost 150 years ago, the difference between humans and other animals is one &quot;of\ndegree, not of kind.&quot; After studying chimpanzees for more than forty years, in her\nforeword to Building an Ark: 101 Solutions to Animal Suffering, Jane Goodall\nconcluded, &quot;It is clear that there is no sharp line between us and chimpanzees,\nbetween us and the rest of the animal kingdom. The more we learn, the more blurry\nthe line becomes. We are not the only beings on the planet with personalities and\nminds capable of rational thought and feelings.&quot; The knowledge that animals feel,\nthink, and reason has profound consequences for our relationship with them. As\njournalist Elizabeth Kolbert observed in the New York Review of Books, &quot;To\nacknowledge that we are separated from other species by &#x27;degree, not kind&#x27; is to call\ninto question just about every aspect of modern life.&quot; We have a powerful moral\nimperative to change the way we relate to, interact with, and exploit other animals.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">81.            Author Albert Schweitzer has said, &quot;Until we\nextend the circle of compassion to all living things, we will\nnot find peace.&quot; The first American law prohibiting cruelty\nto    animals        was      passed        by      the    Puritans        of    the\nMassachusetts Bay Colony in 1641: &quot;No man shall exercise\nany tirranny or crueltie towards any bruite creatures which\nare usuallie kept for man&#x27;s use.&quot; Learned Author has made\nvery pertinent observation on legal changes taking place\nglobally to recognize non-human animals as legal persons\nas under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                &quot;On the frontiers of legal change, there is a growing global movement\n        to recognize non-human animals as legal persons, a radical change that\n        would endow them with the variety of legal rights. Animal rights advocates\n        are not saying primates, cetaceans, or elephants are people. A &#x27;legal person&#x27;\n        is not necessarily a human being, but rather an entity to which the law\n        grants specific rights. A corporation is considered a legal person, as are\n        ships, churches and municipalities. The rights and responsibilities of a legal\n        person vary according to the nature of the entity. Corporations and human\n        beings have different sets of legal rights and duties. For example,\n        corporations may assert freedom of expression, but are not protected by the\n        right to life.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">82.            With the development of the society where the\ninteraction of individuals fell short to upsurge the social\ndevelopment, the concept of juristic person was devised\nand created by human laws for the purposes of the society.\nA juristic person, like any other natural person is in law\nalso conferred with rights and obligations and is dealt with\nin accordance with law. In other words, the entity acts like\na natural person but only through a designated person, as\ntheir     Lordships        have      held      in    the     judgments          cited\nhereinabove, that for a bigger thrust of socio-political-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                    34</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">scientific development, evolution of a fictional personality to\nbe a juristic person becomes inevitable. This may be any\nentity, living inanimate, objects or things.            It may be a\nreligious institution or any such useful unit which may\nimpel the Courts to recognise it.              This recognition is for\nsubserving the needs and faith of the society.           Corpus Juris\nSecundum, Vol.6, page 778 explains the concept of juristic\npersons/artificial persons thus: &quot;Artificial persons.    Such as are\ncreated and devised by human laws for the purposes of society and\ngovernment, which are called corporations or bodies politic.&quot; A\njuristic person can be any subject matter other than a human being\nto which the law attributes personality for good and sufficient\nreasons. Juristic persons being the arbitrary creations of law, as\nmany kinds of juristic persons have been created by law as the\nsociety require for its development. (See Salmond on Jurisprudence\n12th Edition Pages 305 and 306).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">83.         We have to show compassion towards all living\ncreatures. Animals may be mute but we as a society have to\nspeak on their behalf. No pain or agony should be caused\nto    the   animals.    Cruelty         to   animals    also   causes\npsychological pain to them. In Hindu Mythology, every\nanimal is associated with god. Animals breathe like us and\nhave emotions. The animals require food, water, shelter,\nnormal behavior, medical care, self-determination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">84.         Due to damage caused to environment and\necology, the avian and aquatic life is also threatened. Major\nrivers have been reduced to the status of a sewer. Aquatic\nlife cannot survive without water. The rivers have inherent\nright to flow in length as well as in width. The oceans are\nchocked with plastic. Many species are becoming extinct.\nThe loss of one species causes immense damage to the\nentire ecosystem. Global warming has arrived and its\nimpact can be seen in day-to-day existence. There are gaps\nin laws. New inventions are required to be made in law to\nprotect the environment and ecology. The animals including\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                         35</span>\n\n\navian and aquatics have a right to life and bodily integrity,\nhonour and dignity. Animals cannot be treated merely as\nproperty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">85.

By 3.8 billion years ago, the oceans\n      had (at least more or less) achieved their present volumes.\n      The water realm is known as the hydrosphere and it is overwhelmingly\n      oceanic. Ninety-seven per cent of all the water on Earth is in the seas, the\n      greater part of it in the Pacific, which is bigger than all the land masses put\n      together. Altogether the Pacific holds just over half of all the ocean water\n      (51.6 per cent); the Atlantic has 23.6 per cent and the Indian Ocean 21.2\n      per cent, leaving just 3.6 per cent to be accounted for by all the other seas.\n      The average depth of the ocean is 3.86 kilometers, with the Pacific on\n      average about 300 metres deeper than the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Sixty\n      per cent of the planet&#x27;s surface is ocean more than 1.6 kilometres deep. As\n      Philip Ball notes, we would better call our planet not Earth but Water.\n      Of the 3 per cent of Earth&#x27;s water that is fresh, most exists as ice sheets.\n      Only the tiniest amount- 0.036 per cent- is found in lakes, rivers and\n      reservoirs, and an even smaller part - just 0.001 per cent- exists in clouds\n      or as vapour. Nearly 90 per cent of the planet&#x27;s ice is in Antartica and most\n      of the rest is in Greenland. Go to the South Pole and you will be standing on\n      over 2 miles of ice, at the North Pole just 15 feet of it. Antartica alone has 6\n      million cubilc miles of ice- enough to raise the oceans by a height of 200 feet\n      if it all melted. But if all the water in the atmosphere fell as rain, evenly\n      everywhere, the oceans would deepen by only couple of centimeters.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">86.

The Vedas and Upanishads were the first to speak of\nahimsa. Although the Aryans were not vegetarians, the concept of non-killing\nappears in the earliest literature. The Rig Veda (10.87.16), condemns all forms of\nkilling, even for food, preferring vegans to drinkers of milk:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">The yatudhana who fills himself with the flesh of man,\nHe who fills himself with the flesh of horses or of other animals,\nAnd he who steals the milk of the cow:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">Lord, cut off their heads with your flame.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">The Yajur Veda says that service to animals leads to heaven: &#x27;No person should kill\nanimals helpful to all and persons serving them should obtain heaven.&#x27; According\nto the Atharva Veda, the earth was created for the enjoyment of not only human\nbeings but also for bipeds and quadrupeds, birds, animals and all others creatures.\nThe emergence of all life forms from the Supreme Being is expressed in the\nMundakopanishad from Him, too, gods are produced manifold,\nThe celestials, men, cattle, birds.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">These ideas led to the concept of ahimsa or non-violence. Much later, the\nManusmriti says, &#x27;He who injuries innocent beings with a desire to give himself\npleasure never finds happiness, neither in life nor in death.&#x27; The Shrimad\nBhagavatam says that a cruel person who kills others for his existence deserves to\nbe killed, and cannot be happy, either in life or in death. The consequences,\naccording to the Yajunavalkya Smriti are that &#x27;the wicked person who kills animals\nwhich are protected has to live in hellfire for the days equal to the number of hairs\non the body of that animal.&#x27;\nIn the later Puranas, killing animals and eating meat were considered to be such\nheinous sins that neither prayers nor pilgrimages or bathing in holy rives would\nabsolve of it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">Although Sanatana Dharma did not require its adherents to be vegetarians,\nvegetarianism was recognized as a higher forms of living, a belief that continues in\ncontemporary Hinduism where vegetarians is considered essential for spiritualism.\nAround the sixth century BCE, two great religious preachers were born, who took\nthe Upanishadic philosophy of good conduct and non-killing to the people in the\ncommon language:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">Mahavira the Jina (Victor), and Gautama the Budha (wise).\nThe name traditionally used for Hinduism.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">Both emphasized that ahimsa or non-violence was essential for a good life.\nMahavira (599-527 BCE) and Jainism\nMahavira (&#x27;Great Hero&#x27;) was born as Prince Vardhamana, son of Siddhartha, Raja of\nKundalpura, and Queen Trishala or Priyakarni, in 599 BCE. He abandoned home\nin 569 BCE to become a monk.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">He attained enlightenment in 557 BCE and attained nirvana in 527 BCE. Queen\nTrishala had fourteen auspicious signs before she gave birth to Vardhamana,\nforetelling the advent of a great soul. These symbols included the elephant, bull,\nlion, and a pair of fish. Which denote great spirituality in Jainism.\nMahavira was not the founder of Jainism: he was the twenty-fourth and last\nTirthankara who revised the Jaina doctrines and established the central tenets of\nJainism of Jainism. Ahimsa paramo dharmah: &#x27;Ahimsa (non-violence) is the highest\nreligion&#x27; is a tenet basis to Jainism. Violence is the root cause of all crises. Ethical\ndiscipline is important and sacred. To liberate oneself, Mahavira tought the\nimportance of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct, which includes non-\nviolence (ahimsa)- not to cause harm to any living being.\nJainism is basically an ethico-metaphysical system. In comparison to Hinduism\nand Buddhism, ahimsa is the prime Tirtha means ford, a means of crossing over,\nand denotes a spiritual guide or philosophy which enables one to cross over the\nocean of recurring births in this world. Kara means the one who makes, and the\nword Tirthankara means &#x27;one who crosses the sacred ford&#x27;, or a Jain saint.\nAccording to Jainism, ahimsa is not the mere causing of violence; it is the\n&#x27;severance of any of the vitality in a mobile or immobile being&#x27;. Ahimsa, as viewed\nby Jainism, is very comprehensive and takes into consideration the welfare of all\nbeings on earth. Keeping anything in confinement, without consideration for its\nfreedom to exist or live, is bandhana (captivity). Rearing animals without adequate\nshelter, air, light, space and food is atichara (bad conduct). Keeping animals,\nincluding dairy animals, tied with ropes or chains throughout the day is violence.\nThe simple prayer of the Jainas is &#x27;Let the law of the Jaina give all happiness to all\nthe living beings of the world. All beings desire to live. They like pleasure, hate\npain, shun destruction, like to live long. To all, life is dear (Ramanujam 2006).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                         37</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">As the images of all the Tirthankaras are identical, their pedestals contain the\nanimal emblem of each, which is the sole means of identification.

In     a     well-researched           article,      &quot;Personhood,\nAnimals and the Law&quot;, author Christine M. Korsgaard has\ndiscussed the concept of conferring status of personhood\non the animals as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">             &quot;But it may be argued that those who make this proposal are\n      ignoring something important about the concept of a person. It has\n      generally been assumed that &quot;personhood,&quot; whatever it is, is, or is based on,\n      an attribute that is characteristic of human beings, and not of the other\n      animals. In the philosophical tradition, the most common candidate for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                    39</span>\n\nattribute that establishes &quot;personhood&quot; is rationality, but understood in a\nspecific sense. Rationality is sometimes loosely identified with the ability to\nchoose intelligently between options or to solve problems by taking thought,\nbut those are attributes that human beings arguably share with many other\nanimals. The more specific sense of &quot;rationality&quot; refers to a normative\ncapacity, a capacity to assess the grounds of our beliefs and actions, and to\nadjust them accordingly. On the side of action, for instance, it is the\ncapacity to ask whether something that would potentially motivate you to\nperform a certain action is really a reason for doing that action - and then to\nbe motivated to act in accordance with the answer that you get. Rationality,\nin this sense, is normative self-government, the capacity to be governed by\nthoughts about what you ought to do or to believe.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">        In fact, even some thinkers who would deny that rationality is the\ndistinctive characteristic of humanity would still agree that normative self-\ngovernment is both definitive of personhood and distinctive of humanity. In\nthe empiricist tradition, the tradition of Locke, Hume, and Hutcheson, it has\nbeen common to attribute to human beings, and human beings alone, a\ncapacity to form so-called &quot;second-order&quot; attitudes - for instance, attitudes\ntowards our own desires - that make them liable to normative assessment.\nThough I may desire to do something, I may also disapprove of that desire,\nand reject its influence over me. According to empiricists, second order\nattitudes are what make human beings subject to an &quot;ought.&quot; So many\nphilosophers have agreed that it is in virtue of normative self-government\nthat human beings count as persons in the legal and moral sense.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">        Certainly, if something along these lines is correct, it is natural to\nthink that only human beings can have obligations. In order to have\nobligations, you need to be able to think about whether what you are doing\nis right, and to adjust your conduct accordingly. This requires a highly\ndeveloped &quot;theory of mind,&quot; as ethologists call it. An animal has a theory of\nmind when the animal knows that animals (herself included) have mental\nattitudes, such as beliefs and desires. But in order to be rational in the\nsense I just described, an animal must not only know that she and other\nanimals have mental attitudes. She must also know that her attitudes are\nconnected in certain ways - for instance, that she is inclined to perform a\ncertain action because she has a certain desire. To ask whether you have a\ngood reason for doing what you propose to do, or whether it is right, is to\nthink about and evaluate that connection, and it seems likely that only\nhuman beings can do that.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">        But it is a much harder question whether being rational in this\nsense is necessary for having rights, and that is the question most pressing\nfrom the point of view of those who seek legal protections for animals. The\ntraditional distinction between persons and things groups the ability to have\nrights and the liability to having obligations together. One common view\nabout why that should be so is that rights are grounded in some sort of\nagreement that is reciprocal: I agree to respect certain claims of yours,\nprovided that you respect certain similar claims of mine. The view of society\nas based on a kind of social contract supports such a conception of rights.\nBut in fact our laws do not merely protect those who as citizens are involved\nin making its laws: rather, they protect anyone who shares the interests\nthat the laws were made to protect. So for instance, foreigners on our soil\nhave rights not to be robbed or murdered, regardless of the fact that they\nare not parties to our own social contract. The laws that we make against\nmurder and robbery are intended to protect certain human interests that\nforeigners share with citizens, and that is sufficient to give them the relevant\nrights. Of course, foreigners on our soil can also be made to conform to our\nlaws - reciprocity can be required of them. But when we speak of universal\nhuman rights, we speak of interests that are shared by every human being\nand that we think ought to be protected, not merely of the interests\nprotected under some actual social contract. So it makes sense to raise the\nquestion whether the other animals share the kinds of interests that our\nlaws - either legal or moral - are meant to protect.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">        What is distinctive of animal life is the way that it functions, which is\nby means of perception and action. Through perception, an animal forms\nsome sort of representation of her environment. As a result of instinct,\nlearning, and in the case of some animals, intelligent thought, objects in the\nanimal&#x27;s environment are represented as desirable or aversive in specific\nways: as something to eat, or to flee from, or to mate with, or to take care of.\nOr some sort of practical representation may arise from within, as when you\nget hungry and find yourself irresistibly thinking about a sandwich. The\nanimal then acts in accordance with these practical representations. The\npractical representations serve, though very imperfectly of course, to enable\nan animal to get what is good for her and avoid what is bad for her. In other\nwords, when animals evolved, a kind of entity came into existence which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                         40</span>\n\n      actually experiences the goodness or badness of its own condition, or at\n      least of some aspects of its own condition, in a positive or negative way - as\n      something desirable or aversive. An animal experiences its own good or ill.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">               So the way in which things are good or bad for animals is distinctive\n      in that it is both non-derivative and capable of being experienced. We can\n      describe these things by saying that animals have interests, or that there\n      are facts about their welfare. Although our own welfare is more complex\n      than that of the other animals, it is because we are animals, not because we\n      are human beings or persons, that we ourselves have interests or a welfare.\n      Animal rights advocates argue that having a welfare or interests is sufficient\n      to ground rights. We should ask on what basis we claim rights for ourselves,\n      and demand respect for them from each other, if it is not that we ourselves\n      are beings with interests or a welfare?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">               Well, here is one possible answer. Immanuel Kant, who made the\n      concept of a person central to his ethics, argued that a person is an end in\n      himself, to be valued and respected for his own sake, and never to be used\n      merely as a means. Kant claimed that the basis of that value is the capacity\n      for rational choice, or autonomy. He also claimed that it is because of our\n      autonomy that human beings have rights. Because human beings are\n      rational beings, Kant argued, human beings, unlike the other animals, are\n      able to choose our own way of life. We reflect about what counts as a good\n      life, decide the question for ourselves, and live accordingly. In the liberal\n      tradition, with its strong emphasis on toleration, and its antagonism to\n      paternalism, this kind of autonomy has often been regarded as the basis of\n      rights. We have the basic rights of personal liberty, liberty of conscience,\n      and freedom of speech and association, because each of us has the right to\n      determine for himself or herself what counts as a worthwhile life, and to live\n      that life, so long as the way we act is consistent with a like right for\n      everyone else. Because the other animals do not choose their own way of\n      life, they do not have rights grounded in this kind of autonomy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">               But this response is not wholly satisfactory. I think we do have\n      specifically human rights grounded in our autonomy. But the trouble with\n      leaving it at that, is that what makes it important to us that our rights\n      should be respected is not just that we value our autonomy. It is also that\n      we value, to speak almost circularly, our welfare, our interests, or our good.\n      Rights grounded in autonomy may often give us an indirect way to protect\n      what we regard as our good. If someone cannot interfere with your freedom\n      of speech, for example, he cannot interfere with your saying your prayers. It\n      is in part because you care about saying your prayers, and not just because\n      you care about your autonomy, that you care about your right to say them.\n      This is where it becomes clear that there is a problem with dividing the\n      world into persons and things. The other animals, who do not have\n      autonomy, are left with no legal means of protecting their interests or their\n      welfare. If they have no rights, they are not persons, and that leaves them to\n      be things. But animals are not mere things, since they are beings with\n      interests and lives of their own. Insofar as they come within the purview of\n      human laws at all, it is because they are a subject population, and the only\n      way to afford any effective protection for their welfare is through human\n      laws.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">               It is worth emphasizing that last thought. The idea of animal rights\n      sounds silly to some people, because it seems to suggest an insane desire to\n      moralize nature: to imply that we should declare predation to be murder\n      and to make it illegal, or perhaps to turn battles over territory into property\n      disputes that get settled in court. But an advocate of animal rights need not\n      be in favor of our trying to protect nonhuman animals from each other.\n      Rather, the point is to protect them from us, from human beings. The\n      reason only the law can do that effectively is because in a sense, the law is\n      the reason why many of the other animals are so completely at our mercy.\n      What I mean is this: it is not just because we are individually smarter than\n      the other animals that human beings are able to do as we will with them. It\n      is because human beings are so cooperative and therefore so organized. And\n      the way that we organize ourselves is by making laws, which set the terms\n      of our interactions and so unite us into an effective whole. If the law says it\n      is permissible for a person to inflict torments on an animal in order to test a\n      product, for instance, then there is nothing anyone can do to protect that\n      animal. So it is one of those cases - and there are certainly others - in\n      which the only thing that can afford protection against the power of the law\n      is the law itself.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">92.

The author considers the past and present legal status of\nanimals, and the possibility of altering animals&#x27; current status as legal &#x27;non-\npersons&#x27;, contending that not only is such change possible, but would be beneficial.\nImagine if you will...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">This is a description of a remarkable being.1 This being understands spoken\nEnglish and communicates in sign language, employing a vocabulary in excess of\none thousand words.

Clearly, she is not a human being.\nCould she be a person?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">Bioethicist Peter Singer is among those who would argue that Koko is as much a\nperson as she is a gorilla. This paper explores some issues related to the extension\nof personhood to include nonhuman animals like Koko. In particular, it focuses on\nthe question of whether there is anything inherent in the concept of legal\npersonality which prevents its extension to animals. Consideration of this question\nrequires examining what it means to be a &#x27;person&#x27;, and to possess legal personality.\nThis paper considers the current legal status of nonhuman animals and whether\ntheir status as legal &#x27;nonpersons&#x27; can be altered - and, if it can, whether it is\ndesirable to confer the status of &#x27;person&#x27; upon nonhuman animals. The central\ncontention of this paper is that such change is possible and would be beneficial.\nWho - or what - is a person?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">At the outset, it is necessary to consider what we mean by our use of the term\n&#x27;person&#x27;. In particular, we must examine the meaning of the term in legal parlance\nin order to understand what it means to say that something &#x27;is a legal person&#x27; or\n&#x27;has legal personality&#x27;. The dictionary definition of &#x27;person&#x27; exposes the variety of\nmeanings which the word potentially may bear. Both the Macquarie Dictionary and\nthe Concise Oxford Dictionary begin with a descriptive definition of &#x27;person&#x27; as an\nindividual human being. In common usage we assume, unless told otherwise, that\n&#x27;person&#x27; is employed as a synonym for &#x27;human being&#x27;. The corollary of our\ninstinctive identification of &#x27;person&#x27; with &#x27;human&#x27; is that we tend to view the terms\n&#x27;person&#x27; and &#x27;animal&#x27; as representing mutually exclusive categories. This aspect of\nhuman thought is highlighted by the Macquarie Dictionary&#x27;s further definition of\n&#x27;person&#x27; as &quot;a human being as distinguished from an animal or thing&quot;. We see\nourselves primarily as human beings, rather than as human animals. Thus,\nalthough we may be aware that, strictly speaking, it is inaccurate to define &#x27;person&#x27;\n(in the sense of &#x27;human&#x27;) in contradistinction to &#x27;animal&#x27;, innate anthropocentricism\nprobably has a good deal more to do with our thinking in this regard than does\nscientific accuracy. On the whole, we are untroubled by our assumption that\n&#x27;person* is the equivalent of &#x27;human&#x27;, and the opposite of &#x27;animal&#x27;. Indeed, we may\nwell be unaware that we hold this assumption until we are challenged by the\nsuggestion that an &#x27;animal&#x27; might also be a &#x27;person&#x27;. Since our thinking is\npredicated on the perception that those terms are mutually exclusive, our\nimmediate reaction to this suggestion is likely to be negative. Yet if we consider\nsome of the other potential meanings of &#x27;person&#x27;, we find that the term has\nmeanings beyond mere synonymy with &#x27;human being*. We are offered a\n&#x27;philosophical&#x27; definition of &#x27;person&#x27; as &quot;a self-conscious or rational being&quot;.\nAdditionally, the etymology of the word is reflected in definitions of &#x27;person&#x27; as a\ncharacter, role or guise assumed either in a play or story, or in real life. &#x27;Person&#x27;\nderives from the Latin persona, which originally described the mask worn by an\nactor, appropriate to the role played by that actor on stage in the ancient theatre.\nThis was the aspect of the term &#x27;person&#x27; which was carried over into the legal world\nand its concept of the &#x27;legal person&#x27;. In the words of Ernest Barker, &quot;just as the\nparts in a play are created and assigned by the dramatists, so ... personae in law\nare created and assigned by similar agencies&quot; in the state. It is important to\nestablish what is meant by the use of the term &#x27;legal person&#x27;. Although it has no\nfixed definition, it is commonly described in terms of an entity possessing certain\nlegal rights and freedoms, and bearing certain legal duties and obligations. In this\nvein, the CCH Macquarie Dictionary of Law defines the legal person as &quot;a body with\nindividual legal powers, privileges, rights, duties or liabilities, whether a natural\nperson (a human being) or an artificial person (eg a corporation or an accounting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                            42</span>\n\nentity)&quot;. Similarly, J. A. C. Thomas posits that &quot;[i]n modem legal systems, the term\n&#x27;person&#x27; denotes an entity capable of bearing rights and duties&quot;. Alexander\nNekamsuggests that &#x27;legal person* is a classificatory term used to designate\n&quot;anything to which rights are attributed in a legal system.&quot; Thus personality, in a\nlegal sense, may be described as &quot;the quality of being a possible subject of rights\nand duties&quot;. It is evident that jurists generally view the possession of legal rights as\na key constitutive element of legal personality. Although some would argue that\n&quot;there is no generally accepted conception of what it is to have a &#x27;legal right&#x27;&quot;,\nProfessor Christopher Stone has attempted to delineate what it means to be the\nholder of legal rights, and hence to possess legal personality. Stone suggests that\n&quot;an entity cannot be said to hold a legal right unless and until some public\nauthoritative body is prepared to give some amount of review to actions that are\ncolorably inconsistent with that &#x27;right&#x27;.&quot; Were this the sole threshold criterion,\nhowever, we might say that &quot;all public buildings ... have legal rights&quot;. Thus Stone\nargues that three additional criteria must be satisfied in order for something to be\nsaid to be a &#x27;holder of legal rights&#x27;. It is necessary that &quot;the thing can institute legal\nactions at its behest; that &quot;in determining the granting of legal relief, the court\nmust take injury to it into account&quot;; and that &quot;relief must run to the benefit of it.\nStone&#x27;s &#x27;additional criteria&#x27; may be seen as the procedural requirements of legal\npersonality. They do not provide us with any insight into which particular rights\nand duties are possessed by a particular legal person, nor do they expose the\nsubstance of those rights and duties. Those matters are determined by the nature\nof the particular legal person and its concomitant capacities. Rather, satisfaction of\nthe criteria offers an entity basic legal existence, thus enabling it to enter into legal\nrelations with other legal persons and providing it with a measure of visibility in the\neyes of the law. In this way, legal personality &quot;[goes] towards making a thing count\njurally - to have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not\nmerely to serve as a means to benefit [the contemporary group of rights-holders]&quot;.\nTo Stone, this is the fundamental benefit of conferring legal personality upon an\nentity. We will return to this powerful argument in due course.]\n&quot;Sentimental Property&quot; : The current position of nonhuman animals in law\nWe might ponder for a moment whether Orwell&#x27;s enigmatic statement that &quot;[a]ll\nanimals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot; is not more or\nless apt to describe the differential treatment accorded to human and nonhuman\nanimals in our legal system. Human and nonhuman animals are clearly not equal.\nWhile all human animals are legal persons, nonhuman animals fall into the\ncategory of property. Since our system regards legal persons as the only entities\ncapable of possessing rights, nonhuman animals can never possess rights in the\nmanner envisaged by Professor Stone. Instead, they have an extremely limited legal\nexistence as the objects of rights held by legal persons. Nonetheless, animals\nappear to fall into an unusual category of property. An American judge, for\nexample, commented that a pet animal &quot;is not just a thing but occupies a special\nplace somewhere in between a person and a piece of personal property.&quot; Another\njudge described pet animals as a form of &quot;sentimental property&quot;. Such comments\nreflect our understandable discomfort with treating living animals, especially those\nwhom we observe exhibiting &#x27;humanlike* qualities or to whom we have an\nemotional attachment, in the same way as we would treat other forms of property.\nWe are reminded of the indirectness of this protection by Dr Philip Jamieson&#x27;s\nanalysis of Australian animal welfare legislation in terms of Professor Stone&#x27;s\ncriteria for the possession of legal rights. In regard to standing, Jamieson notes\nthat animal welfare legislation does not enable animals to institute legal\nproceedings at their own behest. Since the legislation creates offences of a criminal\nnature, it is concerned predominantly with the punishment of the offending legal\nperson and with &quot;protecting the community from similar transgressions by the\nwrongdoer in the future&quot;. The court is unlikely to consider the animal&#x27;s injury as an\nimportant issue in itself, except in the context of determining the gravity of\npunishment to be imposed on the wrongdoer. Finally, the legislation does not\nprovide for relief running to the animal&#x27;s benefit. The statutory &#x27;remedies&#x27; relate\nonly to the potential imposition of fines and imprisonment upon the legal persons\nconvicted of an offence under the statute.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">According to Esther Cohen, the mediaeval jurists did not purport to try animals on\nthe basis that they possessed reason, understanding or malicious intent. In this\nsense, animals were equated with &quot;perpetual minors&quot;. Yet it appears that in passing\njudgment on animal culprits, the mediaeval courts frequently resorted to\nanthropomorphic language imputing malicious intent to the convicted animal, as\nthough the punishment required some sort of justification.36 Thus a sow was said,\nfor example, to have been &quot;taken en fragrant delit, having committed and\nperpetrated ... murder and homicide&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">Mediaeval jurists believed that the right of humans to try animals stemmed from\nthe superiority and &#x27;legal lordship&#x27; of humankind over nature. Since animals were\nsubject to humankind, the jurists reasoned that they must also be subject to the\nhuman judicial system. Further, mediaeval jurists appear to have felt that if\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                           43</span>\n\nanimals were subject to human justice, they were as deserving as humans of the\nfull measure of justice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">The apparent logic of this belief had some odd, and sometimes brutal,\nramifications. Evans reports that animals were sometimes &quot;put to the rack to extort\nconfession&quot; much like a human criminal, not because the judges expected that a\nconfession would be forthcoming, but because they wished to observe the forms\nprescribed by the law, and &quot;to set in motion the whole machinery of justice before\npronouncing judgment&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">However, mediaeval jurists&#x27; desire to accord justice to accused animals also meant\nthat the secular trials &quot;followed the inquisitorial procedure strictly according to\nhuman rules&quot;. In a case of homicide, for example, &quot;the crown or town authorities\nprosecuted the case, presenting the complaint and summoning the witnesses.&quot;\nAccused animals, though rarely (if ever) brought into court, were even confined in\nthe same prisons as human defendants and subjected to similar forms of capital\npunishment, including hanging, burning or burial of the &#x27;culprit&#x27; alive.\nModem eyes are quick to criticise such mediaeval practices and to attribute them to\n&quot;the common superstition of the age&quot;. Our abhorrence of the brutality of mediaeval\ncriminal law and procedure is understandable. Nonetheless, it is arguable that\nthere is a sense of fairness in trying an animal for a so-called crime, such as the\ninfliction of injury upon a human being, which our modem methods of dealing with\n&#x27;dangerous&#x27; animals appear to lack. Although animals were still put to death\nsummarily on occasion in mediaeval times, such behaviour was generally\ndisapproved of by mediaeval jurists.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">The concept of trying an animal that injures humans or other animals before\n&#x27;putting it down&#x27; in order to protect the community is foreign to our apparently\nenlightened society. This is not to suggest that mediaeval law provided the epitome\nof animal justice, for there is an obvious inequity in its treatment of animals as\nduty-bearing, &quot;sentient, punishable beings&quot; for the purposes of the criminal law,\nand as rightless chattels in every other respect.48 Rather, the mediaeval example\nforces us to question the justice of our modem system&#x27;s treatment of animals, and\nalso serves to highlight the possibility of regarding animals as more than mere\nproperty. For if the mediaeval jurists could treat animals essentially as persons\nwith a very limited capacity (limited to the ability to perform legally punishable\nacts)49, is there any reason why we cannot treat them as legal persons?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">Is there a legal barrier to the extension of legal personality to animals?\nIt has taken centuries to reach the point where the law considers all human beings\nto be legal persons. As Professor Stone points out, &quot;persons we presently regard as\nthe natural holders of at least some rights&quot; previously had none. In colourful style,\nStone also comments that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">&quot;We have been making persons of children although they were not, in law, always\nso. And we have done the same, albeit imperfectly some would say, with prisoners,\naliens, women (especially of the married variety), the insane, Blacks, foetuses, and\nIndians.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">Even the attribution of rights to individual human beings is a relatively recent\ndevelopment in the history of the law. In ancient times, the family or a similar\nsocial group was the usual centre of rights. As recognition of the individual as a\nsubject of rights grew, legal personality was restricted for a long time to individuals\noccupying a particular social position (for example, the paterfamilias as head of the\nfamily in Roman times), or individuals possessing other particular attributes. The\nhistory of the gradual extension of the concept of legal personality to include all\nhuman beings, as well as a variety of nonhuman entities like corporations, reminds\nus that the concept of legal personality is a legal fiction, in the sense that it is an\nartificial construct of the law. The law can &quot;choose which persons to create or\nrecognise&quot; just as it can choose &quot;which rights or other relations to create or at least\nrecognise&quot;. Thus, Nekam asserts that anything &quot;can become a subject - a potential\ncenter - of rights, whether a plant or an animal, a human being or an imagined\nspirit&quot;. What is required for an entity to become the subject of rights is for the\ncommunity, and hence the community&#x27;s lawmakers, to choose to regard it as such.\nThe corollary of this is that if the community does not choose to regard an entity as\na subject of rights, it will not become a subject of rights, &quot;whether human being or\nanything else.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">Legal persons are created as part of the &quot;artificial world&quot; of legal concepts, to serve\ncertain purposes. It has been said, for example, that legal persons are\n&quot;mathematical creations&quot; devised to simplify legal processes. Much as\nmathematicians employ algebraic symbols to simplify mathematical calculations,\nthe concept of the legal person provides the jurist with a basic unit or entity for use\nin the creation of legal relationships. Beyond this, however, it is suggested that\nbeings or objects are endowed with legal personality as a form of community\nrecognition that the entity in question is &quot;a unit [with] interests which need and\ndeserve social protection&quot;. Thus, the key to the concept of legal personality may, as\nNekam argues, be seen to lie in the question of whether the community values a\nparticular being or object enough to make of it a subject of rights - that is, a legal\nperson.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                           44</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">It is clear that Nekam does not predicate the conferral of legal personality upon a\nbeing or object on the possession of human personality by that being or object. The\nlegal person is &quot;for the logic of the system ... just as much a pure &#x27;concept&#x27; as &#x27;one&#x27;\nin arithmetic&quot; and &quot;just as independent from a human being as one is from an\n&#x27;apple&#x27;&quot;. Legal personality &quot;is not the same as human personality&quot;. Nekam reports\nthat in modem legal systems, legal rights have been accorded to the dead, and even\nto &quot;spirits&quot;, &quot;gods&quot;, &quot;devils&quot; and &quot;idols&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_191\">In the modem context, corporations are the prime example of a nonhuman legal\nperson. Although the legal treatment of corporations frequently is coloured by\nanthropomorphic overtones, it is easier to conceptualise the artificial nature of legal\npersonality in the case of a corporation, than in the case of a human legal person.\nThe routine use of the term &quot;artificial person&quot; to describe a corporation is a\nconstant reminder that the corporation is the offspring of legal creativity. However,\nour use of the term &quot;natural person&quot; in relation to human legal persons tends to\nserve as a constant, erroneous suggestion that legal personality is &quot;a characteristic\ninherent in the nature of [human beings]&quot;. It should be remembered that even the\napplication of the word &#x27;person* to human beings &quot;was at first metaphorical&quot;, for\n&#x27;person&#x27; derives from persona - a word which did not originally mean &#x27;human&#x27;.\nBearing in mind that we have established there is no necessary requirement that a\nlegal person possess human personality, we should note that there is one sense in\nwhich there is a always a &quot;necessary connection between every right established\n[which, in order to exist, must be attached to a legal person] and some human\nbeing&quot;. As Nekam points out, every right needs &quot;somebody to dispose of it&quot; and\n&quot;every interest to be protected&quot; requires &quot;somebody to look after it&quot;. These functions\nare performed by the &quot;administrator&quot; of the rights and interests, who must have\n&quot;will&quot; in order to carry out these functions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">Nekam concludes that since only humans have &quot;will&quot;, an administrator must\nalways be a human being. Thus, since the rights and interests of every legal person\nrequire an administrator to exercise and protect them, and since, according to\nNekam, only a human can become an administrator, there is always a certain\nconnection between legal persons and human beings.\nHowever, it is only coincidental that the concepts of the beneficiaiy of rights and the\nadministrator of those rights &quot;overlap&quot; in the case of the &quot;normal adult person&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">(presumably by this Nekam means the legal person with full capacity, who is\ntypically an adult human being). If the distinction between the beneficiary of rights\nand the administrator of that beneficiary&#x27;s rights is not carefully maintained, we\nwill find ourselves confusing the two, and thus assuming that because the\nadministrator of rights must be a human being, able to interact with the courts and\nthe legal system, then the beneficiary of the rights must automatically be human\nalso.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">The question of whether or not new legal persons can be created thus appears a\nmoot point. It seems, as Lawson argues, that there is probably no &quot;limit in logic ...\nto the number of legal persons that may be interpolated at any point in human\nrelations&quot;. In other words, there is nothing inherent in the concept of legal\npersonality which prevents its extension to animals.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">The real question relates to whether an entity will be considered by the community\nand its lawmakers to be of such social importance that it deserves or needs legal\nprotection in the form of the conferral of legal personality. Nekam suggests that this\ndecision is based upon the community&#x27;s &quot;emotional valuation&quot; of the entity&#x27;s need\nfor legal protection. This is essentially what Lawson refers to as the policy factor\ninherent in the question of whether new legal persons should be created.\nThe importance of the policy factor in relation to the extension of legal personality\nto animals must not be underestimated. Lawson suggests that the legislature\nprobably needs to be involved in the extension of legal personality to new entities.\nThis seems likely to be the case in regard to animals. Although on the whole judges\nappear more willing than ever before to engage in creative interpretation of the law,\nthey are unlikely to be keen to forge too far ahead of the legislature in regard to the\nextension of rights to animals, which would no doubt be seen as a contentious\nsocial issue best dealt with by the legislature.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">Unfortunately, seeking legislative conferral of personality on animals is effectively a\nHerculean challenge, as legislative measures frequently lag behind societal\nchanges. Gary Francione makes the cynical, yet pragmatic, point that when &quot;an\neconomic system finds it advantageous&quot;, as with the extension of legal personality\nto corporations, &quot;its notion of &#x27;personhood&#x27; can become quite elastic&quot;. Conversely,\nlegislative change can become &quot;enmired indefinitely&quot; if opposed by powerful vested\ninterests. Those with direct vested interests in maintaining animals&#x27; current legal\nstatus as property might range from multi-national pharmaceutical companies who\nrely on a supply of animals to use as subjects in drug development and testing, to\nfarmers who sell eggs produced by &#x27;battery hens&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">Yet the failure of an attempt to legislate for the &quot;enfranchisement of animals&quot; might\nnot be solely attributable to the opposition of such vested interests. In spite of the\nefforts of animal rights&#x27; activists to raise public awareness of animal rights&#x27; issues,\nit is conceivable that public interest in the issue of the extension of legal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                             45</span>\n\npersonality to animals would be minimal. It is equally conceivable that the\ncommunity might actively oppose legislative action to make animals &#x27;persons&#x27;. Such\nopposition would probably be fatal to the animal cause, for as Bernard Rollin notes,\nlegislative change in favour of animal rights has little chance of success unless\n&quot;public opinion can be galvanised on its behalf&#x27;. For this reason, it seems that we\nmust play upon human emotions in order to obtain the community&#x27;s support for\nthe legislative conferral of legal personality on animals. The general disapproval of\nanthropomorphism expressed by many of those engaged in philosophical\ndiscussion of animal rights may need to be tempered by pragmatism in order to\nmaximise community support for the extension of personality to animals. Human\nweakness for animals who exhibit &#x27;human-like&#x27; behaviour, such as the use of\nlanguage by apes, can be used to animal advantage by arousing empathy in human\nobservers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">Peter Singer appears to be attempting to exploit this facet of human nature by\nemploying John Locke&#x27;s definition of a person in his argument in favour of the\nextension of personhood to include nonhuman animals. Locke defined a &#x27;person&#x27; as\na &quot;thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself\nas itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places&quot;. The intelligent,\nself-aware, rational being embodied in Locke&#x27;s definition bears a striking\nresemblance to the legal person of full capacity in our legal system. This person is\ntypically a &#x27;normal&#x27; human adult, whom the law characterises as an &quot;intellectually\nsophisticated, autonomous [agent]&quot;. Singer argues that the scientific study of\nanimals provides plenty of evidence to suggest that animals like Koko fit Locke&#x27;s\ndefinition of a &#x27;person&#x27;. He claims that the &quot;evidence for personhood&quot; is currently\nmost conclusive for the great apes- gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans. These\nanimals&#x27; (potential) use of language appears to form an integral part of the\n&quot;evidence for personhood&quot;, for their ability to communicate using sign language\nenables researchers to attempt to discern, for example, the degree to which they\nmay be said to be self aware. Our present inability to communicate effectively\nbeyond the level of intuition with other animals seems to prevent the conclusive\nformulation of &quot;evidence for personhood&quot; in relation to them. Nonetheless, Singer\nargues that &quot;whales, dolphins, elephants, monkeys, dogs, pigs and other animals\nmay eventually also be shown to be aware of their own existence over time and\ncapable of reasoning&quot;. In a sense, this assertion begs the question of whether a\nbeing must demonstrate self-awareness, or self-consciousness, and the capacity to\nreason in order to be eligible for the attribution of legal personality. As noted above,\nthe typical bearer of the full complement of legal rights and duties in our system is\na human adult endowed with rationality, sanity and autonomy. Clearly, however,\nthere are far more legal persons in existence than there are so-called &#x27;normal\nhuman adults* in the community. Apart from nonhuman legal entities like\ncorporations, we must fit into the personality equation, among others, foetuses,\nchildren, insane adults, adults suffering from other forms of mental illness,\nintellectually disabled humans and humans in comas. The fact that none of these\n&#x27;persons&#x27; possess the same degree of rationality and autonomy as the characteristic\n(some would say caricatured) legal person discussed above might be an\noverwhelming problem, were it not for the variability of legal capacity. It is not a\nprecondition of legal personality that every legal entity possess a &#x27;complete set&#x27; of\nlegal rights and obligations. Within the human community of legal individuals,\ndifferent individuals possess different rights and bear different obligations - yet all\nremain legal persons. Children, for example, have limited rights and obligations\nbecause they are not thought capable of exercising the same level of reasoning and\nunderstanding assumed of normal adults. Thus the concept of the legal entity is a\nrelative one. Legal personality does not require that an entity &quot;have certain\nminimum rights attributed to it&quot;. It is not an &#x27;all or nothing&#x27; approach. We can\nattribute to a legal entity as little as a single right or obligation, or a wide variety of\nrights and obligations. Arguing that animals should become legal persons, and\nthus have legal rights, does not equate to a demand that animals should possess\nevery conceivable legal right, or even that animals should have the same rights as\nhuman beings. Nor is it necessary that all animals possess identical rights. Clearly,\nthe conferral of legal personality on animals would necessitate a careful\nconsideration of which rights and/or obligations would be appropriate to extend to\nparticular animals. It is equally clear, however, that although there is an advantage\ninherent in being the legal person of full capacity, because this person&#x27;s interests\nare those best served by our modem legal system, that advantage does not\ntranslate into a requirement that all legal persons possess, or be capable of\npossessing, the full complement of legal rights and duties. Therefore, it seems that\nSinger&#x27;s use of the Lockeian model of the person, with its focus on reason,\nintelligence and selfawareness, is in fact a double-edged sword. It helps make his\nargument as palatable as possible for his human audience by emphasising the fact\nthat animals may possess, though to a lesser degree than humans, qualities such\nas intelligence, rationality and self-awareness - qualities which we commonly view\nas &#x27;human&#x27; qualities. The inherent danger in Singer&#x27;s focus on such attributes is\nthat he sets an unnecessarily high standard for admission to the community of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                            46</span>\n\npersons, which could impede the inclusion of animals other than the great apes. In\nresponse to this potential criticism, Singer has argued that reformers &quot;can only\nstart from a given situation, and work from there&quot;, as the alteration of the status\nquo can only be brought about in stages, with each small progression functioning\nas a point of transition to the next stage. Yet without denying the pragmatism of\nthis argument, it is disturbing to note that a consistent application of Singer&#x27;s\nstandard could require the withdrawal of legal personality from a number of human\npersons, such as anencephalic babies, or those who are severely intellectually\ndisabled, or in an irreversible coma. Singer rightly points to the illogicality of\nincluding such humans in the community of legal persons, while excluding animals\n&quot;with equal or superior characteristics and capacities&quot;. However, attempting to\nresolve this logical inconsistency by adopting criteria for personhood based on\nLocke&#x27;s definition of the person would constitute a serious assault on the progress\nmade in relation to the human rights of humans like those mentioned above. It is\nsuggested that this is an unacceptable price to pay, in both moral and political\nterms, for the extension of legal personality to animals. Arguably it would amount\nto the replacement of the bias inherent in the concept of legal personality which\nfavours members of the species Homo sapiens, with an intellectual bias in favour of\nbeings possessing qualities such as intelligence, rationality and self-awareness. Yet\nit may not be necessary to pay this price, for, strictly speaking, the law does not\nimpose Singer&#x27;s standard upon those to whom it extends legal personality. The\nconcept of legal personality makes allowances for persons possessing varying\ndegrees of intelligence, rationality and self-awareness through the gradation of\ncapacity. It may be appropriate for animal legal persons to have similar capacity to\nthat of young children, including limitations on criminal liability and contractual\ncapacity. It is important that they are able to initiate legal proceedings to restrain\nor to seek compensation for the infringement of their rights. No doubt the\nsubstantive content of animals&#x27; new legal rights would be the subject of extensive\ndebate. It suffices to note here that those rights are likely to be limited to basic\nrights such as the right to freedom from cruel treatment and the infliction of\ntorture or unnecessary suffering, and potentially, though not necessarily, the right\nto life.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">Arguments for the extension of legal personality to animals\nWe have established that there is nothing inherent in the concept of legal\npersonality preventing its extension to animals. We will see that there are also good\nreasons why we should extend legal personality to animals.\nCentral to this argument is Stone&#x27;s assertion that legal personality plays an\nimportant part in &quot;making a thing count in the eyes of the law. The conferral of\nlegal personality upon rightless objects or beings carries with it legal recognition\nthat those objects or beings have &quot;worth and dignity&quot; in their own right&quot;. Until we\nattribute personality to a rightless entity, we are likely to be unable to conceive of it\nas &quot;anything but a thing for the use of &#x27;us&#x27; - those who are holding rights at the\ntime.&quot; Thus it is suggested that the inclusion of animals in the\ncommunity of legal persons will dignify them by forcing humans to see and value\nanimals for themselves, rather than seeing them simply as the object of property\nrights, or as something for humans to &#x27;use and abuse&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">The paradox is that we may be loathe to extend legal personality to animals\nbecause we find it difficult to value animals for what they are - but we may\ncontinue to have difficulty seeing animals&#x27; intrinsic worth and dignity &quot;until we can\nbring ourselves to give [them] &#x27;rights&#x27;&quot;. As Stone observes, extending rights to new\nentities always appears &quot;unthinkable&quot; until the change is actually effected, as we\ntend to suppose &quot;the rightlessness of rightless &#x27;things&#x27; to be a decree of Nature, not\na legal convention acting in support of some status quo.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">Attempting to alter the status quo is never easy. Yet persistence is of the essence,\nfor as Singer highlights, the term &#x27;person&#x27; is far from being a &quot;mere descriptive\nlabel&quot;. In fact, it &quot;carries with it a certain moral standing&quot; which is needed to force\nus to think of animals as deserving of the basic rights we take for granted. The\nlaw&#x27;s attitude towards animals could be said to amount to a policy statement about\nhuman society&#x27;s regard, or disregard, for animals. Thus were the law to bring\nanimals in &#x27;out of the cold*, where they languish as rightless beings, the objects of\nrights held by legal persons, and draw them under the umbrella of legal\npersonality, it would ideally encourage the development of more respectful and less\nexploitative social attitudes towards animals.\nThe shelter of the legal umbrella would also provide more effective protection of\nanimal interests than is available under current animal welfare law. As legal\npersons, animals could be recognised as parties to legal actions, because they\nwould have the independent standing that they currently lack. There is no\nconceptual problem with the fact that animals&#x27; inability to speak means that they\nwould require human legal persons to act as their representatives and to interact\nwith the courts and the legal system on their behalf. As I noted above, it is quite\nacceptable for a legal person&#x27;s rights and interests to be exercised and protected by\nanother legal person acting as the &quot;administrator&quot; of those rights. Infants are a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                           47</span>\n\nprime example of legal persons whose rights and interests must be administered by\nanother legal person, usually a parent or an appointed guardian.\nIn practical terms, a human legal person of full capacity, concerned with the well-\nbeing of the animal and willing to represent the animal on a legal level, could be\nappointed by the court as the guardian and legal representative of that animal.\nAppropriate guardians might include animal welfare bodies, like the RSPCA, or\nindividuals with a particular interest in, or familiarity with, the animal concerned.\nThe guardian could represent the interests of an individual animal or a group of\nanimals. For example, guardians might represent the rights of grain-destroying\ncockatoos to a humane death, rather than cruel clubbing, the rights of circus\nanimals to freedom from suffering caused by unnatural captivity, or the rights of\nmarine animals and birds to prevent the indiscriminate killing caused by the use of\nnets in long-line trawling.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_194\">The advantage of this approach is that it would require a court to take the animals&#x27;\ninterests directly into account as parties to the legal action, rather than as the\nobject of rights. This is not to intimate that the animals&#x27; interests must prevail over\nthose of other legal persons. Rather, this approach would require the court\nexplicitly to acknowledge the animals&#x27; interests, as it must acknowledge those of\nother legal persons party to the proceedings, and weigh their interest against those\nof the other parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_195\">This scenario is not far-fetched. The community is already vocal in its disapproval\nof practices such as long-line trawling, which results in the unnecessary deaths of\nlarge numbers of marine animals in the trawler&#x27;s nets. The prospect that society\nwill demand that the next step be taken may not be far away.\nOn balance, we must consider whether making animals &#x27;legal entities&#x27;, and hence\noffering them legal rights, really will procure better protection for animal interests.\nSteve Sapontzis argues that although &quot;rights&quot; constitute our &quot;most powerful moral\nand legal concept&quot;, they are best suited to &quot;the capacities and conditions of\nintellectually sophisticated agents&quot; - that is, to the legal person of full capacity. He\nsuggests that we should employ &quot;concepts suited to the capacities and conditions&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">of animals, rather than &quot;automatically demanding legal rights for nonhuman\nanimals to (or against) those things which (can, will, would) have an impact on their\nbasic interests&quot;. This appears to include strengthening the position of interests\nwhich do not amount to legal rights when those interests come into conflict with\nlegal rights, for example, by not allowing the legal rights automatically to override\nthe protected interests. The argument appears promising, but the fact that\nSapontzis offers no concrete examples of what he calls, in tantalising fashion,\n&quot;concepts suited to the capacities and conditions&quot; of animals, suggests that they\nare difficult to formulate. For now, at least, the extension of legal personality to\nanimals remains the best option for greater protection of animal interests.\nSome final thoughts\nThe concept of legal personality, as we have seen, is a construct of the law. As\nsuch, it can be extended to animals, or to other objects or beings, if the law so\nchooses. Ultimately, the question of whether legal personality will be bestowed on\nanimals depends on whether human beings are prepared to acknowledge that\nanimals need and deserve full legal protection for their rights and interests.\nThe multiplicity of animal beings with whom we share our world deserve to be\ntreated not as means to human ends, but as ends in themselves. Having arrogated\nto ourselves complete power over our animal kin, their liberation rests in our\nhands.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_196\">93.
