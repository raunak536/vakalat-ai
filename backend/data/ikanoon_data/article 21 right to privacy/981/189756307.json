The petitioners&#x27; Association is stated to be duly registered under\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/67909276/\" id=\"a_1\">Haryana Registration &amp; Regulation of Societies Act, 2012</a>\n\ncomprising of allottees of industrial plots/sites at Industrial Model Township,\n\nTehsil Manesar, District Gurugram who are carrying on their industrial and\n\nbusiness activities in the State of Haryana. The resolutions in favour of the\n\nauthorized representatives have been duly appended.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.           The petitioners lay challenge to &#x27;the 2020 Act&#x27; on account of the\n\nfact that it provides reservation in private employment and creates an\n\nunprecedented intrusion by the State Government into the fundamental rights\n\nof the private employers to carry on their business and trade as provided\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19</a> of Constitution of India. The restrictions thus placed upon\n\nthe rights of the petitioners are alleged not to be reasonable and are\n\nmanifestly arbitrary, capricious, excessive and uncalled for and the same\n\nbeing violative of the principles of natural justice, equality, liberty and\n\nfraternity laid down in the Preamble of the Constitution of India and is\n\nsubject to challenge. Similarly, infringement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India is also alleged in as much as all citizens of the country would have a\n                                 2 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           3\n\n\nright to equal employment, to reside and to settle in the State of Haryana and\n\nthe Act, thus, represents a serious assault on the unity and integrity of the\n\ncountry and the idea of a common Indian identity. It has been averred that a\n\nfundamental wedge is sought to be created between persons domiciled in\n\ndifferent States by the Statue in question which is contrary to the concept of\n\ncommon citizenship provided in the Constitution of India. The entire aim and\n\nobjectives of the Act was alleged to be incorrect, misconceived, fanciful and\n\ngranting overly broad discretion to the authorized officers appointed\n\nthereunder apart from the averments that the Haryana State lacked the\n\nlegislative competence to pass the same and it being in the domain of the\n\ncentral legislative and, thus, fell foul of <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 246</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Pleadings of State of Haryana\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.           The stand of the State in its reply was that the members of the\n\npetitioner-Association had been allotted industrial plots at subsidized rates for\n\ncarrying out their business and trade and, therefore, there was a pre-condition\n\nin the allotment that 75% of the employment was to be given to the persons\n\nhaving domicile of Haryana where the posts are not of technical nature. The\n\npolicies of the years 2005 and 2011 of the HSIIDC provided such pre-\n\ncondition which were appended alongwith the respective regular letter of\n\nallotments and, therefore, it was stated that there was suppression of material\n\nfacts and concealment in the writ petition. The right of the petitioners to\n\ninvoke the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 226</a> or 32 of the Constitutional Courts as\n\nsuch was objected to and that the Association could not claim any right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> The Statute was justified on the ground that it made a\n\nreasonable classification on the basis of domicile, which was permissible and\n                                 3 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           4\n\n\nnot violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 14</a> on the ground of geographical limits. The objects\n\nand reasons of the Legislation were highlighted and the industrial power\n\nhouses were accused of exerting their dominant position by enforcing an\n\ninequitable bargain with the migrant human resources and lowering the\n\nbenchmark for pay. Entry 24 and Entry 27 of (State List) List II of the\n\nConstitution of India were relied upon alongwith Entry 24 and Entry 36 of\n\nList III (Concurrent List) to hold out that private employers were not offering\n\nor were reluctant in providing jobs to the local people in the State of Haryana.\n\nIt was this aspect of unemployment of the local population which had to be\n\naddressed on priority basis. Classification was alleged to be founded on the\n\nintelligible differentia distinguishing persons or things that are grouped\n\ntogether and stated to have a rational relation to the object sought to be\n\nachieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">5.          It was averred that the right to provide 75% reservation for\n\nemployment in the private sector could be restricted in any manner specially\n\nsince it was only regarding the employment to low paid jobs and not of other\n\nhigher skilled/expert/managerial or other technically sound jobs. Most of\n\nagricultural land of Haryana having been acquired/consolidated for various\n\npurposes other than agricultural activities had resulted in unemployment of\n\nthe agriculture based society. It was accordingly justified that the Act did not\n\ndiscriminate regarding public employment under the Central Government or\n\nthe State Government or any other organization owned by the Central\n\nGovernment or the State Government and was not repugnant to Chapter III of\n\nthe Constitution of India containing fundamental rights of the citizens of\n\nIndia. It was pleaded that reservation on the basis of place of birth would\n\nviolate the provisions of the Constitution of India but employment on the\n                                 4 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                          5\n\n\nbasis of domicile would not offend <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 15(1)</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nand the unemployed local youth were a distinct class and reasonable\n\nclassification could be made of this particular class for the purposes of\n\nproviding 75% employment in private sectors in new employment after the\n\ncommencement of this Act. Accordingly, it was pleaded that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 14</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India forbids class legislation but does not forbid\n\nreasonable classification. Resultantly, a distinction was sought to be drawn\n\nthat domicile and place of birth are two distinct conceptions with different\n\nconnotations, both in law and fact. The Andhra Pradesh legislation from\n\nwhich concept it was alleged to be copied was sought to be distinguished on\n\nthis ground and it was pleaded that the domicile based benefit was recognized\n\nand was upheld by the Apex Court. The fundamental rights provided under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> was pleaded not to be an absolute right but a qualified one\n\nand the State could impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of general\n\npublic and it was pleaded that the influx of a large number of migrants\n\ncompeting for low paid jobs had placed a significant impact on the local\n\ninfrastructure and housing leading to proliferation of slums. This had lead to\n\nenvironmental and health issues which had been acutely felt in the urban\n\nareas of Haryana affecting quality of living and livability and, therefore,\n\npreference was being given to local candidates for low paid jobs and any such\n\npreference was in the interest of the general public. The sunset clause of the\n\nlegislation was highlighted that the Act would cease to have effect after 10\n\nyears and the State&#x27;s capacity to build the infrastructure was highlighted. The\n\namount of Rs.30,000/- per month being fixed as the gross monthly salary was\n\nhighlighted to justify that unemployed youth from whole of the country can\n\njoin any of the industry or factory or other employments in the State of\n                                5 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">             ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           6\n\n\nHaryana where wages are more and 25% of the area of the scope of jobs was\n\nstill available and the intention was not to bar employment out of the State of\n\nHaryana in totality. Therefore, the rationale providing such reservation was\n\njustified by alleging that the federal structure of the nation as provided by the\n\nConstitution of India was not under attack by the provisions of the Act.\n\nPleadings of Union of India\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.           The Union of India in its initial short reply, which was filed after\n\ndirections had been issued on 22.02.2022 to file a reply since substantial\n\nquestions of law were involved, took the plea that the legislation being a State\n\nlegislation, the Central Government had no comments to offer and the assent\n\nhad been given by the Governor of Haryana and the same has not been sent to\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble President of India due to it being a State legislation. On account\n\nof directions being issued to file a detailed para wise reply on 04.03.2022\n\nsince the Act would affect other citizens of India who may not be domiciled,\n\nanother short reply dated 08.03.2022 was filed by Sh. R.K. Srivastava, Joint\n\nSecretary and Legal Adviser, Department of Legal Affairs, Government of\n\nIndia. The objects and reasons were highlighted to again hold out that it was\n\na State legislation bearing a reasonable correlation sought to be achieved and\n\nit was appropriate for the State to clarify this aspect and not the Union of\n\nIndia. Reference was made to <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_11\">Articles 245</a> and <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_12\">246</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia to plead that the State had averred that it was a State legislation and\n\nenacted by the State on the subject which fell within its legislative domain\n\nunder Entries 24 and 27 of List II (State List) and Entries 24 and 36 of List III\n\n(Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.\n\nResultantly, in sum and substance, the Union of India has not much to offer\n\non the legal discourse which is to take place in this situation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                                 6 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           7\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.           <a href=\"/doc/67909276/\" id=\"a_13\">The Act</a> in question was notified on 06.11.2021 and in view of\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/182400555/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 1(3)</a> of the said Act, the Act came into force w.e.f.\n\n15.01.2022 (Annexure P-8). Apparently, the State introduced the Haryana\n\nState Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020 (Annexure P-4)\n\nwherein, it sought to provide 75% employment to local candidates by an\n\nemployer in the State of Haryana. Objections are stated to have been raised\n\nacross the State in the form of representations leading to the introduction of\n\nthe Bill on 31.10.2020 i.e the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates\n\nBill, 2020 (Annexure P-5) wherein, the statement of objects and reasons\n\nprovided that there was an influx of a large number of migrants competing for\n\nlow paid jobs which is impacting the local infrastructure and housing and is\n\nultimately leading to proliferation of slums.        The quality of living and\n\nlivelihood has been affected and, therefore, preference is sought to be given\n\nto local candidates in low paid jobs as it was desirable for social and\n\neconomic purposes and such preference would be in the interest of the\n\ngeneral public.    Similarly, stress was laid upon the fact that it would\n\nencourage the private employers to boost local employment and they would\n\nget the benefit of qualified and trained local work force directly or indirectly\n\nand would enhance efficiency of the industry at large as the work force is one\n\nof the major components for the development of any industrial\n\norganization/factory. One of the salient features of the bill was that training\n\nwould be provided to eligible local candidates where qualified or suitable\n\ncandidates are not available. The objects and reasons for introducing the Act\n\nin question read thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;HARYANA GOVT. GAZ. (EXTRA).

Accordingly, it was contended that what was forbidden for the\n\nState could not be commanded to the private employer on the pain of\n\nprosecution under the Act and to do what the Constitution prohibited the\n\nState. While referring to <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 38</a> and the duties of the State to secure social\n\norder for protection of the welfare of people and to minimise the inequalities\n\nin income and to eliminate the inequalities in status and to provide\n\nopportunities would amount to withdrawing opportunities from a group of\n\npeople and to give the same to another group of people on the basis of birth.\n\nThe citizens of the country nomenclature as migrants, in the objects and\n\nreasons, was attacked with vigor and venom by the senior counsel on the\n\nground that the fundamental duties under <a href=\"/doc/867010/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 51A</a> of Part IVA which\n\nwere provided under sub-Clause (e) were to promote harmony and spirit of\n\ncommon brotherhood amongst the people of the country which had to cross\n\nthe boundaries of regional and sectional diversities. It is accordingly the\n\nargument of the senior counsel that <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_84\">19(1)(e)</a> provided the\n\nfreedom to move freely throughout the territory of India and to reside and\n\nsettle in any part of the same and on the concept of the Act providing that\n\n&quot;this is my patch of land&quot; and others could not encroach on it was against the\n\nsettled provisions of the Constitution and had amounted to regional\n\nnationalism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">Legal Arguments of Mr. Akshay Bhan, Sr. Advocate\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">19.

While referring to the written statement filed\n\nby the State, it is pointed out that the State had justified the classification\n\nunder the head &quot;geographical&quot;.

It is accordingly submitted that once the State itself was holding out\n\nthat the Legislation was to prevent the unwarranted influx of human resources\n\nto the detriment of the domiciled people, the same was per se unconstitutional\n\nas the State could not discriminate in view of <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_85\">Articles 19(1)(d)</a><a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_86\">, 19(1)(e)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_87\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.

The arguments raised by Mr. Bali on the maintainability of the\n\nwrit petitions on account of being filed by the Association seem attractive at\n\nthe first blush keeping in view the judgments which he has relied upon as\n\nnoticed in his submissions made in Para No.20. However, it is to be seen and\n\nnoticed that in the present bunch of cases, CWP-1698-2022 filed by Akhilesh\n\nLeekha has also been filed by an individual challenging vires of the Act. The\n\nspecific averments have been made that he runs a small scale manufacturing\n\nindustry of garments from Plot No.144, Sector 3, IMT Manesar under a\n\npartnership concern namely &#x27;Vastra Fashions&#x27; since last 10 years and has\n\nemployed more than 100 persons in the said business. It has further been\n\npleaded that he is also running a sole proprietorship concern having more\n\nthan 10 employees. The said writ petition was admitted with the bunch of\n\ncases on 03.02.2022 wherein, the provisions of the Act were stayed.\n\nThereafter on 22.02.2022, CM-935-CWP-2022 was filed for impleading\n\nRajesh Gupta in CWP-26573-2021 as petitioner and it was noticed that it had\n\nonly been filed in view of objection taken by the State regarding the claim for\n                                26 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           27\n\n\nbenefit for fundamental rights and the Learned Advocate General, Haryana\n\nhad taken time to file reply to the said application. The said application was\n\nthereafter allowed on 04.03.2022 and the said individual was also impleaded\n\nas petitioner No.3 and, therefore, it cannot be as such said that there are only\n\nthe Associations who were agitating against vires of the Statutes. The State\n\nhad chosen not to file any reply on merits in CWP-1698-2022 filed by the\n\nindividual, though on 04.03.2022, permission had been taken to file reply in\n\nall cases by the senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State. Thus, the\n\nissue that the matter is only being agitated by the Associations is also not\n\nfactually correct and, therefore, it is our bounden duty to decide on merits\n\nupon the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1272928\" id=\"span_33\">24.

By a petition praying for a writ against\n            infringement of fundamental rights, except in a case\n            where the petition is for a writ of habeas corpus and\n            probably for infringement of the guarantee under Arts.\n            17, 23 and 24, the petitioner may seek relief in respect\n            of his own rights and not of others. The shareholder of a\n            Company, it is true, is not the owner of its assets; he has\n            merely a right to participate in the profits of the\n            Company subject to the contract contained in the\n            Articles of Association. But on that account the petitions\n            will not fail. A measure executive or legislative may\n            impair the rights of the Company alone, and not of its\n            shareholders; it may impair the rights of the\n            shareholders and not of the Company : it may impair\n            the rights of the shareholders as well as of the\n            Company. Jurisdiction of the Court to grant relief\n            cannot be denied, when by State action the rights of the\n            individual shareholder are impaired, if that action\n            impairs the rights of the Company as well. The test in\n            determining whether the shareholder&#x27;s right is impaired\n            is not formal: it is essentially qualitative: if the State\n            action impairs the right of the shareholders as well as to\n            the Company, the Court will not, concentrating merely\n            upon the technical operation of the action, deny itself\n            jurisdiction to grant relief.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                   15.

The defence of the State is interesting in as much as the\n\narguments raised by the senior counsel is contrary to what has been pleaded.\n\nMr. Bali has stressed upon the fact that the counsels for the petitioners have\n\nbeen reading out of context regarding the issue of migration to bring it\n\nbeyond the purview of the State legislation and trying to cover it under Entry\n\nNo.81 of the Union List. It has been his argument throughout that the\n\npurpose of the enactment was only to enhance the quality of living and\n                                35 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           36\n\n\nlivelihood to the residents of Haryana and to lift them from the morass of\n\ntheir poor quality of living and livelihood. It was accordingly argued that\n\nmerely because the word &quot;migrant&quot; had been used in the Statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons would not as such bring the Statute beyond the purview of the\n\nState legislation. The purpose as such was to boost local employment and\n\nalso to train the local work force and it was in the interest of general public.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">30.          Accordingly, it was argued that <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, which provides opportunities in the matter of public employment,\n\ntalked about the right to the citizen and not of an Association. Sub-clause (2)\n\nfurther provided the ineligibility or discrimination on account of place of\n\nbirth which was only qua a citizen in respect of any employment under the\n\nState. It was accordingly submitted that there is no such action of the State\n\nregarding any public employment and, therefore, the challenge as such was\n\nwithout any basis.      It was further contended that it was a reasonable\n\nrestriction which was permissible under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1801593/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 19(5)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_132\">19(6)</a> which was in the interest of the general public. It was, thus, argued that\n\nthere could not be an addition or subtraction from different parts of the\n\nConstitution and it could not be jumbled up by reading it together. The true\n\nletter and spirit of the Constitution had to be seen. While relying upon\n\n<a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 15(4)</a>, it was pointed out that it is permissible for the State to make\n\nspecial provisions for advancement of any socially and educationally\n\nbackward classes of citizens, though discrimination on the basis of place of\n\nbirth was prohibited for the State.        Similarly, while referring to Clause\n\n15(6)(a), it was pointed out that there is a special provision for advancement\n\nof economically weaker sections of citizens which gave the power to the\n\nState.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">                                36 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           37\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">31.         It was accordingly argued that the whole purpose was to provide\n\nbenefits to the lower strata of the State who were earning below Rs.30,000/-\n\nper month and the said limit had been reduced from Rs.50,000/-. It was\n\naccordingly submitted that merely because there was a word &quot;migration&quot; used\n\nin the objects and reasons, the reference to Entry 81 of List I (Union List) was\n\nnot justified. Rather attention of the Court was drawn to List-II and Entry 9\n\nregarding relief to the unemployed and Entry 24 qua industries and the\n\nconcurrent List III which gave the power to the State under Entries 23, 24 and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1515136\" id=\"span_60\">36.

The question is one of construction of this article,\n           particularly of the first three clauses, to find out the\n           ambit of the law-making power of Parliament. The first\n           clause emphasis that there shall be in India equality of\n           opportunity for all citizens in matters of employment or\n           appointment to any office under the State. The word\n           &#x27;State&#x27; here is to be understood in the extended sense\n           given to it by the definition of that word in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 12.</a>\n           The second clause then specifies prohibition against\n           discrimination only on the grounds of religion, race,\n           sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.\n           The intention here is to make every office or\n           employment open and available to every citizen, and\n           inter alia to make offices or employment in one part of\n           India open to citizens in all other parts of India. The\n           third clause then makes an exception. This clause was\n           amended by the <a href=\"/doc/156973329/\" id=\"a_152\">Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act,\n           1956</a>.

The clause thus enables Parliament to make a\n           law in a special case prescribing any requirement as to\n           residence within a State or Union Territory prior to\n           appointment, as a condition of employment in the State\n           or Union territory.

On the other hand, Mr. Setalvad bases his\n           argument on two things. He contends that the power is\n           given to Parliament to make any law and, therefore,\n           Parliament is supreme and can make any law on the\n           subject as the article says. He very ingeniously shifts the\n           emphasis to the words &#x27;an requirement&#x27; and contends\n           that the requirement may be as to residence in the State\n           or any particular part of State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">                 10.     The claim for supremacy of Parliament is\n           misconceived. Parliament in this, as in other matters, is\n           supreme only in so far as the Constitution makes it.\n           Where the Constitution does not concede supremacy,\n           Parliament must, act within its appointed functions and\n           not transgress them. What the Constitution says is a\n           matter for,construction of the language of the\n           Constitution. Which is the proper construction of the\n           two suggested? By the first clause equality of\n           opportunity in employment or appointment to an office\n           is guaranteed. By the second clause, there can be no\n           discrimination, among other things, on the ground of\n\n                               43 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">            ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                  Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                         44\n\n\n           residence. Realising, however, that sometimes local\n           sentiments may have to be respected or sometimes an\n           inroad from more advanced States into less developed\n           States may have to be prevented, and a residential\n           qualification may, therefore, have to be prescribed, the\n           exception in clause (3) was made. Even so, that clause\n           spoke of residence within the State. The claim of Mr.\n           Setalvad that Parliament can make a provision\n           regarding residence in any particular part of a State\n           would render the general prohibition lose all its\n           meaning. The words &#x27;any requirement&#x27; cannot be read\n           to warrant something which could have been said more\n           specifically. These words bear upon the kind of\n           residence or its duration rather than its location within\n           the State. We accept the argument of Mr. Gupte that the\n           Constitution, as it stands, speaks of a whole State as the\n           venue for residential qualification and it is impossible\n           to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of\n           residence in Districts, Taluqas, cities, towns or villages.\n           The fact that this clause is an exception and came as an\n           amendment must dictate that a narrow construction\n           upon the exception should be placed as indeed the\n           debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to\n           indicate. We accordingly reject the contention of Mr.\n           Setalvad seeking to put a very wide and liberal\n           construction upon the words &#x27;any law&#x27; and &#x27;any\n           requirement&#x27;. These words are obviously controlled by\n           the words &#x27;residence within the State or Union territory&#x27;\n           which words mean what they say, neither more nor less.\n           It follows, therefore, that<a href=\"/doc/159962778/\" id=\"a_155\"> S. 3</a> of the Public Employment\n           (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957, in so far as it\n           relates to Telengana (and we say nothing about the\n           other parts) and Rule 3 of the Rules under it are ultra\n           vires the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">                              44 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">            ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           45\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">                   11.

The defence of the State in response in its written statement that\n\nit was achieving the goals of Part-III was rightly highlighted by arguing that\n\nthe guarantees given in Part-III could not be subverted by destroying the basic\n\nstructure and the inter linked clauses of personal liberty and economic\n\nfreedom could not be achieved at the cost of the meanings provided under\n\nPart III for achieving the goals set out in Part IV of the Constitution of India.\n\nIt was submitted that in the 1980s, the disturbing trend on the part of the\n\nIndian Polity regarding regionalism had already been noticed by the Apex\n\nCourt and, therefore, the exercise of large groups being given the benefits on\n\naccount of numerical strength and to choose favoured areas and the favoured\n\nclauses for preferential treatment had been frowned upon. Even the then\n\nHon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of India, Justice Y.V.

The invasion into the territory of\n\nanother is to be determined by the pith and substance of the legislation and\n\nreliance can be placed upon the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/159992/\" id=\"a_187\">Union of\n\nIndia and others vs. Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra Teachers College</a>, (2002) 8\n\nSCC 228 wherein, it was held that the power of the union could not be\n\nencroached upon. It is not disputed that the issue of migration is covered as\n\nsuch under Entry No.81 of the Union List. The underlying purpose of the\n\nStatute itself, thus, is to make it impermissible for 75% of the strength of the\n\nemployer to have their employees from the rest of the country out of the ones\n\nwho are earning less than Rs.30,000/- per month. The end effect is that the\n\nemployer is left with a limited discretion to choose his work force on account\n\nof the action of the State.

The fact\n\nthat there is one nation with one citizenship and the dream of the Constitution\n\nMakers regarding emphasizing and maintaining the concept of &quot;India as a\n\nNation&quot; was noticed and that it has been imperilled at the hands of the &quot;Sons\n\nof the Soil&quot; claim. It had further been noticed that Parliament alone was\n\ngiven the right to enact an exception regarding the ban on discrimination\n\nbased on residence and that also in regard to positions with the employment\n\nof the State Government.       The Public Employment (Requirement as to\n\nResidence) Act, 1957 which protected various states like Andhra Pradesh,\n\nManipur, Tripura and Himachal Pradesh was noticed and the fact that State\n\nGovernments were pursuing policies of localism which had become wide\n\nspread.

The principles were laid to\n\ngive coherence to the Constitution and to make it an organic whole\n\nirrespective of the fact that it was not expressly stated in the written form and\n\nthough not structured expressly.

The Constitution itself could not be used legally to\n\ndestroy itself as the State was attempting to destroy the precious heritage of\n\nthis nation and the identity of the Constitution of India has to be protected.\n\nThe consequences of its denial on the integrity had to be kept in mind while\n\napplying the principles of constitutional morality. Stress can be laid on the\n\nobservations that democracy in India is only &quot;a top dressing on Indian soil\n\nwhich is essentially undemocratic&quot; and it was the observation made by Dr.\n\nB.R. Ambedkar when the Constitution was framed and the said principle will\n\nstill have to be kept in mind.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_114\">Reliance can accordingly be placed upon the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_234\">State (NCT of Delhi</a>) case (supra) wherein, the\n\nApex Court, while dealing with the issues of representative governance and\n\nthe scope of the parliamentary powers inter se the relationship of the Union\n\nGovernment with the U.T. had occasion to observe on the principle of\n\nconstitutional morality.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199141576\" id=\"span_115\">While relying upon the earlier judgment in <a href=\"/doc/199141576/\" id=\"a_235\">Manoj\n\nNarula vs. Union of India</a>, (2014) 9 SCC 1, reference was made to the\n\nphrase that firstly the Government should be enabled to control the governed\n\nand in the next place obliged to control itself. Thus, constitutional morality\n\nbeing the fulcrum is to act as an essential check upon the high functionaries\n\nand the citizens alike and it had accordingly been opined that unbridled power\n\nwithout any checks and balances would result in despotic and tyrannical\n\nsituations and would be antithetical to the very idea of democracy as has been\n\nmentioned in the words of the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak\n\nMisra.   The sustenance of the values that ushered in the foundation of\n\nconstitutional governance is the principal factor which has to be kept in mind,\n\nas the Constitution of India is a political document for assessing the\n                               62 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">             ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           63\n\n\ngovernance of the Indian society in an appropriate manner and therefore,\n\nthere has to be implicit institutional trust between the functionaries. The\n\nfulfillment of the constitutional idealism between the functionaries for\n\ncultivating the understanding of constitutional renaissance was the vision\n\nwhich was expected of the great living document which had to be kept in\n\nmind by the Lt. Governer and the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief\n\nMinister <a href=\"/doc/199141576/\" id=\"a_236\">in that case</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">55.          The present Chief Justice of India, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud\n\nhad also elaborated on the principle of constitutional morality in the same\n\njudgment to go on to hold that democracy was not limited to electing\n\ngovernments while again referring to the observations of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\n\nregarding the top dressing of the Indian soil.         The moral values of the\n\nConstitution, thus, are something to be upheld at every stage and it is not only\n\nthe text of the Constitution which can protect it. The observations against the\n\ntyranny of the majority and the upsurge of mob rule have to be balanced by\n\nthe principle of Constitutional morality and which is to act as a threshold\n\nagainst the same were some of the observations that had been made and it\n\nwould fit to the facts and circumstances of the present case. An effort is\n\nbeing made to distinguish between the citizens of this country on account of\n\ntheir domicile and their belonging to the State of Haryana. Andre Beteille in\n\nhis book &quot;Democracy and its Institutions&quot; can be rightly quoted regarding the\n\nfact that without infusion of constitutional moralities amongst legislature and\n\nJudges, Lawyers, Ministers, Civil Servants; the Constitution would become a\n\nplay thing of power progress and will become totally erratic and arbitrary.\n\nThe relevant quotation reads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">                   &quot;To be effective, constitutional laws have to rest\n                                63 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">              ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                           64\n\n\n             on a substratum of constitutional morality... In the\n             absence of constitutional morality, the operation of a\n             Constitution, no matter how carefully written, tends to\n             become arbitrary, erratic, and capricious. It is not\n             possible in a democratic order to insulate completely\n             the domain of law from that of politics. A Constitution\n             such as ours is expected to provide guidance on what\n             should be regulated by the impersonal rule of law and\n             what may be settled by the competition for power\n             among parties, among factions, and among political\n             leaders. It is here that the significance of constitutional\n             morality lies. Without some infusion of constitutional\n             morality among legislators, judges, lawyers, ministers,\n             civil servants, writers, and public intellectuals, the\n             Constitution becomes a plaything of power brokers.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_118\">56.

Constitutional morality provides a principled\n            understanding for unfolding the work of governance. It\n            is a compass to hold in troubled waters. It specifies\n            norms for institutions to survive and an expectation of\n            behaviour that will meet not just the text but the soul of\n            the Constitution. Our expectations may be well ahead of\n            reality. But a sense of constitutional morality, drawn\n            from the values of that document, enables us to hold to\n            account our institutions and those who preside over\n            their destinies. Constitutional interpretation, therefore,\n            must flow from constitutional morality.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_151\">57.

It is in such\n\ncircumstances the right of LGBT individuals was upheld.

The said principles are apparently not being\n\nkept in mind by the State while framing the current legislation which is under\n\nattack while terming the rest of the citizens of India as migrants. Reliance\n\ncan thus be again placed upon the observations of then Chief Justice of India,\n\nJustice Dipak Misra that it was the responsibility of the State to curb any\n\npropensity or proclivity of popular sentiment or majoritarianism to contend\n\nthat popular sentiment could not over ride the rights of the citizens of the\n\ncountry nor promote the local provincial interest which is clear from the\n\nobjects and reasons of the Act.

The fact that the nation would crack down under rigour if the text\n\nand spirit of the Constitution of India is not imbibed by the citizens and it has\n\nto be cultivated by the people so that they are able to protect the same and the\n\nattitude of respect and reverence has to be maintained towards their\n\nfellowmen.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_122\">59.          The term fraternity connoting a sense of common brotherhood is\n\nto embrace all Indians and a blind eye could not be turned to other citizens of\n\nthe country irrespective of the State they belong to.

The\n\nconcept of constitutional morality has been openly violated by introducing a\n\nsecondary status to a set of citizens not belonging to the State of Haryana and\n\ncurtailing their fundamental rights to earn their livelihood. The exploitation\n\nof the prohibition to private employment by way of a legislative command\n\nwhile keeping States out of the said restrictions and putting the employer\n\nunder the domain of criminalization on account of the violation of the same\n\ncan be termed as unconstitutional as a private individual could not be asked to\n\ndo what the State has been forbidden for itself.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">60.          It is to be noticed that the Constitution of America, vide its Vth\n\nAmendment has held that no citizen can be deprived of life, liberty or\n\nproperty without due process of law whereas under XIVth Amendment,\n\nprotection is granted to the citizens who are born or naturalized in the United\n\nStates and all the States where they reside. The State has been debarred from\n\nmaking or enforcing any law which shall abridge their privileges as citizens\n\nof the country and neither they can be deprived of their liberty, property\n\nwithout due process and nor deny the person within its jurisdiction the equal\n\nprotection of the laws. The fact of our Constitution having borrowed heavily\n\nfrom the principles of the said Constitution are well known and, therefore,\n\nreference to the judgments of the Supreme Court of U.S. can be made\n\nregarding the State making a provision which was violative and\n\ndiscriminatory on account of race which was the subject matter in James\n\nRichard Peterson vs. City of Greenville, (1963) 373 US 244.

On the one hand, the Fourteenth Amendment\n           plainly prohibits a State itself from discriminating\n           because of race. On the other hand, § 1 of the\n           Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid a private party,\n           not acting against a backdrop of state compulsion or\n           involvement, to discriminate on the basis of race in his\n           personal affairs as an expression of his own personal\n           predilections. As was said in Shelley v Kraemer, supra,\n           that Amendment erects no shield against merely private\n           conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.&quot; 334\n           U.S., at 13, 92 L Ed, at 1180, 3 ALR2d 441.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">           [17] At what point between these two extremes a\n           State&#x27;s involvement in the refusal becomes sufficient to\n           make the private refusal to serve a violation of the\n           Fourteenth Amendment, is far from clear under our case\n           law. If a State had a law requiring a private person to\n           refuse service because of race, it is clear beyond dispute\n           that the law would violate the Fourteenth Amendment\n           and could be declared invalid and enjoined from\n\n                              70 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">            ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                  Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                         71\n\n\n           enforcement. Nor can a State enforce such a law\n           requiring discrimination through either convictions of\n           proprietors who refuse to discriminate, or trespass\n           prosecutions of patrons who, after being denied service\n           pursuant to such a law, refuse to honor a request to\n           leave the premises.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">                 The question most relevant for this case, however,\n           is a slightly different one. It is whether the decision of an\n           owner of a restaurant to discriminate on the basis of\n           race under the compulsion of state law offends the\n           Fourteenth Amendment. Although this Court has not\n           explicitly decided the Fourteenth Amendment state\n           action issue implicit in this question, underlying the\n           Court&#x27;s decisions in the sit-in cases is the notion that a\n           State is responsible for the discriminatory act of a\n           private party when the State, by its law, has compelled\n           the act. As the Court said in Peterson v City of\n           Greenville, 373 U.S. 244, 248, <a href=\"/doc/139598664/\" id=\"a_248\">10</a> L.Ed. 2d 323, 326, 83\n           S.Ct 1119 (1963): &quot;When the State has commanded a\n           particular result, it has saved to itself the power to\n           determine that result and thereby &#x27;to a significant extent&#x27;\n           has become involved&#x27; in it.&quot; Moreover, there is much\n           support in lower court opinions for the conclusion that\n           discriminatory acts by private parties done under the\n           compulsion of state law offend the Fourteenth\n           Amendment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">                 In Baldwin v Morgan, supra, the Fifth Circuit\n           held that &quot;the very act of posting and maintaining\n           separate [waiting room] facilities when done by the\n           [railroad] Terminal as commanded by these state orders\n           is action by the state.&quot; The Court then went on to say:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">           &quot;As we have pointed out above the State may not use\n           race or color as the basis for distinction.

Without\n            deciding whether less substantial involvement of a State\n            might satisfy the state action requirement of the\n            Fourteenth Amendment, we conclude that petitioner\n            would show an abridgment of her equal protection right,\n            if she proves that Kress refused her service because of a\n            state-enforced custom of segregating the races in pubic\n            restaurants.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">62.

In Peterson v City of Greenville, 373 US\n           244, 10 L Ed 2d 323, 83 S Ct 1119 (1963), the\n           petitioners were convicted of trespass for refusing to\n           leave a lunch counter at a Kress store in South\n           Carolina. A Greenville ordinance at that time imposed\n           on the proprietors of restaurants the duty to segregate\n           the races in their establishments, and there was\n           evidence that the Kress manager was aware of the\n           ordinance. We held that the existence of the ordinance,\n           together with a showing that the Kress manager\n           excluded the petitioners solely because they were\n           Negroes, was sufficient to constitute discriminatory state\n           action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                  &quot;When the State has commanded a particular\n           result, it has saved to itself the power to determine that\n           result and thereby to a significant extent&#x27; has become\n           involved in it, and, in fact, has removed that decision\n           from the sphere of private choice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">                  &quot;Consequently these convictions cannot stand,\n           even assuming, as respondent contends, that the man-\n           ager would have acted as he did independent of the\n           existence of the ordinance.&quot; 373 US, at 248, 10 L Ed 2d\n           at 326.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                              73 of 83\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">            ::: Downloaded on - 18-11-2023 04:13:51 :::</span>\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:145649-DB\n\n\n\n\nCWP Nos. 26573 of 2021 and other connected matters                          74\n\n\n                    Although the case involved trespass convictions,\n            the Court did not rely on the State&#x27;s enforcement of its\n            neutral trespass laws in analyzing the elements of state\n            action present. Nor did it cite Shelley v Kraemer, supra,\n            the logical starting point for an analysis in terms of\n            Judicial enforcement. The denial of equal protection\n            occurred when the petitioners were denied service in the\n            restaurant. That denial of equal protection-tainted the\n            subsequent convictions. And as was noted in Reitman v\n            Mulkey, 387 US 369, 380, 18 1. Ed 2d 830, 837, 87 S Ct\n            1627 (1967), no &quot;proof [was] required that the\n            restaurant owner had actually been influenced by the\n            state statute. . . .&quot; Thus Peterson establishes the\n            proposition that where a State commands a class of\n            persons to discriminate on the basis of race,\n            discrimination by a private person within that class is\n            state action, regardless of whether he was motivated by\n            the command. The Court&#x27;s intimation in the present case\n            that private discrimination might be state action only\n            where the private person acted under compulsion\n            imposed by the State echoes Mr. Justice Harlan&#x27;s\n            argument in Peterson that private discrimination is state\n            action only where the State motivates the private person\n            to discriminate. See 373 US, at 251-253, 10 L Ed 2d at\n            328-329.

There is no doubt that this is so,\n           but <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_258\">Art. 14</a> prohibits the expropriation of the unearned\n           increment of one owner while leaving his neighbour\n           untouched.

If the object of the legislation is to\n           tax unearned increment it should be done throughout\n           the State. The State cannot achieve this object piece-\n           meat by compulsory acquisition of land of some owners\n           leaving others alone. If the object is to clear slums it\n           cannot be done at the expense of the owners whose\n           lands are acquired, unless as we have said the owner\n           are directly benefited by the scheme. If the object is to\n           build hospitals it cannot be done at the expense of the\n           owners of the land which is acquired. The hospital,\n           schools etc. must be built at the expense of the whole\n           community.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"257876\" id=\"span_137\">69.

The requirement to register any employee on the\n\ndesignated portal within three months who was being paid less than\n\nRs.30,000/- per month upto 75%, thus, is violative of the fundamental rights\n\nprotected under the Constitution of India.
