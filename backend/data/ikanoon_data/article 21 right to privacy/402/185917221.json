Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable\n                              defence of the accused. It is not obligatory for the Judge\n                              at that stage of the trial to consider in any detail and\n                              weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts, if proved,\n                              would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused\n                              or not.

Strong suspicion against the\n                              accused, if the matter remains in the region of suspicion,\n                              cannot take the place of proof of his guilt at the\n                              conclusion of the trial. But at the initial stage if there is a\n                              strong suspicion which leads the Court to think that there\n                              is ground for presuming that the accused has committed\n                              an offence then it is not open to the Court to say that\n                              there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the\n                              accused. The presumption of the guilt of the accused\n                              which is to be drawn at the initial stage is not in the sense\n                              of the law governing the trial of criminal cases in France\n                              where the accused is presumed to be guilty unless the\n                              contrary is proved. But it is only for the purpose of\n                              deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed\n                              with the trial or not.

But if, on the other hand, it is so at\n                              the initial stage of making an order under Section\n                              227 or Section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and\n                              generally the order which will have to be made will be\n                              one under Section 228 and not under Section 227.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">                              23.

Thus, the moot question that arises for answering the\n                             reference is, in the absence of the complainant letting in\n                             direct evidence of demand owing to the non-availability of\n                             the complainant or owing to his death or other reason,\n                             whether the demand for illegal gratification could be\n                             established by other evidence. This is because in the\n                             absence of proof of demand, a legal presumption under\n                             <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 20</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for\n                             short &quot;the Act&quot;) would not arise. Thus, the proof of\n                             demand is a sine qua non for an offence to be established\n                             under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_103\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_104\">13(1)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the Act and dehors\n                             the proof of demand the offence under the two sections\n                             cannot be brought home. Thus, mere acceptance of any\n                             amount allegedly by way of illegal gratification or recovery\n                             thereof in the absence of proof of demand would not be\n                             sufficient to bring home the charge under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_105\">Sections 7</a>,\n                             <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_106\">13(1)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the Act. Hence, the pertinent question\n                             is, as to how demand could be proved in the absence of any\n                             direct evidence being let in by the complainant owing to the\n                             complainant not supporting the complaint or turning\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">By:NIDHI</span>\nSigning Date:16.01.2024   CRL.M.C.6183/2019                                              Page 60\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">15:25:42</span>\n                              &quot;hostile&quot; or the complainant not being available on account\n                             of his death or for any other reason.

Once the said premise is established, the\n                             inference to be drawn is that the said gratification was\n                             accepted as a &quot;motive or reward&quot; for doing or forbearing\n                             to do any official act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                             87. Therefore, this Court cautioned that even if a witness is\n                             treated as &quot;hostile&quot; and is cross-examined, his evidence\n                             cannot be written off altogether but must be considered\n                             with due care and circumspection and that part of the\n                             testimony which is creditworthy must be considered and\n                             acted upon. It is for the Judge as a matter of prudence to\n                             consider the extent of evidence which is creditworthy for\n                             the purpose of proof of the case. In other words, the fact\n                             that a witness has been declared &quot;hostile&quot; does not result in\n                             an automatic rejection of his evidence. Even, the evidence\n                             of a &quot;hostile witness&quot; if it finds corroboration from the facts\n                             of the case may be taken into account while judging the\n                             guilt of the accused. Thus, there is no legal bar to raise a\n                             conviction upon a &quot;hostile witness&quot; testimony if\n                             corroborated by other reliable evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                             88.

The Supreme Court in this case referred\n\n                          Suresh Budharmal Kalani @ Pappu Kalani V State of\n\n                          Maharashtra, (1998) 7SCC337 wherein view was taken that\n\n                          confession by a co-accused containing incriminating matter against a\n\n                          person would not by itself suffice to frame charges against it.

The\n                             result, therefore, is that in dealing with a case against an\n                             accused person, the Court cannot start with the confession\n                             of a co-accused person; it must begin with other evidence\n                             adduced by the prosecution and after it has formed its\n                             opinion with regard to the quality and effect of the said\n                             evidence, then it is permissible to turn to the confession in\n                             order to receive assurance to the conclusion of guilt which\n                             the judicial mind is about to reach on the said other\n                             evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">                             Thus, the confession of a co- accused person cannot be\n                             treated as substantive evidence and can be pressed into\n                             service only when the Court is inclined to accept other\n                             evidence and feels the necessity of seeking for an assurance\n                             in support of its conclusions deducible from the said\n                             evidence.
