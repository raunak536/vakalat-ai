The appellant attended the hearing through video confelence and on behalf\nof the respondents shri Pankaj Gangwar and Shri s K verma, Under Secretary,\nDepartment of Personnel and rraining and Shri Ravi Nirmar, Under Secretary,\nMinistry of Home Affairs, New Delhi, attended the hearing in person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">5.1.   The appellant argued that the cPIo incomectly denied information under\n<a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a>0)of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a> on the ground that the information sought for\npertained to personal information of third parties. He contended that the\nappointments of IPS officers        in qucstion were madc 20 years before the date            on\n                                                                                   Page 2   of l0\n which the RTI application was made. Hence, in view of the provisions contained\nunder <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(3)</a> of the RTI Act, the exemption of personal information of third\nparty provided under section       8(l)O of the RTI Act        ceases   to exist. Hence, the\nCPIO should have provided the information sought for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">5.2.     The respondent while defending their case reiterated that the information\nsought by the appellant pertained to personal information               of third parties,    the\ndisclosure of which had no relationship to any public interest and would have\ncaused unwarranted invasion        of the privacy of the third parties. The      respondent\nemphasized that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court of India in plethora of cases had held\n\nthat the right to privacy was a fundamental right, and hence, the same could have\nnot been eclipsed by ordinary statute. Hence, the information sought for could not\nbe disclosed under the provisions        ofthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_11\">RTI Act</a>. The respondent denied the fact\nthat the right to privacy arose 20 years back and ended with the appointment. The\nrespondent contested the claim       of the appellant that the limitation period of          20\nyears expired after lapse      of 20 years from the date of appointment. It                was\ncontended that it was continuing and hence the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_12\">section 8(3)</a> were not\n\nattracted in that case. The matter of privacy was continuous phenomenon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">5.3. The     issue before the Commission was as  to whether by virtue of                    the\nprovisions contained under sub-section (3 ) ol <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_13\">section 8</a> of the RTI Act,                    the\npersonal information which was           in the custody of a public authority was to         be\ndisclosed under RTI application after lapse of 20 years. The relevant portion                of\n<a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_14\">section 8</a> of the RTI Act read as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">   &quot;8.

The operation               of the statue would\nprovide more access         to the information and thus bring transparency                  and\naccountability. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">The RTI Act</a> is a statute Act which provides for rights and\nobligations ofpersons.      on the other       hand, the right to privacy is a facet   ofright\nto life and personal liberty enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the constitution.

The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case,\nhearing both pafties and perusal of records, feels that the right to privacy being a\n\nfacet    of   fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a>     of the Constitution has to    be\n\nprotected in accordance with the three parameters <a href=\"/doc/1416283/\" id=\"a_30\">laid down by</a> the Supreme\nCoufi in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1416283/\" id=\"a_31\">K.S.Puttaswamy</a> (Supra) i.e. (i) there must be legal object,</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">(ii) there must be legal framework and (iii) there must be nexus between the\nobjective to be achieved and the privacy to be compromised. lt appears that for\nmeeting different treatment, there must be a reasonable classification and the\nclassification must have a rational nexus with the objective to be achieved. If we\ntake that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_32\">RTI Act</a> contains provisions providing framework for disclosures\noutweighing right to privacy undcr <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 8(3)</a> of the RTI Act which aims\ntransparency and accountability,           the appellant may be entitled for       the\n\ninlormation      ol the occurrence      which took place 20 years before the RTt\napplication. Thus the Right to Privacy of the 3&#x27;d party may not be absolute if the\nsame is falling within the ambit of the aforementioned parameters.
