According to the petitioner, sofar, Mr.Narendra Modi, has not acknowledged her, as his wife.

According to the petitioner, Mrs.Jashodaben has been threatened and she is in a distressed condition. She is not able to talk to any journalist.  The petitioner has also submitted that the Headmaster of the School had instructed Mrs.Jashodaben Modi, not to speak to any outsider, during school hours, and after school hours, goondas of Mr.Modi, threatened her, not to speak to the Journalist, who contacted her.  Describing Mr.Modi, the petitioner has said that he is iron hearted person and acts against the upliftment of women, denied maintenance and property rights, to his wife.

A Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/980276/\" id=\"a_1\">A.S.M.Kumar v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> reported in 2008 (5) MLJ 399, to which, one of us, is a party, has considered the following judgments,\n\t\t\t&quot;8.The question of admissibility of the newspaper reports came up for consideration in Samant N.Balkrishna and another Vs.George Fernandez and other reported in 1969 (3) SCC 238 at paragraph 26, the Apex Court observed that\n\t\t\t&quot;A newspaper item without any further proof of what had actually happened through witnesses is of no value.  It is at best a second hand evidence.  It is well known that reporters collect information and pass it on to the editor who edits the news item and then publish it. In this process truth might get perverted or garbled. Such news items cannot be said to prove themselves although they may be taken into account with other evidence if the other evidence is forcible.&quot;</span>\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1846664\" id=\"span_2\">9.As regards nature and admissibility of a newspaper report, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1846664/\" id=\"a_2\">Lakmi Raj Shetty and another Vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a> reported in 1988 (3) SCC 319,  opined  that \n\t\t\t&quot;...We cannot take judicial notice of the facts stated in a news item being in the nature of hearsay secondary evidence, unless proved by evidence aliunde.  A report in a newspaper is only hearsay evidence.  A newspaper is not one of the documents referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1775797/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 78(2)</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 by which an allegation of fact can be proved. The presumption of genuineness attached under <a href=\"/doc/492182/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 81</a> of the Evidence Act to a newspaper report cannot be treated as proved of the facts reported therein.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"582645\" id=\"span_3\"><a href=\"/doc/582645/\" id=\"a_5\">10.In Quamarul Islam Vs. S.K.Kanta</a> reported in 1994 (1) SCC 452, the question as to whether mere production of the copy of the newspaper be treated as proof of the report of the speech (news item) contained therein came up for consideration. The Apex Court at Paragraph 48 of the judgment held that,\n\t\t\t&quot;48.Newspaper reports by themselves are not evidence of the contents thereof. Those reports are only hearsay evidence.  These have to be proved and the manner of proving a newspaper report is well settled.  Since, in this case, neither the reporter who heard the speech and sent the report was examined nor even his reports produced, the production of the newspaper by the Editor and publisher, PW4 by itself cannot amount to proving the contents of the newspaper reports. Newspaper, is at the best secondary evidence of its contents and is not admissible in evidence without proper proof of the contents under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian Evidence Act</a>.  The learned trial Judge could not treat the newspaper reports as duly &#x27;proved&#x27; only by the production of the copies of the newspaper. The election petitioner also examined Abrar Razi, PW5, who was the polling agent of the election petitioner and a resident of the locality in support of the correctness of the reports including advertisements and messages as published in the said newspaper.  We have carefully perused his testimony and find that his evidence also falls short of proving the contents of the reports of the alleged speeches or the messages and the advertisements, which appeared in different issues of the newspaper.  Since, the maker of the report which formed basis of the publications, did not appear in the court to depose about the facts as perceived by him, the facts contained in the published reports were clearly inadmissible.  No evidence was led by the election petitioner to prove the contents of the messages and the advertisements as the original manuscript of the advertisements or the messages was not produced at the trial. No witness came forward to prove the receipt of the manuscript of any of the advertisements or the messages or the publication of the same in accordance with the manuscript. There is no satisfactory and reliable evidence on the record to even establish that the same were actually issued by IUML or MYL, ignoring for the time being, whether or not the appellant had any connection with IUML or MYL or that the same were published by him or with his consent by any other person or published by his election agent or by any other person with the consent of his election agent.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\t\t\t11.The Supreme Court dealing with a &quot;pro bono publico&quot; litigation in B.P.Singhal Vs.State of Tamil Nadu and others reported in 2004 (13) SCC 673, wherein the petitioner sought for a transfer of an investigation from Tamil Nadu State Police to the Central Bureau of Investigation, opined that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t\t\t&quot;the petition is lacking in material particulars. All the averments made in the petition are based, by and large, on news reports and not on personal knowledge.  The petition does not state that the petitioner has taken any care to verify himself the correctness of the averments made.&quot;\t\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43862392\" id=\"span_4\">12.In yet another decision in <a href=\"/doc/43862392/\" id=\"a_7\">Dr.B.Singh Vs. Union of India (UOI) and others</a> reported in 2004 (3) SCC 363 dealing with a public interest litigation, challenging the propriety of the third respondent therein for being considered for appointment as a Judge, the Supreme Court while expressing its anguish found that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t\t\t&quot;the petitioner has no where stated that he has personal knowledge of the allegations made against R3.  He does not even aver that he made any effort to find out whether the allegations have any basis. He only refers to the representation of Ram Sarup and some other paper cuttings of news items. It is too much to attribute authenticity or creditability to any information or fact merely because, it found publication in a newspaper or journal or magazine or any other form of communication, as though it is gospel truth.  It needs no reiteration that newspaper reports per se do not constitute legally acceptable evidence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\t\t\t13. In matters relating to public interest litigation, the Supreme Court has time and again cautioned that the Court has to be satisfied  about (a)the credentials of the applicant; (b) the prima facie correctness or nature of information given by him; c) the information being not vague and indefinite. The information should show gravity and seriousness involved. Court has to strike balance between two conflicting interests; i) nobody should be allowed to indulge in wild and reckless allegations besmirching the character of others; and (ii) avoidance of public mischief and to avoid mischievous petitions seeking to assail, for oblique motives, justifiable executive actions.  In such case, however, the Court cannot afford to be liberal.  It has  to be extremely careful to see that under the guise of redressing a public grievance, it does not encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"642220\" id=\"span_5\">The Court has to act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and busy bodies or meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public spirited holy men.  They masquerade as crusaders of justice.  They pretend to act in the name of Pro Bono Publico, though they have no interest of the public or even of their own to protect. Reference can be made to the recent decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/642220/\" id=\"a_8\">Holicow Pictures Pvt., Ltd., Vs. Prem Chandra Mishra and others</a> reported in 2008 (1) CTC 711 (Para 20).&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\t\t\t6.\tAfter considering the decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, at Paragraph 16, the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench has  observed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t\t\t&quot;It is now well settled that a news item published in the newspaper are only hearsay and no judicial notice can be taken unless supported by further authentic evidence. Though the parameters of public interest litigation have been indicated by the Supreme Court in large number of cases, yet unmindful of the real intentions and objectives, the petitioner, without verifying the authenticity or otherwise of the news items, has chosen to resort to the extra ordinary jurisdiction. The Public Interest Litigation intended to ameliorate the grievance of the poor, the ignorant, the oppressed and the needy whose fundamental rights are infringed and violated, should not be misused.  Before maintaining a cause before the Court one should prove that there is concrete and credible basis, not withstanding the credentials claimed of the person moving the courts.&quot;   \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\t\t\t7.\tOn the question, as to whether, print and visual media can publish any news, affecting the rights of privacy, this Court deems it fit to consider the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t\t\t&quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.  Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\t\t\t8.\tFreedom of speech and expression, includes right not only to speak, but includes right to print, publish, distribute, receive information.   But whether this right is unrestricted, unlimited and the journalists and the media are given a total freehand to publish or telecast anything they desire? Whether right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India can simply be exercised to invade into the privacy of life, which is exclusively reserved to an individual?\n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_6\">9.\tThe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_11\">Mr.X v. Hospital Z</a> reported in 1998 (8) SCC 296,  at Paragraph 15, explained what is meant by &#x27;right&#x27; in legal parlance and it is extracted:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t&quot;15. \u0013Right\u0014 is an interest recognised and protected by moral or legal rules. It is an interest the violation of which would be a legal wrong. Respect for such interest would be a legal duty. That is how Salmond has defined \u0013right\u0014. In order, therefore, that an interest becomes the subject of a legal right, it has to have not merely legal protection but also legal recognition. The elements of a \u0013legal right\u0014 are that the \u0013right\u0014 is vested in a person and is available against a person who is under a corresponding obligation and duty to respect that right and has to act or forbear from acting in a manner so as to prevent the violation of the right. If, therefore, there is a legal right vested in a person, the latter can seek its protection against a person who is bound by a corresponding duty not to violate that right.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_7\">10.\tWhile dealing with the right of privacy vis-a-vis the right of the press, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_12\">R.Rajagopal v. State of T.N.</a>, reported in 1994 (6) SCC 632 has held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t\t\t&quot;26. (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21.</a> It is a \u0011right to be let alone\u0012. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above matters without his consent \u0017 whether truthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\t\t\t11.\t&#x27;Privacy&#x27; has been defined as &quot;the rightful claim of an individual to determine to which he wishes to share himself with others and control over the time, place and circumstances to communicate with others&quot;.  It means the individuals right to control dissemination of information about himself.  It is his own personal possession.   It is well accepted that one person&#x27;s right to know and be informed may violate another&#x27;s right of privacy.  In other words, disclosure of certain facts, events, actions, photographs, videotapes, in any form of media, print or celluloid, internet would cause embarrassment, agony, emotional stress, to a person of reasonable sensitiveness.  &#x27;Right of Privacy&#x27;  in otherwords can be said &quot;to be let alone&quot;.  What is an information to others according to a journalist, could be a personal and sensitive information to an individual.  The boundary, between freedom of press and privacy of individual  is the &quot;Lakshman Rekha&quot; and if the media, crosses the line of boundary, the invasion starts.   To  Strike a balance between these two competing interests is difficult.  Right of privacy, vis-a-vis right of information to be furnished to the general public, in otherwords, the right of the media, should be with reference to the kind of information, which the law permits.  Constitution does not guarantee absolute freedom or absolute protection to the media. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\t\t\t12.\tWe wish to add that media attention should be towards exposing corruption, nepotism, law breaking, abuse or arbitrary exercise of power, law and order, economy, health, science and technology etc., which are matters of public interest.  The &quot;Lakshman Rekha&quot; or the &quot;line of control&quot;, should be that the publication of comments/information should not invade into the privacy of an individual, unless, outweighed by bona fide and genuine public interest.  Right of information is a facet of freedom of speech and expression, enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.  Right of Information has been recognised as the  Fundamental Right and the Right of Press, to furnish the information or facts or opinion should be only to foster public interest, and not to encroach upon the privacy of an individual. The public at large has no fundamental or legal right to get any information or intrude into the personal life of the other individual.\n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\t\t\t13.\tAt this juncture, this Court deems it fit to consider few judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, on public interest litigations.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"802583\" id=\"span_8\">(i) In <a href=\"/doc/802583/\" id=\"a_15\">S.P.Anand v. H.D.Deve Gowda</a> reported in 1996 (6) SCC 734, the Supreme Court, at Paragraph 18, held as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t\t\t&quot;It is of utmost importance that those who invoke this Court&#x27;s jurisdiction seeking a waiver of the locus standi rule must exercise restraint in moving the Court by not plunging in areas wherein they are not well-versed. Such a litigant must not succumb to spasmodic sentiments and behave like a knight-errant roaming at will in pursuit of issues providing publicity. He must remember that as a person seeking to espouse a public cause, he owes it to the public as well as to the court that he does not rush to court without undertaking a research, even if he is qualified or competent to raise the issue. Besides, it must be remembered that a good cause can be lost if petitions are filed on half-baked information without proper research or by persons who are not qualified and competent to raise such issues as the rejection of such a petition may affect third party rights. Lastly, it must also be borne in mind that no one has a right to the waiver of the locus standi rule and the court should permit it only when it is satisfied that the carriage of proceedings is in the competent hands of a person who is genuinely concerned in public interest and is not moved by other extraneous considerations. So also the court must be careful to ensure that the process of the Court is not sought to be abused by a person who desires to persist with his point of view, almost carrying it to the point of obstinacy, by filling a series of petitions refusing to accept the Court&#x27;s earlier decisions as concluding the point. We say this because when we drew the attention of the petitioner to earlier decisions of this Court, he brushed them aside, without so much as showing willingness to deal with them and without giving them a second look, as having become stale and irrelevant by passage of time and challenged their correctness on the specious plea that they needed reconsideration. Except for saying that they needed reconsideration he had no answer to the correctness of the decisions. Such a casual approach to considered decisions of this Court even by a person well-versed in law would not be countenanced. Instead, as pointed out earlier, he referred to decisions having no bearing on the question, like the decisions on cow slaughter cases, freedom of speech and expresssion, uniform civil code, etc., we need say no more except to point out that indiscriminate of this important lever of public interest litigation would blunt the lever itself.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1737583\" id=\"span_9\">(ii) In <a href=\"/doc/1737583/\" id=\"a_16\">Balco Employees&#x27; Union (Regd.) v. Union of India</a> reported in 2002 (2) SCC 333, the Supreme Court, held that,\n\t\t\t&quot;Public interest litigation, or PIL as it is more commonly known, entered the Indian judicial process in 1970. It will not be incorrect to say that it is primarily the judges who have innovated this type of litigation as there was a dire need for it. At that stage, it was intended to vindicate public interest where fundamental and other rights of the people who were poor, ignorant or in socially or economically disadvantageous position and were unable to seek legal redress were required to be espoused. PIL was not meant to be adversial in nature and was to be a cooperative and collaborative effort of the parties and the court so as to secure justice for the poor and the weaker sections of the community who were not in a position to protect their own interests. Public interest litigation was intended to mean nothing more than what words themselves said viz. &quot;litigation in the interest of the public.&quot;</span> \n</p>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1107385\" id=\"span_10\">(iii) In <a href=\"/doc/1107385/\" id=\"a_17\">Ashok Kumar Pandey v.

When there is material to show that a petition styled as a public interest litigation is nothing but a camouflage to foster personal disputes, said petition is to be thrown out. Before we grapple with the issue involved in the present case, we feel it necessary to consider the issue regarding public interest aspect. Public Interest Litigation which has now come to occupy an important field in the administration of law should not be &quot;publicity interest litigation&quot; or &quot;private interest litigation&quot; or &quot;politics interest litigation&quot; or the latest trend &quot;paise income litigation&quot;. If not properly regulated and abuse averted it becomes also a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta and wreck vengeance, as well. There must be real and genuine public interest involved in the litigation and not merely an adventure of knight errant or poke ones into for a probe. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1830927\" id=\"span_11\">It cannot also be invoked by a person or a body of persons to further his or their personal causes or satisfy his or their personal grudge and enmity. Courts of justice should not be allowed to be polluted by unscrupulous litigants by resorting to the extraordinary jurisdiction.

Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the armory of law for delivering social justice to the citizens. The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should not be used for suspicious products of mischief. It should be aimed at redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented or founded on personal vendetta. As indicated above, Court must be careful to see that a body of persons or member of public, who approaches the court is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or political motivation or other oblique consideration. The Court must not allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations. Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives.

In such case, however, the Court cannot afford to be liberal. It has to be extremely careful to see that under the guise of redressing a public grievance, it does not encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature. The Court has to act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and busy bodies or meddlesome interlopers impersonating as public-spirited holy men. They masquerade as crusaders of justice.

Public Interest Litigation is no doubt a very useful handle for redressing the grievances of the people but unfortunately lately it has been abused by some interested persons and it has brought very bad name. Courts should be very very slow in entertaining petitions involving public interest in a very rare cases where public at large stand to suffer. This jurisdiction is meant for the purpose of coming to the rescue of the down trodden and not for the purpose of serving private ends. It has now become common for unscrupulous people to serve their private ends and jeopardize the rights of innocent people so as to wreak vengeance for their personal ends. This has become very handy to the developers and in matters of public contracts. In order to serve their professional rivalry they utilize the service of the innocent people or organization in filing public interest litigation. The Courts are sometimes persuaded to issue certain directions without understanding implication and giving a handle in the hands of the authorities to misuse it. Therefore, the courts should not exercise this jurisdiction lightly but should exercise in a very rare and few cases involving public interest of large number of people who cannot afford litigation and are made to suffer at the hands of the authorities.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4471\" id=\"span_33\">(vi) In <a href=\"/doc/4471/\" id=\"a_46\">Gurpal Singh v.

Whenever such frivolous pleas are taken to explain possession, the Court should do well not only to dismiss the petitions but also to impose exemplary costs. It would be desirable for the Courts to filter out the frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs as afore-stated so that the message goes in the right direction that petitions filed with oblique motive do not have the approval of the Courts.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t  \t\t8. ......\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t\t\t9. It is depressing to note that on account of such trumpery proceedings initiated before the Courts, innumerable days are wasted, which time otherwise could have been spent for the disposal of cases of the genuine litigants. Though we spare no efforts in fostering and developing the laudable concept of PIL and extending our long arm of sympathy to the poor, the ignorant, the oppressed and the needy whose fundamental rights are infringed and violated and whose grievance go unnoticed, un-represented and unheard; yet we cannot avoid but express our opinion that while genuine litigants with legitimate grievances relating to civil matters involving properties worth hundreds of millions of rupees and substantial rights and criminal cases in which persons sentenced to death facing gallows under untold agony and persons sentenced to life imprisonment and kept in incarceration for long years, persons suffering from undue delay in service matters - government or private, persons awaiting the disposal of tax cases wherein huge amounts of public revenue or unauthorized collection of tax amounts are locked up, detenu expecting their release from the detention orders etc. etc. are all standing in a long serpentine queue for years with the fond hope of getting into the Courts and having their grievances redressed, the busy bodies, meddlesome interlopers, wayfarers or officious interveners having absolutely no real public interest except for personal gain or private profit either of themselves or as a proxy of others or for any other extraneous motivation or for glare of publicity break the queue muffing their faces by wearing the mask of public interest litigation and get into the Courts by filing vexatious and frivolous petitions of luxury litigants who have nothing to loose but trying to gain for nothing and thus criminally waste the valuable time of the Courts and as a result of which the queue standing outside the doors of the court never moves, which piquant situation creates frustration in the minds of the genuine litigants.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t\t\t10. Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the armory of law for delivering social justice to the citizens.  The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should not be allowed to be used for suspicious products of mischief.  It should be aimed at redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented or founded on personal vendetta.  As indicated above, Court must be careful to see that a body of persons or member of public, who approaches the court is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or political motivation or other oblique consideration.  The Court must not allow its process to be abused for oblique considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at times from behind. Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives and try to bargain for a good deal as well to enrich themselves. Often they are actuated by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity.  The petitions of such busy bodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in appropriate cases with exemplary costs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\t\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1707158\" id=\"span_35\">(vii) In <a href=\"/doc/1707158/\" id=\"a_49\">Common Cause (A Regd.

Unfortunately, the truth is that PILs are being entertained by many courts as a routine and the result is that the dockets of most of the superior courts are flooded with PILs, most of which are frivolous or for which the judiciary has no remedy. As stated in Dattaraj Nathuji Thaware v. State of Maharastra reported in AIR 2005 SC 540, public interest litigation has nowadays largely become &#x27;publicity interest litigation&#x27;, &#x27;private interest litigation&#x27;, or &#x27;politics interest litigation&#x27; or the latest trend &#x27;paise income litigation&#x27;.

I am also of the view that if there is a buffer zone unoccupied by the legislature or executive which is detrimental to the public interest, judiciary must occupy the field to subserve public interest.
