Case of the plaintiff as per plaint and the evidence led is that he is a\n        Property Consultant. In July 2020 defendant and his son Gurdeep Singh\n        contacted him for sale of property no. 64, Shanti Vihar, Delhi-110092\nCS Comm.

Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         consisting of ground floor, first floor and second floor with roof rights apart\n        from common lift and parking space. It was built on a plot admeasuring\n        194.66 Sq. Yards. Another shop admeasuring 7&#x27;5&quot; X 17&#x27;5&quot; with carpet area\n        163 Sq. Feet at Plot No. 3, LSC Rishabh Vihar, Delhi was also to be sold.\n        Upon deliberations, the plaintiff arranged for the sale of the first property\n        and an Agreement for Sale dated 19.10.2020 was executed for the 3 floors\n        of     the     first    property   for   Rs.2,45,50,000/-,   Rs.2,35,50,000/-   and\n        Rs.2,61,00,000/- respectively. However, the sale deed was executed as per\n        the circle rate much below the above amount. As per plaintiff the defendant\n        caused Loss to the Exchequer and the Revenue Authorities by undervaluing\n        the Sale Deeds. It is case of the plaintiff that defendant left Delhi and shifted\n        to Mohali, Punjab without paying the requisite commission for services pro-\n        vided by him as a Property Consultant @ 1% of the total sale from both the\n        sides or 2 % from the defaulting party as the case may be. As per him he has\n        the necessary documentary records to support his claim which comes to\n        Rs.14.84 lacs.\n\n    3. Plaintiff tried to reach out to defendants repeatedly on phone followed by\n        issuance of legal notice dated 12.01.2022. Plaintiff approached Shahdara\n        DLSA for Pre-Institution Mediation which issued a Non-Starter Report\n        dated 06.04.2022.

Upon service of summons of this suit defendant entered appearance and\n        filed detailed Written Statement on 18.10.2022.\n\n        Defendant&#x27;s Case\n\n    5. Case of the defendant as per pleadings and the evidence led is that he is an\n        aged man and is suffering from various ailments. He contested this suit\n\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                                 Page 2\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         through his Special Power of Attorney i.e. his son Sh. Gurdeep Singh. It is\n        pleaded that he was owner of the property no. 64, Shanti Vihar, Delhi which\n        was later constructed with stilt parking apart from 4 floors i.e. ground, first,\n        second and third under a Collaboration Agreement dated 09.05.2012 with\n        one builder. Out of the same second floor was sold by Defendant to Smt.\n        Meenakshi Chaudhary on 16.03.2016 along with the Builder. It is\n        thepleaded case that in 2021 Defendant was desirous of selling the\n        remaining 3 floors i.e ground, first and third with an aim to shift and settle\n        in Punjab. It is at that juncture that his son Gurdeep Singh came in contact\n        with the plaintiff through a man who offered to provide his services and\n        help them sale the properties. As per defendant although plaintiff did try to\n        get the property sold but the deals could not be finalized and subsequently\n        defendant and his son sold the properties on their own without any\n        involvement of the plaintiff. Upon execution of the Sale Deeds they shifted\n        to Mohali, Punjab. It is pleaded case of the defendant that no written or oral\n        contract was entered between them and the plaintiff for availing his services\n        or for payment of commission as claimed. It is pleaded that plaintiff has\n        filed a Compact Disk (CD) purportedly containing the recording of\n        telephonic conversations between the plaintiff and the defendant and\n        defendant&#x27;s son but the same was not supplied to the defendant. However it\n        is stated that it was supplied post-filing of the WS but no additional reply\n        qua the same was filed.\n    6. It is claimed that the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable as it suffers\n        from concealment and misrepresentation of facts. Objection qua territorial\n        jurisdiction of this Court was also raised. It was pleaded that the suit is\n        without cause of action and plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit in the\n        form presented.\n\n\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                              Page 3\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n     7.

As per defendant, plaintiff concocted a bogus story\n        so as to extract money from him. It is denied that plaintiff is entitled to\n        recovery of Rs.14.84 lacs. It is denied that plaintiff had issued any legal\n        notice to them.\n\n        Replication\n\n    8.

He was cross-examined at length. In his cross-examination done on behalf of Ld.\n        Counsel for defendant he stated that he accepted the suggestion that he had cordial\n        relations with the defendant and that property no. 64, Shanti Vihar, Delhi\n        consisted of 4 floors. He also accepted that the second floor of the property was\n        the builder&#x27;s floor and was not owned by the defendant. He expressed\n        unawareness that second floor was sold in 2016. He accepted that he had no role\n        to play in the sale of second floor. He stated that he was one of the witnesses in\n        the registered sale deed of upper ground floor and first floor of the property but is\n        not aware of the consideration amount of the registered sale deed of these 2 floors.\n        He stated that he was not witness in the sale of third floor of the property. As per\n        him the CD filed by him in the Court contain 91 recordings. However, it is found\n        that no transcript of such recording and <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 65B</a> Evidence Act Certificate\n        supporting the transcript has been filed on record. PW1 expressed unawareness if\n        the CD reflects the telephone numbers of the persons whose calls were\n        purportedly recorded. He denied the suggestion that the recordings are false and\n        fabricated or that his claim in this suit in hand is false.\n\n        Defendant&#x27;s Evidence:\n\n    13. On the other hand defendant&#x27;s Special Power of Attorney son Gurdeep Virdhi\n        has examined himself as DW1.

Counsel for plaintiff at length wherein he stated\n        that the property no. 64, Shanti Vihar, Delhi was owned by his defendant father\n        and it was built consisting of 4 floors i.e. upper ground, first, second and third\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                                    Page 8\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         floors. He admitted that his father also owned one shop in Rishabh Vihar, DDA\n        Market where they had an electronic repair shop. He also accepted that they know\n        the plaintiff since long. He also accepted that they approached the plaintiff for sale\n        of 3 floors. He denied that he had telephonic conversations with plaintiff qua the\n        sale of floors. As per him they had contacts in the locality and it is through them\n        that the 3 floors were sold. The approximate rate was Rs. 85 lacs upper ground\n        floor. He accepted the document Mark A i.e. Collaboration Agreement of\n        defendant with the builder dated 09.05.2012. He accepted that second floor was\n        sold to Ms. Meenakshi Chaudhary on 16.03.2016 for Rs.75 lacs. He denied the\n        suggestion that the upper ground floor was sold for Rs.2.45 crores or that 1%\n        commission was supposed to be paid by both sides. He denied the suggestion that\n        upper ground floor was sold by his defendant father to Ajay Kumar Jain. He\n        expressed unawareness that cheque no. 148051 dated 19.10.2020 for Rs.2.50\n        lacs///////////////////////////////////////////////////// was drawn by buyer in favour of his\n        defendant father qua the property. He denied his signatures on Agreement to Sale\n        dated 19.10.2020 qua the first floor of the property. He also denied the suggestion\n        that the third floor was sold by his father to one Mr. Praveen Chaudhary for\n        Rs.2.61 crore. He denied that his father is liable to pay 2% commission for sale of\n        3 floors. He stated that his father is undergoing treatment of Schizophrenia and\n        depression for the last 10 years.\n\n    15.I have heard arguments of Sh. Vinay Kumar Mishra, Ld.

No. 424/22                                                                         Page 9\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n     16.While opening his submissions it is argued by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff that\n        the defendants have admitted that they had cordial relations with the\n        plaintiff and that the defendant and his son DW1 Gurdeep Singh had\n        approached him for sale of 3 floors at property no. 64 Shanti Vihar, Delhi.\n        Although it is case of the plaintiff that he did not facilitate sale of second\n        floor of the property and that the same was sold in the year 2016 but it is\n        claimed that he facilitated the sale of other 3 floors including ground floor,\n        first floor and third floor. As referred to supra, this plea of the plaintiff has\n        been categorically denied by the defendant and it is maintained that\n        although initially services of the plaintiff were sought but no deal could be\n        finalised with the help of the plaintiff and that the 3 sale deeds were\n        executed in the name of buyers independent of plaintiff&#x27;s involvement.\n\n    17.It is interesting to observe that in para 2 of his plaint plaintiff has claimed\n        that he was instrumental in getting Agreement to Sell registered for the\n        upper ground floor, first floor and second floor for Rs.2,45,50,000/-,\n        Rs.2,35,50,000/- and Rs.2,61,00,000/-       but in the affidavit of evidence\n        Ex.PW1/A he changed the material facts and denied facilitating sale of\n        second floor. This was done without any leave of the Court when the\n        plaintiff came to know that the second floor was actually sold in the year\n        2016 to Ms. Meenakshi Chaudhary. Furthermore, in support of his claim\n        plaintiff has filed photocopy of 2 purported Agreements to Sell which are\n        Mark A and Mark B instead of 3 agreements as claimed in para 2 of the\n        plaint. Document Mark A pertains to the first floor. A bare perusal thereof\n        shows that it is purportedly executed between defendant and buyer Sh.\n        Manish Kumar Gupta. This 4-paged document is signed by defendant on all\n        the pages but there is no signature of the said Manish Kumar Gupta\n        anywhere as also on the 4th page meant for appending signatures by &quot;Second\n\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                              Page 10\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         Party&quot;. While this document was Mark A, during the course of recording of\n        evidence before Ld. LC Ld. Counsel for defendant has objected to the mode\n        of proving of the same. As per the protocol designed by this Court this\n        objection was kept open for disposal by the Court during the course of final\n        arguments. The objection taken is that the Agreement to Sell sought to be\n        proved is not an original document but a photocopy and moreover it is\n        neither registered nor signed by the parties.\n\n    18.It goes without saying that while proving his case plaintiff has to directly\n        adhere to the best evidence rule and as per <a href=\"/doc/1915814/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 61</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1248052/\" id=\"a_13\">62</a> of Evidence\n        Act every document has to be proved by primary evidence i.e. by\n        production of original document. In case the original document is not\n        available, the plaintiff has to either seek permission of the Court to lead\n        secondary evidence or at least bring on record and establish such facts and\n        circumstances which justifies pleading of secondary evidence. Neither in the\n        plaint nor in the affidavit in chief it has been pleaded or explained as to why\n        original Agreement to Sells were not produced and why plaintiff should be\n        allowed to lead secondary evidence.\n\n    19.An endeavour was made by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff during the arguments\n        to explain by stating that as a matter of practice such like Agreement to Sells\n        which are executed as per market value of prospectus are routinely\n        destroyed by the transacting parties and the dealers when the actual sale\n        deed is executed in so far as actual sale deeds are highly undervalued as per\n        circle rate. It is argued that this practice is followed not only so save stamp\n        duty payable to the Government but also to include payment of cash amount\n        which cannot be accounted for in the sale deed. This plea of Ld. Counsel for\n        plaintiff is nothing but an attempt to improve the case. There is no\n        justification for requesting the Court to take notice of any such illegal\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                            Page 11\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         practice. This is not only impermissible under <a href=\"/doc/973062/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 56</a> of the Evidence\n        Act but the practice sought to be brought on record is nothing but an illegal\n        exercise if at all it is being carried in the manner so stated. The primary onus\n        of proving this issue lies only on the plaintiff as provided under <a href=\"/doc/147127/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 101</a>\n        and <a href=\"/doc/1505766/\" id=\"a_16\">102</a> of the Evidence Act and in the absence of any material or\n        circumstance to show that the plaintiff is entitled to lead secondary\n        evidence, the objection is raised by Ld. Counsel for defendant in exhibiting\n        this document stands duly justified and is accordingly allowed. Moreover,\n        since the document Mark A does not bear signature of any second party i.e.\n        purported buyer the same cannot be regarded as an agreement or a contract\n        under <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_17\">Contract Act</a> at all.\n\n    20.Likewise, similar objection is raised qua Mark B which pertains to upper\n        ground floor. Although this document is purportedly signed by the second\n        party but since this too is a photocopy and is not legally proved on record\n        and suffer from infirmities as stated qua document Mark A, the same too\n        cannot be read in evidence in favour of plaintiff.\n\n    21.The endeavour is made by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff to show locus standi and\n        cause of action in the matter by referring to Clause 9 of the above 2\n        documents. Although once this Court has concluded that these documents\n        are not proved on record as per <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_18\">Evidence Act</a>, the contents thereof cannot\n        be cited and relied. However, for the sake of argument even if its contents\n        are read and considered, they do not in any manner justify the frame of the\n        suit as filed by the plaintiff in this case. For ready reference Clause 9 is\n        reproduced hereunder:\n\n              &quot;Both party introduced by (1) Aachman Associates (2) M/s Jaggi Associates &amp; (3) Sh.\n              Bittoo Choudhary and 1% brokerage charge of introduction of total deal from both the\n              parties and defaulter party will pay 2% of brokerage. Both the parties herein are fully\n              satisfied with the title documents and possession of the said property.&quot;\n\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                                              Page 12\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n     22.Plain reading of this clause shows that it was 3 persons/entities who are\n        shown to be brokers in this matter i.e. M/s. Aachman Associates, M/s Jaggi\n        Associates and Sh. Bittoo Chaudhary i.e. plaintiff, it is provided that both\n        the sides i.e. buyer and seller will pay 1% brokerage each. It is also provided\n        that in case this Agreement to Sell does not fructify then the defaulting party\n        will pay entire 2% brokerage to the aforesaid dealers. In so far as it is\n        admitted case of both the sides that proper sale deed was executed qua the 3\n        floors in question, the question of defaulting party does not arise. In this\n        backdrop even if it is accepted that this clause was live and binding the\n        plaintiff&#x27;s cause of action remains only to claim one-third of the brokerage\n        and that too both from both sides i.e. buyer and seller.\n\n    23.An attempt is made by Ld. Counsel for plaintiff to impress upon the Court\n        that the other 2 buyers i.e. M/s. Aachman Associates, M/s Jaggi Associates\n        were from the buyer&#x27;s side that plaintiff was the sole dealer from the seller\n        side i.e. the defendant. This plea of Ld. Counsel for plaintiff is hit by\n        <a href=\"/doc/205529/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 91</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_20\">92</a> of the Evidence Act which prohibits inclusion of oral\n        agreement over and above the written contract. In this regard the claim of\n        recovery of Rs.14.84 lacs out of cumulative suit Agreement to Sell amount\n        for 3 floors of Rs.7.41 crores comes to entire 2% of the deal. As such even\n        the calculation of the suit amount of Rs.14.84 lacs is much beyond the one-\n        third purported entitlement of the plaintiff from both the sides i.e. buyer and\n        seller. As such this suit also suffers for non-joinder of the buyers in the\n        matter who were also supposed to bear 50% part of the brokerage, if the\n        story of the plaintiff is to be believed.\n\n    24.Another flaw which is found in the case of the plaintiff is that he did not\n        examine any other witness apart from examining himself as plaintiff.\n        Admittedly, the suit in hand is not a suit in representative capacity and\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                            Page 13\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n         plaintiff could have examined any witness from the other 2 property dealers\n        i.e. M/s. Aachman Associates and M/s Jaggi Associates to show that the 3\n        sale deeds were executed and were actually executed with due services\n        provided by the plaintiff. Also plaintiff did not examine the buyers of the\n        properties so as to show that his services were utilised in finalising the sale\n        deeds. The failure of the plaintiff to examine these witnesses call for\n        drawing of adverse inference as provided under <a href=\"/doc/473654/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 114(g)</a> of the\n        Evidence Act which is reproduced as under:\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 114</a> Evidence Act: Court may presume existence of certain facts\n\n        Illustration\n        The Court may presume-\n        (g) That evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the\n        person who withholds it;\n\n    25.The fact that the sale deeds were executed is not a fact in issue in the case in\n        hand rather the fact in issue is whether plaintiff was instrumental in getting\n        the sale deeds executed. There is no bilateral agreement between the\n        plaintiff and the defendant either oral or documentary which can be cited or\n        relied to show that there was a prior understanding between him and the\n        defendant that he would be paid the commission.\n\n    26.At this juncture, Ld.

The relevant paras of the same are\n        reproduced as under:\n         &quot;52.      The main question which arises for our consideration is whether the prevailing delay\n                   in civil litigation can be curbed? In our considered opinion the existing system can\n                   be drastically changed or improved if the following steps are taken by the trial\n                   courts while dealing with the civil trials.\n                     A. Pleadings are foundation of the claims of parties. Civil litigation is\n\nCS Comm. No. 424/22                                                                                Page 17\nJasvinder Singh Vs. Surjeet Singh Virdhi\n                        largely based on documents. It is the bounden duty and obligation of the\n                       trial judge to carefully scrutinize, check and verify the pleadings and the\n                       documents filed by the parties. This must be done immediately after civil\n                       suits are filed.\n                    B. The Court should resort to discovery and production of documents and\n                       interrogatories at the earliest according to the object of the Act. If this\n                       exercise is carefully carried out, it would focus the controversies involved\n                       in the case and help the court in arriving at truth of the matter and doing\n                       substantial justice.\n                    C. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering prosecution\n                       would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings\n                       and forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of\n                       heavy costs would also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In\n                       appropriate cases the courts may consider ordering prosecution otherwise\n                       it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of judicial\n                       proceedings.\n                    D. The Court must adopt realistic and pragmatic approach in granting mesne\n                       profits. The Court must carefully keep in view the ground realities while\n                       granting mesne profits.\n                    E. The courts should be extremely careful and cautious in granting ex-parte ad\n                       interim injunctions or stay orders. Ordinarily short notice should be\n                       issued to the defendants or respondents and only after hearing concerned</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1\">                       parties appropriate orders should be passed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_2\">                    F. Litigants who obtained ex-parte ad interim injunction on the strength of false\n                       pleadings and forged documents should be adequately punished. No one\n                       should be allowed to abuse the process of the court.\n                    G.

Every case emanates from a human or a commercial problem and the Court\n                       must make serious endeavour to resolve the problem within the framework of\n                       law and in accordance with the well settled principles of law and justice.\n                    I. If in a given case, ex parte injunction is granted, then the said application for\n                       grant of injunction should be disposed of on merits, after hearing both\n                       sides as expeditiously as may be possible on a priority basis and\n                       undue adjournments should be avoided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">                    J. At the time of filing of the plaint, the trial court should prepare complete\n                       schedule and fix dates for all the stages of the suit, right from filing of the\n                       written statement till pronouncement of judgment and the courts should\n                       strictly adhere to the said dates and the said time table as far as possible.\n                       If any interlocutory application is filed then the same be disposed of in\n                       between the said dates of hearings fixed in the said suit itself so that the date\n                       fixed for the main suit may not be disturbed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">       54.   While imposing costs we have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and\n             be realistic what the defendants or the respondents had to actually incur in contesting\n             the litigation before different courts. We have to also broadly take into consideration\n             the prevalent fee structure of the lawyers and other miscellaneous expenses which have\n             to be incurred towards drafting and filing of the counter affidavit, miscellaneous\n             charges towards typing, photocopying, court fee etc.\n      5 5 . T he Apex Court observed that the other factor which should not be forgotten\n            while imposing costs is for how long the defendants or respondents were compelled\n            to contest and defend the litigation in various courts. The appellants in the instant case\n            have harassed the respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and\n            dishonest litigation in various courts.
