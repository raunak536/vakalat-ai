Indian Law has proceeded on the assumption that parents are\n\n       persons who beget a child or who assume the legal obligations of\n\n       parenthood through formal adoption of child. Under the Indian legal\n\n       spectrum, a husband is strongly presumed to be the father of a child\n\n       born to his wife. Thus, there is a strong presumption regarding the\n\n       paternity of a child. This presumption can be overcome only by evidence\n\n       precluding any procreative role of the husband, such as by showing that\n\n       the husband and wife had no access to each other at the relevant time\nSignature Not Verified\n\n\n       of possible conception. In the absence of proof of non-access, the law\nDigitally signed by\nPOOJA SHARMA\nDate: 2023.02.20\n18:43:28 IST\nReason:\n\n\n\n       considers the husband&#x27;s paternity to be conclusively established if they\n\n       cohabited when the child was likely to have been conceived. By allowing\n\frebuttal with proof, that the husband could not have been the biological\n\nfather, the marital presumption was implicitly premised, in part, on a\n\npolicy linking parenthood with biological reproduction and on an\n\nassumption about the probability of the husband&#x27;s genetic contribution.\n\nThe presumption protects social parentage over biological parentage.\n\n     Scientific proof now makes it possible to know with virtual certainty\n\nwhether a man is genetically related to a child. As a result, Courts are\n\nroutinely confronted with husbands seeking to disavow their paternity\n\nbased on newly acquired DNA evidence, notwithstanding them having\n\nlong performed the social role of father to a child. The short question in\n\nthe present appeal is as to how a Court can prevent the           law’s tidy\n\nassumptions    linking   paternity   with   matrimony,    from    collapsing,\n\nparticularly when parties are routinely attempting to dislodge such\n\npresumptions by employing modern genetic profiling techniques.\n\nFactual Background:\n\n3.   The present controversy emerges from an application (Exhibit 84/B)\n\nfiled by the respondent-husband on 9 th November, 2020 before the\n\nPrincipal Judge Family Court, Pune, praying for a direction to subject\n\nMaster Arjun, the second child born to the appellant-wife, during the\n\nsubsistence of her marriage with the respondent, to deoxyribonucleic acid\n\ntest (“DNA test” for short), with a view to ascertain his paternity. The said\n\napplication was filed by the respondent-husband in a petition for divorce\n\ffiled by him under Sections 13(1)(i) and (ia) of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_1\">Hindu Marriage Act,\n\n1955</a>, being Petition No. P.A. 639 of 2017. The same was allowed by the\n\nFamily Court, Pune by an order dated 12 th August, 2021 and confirmed by\n\nthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay by way of the impugned\n\njudgment dated 22nd November, 2021 in Civil Writ Petition No.7077 of\n\n2021.\n\n\n4.    Succinctly stated, the facts leading to the present appeal are as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n4.1. The appellant and the respondent got married as per Hindu rites\n\nand rituals at Pune, on 23rd November, 2005. Their first child, Master\n\nHridaan Firodia, was born on 21st December, 2009. During the\n\nsubsistence of their marriage, a second son, namely, Master Arjun\n\nFirodia, was born on 17th July, 2013.\n\n\n4.2. On 1st June, 2017, the respondent-husband, filed a petition for\n\ndivorce under <a href=\"/doc/1151479/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 13(1)(i)</a> and (ia) of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_3\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a>\n\nbeing Petition No.P.A. 639 of 2017 and a petition seeking custody of their\n\ntwo children, being P.D. No. 17 of 2017 against the appellant-wife, before\n\nthe Family Court, Pune. In the petition for divorce, the respondent, inter-\n\nalia, alleged that the appellant-wife was in an adulterous relationship with\n\none Kshitij Bafna, and the respondent discovered the same on 14 th\n\fSeptember, 2016 when he found that certain intimate messages had been\n\nexchanged between the appellant and Kshitij Bafna.\n\n\n4.3. On 9th November, 2020, the respondent filed an application, being\n\napplication 84/B, before the Family Court, Pune seeking a direction to\n\nsubject Master Arjun, the second child born to the appellant-wife, during\n\nthe subsistence of her marriage with the respondent to DNA testing, with\n\na view to ascertain the child’s paternity. The contents of the said\n\napplication may be summarised as under:\n\n  i.   That Master Arjun, the second son born to the appellant-wife,\n\n       during the subsistence of her marriage with the respondent, was\n\n       born out of an adulterous relationship between the appellant and\n\n       Kshitij Bafna.\n\n ii.   That the respondent discovered that the appellant had been in an\n\n       adulterous relationship with Kshitij Bafna, while he was using her\n\n       phone on 14th September, 2016. That on being confronted about the\n\n       same the appellant admitted to the adulterous relationship with\n\n       Kshitij Bafna.\n\niii.   That the respondent, being unwilling to accept the truth as\n\n       confirmed by the appellant, decided to further investigate the issue\n\n       of Master Arjun’s paternity and hence, caused a DNA test to be\n\n       conducted at DNA Labs India, a private laboratory. The DNA Test\n\n       report dated 24th November, 2016 indicated as follows:\n\f            “The alleged father lacks genetic markers that must be\n            contributed to the child by the biological father. The\n            probability of paternity is 0%”.\n\n iv.   That the respondent was certain that Master Arjun was born as a\n\n       result of the adulterous relationship of the appellant. However, in\n\n       order to substantiate his contention as to the appellant’s infidelity as\n\n       a ground for divorce, it was necessary to conduct a DNA test which\n\n       would reveal that the respondent was not the biological father of\n\n       Master Arjun.\n\n v.    That a DNA test is the most legitimate and scientifically perfect\n\n       means, that the respondent could use to establish the assertion of\n\n       infidelity on part of the appellant. That in the absence thereof it\n\n       would be impossible for the respondent to conclusively establish the\n\n       assertions made by him in the pleadings.\n\nvi.    That the respondent had access to telephonic conversations between\n\n       him and Kshitij Bafna, wherein Kshitij Bafna had expressed his\n\n       anger at the respondent for intimating his wife i.e., the wife of Mr.\n\n       Bafna, of his illicit relationship with the appellant. That Kshitij\n\n       Bafna when confronted about the paternity of Master Arjun, did not\n\n       deny that the child was born to him and the appellant. That the\n\n       appellant was in the habit of maintaining a daily diary wherein she\n\n       had penned her thoughts as to her adulterous relationship. Having\n\n       regard to the sensitive nature of the conversation and the contents of\n\n       the diary, the respondent sought for the leave of the Family Court to\n\f       produce the recording, the diary and other evidences, if necessary, at\n\n       the time of final hearing of the divorce proceedings.\n\n4.4. The appellant filed an affidavit in reply, opposing the application filed\n\nby the respondent seeking a direction to conduct DNA test of Master\n\nArjun, inter-alia, contending that the respondent had not made out a\n\nprima-facie case requiring the Court to exercise its discretion to direct DNA\n\ntest to be conducted as prayed for.\n\n\n4.5. By an order dated 12th August, 2021, the Family Court, Pune,\n\nallowed the application filed by the respondent seeking DNA test of Master\n\nArjun and further observed that in the event that the appellant fails to\n\ncomply with the directions of the Court, the allegations of adultery as\n\nagainst her would be determined by drawing an adverse inference as\n\ncontemplated under Illustration (h) of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence\n\nAct, 1872 (hereinafter “<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_5\">Evidence Act</a>” for the sake of brevity). The salient\n\nfindings of the Family Court may be encapsulated as under:\n\n  i.   That the respondent had filed the application seeking direction to\n\n       conduct DNA test of Master Arjun, only with a view to establish\n\n       adultery on the part of the appellant and not to disparage the\n\n       paternity of the minor child.\n\n ii.   On perusal of the DNA Test Report issued by DNA Labs India dated\n\n       24th November, 2016, the Family Court concluded that the possibility\n\n       of the respondent being the biological father Master Arjun has been\n\f       excluded. That in view of <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, 1984\n\n       the said Report can be read as evidence.\n\niii.   Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Nandlal\n\n       Wasudeo Badwaik vs. Lata Nandlal Badwaik, (2014) 2 SCC\n\n       576, to hold that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act was enacted at a\n\n       time when scientific advancement in the field of DNA test was not as\n\n       sophisticated. That although <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 112</a> raises a presumption of\n\n       conclusive proof on the satisfaction of the conditions enumerated\n\n       therein, the same is rebuttable. That where the truth of a fact is\n\n       known, there is no need or room for any presumption. Thus, when\n\n       there is a conflict between a conclusive proof envisaged under law\n\n       and a proof based on scientific advancement accepted by the world\n\n       community to be correct, the latter must prevail over the former.\n\niv.    That the respondent had made out a prima-facie case justifying the\n\n       Court’s exercise of discretionary power to direct conducting DNA Test\n\n       by collecting blood samples of the respondent and the minor child.\n\n v.    That the respondent would be able to substantiate his allegations of\n\n       adultery/infidelity on the part of the appellant, only if permission is\n\n       granted for conducting a DNA test. That it would be impossible for\n\n       the respondent to establish and confirm the assertions made in the\n\n       pleadings, other than by way of a DNA test. That DNA Testing is the\n\n       most legitimate and scientifically perfect means, that the husband\n\n       could use, to establish his assertion of infidelity.\n\f vi.   That in the event that the appellant accepts the direction issued by\n\n       the Court, the DNA Test will determine conclusively the veracity of\n\n       the accusations levelled by the respondent against her. In case, she\n\n       declines to comply with the direction issued by the Court, the\n\n       allegations would be determined by the Court, by drawing a\n\n       presumption of the nature contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 114</a> of the Indian\n\n       Evidence Act, particularly, in terms of illustration (h) thereof.\n\nvii.   That by adopting the above course, the issue of infidelity alone\n\n       would be determined, without expressly disturbing the presumption\n\n       contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.\n\n\n4.6. Aggrieved by the Order dated 12th August, 2021 passed by the\n\nFamily Court, Pune, the appellant filed a Writ Petition, being Civil Writ\n\nPetition No.7707 of 2021, before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay,\n\nassailing the same, inter-alia, on the ground that the Family Court failed\n\nto appreciate that a strong prima-facie case is a sine qua non for directing\n\nDNA profiling and that there was no evidence to support the respondent’s\n\nprayer for DNA test. Further, that the order of the Family Court was\n\ncontrary to the presumption provided under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 112</a> of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act and the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_12\">Hindu Marriage Act, 1955</a> and was\n\ncontrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\f4.7. By the impugned judgment dated 22nd November, 2021 the High\n\nCourt dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellant herein and upheld\n\nthe order of the Family Court dated 12 th August, 2021. The pertinent\n\nfindings of the High Court may be epitomized as under:\n\n  i.    That the respondent had carried out a DNA Test of Master Arjun at\n\n        DNA Labs India and had produced the report of the same dated 24 th\n\n        November, 2016 wherein the possibility of the respondent being the\n\n        biological father of Master Arjun was stated to be 0%. Thus, the very\n\n        foundation for taking recourse of moving an application for a\n\n        direction to conduct the DNA Test was expressly and strongly laid\n\n        down by the respondent.\n\n ii.    As regards the question as to whether an order directing DNA test of\n\n        the appellant’s minor child would encroach on the legal or\n\n        Constitutional rights of the appellant, the High Court held that\n\n        fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\n        of India are always subject to reasonable restrictions. Reliance was\n\n        placed on Sharda vs. Dharmpal, (2003) 4 SCC 493 to hold that a\n\n        matrimonial court has the power to direct a person to undergo\n\n        medical tests and such a direction would not amount to a violation\n\n        of the personal liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n        Constitution of India.\n\n iii.   That <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act provides for the\n\n        presumption of conclusive proof of legitimacy. However, such a\n\f       presumption is rebuttable. One way of rebutting such presumption\n\n       is by pleading and establishing a strong prima facie case like the one\n\n       demonstrated by the respondent.\n\n iv.   That a Court is required to be sensitive to the fact that but for the\n\n       medical/DNA test, it would be impossible for the respondent to\n\n       establish the assertions made in the pleadings.\n\n v.    That the Family Court had been adequately sensitive in taking note\n\n       of the statement of the respondent to the effect that he would not\n\n       disown Master Arjun even if the paternity test establishes that he is\n\n       not the biological father. That the respondent had also made prayers\n\n       for the custody of the said child, therefore, the interest of the child\n\n       was not jeopardized in allowing the DNA test.\n\nvi.    That if the appellant failed to comply with the directions of the\n\n       Family Court, the Court can draw a presumption of the nature\n\n       contemplated under illustration (h) of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence\n\n       Act.\n\n4.8. Aggrieved by the order of the Family Court dated 12 th August, 2021,\n\nas well as the impugned judgment, the appellant has assailed the same in\n\nthe present appeal.\n\nSubmissions:\n\n5.     We have heard learned Senior Counsel, Sri Huzefa Ahmadi for the\n\nappellant-wife, and learned Senior Counsel, Sri Kapil Sibal for the\n\nrespondent-husband and perused the material on record.\n\f6.   At the outset, Sri Huzefa Ahmadi submitted that the High Court had\n\nerred in upholding the direction of the Family Court, Pune, to conduct the\n\nDNA test of the younger son of the parties. That the respondent had failed\n\nto satisfy the test of “eminent need” as laid down by this Court in Goutam\n\nKundu vs. State of West Bengal, (1993) 3 SCC 418 wherein it was\n\nobserved that the Indian law leans towards legitimacy and that a direction\n\nfor DNA test should be passed only after balancing the interests of the\n\nparties, including the rights of the child, and if such a test is eminently\n\nneeded. That in the present case, the respondent had failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the direction for conducting DNA test could not have\n\nbeen avoided, and therefore, the direction to conduct the same was\n\nerroneous.\n\n\n6.1. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellant further contended that the\n\nHigh Court erred in observing that the interest of the child would not be\n\njeopardized by simply relying on the statement of the respondent that he\n\nwould not disown his son. That even if such a statement is taken at its\n\nface value, it will not be enough to protect the child from societal\n\nrepercussions associated with the illegitimacy of his birth (if any) and that\n\nany direction to conduct DNA test would be contrary to the interests of the\n\nchild and the same is being sought by the respondent to secure his\n\ninterests alone, without any consideration of the interest of the child. It\n\nwas next contended that the rationale behind the Indian Law leaning\n\ftowards legitimacy is that the DNA test would impinge on the right to\n\nprivacy of a child and any issue as to legitimacy will have major societal\n\nrepercussions on the innocent child. Further, balancing the interests of\n\nthe child and the respondent does not justify passing a direction for\n\nconducting the DNA test of the child.\n\n\n6.2. Sri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel next submitted that the\n\nrespondent had failed to establish any case demonstrating non-access at\n\nthe relevant time, so as to dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 112</a> of\n\nthe Evidence Act and thus, no direction could have been passed to\n\nconduct a DNA test of the child. That the language of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 112</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act and the decisions of this Court in Goutam Kundu, Bhabani\n\nPrasad Jena vs. Convenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for\n\nWomen, (2010) 8 SCC 633 and Ashok Kumar vs. Raj Gupta, (2022) 1\n\nSCC 20, would establish that a party seeking a direction to conduct DNA\n\ntest is required to bring on record strong prima-facie evidence of non-\n\naccess vis-a-vis the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\nThat clear and satisfactory evidence of non-access is needed to rebut the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, vide Perumal Nadar\n\n(dead) by Lrs. vs. Ponnuswami, (1970) 1 SCC 605.\n\n\n6.3. That in the instant case, Master Arjun was born on 17 th July, 2013,\n\nduring the continuance of marital relations between the parties and that\n\nthe respondent does not deny access to the appellant at the relevant time.\n\f6.4. That a direction to conduct a DNA test cannot be passed based on\n\nvague material. That the respondent has sought to rely on the DNA test\n\nreport dated 24th November, 2016. However, the authenticity of the said\n\nDNA Report has to be established during trial and any reliance placed on\n\nthe same before the authenticity of the same is proved would, in future,\n\namount to giving a license to a party (such as the respondent herein),\n\nseeking a direction to conduct a DNA test, to produce unauthenticated\n\nreports and this would have a devastating effect on the child.\n\n\n6.5. With respect to the assertion of the respondent that he came across\n\nmessages on the phone of the petitioner in the month of September 2016,\n\ndisclosing the appellant’s adulterous actions, it was submitted on behalf of\n\nthe appellant that no evidence or material in support of the same had\n\nbeen produced by the respondent and thus, no reliance can be placed on\n\nthe same.\n\n\n6.6. That it would be incorrect to state that simply because DNA tests are\n\nscientifically accurate, the same may be routinely conducted to dislodge\n\nthe presumption of legitimacy under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n\n6.7. It was averred that the issue of legitimacy is inextricably linked to\n\nthe allegations of adultery and the same cannot be lightly trifled with,\n\nmerely at the request of the respondent. Therefore, the presumption of\n\nlegitimacy must be preserved by Courts.\n\f     With the aforesaid submissions, learned Senior Counsel, Sri Huzefa\n\nAhmadi has prayed that the instant appeal be allowed and the impugned\n\njudgment of the High Court, as well as the order of the Family Court dated\n\n12th August 2021, be set aside.\n\n\n7.   Per contra, learned Senior Counsel Sri Kapil Sibal, appearing on\n\nbehalf of the respondent-husband submitted that the impugned judgment\n\nof the High Court and the order of the Family Court dated 12 th August\n\n2021 have been passed on an unimpeachable appreciation of the facts of\n\nthe case, as well as the relevant law, and therefore, the same do not call\n\nfor interference by this Court.\n\n\n7.1. Sri Kapil Sibal asserted that the instant appeal is an abuse of the\n\nprocess of law and is not maintainable either on law or based on the facts\n\nof the present case. That the present appeal has been filed with a view to\n\nmask the adulterous conduct of the appellant, in the guise of the child’s\n\nwelfare.\n\n\n7.2. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Uday Chand\n\nDutt vs. Saibal Sen, (1987) Supp SCC 506 to contend that in the face of\n\ntwo concurrent findings of the Family Court and the High Court, such\n\nfindings may not be interfered with by this Court.\n\n\n7.3. Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent\n\nreferred to <a href=\"/doc/1038208/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 41</a> of the Evidence Act and stated that a judgment in a\n\fmatrimonial proceeding is a judgment in-rem and therefore, to arrive at a\n\njust and proper judgment in the pending Divorce Petition, any evidence to\n\nbring out the truth is germane to the matter and has to be permitted to be\n\nbrought in and cannot be ignored. That the issue is one of a fair trial from\n\nthe point of view of both the parties.\n\n\n7.4. It was next submitted that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act would\n\nnot come in the way of the Courts directing DNA tests to be conducted in\n\ndeserving cases. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in\n\nDipanwita Roy vs. Ronobroto Roy, (2015) 1 SCC 365 to contend that\n\nthis Court in the said case laid down the process to be followed by Courts\n\nin directing DNA tests, while at the same time preserving the presumption\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. That a similar approach must be\n\npermitted to be adopted in the present case.\n\n\n7.5. It was further contended that in the present case, the most material\n\npiece of evidence to establish the allegations of adultery is the DNA test\n\nand the same cannot be shut out on the ground of sensitivity or privacy.\n\nReliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Sharda to contend\n\nthat in the said case it was categorically held that an order passed by a\n\nmatrimonial court ordering a person to undergo a medical test would not\n\nbe violative of the right of personal liberty as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. That therefore, the reluctance and hesitation of the\n\fappellant to allow the DNA test corroborates the allegations of adultery\n\nagainst her and brings forth the need to conduct the said DNA Test.\n\n\n7.6. That the Family Court passed the order directing DNA test after\n\nhaving due regard to the prima facie evidence brought before the said\n\ncourt and the High Court has rightly confirmed the order passed by the\n\nFamily Court. The Report of the privately conducted DNA test filed before\n\nthe Family Court, in unequivocal terms rules out the possibility of the\n\nrespondent being the biological father of the minor child. The said Report\n\nstrongly lays down the foundation for taking recourse of moving an\n\napplication for directions to conduct the DNA test. That under <a href=\"/doc/1352526/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 14</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act, Family Courts have been given vast powers to take\n\ninto consideration any report, statement, documents, and information\n\nwhich may assist the court to deal effectively with the dispute and thus,\n\nthe Family Court was right in accepting the report of the privately\n\nconducted DNA test.\n\n     With the aforesaid averments, it was prayed that the instant appeal\n\nbe dismissed as being devoid of merit and an abuse of the process of law,\n\nand the impugned judgment as well as the order of the Family Court, be\n\naffirmed.\n\nPoints for Consideration:\n\fHaving heard learned Senior Counsel for the respective parties, and upon\n\nperusal of the record, the following points would arise for our\n\nconsideration:\n\n  i.   Whether, the Family Court, Pune and the High Court of Judicature\n\n       at Bombay, have rightly appreciated <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act\n\n       in directing that a DNA test of Master Arjun be conducted?\n\nii.    Whether, on non-compliance on the part of the appellant of the\n\n       direction to subject Master Arjun to DNA test, allegations of adultery\n\n       as against her could be determined by drawing an adverse inference\n\n       as contemplated under Illustration (h) of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 114</a>?\n\niii.   What order?\n\n\nLegal Scheme:\n\n8.     For an easy and immediate reference, the relevant provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_30\">Evidence Act</a> are extracted hereinunder:\n\n            “4. ‘Conclusive proof’.—When one fact is declared\n            by this Act to be conclusive proof of another, the\n            Court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the\n            other as proved, and shall not allow evidence to be\n            given for the purpose of disproving it.\n                                    x x x\n\n            112.

According to Sarkar on Law of Evidence, 20th Edition, in the interest\n\nof health, order and peace in society, certain axiomatic presumptions have\n\nto be drawn. One such presumption is the conclusive presumption of\n\npaternity under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 112</a> embodies\n\nthe rule of law that the birth of a child during the continuance of a valid\n\nmarriage or within 280 days (i.e., within the period of gestation) after its\n\ndissolution shall be “conclusive proof” that the child is legitimate unless it\n\nis established by evidence that the husband and wife did not or could not\n\nhave any access to each other at any time when the child could have been\n\nconceived. The object of this provision is to attach unimpeachable\n\nlegitimacy to children born out of a valid marriage. When a child is born\n\nduring the subsistence of lawful wedlock, it would mean that the parents\n\nhad access to each other. Therefore, the Section speaks of “conclusive\n\nproof” of the legitimate birth of a child during the period of lawful\n\nwedlock.\n\f     The latter part of the Section is with reference to proof of the non-\n\naccess of the parents of the child to each other. Thus, the presumption of\n\nlegitimacy of the birth of the child is rebuttable by way of strong evidence\n\nto the contrary.\n\n     The principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 112</a> is to prevent an unwarranted\n\nenquiry as to the paternity of the child whose parents, at the relevant\n\ntime had “access” to each other. In other words, once a marriage is held to\n\nbe valid, there is a strong presumption as to the children born from that\n\nwedlock as being legitimate. This presumption can be rebutted only by\n\nstrong, clear and conclusive evidence to the contrary. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 112</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act is based on the presumption of public morality and public\n\npolicy vide Sham Lal vs. Sanjeev Kumar, (2009) 12 SCC 454. Since\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 112</a> creates a presumption of legitimacy that a child born during\n\nthe subsistence of a marriage is deemed to be legitimate, a burden is cast\n\non the person who questions the legitimacy of the child.\n\n\n8.2. Further, “access” or “non-access” does not mean actual co-\n\nhabitation but means the “existence” or “non-existence” of opportunities\n\nfor sexual relationship. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 112</a> refers to point of time of birth as the\n\ncrucial aspect and not to the time of conception. The time of conception is\n\nrelevant only to see whether the husband had or did not have access to\n\nthe wife. Thus, birth during the continuance of marriage is “conclusive\n\nproof” of legitimacy unless “non-access” of the party who questions the\n\fpaternity of the child at the time the child could have been begotten is\n\nproved by the said party.\n\n\n8.3. It is necessary in this context to note what is “conclusive proof” with\n\nreference to the proof of the legitimacy of the child, as stated in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n112</a> of the Evidence Act. As to the meaning of “conclusive proof” reference\n\nmay be made to <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 4</a> of the Evidence Act, which provides that when\n\none fact is declared to be conclusive proof of another, proof of one fact,\n\nwould automatically render the other fact as proved, unless contra\n\nevidence is led for the purpose of disproving the fact so proved. A conjoint\n\nreading of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, with the definition of\n\n“conclusive proof” under <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 4</a> thereof, makes it amply clear that a\n\nchild proved to be born during a valid marriage should be deemed to be a\n\nlegitimate child except where it is shown that the parties to the marriage\n\nhad no access to each other at any time when the child could have been\n\nbegotten or within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage and the\n\nmother remains unmarried, that fact is the conclusive proof that the child\n\nis the legitimate son of the man. Operation of the conclusive presumption\n\ncan be avoided by proving non-access at the relevant time.\n\n\n8.4. The latter part of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act indicates that if a\n\nperson is able to establish that the parties to the marriage had no access\n\nto each other at any time when the child could have been begotten, the\n\nlegitimacy of such child can be denied. That is, it must be proved by\n\fstrong and cogent evidence that access between them was impossible on\n\naccount of serious illness or impotency or that there was no chance of\n\nsexual relationship between the parties during the period when the child\n\nmust have been begotten. Thus, unless the absence of access is\n\nestablished, the presumption of legitimacy cannot be displaced.\n\n     Thus, where the husband and wife have co-habited together, and no\n\nimpotency is proved, the child born from their wedlock is conclusively\n\npresumed to be legitimate, even if the wife is shown to have been, at the\n\nsame time, guilty of infidelity. The fact that a woman is living in adultery\n\nwould not by itself be sufficient to repel the conclusive presumption in\n\nfavour of the legitimacy of a child. Therefore, shreds of evidence to the\n\neffect that the husband did not have intercourse with the wife at the\n\nperiod of conception, can only point to the illegitimacy of a child born in\n\nwedlock, but it would not uproot the presumption of legitimacy under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 112</a>.\n\n\n8.5. The presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 112</a> can be drawn only if the child\n\nis born during the continuance of a valid marriage and not otherwise.\n\n“Access” or “non-access” must be in the context of sexual intercourse that\n\nis, in the sexual sense and therefore, in that narrow sense. Access may for\n\ninstance, be impossible not only when the husband is away during the\n\nperiod when the child could have been begotten or owing to impotency or\n\nincompetency due to various reasons or the passage of time since the\n\fdeath of the husband. Thus, even though the husband may be cohabiting,\n\nthere may be non-access between the husband and the wife. One of the\n\ninstances of non-access despite co-habitation is the impotency of the\n\nhusband. If the husband has had access, adultery on the wife&#x27;s part will\n\nnot justify a finding of illegitimacy.\n\n\n8.6. Thus, “non-access” has to be proved as a fact in issue and the same\n\ncould be established by direct and circumstantial evidence of an\n\nunambiguous character. Thus, there could be “non-access” between the\n\nhusband and wife despite co-habitation. Conversely, even in the absence\n\nof actual co-habitation, there could be access.\n\n\n8.7. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 112</a> was enacted at a time when modern scientific tests\n\nsuch as DNA tests, as well as Ribonucleic acid tests (‘RNA’, for short), were\n\nnot in contemplation of the legislature. However, even the result of a\n\ngenuine DNA test cannot escape from the conclusiveness of the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. If a husband and\n\nwife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test\n\nreveals that the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in\n\nlaw would remain irrebuttable. What would be proved, is adultery on the\n\npart of the wife, however, the legitimacy of the child would still be\n\nconclusive in law. In other words, the conclusive presumption of paternity\n\nof a child born during the subsistence of a valid marriage is that the child\n\nis that of the husband and it cannot be rebutted by a mere DNA test\n\freport. What is necessary to rebut is the proof of non-access at the time\n\nwhen the child could have been begotten, that is, at the time of its\n\nconception vide Kamti Devi vs. Poshi Ram, (2001) 5 SCC 311.\n\n\n9.      The next aspect of the matter that requires to be considered is\n\nwhether an adverse presumption can be drawn in the nature of\n\nIllustration (h) to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 114</a>, as to the wife’s adulterous conduct when\n\nshe refuses to comply with a direction for the child to undergo a DNA test.\n\n\n9.1. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 114</a> states that the Court may presume the existence of any\n\nfact that it thinks likely to have happened, having regard to the common\n\ncourse of natural events, human conduct and public and private\n\nbusiness, in relation to the facts of a particular case. Broadly speaking,\n\nthere are two classes of presumptions, viz presumption of fact and\n\npresumption of law. The latter is again categorised as “rebuttable\n\npresumptions of law” and “irrebuttable or conclusive presumptions of\n\nlaw”.\n\n        The Court may presume that if a man refuses to answer a question\n\nwhich he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer if given would be\n\nunfavourable to him. The questions that one is not compelled to answer\n\nby law, are dealt with in Sections 121-129. Refusal to answer a question\n\nis generally a legitimate ground for unfavourable inference against the\n\nperson who may not answer the question. If a witness refuses to answer\n\nthe question, the Court has the power to draw an inference from such\n\frefusal vide <a href=\"/doc/509450/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 148(4)</a> of the Evidence Act. <a href=\"/doc/509450/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 148(4)</a> reads as\n\nunder:-\n\n           “148. Court to decide when question shall be\n           asked and when witness compelled to answer.—\n                  If any such question relates to a matter not\n           relevant to the suit or proceeding, except in so far as\n           it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his\n           character, the Court shall decide whether or not the\n           witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if\n           it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged\n           to answer it. In exercising its discretion, the Court\n           shall have regard to the following considerations:—\n\n                                       xxx\n\n           (4)   The Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the\n                 witness’s refusal to answer, the inference that\n                 the answer if given would be unfavourable.”\n\n\n     The use of the word expression “may” would imply that the Court\n\nhas the discretion to draw such an inference and it not bound to do so.\n\nThe Court is to exercise such discretion having regard to the facts of each\n\nindependent case.\n\n\n9.2. For the purpose of reaching one conclusion, the Court can rely on a\n\nfactual presumption unless the presumption is disproved or dispelled or\n\nrebutted. However, Illustration (h) to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 114</a> has given enough\n\ndiscretionary power to the Court to draw certain inferences from the facts.\n\nThe presumption under the section is discretionary and not mandatory.\n\nThe use of the phrase “may presume” in the said provision indicated that\n\nthat the Courts of Justice are to use their own sense and experience in\n\fjudging the effect of particular facts, and in determining whether a\n\npresumption is to be drawn therefrom.\n\n\n10. At this juncture, it may be useful to refer to the decision of this Court\n\nin Dipanwita Roy wherein the interplay between <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_51\">Sections 112</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_52\">114</a> of\n\nthe Evidence Act has been discussed. The said case arose out of divorce\n\nproceedings initiated by the respondent-husband on the ground of\n\nadultery and infidelity. The respondent’s case was that at the time when\n\nthe child, whose paternity was in question, was conceived, the parties\n\nwere not living in co-habitation and on no occasion shared a bed. The\n\nrespondent sought to establish by way of a DNA test that the son\n\nconceived during the said period was born outside wedlock and as a result\n\nof the appellant-wife’s adulterous relationship with another person and\n\nconsequently demonstrated infidelity on the part of the appellant-wife.\n\nThis Court took note of the plea of the respondent-husband as to non-\n\naccess at the relevant time, and accordingly opined that it would be a fit\n\ncase for directing that a DNA test be conducted. Further, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the said case, this Court accepted that a DNA test would\n\nbe the only way in which the respondent-husband could establish his plea\n\nof infidelity on the part of the appellant-wife. While upholding the\n\ndirection of the High Court to conduct DNA test of the minor child, this\n\nCourt cautioned that if the direction to hold such a test can be avoided, it\n\nshould be so avoided, and legitimacy of the child should not be put to\n\fperil. The relevant portions of the decision in the said case have been\n\nusefully extracted hereinunder:\n\n        “10. It is borne from the decisions rendered by this\n        Court in Bhabani Prasad Jena (supra), and Nandlal\n        Wasudeo Badwaik (supra), that depending on the facts\n        and circumstances of the case, it would be permissible\n        for a Court to direct the holding of a DNA examination,\n        to determine the veracity of the allegation(s), which\n        constitute one of the grounds, on which the concerned\n        party would either succeed or lose. There can be no\n        dispute, that if the direction to hold such a test can be\n        avoided, it should be so avoided. The reason, as already\n        recorded in various judgments by this Court, is that the\n        legitimacy of a child should not be put to peril.\n\n        11. The question that has to be answered in this case, is\n        in respect of the alleged infidelity of the Appellant-wife.\n        The Respondent-husband has made clear and\n        categorical assertions in the petition filed by him Under\n        <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, alleging infidelity.\n        He has gone to the extent of naming the person, who\n        was the father of the male child born to the Appellant-\n        wife. It is in the process of substantiating his allegation\n        of infidelity, that the Respondent-husband had made an\n        application before the Family Court for conducting a\n        DNA test, which would establish whether or not, he had\n        fathered the male child born to the Appellant-wife. The\n        Respondent feels that it is only possible for him to\n        substantiate the allegations levelled by him (of the\n        Appellant-wife&#x27;s infidelity) through a DNA test. We agree\n        with him. In our view, but for the DNA test, it would be\n        impossible for the Respondent-husband to establish and\n        confirm the assertions made in the pleadings. We are\n        therefore satisfied, that the direction issued by the High\n        Court, as has been extracted hereinabove, was fully\n        justified. DNA testing is the most legitimate and\n        scientifically perfect means, which the husband could\n        use, to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should\n        simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful\n        and correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut\n        the assertions made by the Respondent-husband, and to\n        establish that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous\n\for disloyal. If the Appellant-wife is right, she shall be\nproved to be so.\n\n12. We would, however, while upholding the order\npassed by the High Court, consider it just and\nappropriate to record a caveat, giving the Appellant-wife\nliberty to comply with or disregard the order passed by\nthe High Court, requiring the holding of the DNA test. In\ncase, she accepts the direction issued by the High Court,\nthe DNA test will determine conclusively the veracity of\naccusation levelled by the Respondent-husband, against\nher. In case, she declines to comply with the direction\nissued by the High Court, the allegation would be\ndetermined by the concerned Court, by drawing a\npresumption of the nature contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 114</a>\nof the Indian Evidence Act, especially, in terms of\nillustration (h) thereof. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 114</a> as also illustration\n(h), referred to above, are being extracted hereunder:\n\n    “114. Court may presume existence of certain\n    facts - The Court may presume the existence\n    of any fact which it thinks likely to have\n    happened, regard being had to the common\n    course of natural events, human conduct and\n    public and private business, in their relation\n    to the facts of the particular case.\n\n    Illustration (h) - That if a man refuses to\n    answer a question which he is not compelled\n    to answer by law, the answer, if given, would\n    be unfavourable to him.”\n\nThis course has been adopted to preserve the right of\nindividual privacy to the extent possible. of course,\nwithout sacrificing the cause of justice. By adopting the\nabove course, the issue of infidelity alone would be\ndetermined,     without    expressly     disturbing   the\npresumption contemplated Under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 112</a> of the\nIndian Evidence Act. Even though, as already stated\nabove, undoubtedly the issue of legitimacy would also be\nincidentally involved.”\n\f10.1. However, it is necessary to distinguish the facts of the present case\n\nwith the facts in Dipanwita Roy. In the said case, the respondent-\n\nhusband had made a specific plea of non-access in order to rebut the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 112</a>. He made clear and categorical assertions\n\nin the petition filed by him alleging infidelity. He even named the person\n\nwho was the father of the male child born to the appellant-wife, and\n\nasserted that at the relevant time, he and his wife did not share a bed on\n\nany occasion. In that backdrop, this Court specifically recorded a finding\n\nthat in the facts and circumstances of the said case, it would have been\n\nimpossible to prove the allegations of adultery/infidelity in the absence of\n\na DNA test. However, in the present case, no plea has been raised by the\n\nrespondent-husband      as   to   non-access   in   order   to   dislodge   the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. Further, the\n\nrespondent has specifically claimed that he is in possession of call\n\nrecordings/transcripts, and the daily diary of the appellant, which would\n\npoint to the infidelity of the appellant. Therefore, this is not a case where a\n\nDNA test would be the only possible way to ascertain the truth regarding\n\nthe appellant’s adultery. Hence, in the present case, there is insufficient\n\nmaterial to dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct and permit a DNA test of Master Arjun.\n\n     Further, having regard to the compelling need for a DNA test in the\n\nsaid case, in order to establish the truth, this Court directed that if the\n\nappellant-wife therein refused to comply with the direction of the Court\n\fregarding DNA test, the allegations of adultery as against her would be\n\ndetermined by drawing an adverse inference as contemplated under\n\nIllustration (h) of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act. However, such an\n\nobservation made in the said case cannot be regarded as a precedent\n\nwhich can be applied to all cases in a strait jacket manner wherein the\n\nwife refuses to comply with the direction of the Court regarding DNA test.\n\n     It is highlighted at this juncture that presumptions are established\n\non the basis of facts, and the Court enjoys the discretionary power, either\n\nto presume a fact or not. As observed hereinabove, the facts in Dipanwita\n\nRoy were so compelling, so as to justify a direction to conduct a DNA test.\n\nIn the said case, the husband had taken a specific plea of non-access.\n\nFurther, the Court accepted that a DNA test would be the only manner in\n\nwhich the case of adultery could be proved. However, facts of the present\n\ncase neither warrant a direction to conduct a DNA test of Master Arjun,\n\nnor do they justify drawing an adverse inference as against the appellant-\n\nwife, under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act, on her refusal to subject her\n\nson to a DNA test.\n\n     As per Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, ‘Inference’ means “a\n\nconclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a logical\n\nconsequence from them.”\n\n     ‘Adverse Inference’ is explained as follows:\n\n         “A detrimental conclusion drawn by the fact-finder from\n         a party’s failure to produce evidence that is within the\n\f         party’s control. Some courts allow the inference only if\n         the party’s failure is attributable to bad faith.”\n\n     The aforesaid meaning would also suggest that inferences, whether\n\nadverse or otherwise, are to be drawn by the Court, on consideration of\n\nfacts and circumstances of each individual cases. Hence, the judgment of\n\nthis Court in Dipanwita Roy is to be read in the aforesaid context.\n\n     In the instant case, there is no dispute about the paternity of Master\n\nArjun as even during the course of arguments, Learned Senior Counsel\n\nShri Kapil Sibal admitted that Master Arjun was born during the\n\ncontinuous cohabitation of the parties and thus during the subsistence of\n\na valid marriage. The thrust of the submissions of Learned Senior\n\nCounsel Shri Kapil Sibal was that if the appellant herein does not agree to\n\nsubject Master Arjun to a DNA test, then, an adverse inference could be\n\nraised against her regarding her adulterous life. What is the nature of the\n\nadverse inference that could be raised against the appellant herein? The\n\nadverse inference is not with regard to Master Arjun being a child born\n\noutside wedlock and therefore an illegitimate child. What was contended\n\nwas that an adverse inference regarding adultery on the part of the\n\nappellant herein could be raised. We cannot accede to such an approach\n\nin the matter. The issue of paternity of Master Arjun is alien to the issue of\n\nadultery on the part of the appellant herein. Master Arjun being a\n\nlegitimate child of the parties herein has nothing to do with the alleged\n\nadultery on the part of the appellant herein. Hence, the judgment of this\n\fCourt in Dipanwita Roy is of no assistance to the respondent herein. The\n\naforesaid case, turns on its own facts and cannot be relied upon as a\n\nprecedent having regard to the facts of this case.\n\n\nUse of DNA profiling technology as a means to prove adultery:\n\n11.   With the advancement of science, DNA profiling technology which is\n\na tool of forensic science can, in case of disputed paternity of a child by\n\nmere comparison of DNA obtained from the body fluid or body tissues of\n\nthe child with his parents, offer infallible evidence of biological parentage.\n\nBut, it is not always necessary to conduct a DNA test to ascertain whether\n\na particular child was born to a particular person, however, the burden of\n\nproof is on the husband who alleges illegitimacy. He has to establish the\n\nfact that he has not fathered the child born to his wife which is a negative\n\nplea by positive proof in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n\n11.1. A Family Court, no doubt, has the power to direct a person to\n\nundergo medical tests, including a DNA test and such an order would not\n\nbe in violation of the right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, vide Sharda. However, the Court should exercise such\n\npower only when it is expedient in the interest of justice to do so, and\n\nwhen the fact situation in a given case warrants such an exercise. Thus,\n\nan order directing that a minor child be subjected to DNA test should not\n\nbe passed mechanically in each and every case.\n\f11.2. This Court has, while considering questions connected with <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n\n112</a> of the Evidence Act, consistently expressed the stand against DNA\n\ntests being ordered on a mere asking. Further, the law does not\n\ncontemplate use of DNA tests as exploratory or investigatory experiments\n\nfor determining paternity. The following decisions of this Court are highly\n\ninstructive in determining the circumstances under which a DNA test may\n\nbe ordered by a Court in matters involving disputed questions of\n\npaternity:\n\n i.   In Goutam Kundu, this Court was required to consider whether a\n\n      blood test of a minor child could be ordered to be conducted as a\n\n      means to determine disputed questions of paternity in what was\n\n      essentially a matrimonial dispute concerning maintenance. In the\n\n      said case, the appellant-husband therein disputed the paternity of\n\n      the child and prayed for blood group test of the child to prove that\n\n      he was not the father of the child. According to him, if that could be\n\n      established, he would not be liable to pay maintenance. In that\n\n      context, this Court held that due deference must be accorded to the\n\n      presumption of legitimacy of a child born during the subsistence of\n\n      a marriage, as expressed under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n      The consequence of the said presumption on the power of the\n\n      Courts to direct blood test as a means to determine paternity in\n\n      matrimonial disputes was discussed by this Court, and the following\n\f      principles were culled out so as to guide the Courts in issuing such\n\n      directions:\n\n              “26. From the above discussion it emerges:\n\n              (1) that courts in India cannot order blood test as a\n                  matter of course;\n\n              (2) wherever applications are made for such prayers\n                  in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for\n                  blood test cannot be entertained.\n\n              (3) there must be a strong prima facie case in that\n                  the husband must establish non-access in order\n                  to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_66\">Section\n                  112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n              (4) the court must carefully examine as to what\n                  would be the consequence of ordering the blood\n                  test; whether it will have the effect of branding a\n                  child as a bastard and the mother as an\n                  unchaste woman.\n\n              (5) no one can be compelled to give sample of blood\n                  for analysis.”\n\nii.   In Bhabani Prasad Jena, this Court emphasised that a direction to\n\n      use DNA profiling technology to determine the paternity of a child, is\n\n      an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. Therefore, such tests\n\n      must be directed to be conducted only when the same are eminently\n\n      needed. That DNA profiling in a matter relating to paternity of a\n\n      child should not be directed by the court as a matter of course or in\n\n      a routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The court has\n\n      to consider diverse aspects including presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_67\">Section\n\n      112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test of\n\f       &#x27;eminent need&#x27; whether it is not possible for the court to reach the\n\n       truth without use of such test. It was further declared that a Court\n\n       may direct that a DNA test be conducted, to conclusively determine\n\n       paternity, only when there is a strong prima-facie case in favour of\n\n       the person seeking such a direction.\n\niii.   In Inayath Ali vs. State of Telangana, MANU/SC/1538/2022, the\n\n       question before this Court was whether a DNA test of two minor\n\n       children could be ordered by a Court, with a view to facilitate proof\n\n       of allegations under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_68\">Sections 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_69\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_70\">354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_71\">506</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_72\">509</a> of Indian\n\n       Penal Code, 1860. This Court speaking through Aniruddha Bose, J.\n\n       at the outset took note of the fact that the dispute was essentially\n\n       one relating to dowry related offences, and that paternity of the\n\n       children of the complainant was not directly related to the\n\n       allegations. The complainant therein sought for a direction to\n\n       conduct DNA test of her two minor children, in order to establish\n\n       that they were born as a result of her forced relationship with her\n\n       brother-in-law. Rejecting the complainant’s plea, this Court held as\n\n       under as to the power of Courts to subject children to DNA testing,\n\n       in proceedings in which their status is not required to be examined:\n\n              “In the present proceeding, we are taking two\n              factors into account which have been ignored by the\n              Trial Court as also the Revisional Court. The Trial\n              Court allowed the application of the respondent\n              no.2 mechanically, on the premise that the DNA\n              fingerprint test is permissible under the law. High\n              Court has also proceeded on that basis, referring to\n\fdifferent authorities including the case of\nDipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy [2015 (1) SCC\n365]. The ratio of this case was also examined by\nthe Coordinate Bench in the decision of Ashok\nKumar (supra).\n\n7. The first factor, which, in our opinion, is of\nsignificance, is that in the judgment under\nappeal, blood sampling of the children was\ndirected, who were not parties to the proceeding\nnor were their status required to be examined in\nthe complaint of the respondent no.2. This\nraised doubt on their legitimacy of being borne\nto legally wedded parents and such directions, if\ncarried out, have the potential of exposing them\nto inheritance related complication. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 112</a>\nof the Evidence Act, also gives a protective cover\nfrom allegations of this nature. The said provision\nstipulates:-\n\n    “Birth during marriage, conclusive\n    proof of legitimacy.—The fact that any\n    person was born during the continuance of\n    a valid marriage between his mother and\n    any man, or within two hundred and eighty\n    days after its dissolution, the mother\n    remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive\n    proof that he is the legitimate son of that\n    man, unless it can be shown that the\n    parties to the marriage had no access to\n    each other at any time when he could have\n    been begotten.”\n\n8. In our opinion, the Trial Court as also the\nRevisional Court had completely ignored the\nsaid factor and proceeded as if the children were\nmaterial objects who could be sent for forensic\nanalysis. The other factor, in our opinion, which\nwas ignored by the said two Courts is that the\npaternity of the children was not in question in\nthe subject-proceeding.\n\n9. The substance of the complaint was not related to\npaternity of the children of the respondent no.2 but\nthe question was whether the offences under the\n\f              aforesaid provisions of the 1860 Code was\n              committed against her or not. The paternity of the\n              two daughters of the respondent no.2 is a\n              collateral factor to the allegations on which the\n              criminal case is otherwise founded. On the basis\n              of the available materials, in our opinion, the case\n              out of which this proceeding arises could be decided\n              without considering the DNA test report. This was\n              the reasoning which was considered by the\n              Coordinate Bench in the case of Ashok Kumar\n              (supra), though that was a civil suit. Merely\n              because something is permissible under the law\n              cannot be directed as a matter of course to be\n              performed particularly when a direction to that\n              effect would be invasive to the physical\n              autonomy of a person. The consequence thereof\n              would not be confined to the question as to whether\n              such an order would result in testimonial\n              compulsion, but encompasses right to privacy as\n              well. Such direction would violate the privacy\n              right of the persons subjected to such tests and\n              could be prejudicial to the future of the two\n              children who were also sought to be brought\n              within the ambit of the Trial Court’s direction.”\n\n                                                 (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n12.    Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, the following principles\n\ncould be culled out as to the circumstances under which a DNA test of a\n\nminor child may be directed to be conducted:\n\n i.    That a DNA test of a minor child is not to be ordered routinely, in\n\n       matrimonial disputes. Proof by way of DNA profiling is to be directed\n\n       in matrimonial disputes involving allegations of infidelity, only in\n\n       matters where there is no other mode of proving such assertions.\n\n ii.   DNA tests of children born during the subsistence of a valid\n\n       marriage may be directed, only when there is sufficient prima-facie\n\f        material to dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 112</a> of the\n\n        Evidence Act. Further, if no plea has been raised as to non-access,\n\n        in order to rebut the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 112</a> of the\n\n        Evidence Act, a DNA test may not be directed.\n\n iii.   A Court would not be justified in mechanically directing a DNA test\n\n        of a child, in a case where the paternity of a child is not directly in\n\n        issue, but is merely collateral to the proceeding.\n\n iv.    Merely because either of the parties have disputed a factum of\n\n        paternity, it does not mean that the Court should direct DNA test or\n\n        such other test to resolve the controversy. The parties should be\n\n        directed to lead evidence to prove or disprove the factum of paternity\n\n        and only if the Court finds it impossible to draw an inference based\n\n        on such evidence, or the controversy in issue cannot be resolved\n\n        without DNA test, it may direct DNA test and not otherwise. In other\n\n        words, only in exceptional and deserving cases, where such a test\n\n        becomes indispensable to resolve the controversy the Court can\n\n        direct such test.\n\n v.     While directing DNA tests as a means to prove adultery, the Court is\n\n        to be mindful of the consequences thereof on the children born out\n\n        of adultery, including inheritance-related consequences, social\n\n        stigma, etc.\n\n13.     Further, in Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik, the facts of the case were\n\nthat due to non-opposition of the counsel for the wife, this Court directed\n\fthat the serological test be conducted. The report was brought on record,\n\nwhich stated that the appellant-husband was not the biological father of\n\nthe minor child. At the request of the respondent-wife, a re-test was\n\nordered, which also revealed the same result. The plea with regard to the\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_76\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act was taken only after the\n\nDNA test was conducted on the direction of this Court and the report was\n\nbrought on record. This Court held that when a report of a DNA test\n\nconducted on the direction of a Court, was available on record and was in\n\nconflict with the presumption of conclusive proof of the legitimacy of the\n\nchild, the DNA test report cannot be ignored. Hence, this Court relied on\n\nthe DNA test report and held that the appellant-husband would not be\n\nliable to pay maintenance. The said case would be of no assistance to the\n\ncase of the respondent herein. This is because, in the said case, this\n\nCourt was confronted with a situation in which DNA test report, in fact,\n\nwas available and was in conflict with the presumption of conclusive proof\n\nof legitimacy of the child, under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. However,\n\nin the present case, no DNA test is available till date, which was\n\nconducted on the direction of a competent Court. Therefore, the\n\nrespondent-husband would first need to dislodge the presumption under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act and thereafter seek a direction to conduct\n\na DNA test of Master Arjun.\n\f14.   The evidentiary value of blood tests for determining paternity, has\n\nbeen discussed in Rayden and Jackson on Divorce and Family Matters,\n\n(1983) Vol. I, at Pg. 1054, in the following words:\n\n         “…depending on the type of litigation, samples of blood,\n         when subjected to skilled scientific examination, can\n         sometimes supply helpful evidence on various issues, to\n         exclude a parentage set up in the said case. But the\n         consideration remains that the party asserting the claim\n         to have a child and the rival set up parents put to blood\n         test must establish his right to do so. The courts\n         exercise protective jurisdiction on behalf of an\n         infant. In my considered opinion, it would be unjust\n         and not fair either to direct a test for a collateral\n         reason to assist a litigant in his or her claim. The\n         child cannot be allowed to suffer because of his\n         incapacity; the aim is to ensure that he gets his\n         rights. If in a case the court has reason to believe\n         that the application for the blood test is of a fishing\n         nature or designed for some ulterior motive, it would\n         be justified in not according to such a prayer.”\n                                                 (Emphasis by us)\n\n\n15.   It is trite that the burden is on a litigating party to prove his case by\n\nadducing evidence in support of his plea. The Court is not to compel one\n\nparty to the dispute to assist the other contesting party, vide Ashok\n\nKumar. Therefore, DNA tests are not to be directed on a routine basis,\n\nmerely to enable a party to prove his case of adultery.\n\n\nThe right of children not to have their legitimacy questioned\n\nfrivolously in Courts of Law:\n\n16.   The default position in India is that for many reasons, parents are\n\npresumed to be the decision makers for their children, in so far as\n\fhealthcare, consent for genetic testing etc. are concerned. Justifications\n\nfor this position include that parents are free within very broad limits to\n\ndecide how to bring up their children, parents are thought to be most\n\nlikely to act in their child&#x27;s best interests, children generally lack the\n\ncapacity to make fully competent decisions so someone else must, and\n\nstate intervention is rarely appropriate. Genetic information is broadly\n\nunderstood as shedding light on a person&#x27;s essence, as going to the very\n\nheart of who he/she is. That kind of intimate, personal information,\n\nwhich is so highly valued in our society, is precisely what the law protects\n\nin the right of privacy, which extends even to children.\n\n\n17.   Further, children have the right not to have their legitimacy\n\nquestioned frivolously before a Court of Law. This is an essential attribute\n\nof the right to privacy. Courts are therefore required to acknowledge that\n\nchildren are not to be regarded like material objects, and be subjected to\n\nforensic/DNA testing, particularly when they are not parties to the divorce\n\nproceeding. It is imperative that children do not become the focal point of\n\nthe battle between spouses.\n\n\nThe Rights to Privacy, Autonomy and Identity of Children under The\n\nConvention on Rights of Child:\n\n18.   In 1989, the United Nations Organisation drew up the Convention\n\non Rights of Child with a view to provide special protection to children,\n\nproclaiming that “childhood is entitled to special care and assistance.” The\n\fDeclaration, inter-alia, recognises that a child, for full and harmonious\n\ndevelopment of his or her personality, should grow up in a family\n\nenvironment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.\n\nThe Declaration further emphasises the importance of family, as the\n\n“fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth\n\nand well-being of all its members and particularly children.”\n\n\n19.   <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 19</a> of the Convention protects children against all forms of\n\nviolence, neglect, and abuse; <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 24(3)</a> protects children against\n\ntraditional practices that are prejudicial to a child’s health; and <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 37</a>\n\nprotects children against torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading\n\ntreatment. Complementing these provisions is a child’s right to privacy,\n\nwhich extends to the physical and psychological integrity of a child.\n\nImportantly, violations of a child’s bodily integrity that reach the\n\nthreshold of torture or cruel inhuman degrading treatment will never be\n\njustifiable, given the absolute prohibition on such treatment. Thus, a\n\nviolation of this prohibition will always constitute a violation of a child’s\n\nright to privacy. However, the right to privacy has a residual application in\n\nthose cases where there is an interference with a child’s physical and/or\n\npsychological integrity that does not reach the threshold for torture or\n\ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. In such circumstances the\n\nquestion becomes whether the interference with a child’s integrity is\n\nlawful and non-arbitrary.\n\f20.   The Convention accommodates and protects parental rights with\n\nrespect to the upbringing of their Children, vide <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 5.</a> However, this\n\ndeference to parental wishes is subject to the strict caveat that such\n\nrights are exercised for the purpose of providing guidance and assistance\n\nto a child. Thus, unless a parent can demonstrate on the basis of objective\n\nevidence that an interference with a child’s bodily integrity is intended to\n\nbenefit the health and development of a child, the interference will not be\n\njustified. If any interference with the right to privacy or bodily integrity of\n\na child is to be justified, it must be established that there is objective\n\nevidence that establishes a nexus between the measure and aim; that\n\nthere is no reasonably available alternative which would have minimized\n\nthe interference with the child’s right. Applying the said principles\n\nenumerated in the Convention, to the facts of the present case, we are\n\nunable to accept that conducting a DNA test of a child, as a means to\n\nprove adultery on the part of the appellant-wife, is with a view to provide\n\nguidance and assistance to a child, as required under the Convention.\n\nFurther, interference with the bodily integrity of a child in such a case,\n\nwould not be justified, as there is no nexus between the Respondent’s\n\nrequest for the DNA test and the best interests of the child.\n\n\n21.   The concept of privacy for a child may not be equivalent to that of an\n\nadult. However, the evolving capacity of children has been recognised and\n\nthe Convention acknowledges the control that individuals, including\n\fchildren, have over their own personal boundaries and the means by\n\nwhich they define who they are in relation to other people. Children are\n\nnot to be deprived of this entitlement to influence and understand their\n\nsense of self simply by virtue of being children. Further, <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 8</a> of the\n\nConvention provides children with an express right to preserve their\n\nidentity. Details of parentage are an attribute of a child’s identity.\n\nTherefore, long-accepted notions about a child’s parentage must not be\n\nfrivolously challenged before Courts of Law.\n\n\nBest interests of a child:\n\n22.   The phrase “mankind owes to the child the best it has to give” clearly\n\nunderlines our duties towards children, and it entitles them to the best\n\nthat mankind can give. This implies that the interest of the child should\n\nbe given primary consideration in actions involving children.\n\n      This idea has been effectively expressed in <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 3</a> of the\n\nConvention on the Rights of Child which reads as under:\n\n         “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken\n         by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of\n         law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the\n         best interests of the child shall be a primary\n         consideration”.\n\n\n22.1 In two English decisions reported in Re L., (1968) 1 All ER\n\n20 and B. (B.R.) vs. B.(J.), (1968) 2 All ER 1023, blood test of the child\n\nwas permitted for determining paternity. However, the decision in Re\n\nL. was passed based on the reasoning that a blood test can be directed if\n\fit serves the best interest of the child. Lord Denning, MR, was however of\n\nthe view that blood tests could be ordered even in cases involving\n\npaternity issues or in proceedings where it is in the best interest of the\n\nchild to have its paternity settled one way or the other. However, in the\n\nsame decision, Wilmer, LJ and Davoes, LJ, expressed their reservations\n\nagainst the opinion of Lord Denning, MR, regarding blood tests in\n\nproceedings other than in custodial jurisdiction.\n\n     However, in the latter decision of B. (B.R.), it was held that a judge of\n\nthe High Court can order a blood test on a paternity issue or indeed on\n\nany other issue, when doing so would be in the best interest of the child to\n\ndo so.\n\n\n22.2 This Court has consistently invoked the principle of best interest of\n\nchild, particularly, in disputes concerning custody of children.\n\n\n22.3. It is undeniable that a finding as to illegitimacy, if revealed in a DNA\n\ntest, would, at the very least adversely affect the child psychologically. It\n\ncan cause not only confusion in the mind of the child but a quest to find\n\nout who the real father is and a mixed feeling towards a person who may\n\nhave nurtured the child but is not the biological father. Not knowing who\n\none’s father is creates a mental trauma in a child. One can imagine, if,\n\nafter coming to know the identity of the biological father what greater\n\ntrauma and stress would impact on a young mind. Proceedings which are\n\nin rem have a real impact on not only the child but also on the\n\frelationship between the mother and the child itself which is otherwise\n\nsublime. It has been said that parents of a child may have an illegitimate\n\nrelationship but a child born out of such a relationship cannot carry the\n\nstamp of illegitimacy on its forehead, as, such a child has no role to play\n\nin its birth. An innocent child cannot be traumatised and subjected to\n\nextreme stress and tension in order to discover its paternity. That is why\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act speaks about a conclusive presumption\n\nregarding the paternity of a child, subject to a rebuttal, as provided in the\n\nsecond part of the Section.\n\n     In today’s world, there can even be a race to claim paternity of a\n\nchild so as to invade upon its rights, particularly, if such a child is\n\nendowed with property and wealth. There could also be exclusions in a\n\ntestament doubting the paternity of a child or an evasion in performance\n\nof parental obligations such as payment of maintenance or living and\n\neducational expenses by simply doubting the paternity of a child.\n\n     In many cases, this would cast a doubt on the chastity of the\n\nmother of a child when no such doubt could arise. As a result, the\n\nreputation and dignity of a mother of a child would be jeopardised in\n\nsociety. What is of utmost importance for a lady who is the mother of a\n\nchild is to protect her chastity as well as her dignity and reputation, in\n\nthat, she would also preserve the dignity of her child.\n\n     No woman, particularly, who is married can be exposed to an\n\nenquiry on the paternity of a child she has given birth to in the face of\n\f<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act subject to the presumption being rebutted\n\nby strong and cogent evidence. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 112</a> particularly speaks about\n\nbirth of a child during marriage and raises a conclusive presumption\n\nabout legitimacy. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 112</a> has recognised the institution of marriage\n\ni.e., a valid marriage for the purpose of conferring legitimacy on children\n\nborn during the subsistence of such a marriage.\n\n     As to children born outside a valid marriage, the personal law of\n\nrespective parties would apply. But in the cases of children born from a\n\nrelationship in the nature of marriage and when the parents are in a\n\ndomestic relationship or those born as a result of a sexual assault or to\n\nthose who are in a casual relationship or to those forced or subjected to\n\nrender sexual favours and beget children, the problem of their legitimacy\n\ngets complex and is serious.\n\n     A child should not be lost in its search for paternity. Precious\n\nchildhood and youth cannot be lost in a quest to know about one’s\n\npaternity. Therefore, the wholesome object of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct which confers legitimacy on children born during the subsistence of a\n\nvalid marriage, subject to the same being rebutted by cogent and strong\n\nevidence, is to be preserved.\n\n     Children of today are citizens and the future of a nation. The\n\nconfidence and happiness of a child who is showered with love and\n\naffection by both parents is totally distinct from that of a child who has no\n\nparents or has lost a parent and still worse, is that of a child whose\n\fpaternity is in question without there being any cogent reason for the\n\nsame. The plight of a child whose paternity and thus his legitimacy, is\n\nquestioned would sink into a vortex of confusion which can be\n\nconfounded if Courts are not cautious and responsible enough to exercise\n\ndiscretion in a most judicious and cautious manner.\n\nFurther, questions surrounding paternity have a significant impact on the\n\nidentity of a child. Routinely ordering DNA tests, particularly in cases\n\nwhere the issue of paternity is merely incidental to the controversy at\n\nhand, could, in some cases even contribute to a child suffering an identity\n\ncrisis. It is also necessary to take into account that some children,\n\nalthough born during the subsistence of a marriage and on the desire and\n\nconsent of the married couple to beget a child, may have been conceived\n\nthrough processes involving sperm donation, such as intrauterine\n\ninsemination (IUI), in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). In such cases, a DNA test of\n\nthe child, could lead to misleading results. The results may also cause a\n\nchild to develop a sense of mistrust towards the parents, and frustration\n\nowing to the inability to search for their biological fathers. Further, a\n\nchild’s quest to locate its biological father may compete with the right to\n\nanonymity of the sperm donor. Having regard to such factors, a parent\n\nmay, in the best interests of the child, choose not to subject a child to a\n\nDNA test. It is also, antithetical to the fundamentals of the right to\n\nprivacy to require a person to disclose, in the course of proceedings in\n\nrem, the medical procedures resorted to in order to conceive.\n\f      The reasons for the parent’s refusal may be several, and hence, it is\n\nnot prudent to draw an adverse inference under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 114</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, in every case where a parent refuses to subject the child to\n\na DNA test.\n\n      Therefore, it is necessary that only in exceptional and deserving\n\ncases, where such a test becomes indispensable to resolve the controversy,\n\nthe Court can direct such test. Further, a direction to conduct DNA test of\n\na child, is to be ordered even rarely, in cases where the paternity of a child\n\nis not directly in issue but is merely collateral to the proceeding, such as\n\nin the instant case.\n\n\nConclusions:\n\n23.   ‘Illegitimate’- a term that brands an individual with the shame of\n\nbeing born outside wedlock, casts a shadow on one’s identity. Times\n\nchange and attitudes may change, but the impact of growing up with the\n\nsocial stigma of being illegitimate, does not. The Courts must hence be\n\ninclined towards upholding the legitimacy of the child unless the facts are\n\nso compulsive and clinching as to necessarily warrant a finding that the\n\nchild could not at all have been begotten to the father and as such a\n\nlegitimisation of the child would result in rank injustice to the father, vide\n\nDukhtar Jahan vs. Mohammed Farooq, (1987) 1 SCC 624.\n\n\n24.   Questions as to illegitimacy of a child, are only incidental to the\n\nclaim of dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery or infidelity.\n\fAllowing DNA tests to be conducted on a routine basis, in order to prove\n\nadultery, would amount to redefinition of the maxim, “Pater est quem\n\nnuptiae demonstrant” which means, the father is he whom the nuptials\n\npoint out. While dealing with allegations of adultery and infidelity, a\n\nrequest for a DNA test of the child, not only competes with the\n\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 112</a>, but also jostles with the imperative of\n\nbodily autonomy.\n\n\n25.   Another aspect that needs to be considered in the instant case is\n\nwhether, for a just decision in the divorce proceedings, a DNA test is\n\neminently necessary. This is not a case where a DNA test is the only route\n\nto the truth regarding the adultery of the mother. If the paternity of the\n\nchildren is the issue in a proceeding, DNA test may be the only route to\n\nestablish the truth. However, in our view, it is not so in the present case.\n\nThe evidence of DNA test to rebut the conclusive presumption available\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, can be allowed only when there is\n\ncompelling circumstances linked with &#x27;access&#x27;, which cannot be liberally\n\nused as cautioned by this Court in Dipanwita Roy.\n\n\n26.   The case of the Respondent-husband is that if a DNA test is allowed\n\nand the same reveals that he is not the biological father of Arjun, as a\n\ncorollary, it would be proved that the Appellant-wife committed adultery.\n\nWe do not find favour with the approach suggested by the Respondent-\n\nhusband to prove adultery, for the following reasons:\n\f i.    It is not in dispute that Master Arjun, the son stated to be born to\n\n       the Appellant-wife from the wedlock, was born in the year 2013.\n\n       DNA testing, cannot be used as a short cut to establish infidelity\n\n       that might have occurred over a decade ago or subsequently after\n\n       the birth of Master Arjun.\n\n ii.   In the circumstances of the present case, we are unable to accept\n\n       that a DNA test would be the only way in which the truth of the\n\n       matter   can    be   established.        The    respondent-husband     has\n\n       categorically   claimed   that      he     is   in   possession   of   call\n\n       recordings/transcripts and the daily diary of the appellant, which\n\n       may be summoned in accordance with law to prove the infidelity of\n\n       the appellant. Therefore, it seems to us that the respondent is in a\n\n       position to attempt to make out a case based on such evidence, as to\n\n       adultery/infidelity on the part of the appellant.\n\niii.   No plea has been raised by the respondent-husband herein as to\n\n       non-access in order to dislodge the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 112</a>\n\n       of the Evidence Act. Therefore, no prima-facie case has been made\n\n       out by the respondent which would justify a direction to conduct a\n\n       DNA test of Master Arjun.\n\niv.    No adverse inference can be raised in the instant case regarding the\n\n       legitimacy or paternity of Master Arjun vis-à-vis the appellant\n\n       herein, on her declining to subject Master Arjun to a paternity test.\n\n       Further, on the appellant declining to subject Master Arjun to a\n\f      paternity test, no adverse inference can be drawn as regards the\n\n      alleged adultery on the part of the appellant herein can be raised. In\n\n      our view, the allegation of adultery has to be proved by the\n\n      respondent herein de hors the issue of paternity of Master Arjun.\n\n27.   In the result, the present appeal is allowed. Consequently, the\n\nimpugned judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 22 nd\n\nNovember, 2021 and the order of the Family Court, Pune dated 12 th\n\nAugust, 2021, are set aside.\n\n      Bearing in mind the facts of the present case, the appeal is allowed\n\nwith cost of Rs.1 Lakh payable by the respondent to the appellant.

While I am entirely in agreement with the opinion well-\n\ncrafted     by    my   learned   sister   Hon’ble   Mrs.   Justice   B.V.\n\nNagarathna, I thought that two aspects of the matter require little\n\nmore emphasis. Hence a separate but concurring opinion.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_3\">2.       As we have seen from the narration of facts given by my\n\nlearned sister Hon’ble Mrs. Justice B.V. Nagarathna –\n\n        The marriage of the appellant with the respondent took\n         place on 23.11.2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">        The first child was born on 21.12.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">        The second child was born on 17.7.2013.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                             53</span><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n\n        The respondent-husband claims to have found out the\n         alleged adulterous conduct of the appellant, on 14.9.2016,\n         (3 years after the birth of the second child) when he\n         accidentally stumbled upon the Whatsapp messages in the\n         mobile phone of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">        Then the respondent privately had a DNA test conducted on\n         the second child, in November 2016, from DNA Labs India,\n         which is said to be an ISO 17025 certified, A2LA and NATA\n         accredited agency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">        The respondent then filed a petition for divorce on the\n         ground of adultery, in June 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">        During the pendency of the proceedings for divorce, the\n         respondent moved an application in November 2020 seeking\n         a direction to subject the second son to DNA testing at the\n         Government Central Forensic Laboratory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">3.       The Family Court allowed the application filed by the\n\nrespondent-husband and the High Court also affirmed the same,\n\nforcing the wife to come up with the above appeal, contending\n\nthat under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 1, birth\n\nduring marriage is conclusive proof of legitimacy and that no\n\nevidence to disprove the same can be allowed by the Court. This\n\nis especially so when the parties to the marriage admittedly had\n\n\n\n\n1For short, “<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_95\">Evidence Act</a>” or the “Act”, as the case may be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                   54</span>\n\n\naccess to each other during the time when the child could have\n\nbeen begotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">4.   The main contention of Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the respondent-husband is that the respondent is not\n\neven questioning the legitimacy of the child, but alleging adultery\n\nagainst the appellant-wife and that therefore, on the refusal of the\n\nwife to subject the child to DNA test, a presumption under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 114(h)</a> of the Evidence Act can be drawn against the\n\nappellant-wife. In other words, his contention is that what is\n\napplicable in the case on hand, is not <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 112</a> but <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_98\">Section\n\n114(h)</a> and that the Court need not subject the child to DNA test,\n\nif the appellant is not willing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">5.   In the light of the aforesaid contention, two aspects, in my\n\nopinion, require deeper analysis. They are (i) the interplay\n\nbetween <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_99\">Sections 112</a> and <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_100\">114(h)</a> of the Evidence Act; and (ii)\n\nwhose rights, are to tilt the balance in the scales of justice?\n\nInterplay between Sections 112 and 114(h) of the Evidence\nAct\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">6.   <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 4</a> of the Evidence Act defines the expressions “may\n\npresume”, “shall presume” and “conclusive proof”. <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 4</a>\n\nindicates the course of action to be followed by a Court, wherever\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    55</span>\n\n\nthe Act makes it (i) optional to presume a fact; (ii) mandatory to\n\npresume a fact; and (iii) obligatory for the Court to take one fact\n\nto be conclusive proof of another.         To put it in simple terms,\n\nwherever the Act uses the expression “may presume”, it is\n\noptional for the Court either to presume or not to presume. If a\n\nCourt refuses to presume the fact in question as proved, that is\n\nthe end of the matter. But when the Court agrees to presume\n\nsuch fact, it is up to the other party to lead evidence to rebut the\n\npresumption.        Wherever the Act uses the expression “shall\n\npresume”, the Court has no option but to presume the fact, till\n\nsuch time it is rebutted.

It is interesting to note that the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_119\">Evidence Act</a> does not\n\ninclude legitimacy of birth during marriage, either under the\n\ncategory of a fact which “may be presumed” or under the category\n\nof a fact which “shall be presumed”. On the contrary, the Act\n\nplaces birth during marriage as “conclusive proof” of legitimacy.\n\nBut <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 112</a> keeps a window open, enabling a party to the\n\nmarriage who questions the legitimacy of the child, to show that\n\nhe/she had no access to the other, when the child could have\n\nbeen begotten.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                 58</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">10. We have seen that under <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 4</a>, when one fact is\n\ndeclared by the Act to be conclusive proof, the Court shall, on\n\nproof of that one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall not\n\nallow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it. This is\n\nwhy <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 112</a> does not use the word “proved” or “disproved”.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 112</a> uses the words “unless it can be shown”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">11.

In other words, if a party to a\n\nmarriage establishes that there was no access to the other party\n\nto the marriage, then the shield of conclusive proof becomes\n\nunavailable. If on the contrary, such a party is not able to prove\n\nthat he had no access to the other party to the marriage, then\n\nthe shield of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 112</a> protects the other party to such an\n\nextent that it cannot be pierced by any amount of evidence in\n\nview of the prohibition contained in <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 4</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">12. In contrast, <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 114</a> on which heavy reliance is placed\n\nby Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel for the respondent,\n\ndeals only with facts which the Court “may presume”. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                     59</span>\n\n\nexistence of any fact which the Court may presume to have likely\n\nto have happened, turn on three things, namely, (i) common\n\ncourse of natural events; (ii) common course of human conduct;\n\nand (iii) common course of public and private business. Since\n\nnatural events, human conduct, etc. are not always consistent,\n\nthe presumption regarding the existence of any fact with regard to\n\nthese things, are placed only under the category of facts which\n\n“may be presumed”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">13. As pointed out earlier, wherever the Act uses the expression\n\n“may presume”, it is only optional and not mandatory for the\n\nCourt to presume the existence of such a fact. That it is only\n\noptional stands reinforced by, (i) the Illustrations under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_131\">Section\n\n114</a>; and (ii) the further exposition of those Illustrations. At this\n\nstage it may be useful to extract (i) <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 114</a>; (ii) the\n\nIllustrations under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 114</a>; and (iii) the exposition of those\n\nIllustrations, all of which read as follows:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        “114.

As may be seen from the exposition to the Illustrations, the\n\nCourt, while taking a decision to presume or not, the existence of\n\nany fact, should have regard to some additional facts, in\n\nconsidering whether such maxims do or do not apply to the\n\nparticular case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">15. It is relevant to note that there are nine Illustrations under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 114</a>, from (a) to (i). Immediately after those Illustrations,\n\nthe exposition of those Illustrations begins with the words: “But\n\nthe Court shall also have regard to such facts as the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                 62</span>\n\n\nfollowing, in considering whether such maxims do or do not\n\napply to the particular case before it”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">16. Let us take for instance, Illustration (h) under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 114</a>.\n\nIt says that if a man refuses to answer a question which he is not\n\ncompelled to answer by law, the Court may presume that the\n\nanswer, if given, would be unfavourable to him. But the\n\nexposition to Illustration (h) says that in considering the maxim\n\nunder (h), the Court shall have due regard as to whether the\n\nrefusal of the man to answer the question, is due to the fact that\n\nthe answer may cause loss to him in matters unconnected with\n\nthe matter in relation to which it is asked.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">17. In other words, while dealing with a situation where a\n\npresumption in terms of Illustration (h) under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 114</a> is\n\nsought to be raised, the Court has to examine whether the\n\nrefusal of the person to answer, is on account of the fear that the\n\nanswer may produce an unfavourable result to him in relation to\n\nthe matter in issue or due to the fear that such an answer might\n\ncause loss to him in a matter unconnected to it.\n\n18   Keeping in mind the above scheme of <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_137\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_138\">112</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_139\">114</a>, let us now test the main contention of Shri Kapil Sibal,\n\nlearned senior counsel for the respondent-husband that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   63</span>\n\n\nattempt of the respondent-husband is not so much to show that\n\nhe did not father the second child but is only to show that the\n\nappellant was living in adultery and that what comes into play in\n\nthis case is only <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 114</a> and not <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 112</a>. The learned\n\nsenior counsel submitted that the respondent-husband is even\n\nprepared to accept the second child as his own, irrespective of the\n\noutcome of the DNA test. According to the learned senior counsel\n\nfor the respondent, it is open to the appellant-wife not to subject\n\nthe child to DNA test, even if the Court orders the same, but if\n\nthe appellant chooses not to subject the child to DNA test, the\n\nCourt is obliged to draw an adverse inference in terms of <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_142\">Section\n\n114(h)</a>. According to the learned senior counsel, such adverse\n\ninference need not be about the paternity of the child but shall be\n\nonly about the adulterous conduct of the appellant-wife.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_12\">19. To drive home the point that such an adverse inference, not\n\nabout the paternity of the child, but about the adulterous\n\nconduct of the wife is permissible in law, learned senior counsel\n\nfor   the    respondent   placed   heavy   reliance   upon   last   two\n\nparagraphs of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_143\">Dipanwita Roy vs. Ronobroto\n\nRoy2</a>. These paragraphs read as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">2 (2015) 1 SCC 365\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                          64</span>\n\n\n“17. The question that has to be answered in this\ncase is in respect of the alleged infidelity of the\nappellant wife. The respondent husband has made\nclear and categorical assertions in the petition filed\nby him under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 13</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act,\nalleging infidelity. He has gone to the extent of\nnaming the person who was the father of the male\nchild born to the appellant wife. It is in the process\nof substantiating his allegation of infidelity that the\nrespondent husband had made an application before\nthe Family Court for conducting a DNA test which\nwould establish whether or not he had fathered the\nmale child born to the appellant wife. The\nrespondent feels that it is only possible for him to\nsubstantiate the allegations levelled by him (of the\nappellant wife&#x27;s infidelity) through a DNA test. We\nagree with him. In our view, but for the DNA test, it\nwould be impossible for the respondent husband to\nestablish and confirm the assertions made in the\npleadings. We are therefore satisfied that the\ndirection issued by the High Court, as has been\nextracted hereinabove, was fully justified. DNA\ntesting is the most legitimate and scientifically\nperfect means, which the husband could use, to\nestablish his assertion of infidelity. This should\nsimultaneously be taken as the most authentic,\nrightful and correct means also with the wife, for her\nto rebut the assertions made by the respondent\nhusband, and to establish that she had not been\nunfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If the appellant\nwife is right, she shall be proved to be so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_14\">18. We would, however, while upholding the order\npassed by the High Court, consider it just and\nappropriate to record a caveat, giving the appellant\nwife liberty to comply with or disregard the order\npassed by the High Court, requiring the holding of\nthe DNA test. In case, she accepts the direction\nissued by the High Court, the DNA test will\ndetermine conclusively the veracity of accusation\nlevelled by the respondent husband against her. In\ncase, she declines to comply with the direction\nissued by the High Court, the allegation would be\ndetermined by the court concerned by drawing a\npresumption of the nature contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_145\">Section\n114</a> of the Evidence Act, especially, in terms of\nIllustration (h) thereof. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 114</a> as also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                       65</span>\n\n\n             Illustration (h<a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_147\">)<a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_148\">, <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_149\">referred to above</a></a></a>, are being extracted\n             hereunder:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                    “114.Court may presume existence of\n                 certain facts.—The court may presume the\n                 existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have\n                 happened, regard being had to the common\n                 course of natural events, human conduct and\n                 public and private business, in their relation to\n                 the facts of the particular case.”\n                    “Illustration (h)—that if a man refuses to\n                 answer a question which he is not compelled to\n                 answer by law, the answer, if given, would be\n                 unfavourable to him;”\n             This course has been adopted to preserve the right\n             of individual privacy to the extent possible.

If despite an order passed by the court, a\n             person refuses to submit himself to such medical\n             examination, a strong case for drawing an adverse\n             inference would be made out. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 114</a> of the\n             Indian Evidence Act also enables a court to draw an\n             adverse inference if the party does not produce the\n             relevant evidences in his power and possession.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">21. But we do not know how a mix up of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 112</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 114</a> is possible. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 112</a> deals with something where\n\nthe existence of a fact is taken to be conclusive proof, without any\n\npossibility for the disputing party to lead evidence for disproving\n\n3 (2003) 4 SCC 493\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                 66</span>\n\n\nthe same. The only escape route or emergency exit as we may\n\ncall it, available for a person to deprive another person of the\n\nbenefit of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 112</a>, is to show that the parties to the marriage\n\ndid not have access to each other at the time when the child\n\ncould have been begotten. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 114</a> has nothing to do with,\n\nnor is in connection with conclusive proof of legitimacy dealt with\n\nby <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 112</a>.    Both <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 112</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 114</a> fall under\n\ndifferent compartments. The word “presumption” itself is not used\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 112</a>. The expression used in <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 112</a> is “conclusive\n\nproof”. Therefore, by virtue of Section 4, no evidence shall be\n\nallowed to be given for the purpose of disproving it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">22. As we have indicated elsewhere, if one of the parties to the\n\nmarriage shows that he had no access to the other at the time\n\nwhen the child could have been begotten, then <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 112</a> itself\n\ndoes not get attracted. On the contrary, if the parties have had\n\naccess to each other at the relevant point of time, the fate of the\n\nquestion relating to legitimacy is sealed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">23. We are not suggesting for a moment that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 112</a> acts\n\nas a shield even for the alleged adulterous conduct on the part of\n\nthe wife. All that we say is that anything that would destroy the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                     67</span>\n\n\nlegal effect of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 112</a> cannot be used by the respondent, on\n\nthe ground that the same is being done to achieve another result.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">24. In the case on hand, the very pleading of the respondent in\n\nhis petition for divorce before the Family Court is that the second\n\nchild-Master Arjun was born on 17.7.2013 and that the\n\nrespondent came to know about the alleged adulterous behavior\n\nof the appellant herein, only on 14.9.2016. In paragraph 23 of his\n\npetition for divorce, the respondent pleaded as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">             “23. The Petitioner states that he has not condoned\n             the adultery and the cruel behavior of Respondent\n             No.1. The Petitioner has had no physical relations\n             with Respondent No.1 after discovering her\n             adulterous act. The Petitioner states that though\n             the Petitioner and the respondent no.1 are living\n             under the same roof, the Petitioner and Respondent\n             no.1 have not shared the bedroom and have had no\n             physical relations since the day the Petitioner\n             discovered the adultery of Respondent No.1.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">25. The pleading of the respondent extracted above to the effect\n\nthat after September 2016, he has had no physical relationship\n\nwith the appellant-wife means that he has at least had access to\n\nthe wife both at the time when the child was begotten and for a\n\nfull period of three years even thereafter. Therefore, the\n\nconclusive proof under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 112</a> has actually come into play in\n\nthis case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">26. There is another fallacy in the argument of the respondent.\n\nIt is the contention of the respondent that he is seeking an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                 68</span>\n\n\nadverse inference to be drawn only as against the wife under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 114(h)</a>, upon the refusal of the wife to subject the child to\n\nDNA test. But the stage at which the wife may refuse to subject\n\nthe child to DNA, would arise only after the Court comes to the\n\nconclusion that a DNA test should be ordered. To put in simple\n\nterms, there are three stages in the process, namely, (i)\n\nconsideration by the Court, of the question whether to order DNA\n\ntest or not; (ii) passing an order directing DNA test, after such\n\nconsideration; and (iii) the decision of the wife to comply or not,\n\nwith the order so passed. The respondent should first cross the\n\nouter fence namely whether a DNA test can be ordered or not. It\n\nis only after he convinces the Court to order DNA test and\n\nsuccessfully secures an order that he can move to the inner\n\nfence, regarding the willingness of the wife to abide by the order.\n\nIt is only at that stage that the respondent can, if at all, seek\n\nrefuge under <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 114(h)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">27. But today, we are actually at the outer fence in this case,\n\nadjudicating as to whether DNA test can be ordered at all.\n\nTherefore, the respondent cannot jump to the inner fence by-\n\npassing the outer fence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                69</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">28. Coming to the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 114(h)</a>, the\n\ncontention of the respondent is obviously misplaced. An adverse\n\ninference, in law, can be drawn only against the person who\n\nrefuses to answer a question. In the case on hand, the appellant\n\nhas a dual role to play, namely, that of the respondent’s wife and\n\nthat of Master Arjun’s mother. If the appellant does or refuses to\n\ndo something, for the purpose of deriving a benefit to herself, an\n\nadverse inference can be drawn against her. But in her capacity\n\nas a mother and natural guardian if the appellant refuses to\n\nsubject the child to DNA test for the protection of the interests\n\nand welfare of the child, no adverse inference of adultery can be\n\ndrawn against her. By refusing to subject the child to DNA test,\n\nshe is actually protecting the best interests of the child.   For\n\nprotecting the best interests of the child, the appellant-wife may\n\nbe rewarded, but not punished with an adverse inference. By\n\ntaking recourse to <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 114(h)</a>, the respondent cannot throw\n\nthe appellant to a catch-22 situation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">29. Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 114(h)</a> has no application to a case where\n\na mother refuses to make the child undergo DNA test. It is to be\n\nremembered that the object of conducting a DNA test on the child\n\nis primarily to show that the respondent was not the biological\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                 70</span>\n\n\nfather. Once that fact is established, it merely follows as a\n\ncorollary that the appellant was living in an adulterous\n\nrelationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">30. What comes out of a DNA test, as the main product, is the\n\npaternity of the child, which is subjected to a test. Incidentally,\n\nthe adulterous conduct of the wife also stands established, as a\n\nby-product, through the very same process. To say that the wife\n\nshould allow the child to undergo the DNA test, to enable the\n\nhusband to have the benefit of both the product and the by-\n\nproduct or in the alternative the wife should allow the husband to\n\nhave the benefit of the by-product by invoking <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 114</a>, if she\n\nchooses not to subject the child to DNA test, is really to leave the\n\nchoice between the devil and the deep sea to the wife.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">31. In fact, in cases of this nature the Court must bear in mind\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 114</a> uses only the word “may” and not the word\n\n“shall”. Therefore, the constraints articulated in the exposition to\n\nIllustration (h) under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 114</a> may dissuade the Court not to\n\npresume at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">32. Hence, we reject the contention of the respondent that what\n\nis sought to be invoked is only <a href=\"/doc/583333/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 114(h)</a> and not Section\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">112.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                    71</span>\n\n\n\n\nWhose rights, are to tilt the balance in the scales of justice?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">33. As rightly contended by Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the appellant, the question as to whether a DNA test\n\nshould be permitted on the child, is to be analysed through the\n\nprism of the child and not through the prism of the parents. The\n\nchild cannot be used as a pawn to show that the mother of the\n\nchild was living in adultery. It is always open to the respondent-\n\nhusband to prove by other evidence, the adulterous conduct of\n\nthe wife, but the child’s right to identity should not be allowed to\n\nbe sacrificed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86964673\" id=\"span_23\">34. It is contended by Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe respondent that after all the endeavour of every Court should\n\nbe to find the truth and that every party to a litigation is entitled\n\nto produce the best evidence. Enabling the party to produce the\n\nbest of evidence, is part and parcel of right to fair trial. Therefore,\n\nit is contended by learned senior counsel that the refusal to\n\nsubject   the    child   to   DNA   test   would   infringe   upon   the\n\nrespondent’s right to fair trial. To buttress the contention that the\n\nright to privacy of an individual must yield to the right to fair trial\n\nof another, reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                  72</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86964673/\" id=\"a_176\">Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited &amp; Ors. vs.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India &amp; Anr.4</a>.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">35. Attractive as it may seem at first blush, the said argument\n\ndoes not carry any legal weight. The lis in these cases is between\n\nthe parties to a marriage. The lis is not between one of the parties\n\nto the marriage and the child whose paternity is questioned. To\n\nenable one of the parties to the marriage to have the benefit of\n\nfair trial, the Court cannot sacrifice the rights and best interests\n\nof a third party to the lis, namely, the child.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">36. Therefore, I concur wholeheartedly with my learned sister\n\nthat the Family Court as well as the High Court were wrong in\n\nallowing the application of the respondent for subjecting the child\n\nto DNA test. Therefore, the appeal deserves to be allowed and\n\naccordingly it is allowed. However, this shall not preclude the\n\nrespondent-husband from leading any other evidence to establish\n\nthe allegations made by him against the appellant in the petition\n\nfor divorce.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">                                            …………………………….J.\n                                             (V.
