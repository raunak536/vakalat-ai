This necessity of\n                             Aadhaar has arisen in order to ensure that such\n                             benefits are given to only genuine beneficiaries. <a href=\"/doc/193125601/\" id=\"a_26\">The\n                             Act</a> aims at efficient, transparent and targeted\n                             delivery of subsidies, benefits and services.

Intensity of review depends upon the particular\n                             context of question in a given case. There is yet\n                             another significant angle in these matters, which has\n                             to be emphasised at this stage viz. dignity in the form\n                             of autonomy (informational privacy) and dignity in\n                             the form of assuring better living standards, of the\n                             same individual. In the instant case, a holistic view of\n                             the matter, having regard to the detailed discussion\n                             hereinabove, would amply demonstrate that\n                             enrolment in Aadhaar of the unprivileged and\n                             marginalised section of the society, in order to avail\n                             the fruits of welfare schemes of the Government,\n                             actually amounts to empowering these persons. On\n                             the one hand, it gives such individuals their unique\n                             identity and, on the other hand, it also enables such\n                             individuals to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of\n                             the Government which are floated as socio-economic\n                             welfare measures to uplift such classes. In that sense,\n                             the scheme ensures dignity to such individuals. This\n                             facet of dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be\n                             acknowledged. We are, by no means, accepting that\n                             when dignity in the form of economic welfare is given,\n                             the State is entitled to rob that person of his liberty.\n                             That can never be allowed.

The\n                                          Aadhaar Scheme is backed by the statute i.e. the\n                                          Aadhaar Act. It also serves legitimate State aim,\n                                          which can be discerned from the Introduction to the\n                                          Act as well as the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n                                          which reflect that the aim in passing the Act was to\n                                          ensure that social benefit schemes reach the\n                                          deserving community.

It may be highlighted that the petitioners are\n                             making their claim on the basis of dignity as a facet of\n                             right to privacy. On the other hand, Section 7 of the\n                             Aadhaar Act is aimed at offering subsidies, benefits\n                             or services to the marginalised section of the society\n                             for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated\n                             from time to time. That also becomes an aspect of\n                             social justice, which is the obligation of the State\n                             stipulated in Part IV of the Constitution. The\n                             rationale behind <a href=\"/doc/114646628/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 7</a> lies in ensuring targeted\n                             delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are\n                             funded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In\n                             discharge of its solemn constitutional obligation to\n                             enliven the fundamental rights of life and personal\n                             liberty (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a>) to ensure justice, social, political\n                             and economic and to eliminate inequality (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 14</a>)\n                             with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the\n                             Dalits, the Central Government has launched several\n                             welfare schemes. Some such schemes are PDS,\n                             scholarships, mid-day meals, LPG subsidies, etc.\n                             These schemes involve 3% of the GDP and involve a\n                             huge amount of public money. Right to receive these\n                             benefits, from the point of view of those who deserve\n                             the same, has now attained the status of fundamental\n                             right based on the same concept of human dignity,\n                             which the petitioners seek to bank upon. The\n                             Constitution does not exist for a few or minority of the\n                             people of India, but &quot;We, the People&quot;. The goals set\n                             out in the Preamble of the Constitution do not\n                             contemplate statism and do not seek to preserve\n                             justice, liberty, equality and fraternity for those who\n                             have the means and opportunity to ensure the\n                             exercise of inalienable rights for themselves. These\n                             goals are predominantly or at least equally geared to\n                             &quot;secure to all its citizens&quot;, especially, to the\n                             downtrodden, poor and exploited, justice, liberty,\n                             equality and &quot;to promote&quot; fraternity assuring dignity.\n                             Interestingly, the State has come forward in\n                             recognising the rights of deprived section of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signing Date:07.04.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">12:54:57</span>\n                              society to receive such benefits on the premise that it\n                             is their fundamental right to claim such benefits. It is\n                             acknowledged by the respondents that there is a\n                             paradigm shift in addressing the problem of security\n                             and eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. The\n                             shift is from the welfare approach to a right-based\n                             approach. As a consequence, right of everyone to\n                             adequate food no more remains based on directive\n                             principles of State policy (<a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 47</a>), though the said\n                             principles remain a source of inspiration. This\n                             entitlement has turned into a constitutional\n                             fundamental right. This constitutional obligation is\n                             reinforced by obligations under International\n                             Convention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">                             xxxx\n\n                             511.9.2. There needs to be balancing of two\n                             competing fundamental rights, right to privacy on the\n                             one hand and right to food, shelter and employment\n                             on the other hand. Axiomatically both the rights are\n                             founded on human dignity. At the same time, in the\n                             given context, two facets are in conflict with each\n                             other. The question here would be, when a person\n                             seeks to get the benefits of welfare schemes to which\n                             she is entitled to as a part of right to live life with\n                             dignity, whether her sacrifice to the right to privacy,\n                             is so invasive that it creates imbalance?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">                             511.10. In the process, sanctity of privacy in its\n                             functional relationship with dignity is kept in mind\n                             where it says that legitimate expectation of privacy\n                             may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and\n                             from the private to public arena. Reasonable\n                             expectation of privacy is also taken into\n                             consideration. The Court finds that as the information\n                             collected at the time of enrolment as well as\n                             authentication is minimal, balancing at the first level\n                             is met. Insofar as second level, namely, balancing of\n                             two competing fundamental rights is concerned,\n                             namely, dignity in the form of autonomy\n                             (informational privacy) and dignity in the form of\n                             assuring better living standards of the same\n                             individual, the Court has arrived at the conclusion\n                             that balancing at the second level is also met. The\n                             detailed discussion in this behalf amply demonstrates\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Signing Date:07.04.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">12:54:57</span>\n                              that enrolment in Aadhaar of the unprivileged and\n                             marginalised section of the society, in order to avail\n                             the fruits of welfare schemes of the Government,\n                             actually amounts to empowering these persons. On\n                             the one hand, it gives such individuals their unique\n                             identity and, on the other hand, it also enables such\n                             individuals to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of\n                             the Government which are floated as socio-economic\n                             welfare measures to uplift such classes. In that sense,\n                             the scheme ensures dignity to such individuals. This\n                             facet of dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be\n                             acknowledged. We are, by no means, accepting that\n                             when dignity in the form of economic welfare is given,\n                             the State is entitled to rob that person of his liberty.\n                             That can never be allowed. We are concerned with\n                             the balancing of the two facets of dignity. Here we\n                             find that the inroads into the privacy rights where\n                             these individuals are made to part with their\n                             biometric information, is minimal. It is coupled with\n                             the fact that there is no data collection on the\n                             movements of such individuals, when they avail\n                             benefits under <a href=\"/doc/114646628/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 7</a> of the Act thereby ruling out\n                             the possibility of creating their profiles. In fact, this\n                             technology becomes a vital tool of ensuring good\n                             governance in a social welfare State. We, therefore,\n                             are of the opinion that the Aadhaar Act meets the test\n                             of balancing as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                             xxxx\n\n                             511.12. The entire aim behind launching this\n                             programme is the &quot;inclusion&quot; of the deserving\n                             persons who need to get such benefits. When it is\n                             serving much larger purpose by reaching hundreds of\n                             millions of deserving persons, it cannot be crucified\n                             on the unproven plea of exclusion of some. It is\n                             clarified that the Court is not trivialising the problem\n                             of exclusion if it is there. However, what we are\n                             emphasising is that remedy is to plug the loopholes\n                             rather than axe a project, aimed for the welfare of\n                             large section of the society. Obviously, in order to\n                             address the failures of authentication, the remedy is\n                             to adopt alternate methods for identifying such\n                             persons, after finding the causes of failure in their\n                             cases. We have chosen this path which leads to better\n                             equilibrium and have given necessary directions also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">Signing Date:07.04.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">12:54:57</span>\n                                          in this behalf viz:&quot;\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_74\">10.      A reading of the above judgment would clearly show that the\n                    submissions made by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner cannot be\n                    accepted. The above judgement in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_34\">K.S. Puttaswamy</a> (supra) has considered\n                    in detail the requirement of Aadhaar authentication under the NFSA. The\n                    Supreme Court has held that Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is aimed at\n                    offering subsidies, benefits or services to the marginalised sections of the\n                    society for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated from time to\n                    time. That also becomes an aspect of social justice, which is the obligation\n                    of the State stipulated in Part IV of the Constitution of India. It has held that\n                    the rationale behind Section 7 of the Aadhar Act lies in ensuring targeted\n                    delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are funded from the\n                    Consolidated Fund of India. In discharge of its solemn constitutional\n                    obligation to enliven the fundamental rights of life and personal liberty\n                    (<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a>) to ensure justice, social, political and economic and to eliminate\n                    inequality (<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 14</a>) with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the\n                    Dalits, the Central Government has launched several welfare schemes. Some\n                    such schemes are the Public Distribution System, scholarships, mid-day\n                    meals, LPG subsidies, etc. The right to receive these benefits, from the point\n                    of view of those who deserve the same, has now attained the status of a\n                    fundamental right based on the same concept of human dignity. The\n                    Supreme Court further took specific note of the NFSA and <a href=\"/doc/2013030/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 12</a>,\n                    which in sub-section (c) thereof, requires the Central and State Governments\n                    to endeavour to progressively undertake necessary reforms in the Targeted\n                    Public Distribution System, including leveraging Aadhaar for unique\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">Signing Date:07.04.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">12:54:57</span>\n                     identification, with biometric information of entitled beneficiaries for proper\n                    targeting of benefits under the NFSA. The Supreme Court held that by\n                    providing that the benefits for various welfare schemes shall be given to\n                    those who possess an Aadhaar number and after undergoing the\n                    authentication as provided in Section 8 of the Aadhaar Act, the purpose is to\n                    ensure that only rightful persons receive these benefits. The Supreme Court\n                    therefore, upheld the insistence on Aadhar for availing benefits under the\n                    NFSA.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                    11.      The submission of Mr. Parikh that the disbursement of subsidized\n                    foodgrains to the beneficiaries under the NFSA is not a „dole‟, since the\n                    same has been elevated to a statutory right under the NFSA, in recognition\n                    of the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, has no merit.\n                    As a welfare State, the Parliament has enacted the NFSA to fulfil the\n                    requirement of food of the targeted beneficiaries at subsidized rates.\n                    Therefore, even though a statutory right has been created in favour of the\n                    targeted beneficiaries to receive rations/food articles under the NFSA, such\n                    benefits do not lose their character of being welfare measures undertaken by\n                    the State for the needy and downtrodden.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                    12.
