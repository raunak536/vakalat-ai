This Court spoke through\n\n    separate but concurrent judgments.                        Apart from the\n\n    lead judgment of Hon’ble Mr. Justice Dipak Misra,\n\n    former Chief Justice of this Court, and with whom,\n\n    Hon’ble Mr. Justice A. M. Khanwilkar concurred, the\n\n    other        learned       Judges     wrote        separate      opinions.\n\n    However,       they     agreed       that    <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_49\">Section       497</a>       IPC   and\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/854390/\" id=\"a_50\">Section       198</a>    Cr.P.C.       were     unconstitutional.              The\n\n    premise on which the provision was struck down was\n\n    that    it     offended      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_51\">Articles       14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_52\">,    15</a>    and    <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">21</a>    of   the\n\n    Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">            In    this     case,     this     Court     had    no    occasion,\n\n    whatsoever, to consider the effect of the provisions\n\n    of the Acts in question.                    In fact, we may notice\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                                     16</span>\n\fMA No. 2204/2020 in W.P.(Crl.)

This Court has found that adultery may be\n\n    a      moral    wrong       (per    Hon’ble        Ms.     Justice     Indu\n\n    Malhotra).           This Court has also held that it will\n\n    continue to be a ground for securing dissolution of\n\n    marriage.        It has also been described as a civil\n\n    wrong.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"42184625\" id=\"span_26\">(24)      In view of the fact that the scheme of the Acts\n\n      in the context, in particular, of <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 33</a> of the\n\n      Constitution did not fall for the consideration of\n\n      this Court, we must necessarily observe and clarify\n\n      that the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/42184625/\" id=\"a_55\">Joseph Shine v.\n\n      Union    of    India</a>      (2019)      3    SCC   39    was     not   at    all\n\n      concerned       with      the    effect      and      operation      of    the\n\n      relevant      provisions         in   the    Acts      which    have       been\n\n      placed before us by the applicant.
