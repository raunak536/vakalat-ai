Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiff invites the\n                         attention of the Court to the judgment dated 15.10.2019 passed by the\n                         learned Metropolitan Magistrate, 66th Court, Andheri, Mumbai, to contend\n                         that the plaintiff was acquitted after full dressed trial on the ground that the\n                         prosecution failed to prove the guilt of plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                         16.

Even after the acquittal of the plaintiff, the said posts were not\n                         removed thus, the plaintiff served legal notice dated 03.05.2024 to the\n                         various media houses. Some of the media houses as mentioned in para 17 of\n                         the plaint, who had published / circulated the news, removed the offending\n                         contents from their respective platforms after receipt of notice. However, the\n                         defendant nos. 1 to 4 have not deleted the defamatory news/articles against\n                         the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">                         18.

Elaborating on his submissions, the learned counsel for the plaintiff\n                         invites the attention of the Court to Document No. 2 annexed with the plaint,\n                         which is an updated post published by defendant no.1 on 28.05.2024,\n                         updating its previous post of 27.06.2018. Besides giving the update of\n                         plaintiff&#x27;s acquittal, the updated post also says - &quot;The original story\n                         follows&quot; and then original post has been extracted containing allegations\n                         which are defamatory per se and in respect of which an order of acquittal\n                         has already been recorded in the year 2019. Thus, the contents of original\n                         posts are still available to the public at large for reading.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">                         20.   Attention of the Court was also drawn to a similar update published\n                         by defendant no.2 on 07.05.2024 in respect of its original post dated\n                         27.06.2018 and the said original post containing contents that are\n                         defamatory per se is also available as a trail to the updated post.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">                         21.

Apart from the posts published by defendants nos. 1 to 4, attention of\n                         the Court is also invited to various posts dated 06.03.2024, 07.03.2024,\n                         21.03.2024 and 23.03.2024,on the defendant no.5&#x27;s platform i.e., &#x27;X&#x27;,\n                         wherein, some unknown persons have castigated the plaintiff and have\n                         called for awarding punishment to him notwithstanding plaintiff&#x27;s acquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">                         23.   He submits that the plaintiff is an established businessman, with a\n                         family comprising of a daughter aged about 23 years and a son aged about\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">ARUNA KANWAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">29.07.2024               CS(OS) 560/2024                                                   Page 4 of 14</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">20:10:29</span>\n                          21 years, who are of marriageable age. The disparaging and defamatory\n                         contents of the posts referred to above have caused serious damage and\n                         injury to the reputation and image of the plaintiff in the corporate world as\n                         well as amongst his relatives, friends and family members. It is thus, urged\n                         that necessary directions be given to the defendants to remove the impugned\n                         libelous posts / news articles from their respective websites as well as from\n                         &#x27;X&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"181278128\" id=\"span_17\">24.    The learned counsel for the plaintiff has relied upon the decisions of -\n                         the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in - K.S.

Having heard the learned counsel for the plaintiff, at the outset it is to\n                         be noted that the acquittal of the plaintiff is not in dispute. The posts have\n                         though been updated by the defendant nos. 1, 2 and 4 to state that the\n                         plaintiff has been acquitted, however, the fact remains that the updated posts\n                         still have the trail of original posts containing allegations against the plaintiff\n                         which are disparaging, defamatory and libelous and portrays the plaintiff in\n                         bad light.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                         26.    Therefore, the question which confronts this Court at this stage is\n                         whether any direction to the defendants is warranted to remove the posts /\n                         articles containing libelous and defamatory contents against the plaintiff in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">ARUNA KANWAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">29.07.2024               CS(OS) 560/2024                                                    Page 5 of 14</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">20:10:29</span>\n                          respect of a criminal case in which the plaintiff has secured honourable\n                         acquittal, which has attained finality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                         27.

Incidentally, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.)\n                         (supra) observed that the right of an individual to exercise control over his\n                         personal data encompass his right to control his existence on the internet, but\n                         the same is not an absolute right. The existence of such a right does not\n                         imply that a criminal can obliterate his past. The right to privacy has to be\n                         balanced against other fundamental rights like the freedom of expression, or\n                         freedom of media etc. The relevant part of <a href=\"/doc/181278128/\" id=\"a_25\">the said decision</a> reads as under:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                                   629. The right of an individual to exercise control over his\n                                   personal data and to be able to control his/her own life would also\n                                   encompass his right to control his existence on the internet.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                                   Needless to say that this would not be an absolute right. The\n                                   existence of such a right does not imply that a criminal can\n                                   obliterate his past, but that there are variant degrees of mistakes,\n                                   small and big, and it cannot be said that a person should be\n                                   profiled to the nth extent for all and sundry to know.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">ARUNA KANWAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">29.07.2024               CS(OS) 560/2024                                                 Page 11 of 14</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">20:10:29</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">                                    Xxxx                           xxxx                              xxxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                                   635. Whereas this right to control dissemination of personal\n                                   information in the physical and virtual space should not amount to\n                                   a right of total eraser of history, this right, as a part of the larger\n                                   right to privacy, has to be balanced against other fundamental\n                                   rights like the freedom of expression, or freedom of media,\n                                   fundamental to a democratic society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                         34.   Thus, Courts will have to balance the competing rights in the facts\n                         and circumstances of each case. This Court is prima facie of the view right\n                         to freedom of expression of the press in the present case must give way to\n                         the right to privacy of the plaintiff especially when he has been exonerated\n                         of all the allegations leading to his honourable acquittal. Apart from the\n                         existence of old news articles / posts on the internet, the plaintiff&#x27;s\n                         reputation has been injured on account of updation of such posts which has\n                         again brought plaintiff&#x27;s accusation under public glare. Further, the posts\n                         made by unknown persons on the defendant no.5&#x27;s / &#x27;X&#x27; platform have also\n                         equally injured the reputation of the plaintiff. Therefore, it appears to be a fit\n                         case to invoke the right to be forgotten in favour of the plaintiff. The balance\n                         of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff. I am also satisfied that\n                         grave and irreparable damages will be caused to the plaintiff, if ad interim\n                         injunctive orders are not passed in his favour. Accordingly, it would be\n                         appropriate to grant ad-interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff and\n                         against the defendant nos. 1 to 4 as well as unknown persons (John Doe)\n                         who have made per se defamatory statements against the plaintiff on &#x27;X&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">                         35.
