The facts of PIL No.241 of 2015 are being dealt with\n\nfor deciding the controversy which is common in all these\n\ncases. It has been filed by one Vattsala Vidyasagar, who is\n\nclaiming himself to be a social worker. It has been stated in\n\nthe PIL that a Fashion Show took place in &#x27;The Park&#x27; hotel in\n\nHyderabad on 18.06.2015 and the respondent No.2, Smt\n\nSmita Sabharwal, IAS., along with her husband made\n\nappearance on the ramp. The Fashion Show was conducted\n\nby Designer Abhishek Dutta. It has been further stated that\n\nthe Outlook English Weekly Magazine in its 6th Edition July,\n\n2015 published an article under the name and style &#x27;NO\n\nBORING BABU&#x27; and certain comments were made in respect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                               2</span>\n\n\n\n\nof an IAS Officer and also the Chief Minister of the State of\n\nTelangana.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The respondent No.2 issued a notice to the Outlook\n\nMagazine for publishing the article and finally a letter was\n\nsubmitted to the State Government on 29.07.2015 stating\n\nthat she intends to file a suit for defamation claiming Rs.10\n\ncrores against the management of Outlook Magazine for\n\npublishing the article and therefore, she needs an amount\n\nof Rs.9,75,000/- (Rupees nine lakh and seventy five\n\nthousand only) for payment of court fee.

The petitioner&#x27;s contention is that the article was\n\npublished by the Outlook Weekly Magazine in respect of a\n\nprivate function and it was not an official function and in\n\ncase, the respondent No.2 was aggrieved in the matter, it\n\nwas her private affair and by no stretch of imagination, the\n\nState Government could not have sanctioned Rs.15.00\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           3</span>\n\n\n\n\nlakhs for filing a suit in respect of defamation. The\n\npetitioner has also stated that the husband of the\n\nrespondent No.2 is an IPS Officer, they are having sufficient\n\nfunds to pay the court fees and the State exchequer cannot\n\nbe burdened in the manner and method it has been done by\n\nissuing the G.O., dated 20.08.2015. The petitioner has\n\nprayed for the following relief:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;It is therefore prayed that this Hon&#x27;ble Court may\n      be   pleased   to     issue    an       order   or   direction   more\n      particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus\n      declaring      that      the        G.O.Rt.No.2296,          General\n      Administration (SC.A) Department, dated 20.08.2015\n      issued by the 1st respondent sanctioning an amount of\n      Rs.15.00 lakhs to the 2nd respondent towards legal\n      expenses to fight out her private litigation is highly\n      arbitrary, bad and illegal and pass such other order or\n      orders as deem fit and proper&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">5.

The respondent No.1 has reproduced the\n\nextract of the article in the counter affidavit. It has been\n\nstated that the article published in the Outlook Magazine is\n\ndefamatory and it was published to ruin the reputation of\n\nthe respondent No.2, a woman IAS Officer as well as the\n\nChief Minister of the State of Telangana. It was published to\n\ncreate a misleading impression against the Government&#x27;s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nfunctioning      and   therefore,       the     IAS   Officer    made    a\n\nrepresentation on 03.07.2015 to the Government for grant\n\nof   financial   assistance    to       the    respondent       No.2   and\n\naccordingly,     the   G.O.,   dated          20.08.2015    was    issued\n\ngranting financial assistance to the respondent No.2. The\n\nrespondent No.1 has further stated that earlier also, several\n\nIAS Officers were granted financial assistance by issuing\n\nG.O.Rt.No.719, dated 19.02.2014 and the G.O., under\n\nchallenge is neither arbitrary nor illegal or mala fide in\n\nnature or has been issued by abusing the power. In fact, it\n\nhas been issued in public interest as well as in protecting\n\nand safeguarding the IAS Officer, who is working with the\n\nGovernment. A prayer has been made for dismissal of the\n\nPILs as well as the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">7.

She used to be\n     posted in a district earlier. But things changed all of a\n     sudden after the elections. The lady is present at every\n     meeting and seen in almost every official photograph sent\n     out by the CMO. But what she does exactly is a puzzle.\n     She makes a fashion statement, with her lovely saris and\n     serves as &quot;eye candy&quot; at meetings, admit leading party\n     politicians. In fact, it&#x27;s this bureaucrat who calls up other\n     officials in the CMO and asks them to come for meetings.\n     She knows exactly what time the CM will arrive and leave\n     the office. The lovely lady, known for her ethnic style,\n     recently stunned all by appearing in a trendy trouser and\n     frilly top at a fashion show.

However, the matter of expenditure for a\n&quot;public     purpose&quot;   is   subject    to    fulfilment   of   the\nconstitutional requirements.

A specific or special law need not be\nenacted by Parliament to resort to the provision. Thus,\nthe MPLAD Scheme is valid as Appropriation Acts have\nbeen duly passed year after year.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">   (5) Indian Constitution does not recognise strict\nseparation of powers. The constitutional principle of\nseparation of powers will only be violated if an essential\nfunction of one branch is taken over by another branch,\nleading to a removal of checks and balances.\n   (6) Even though MPs have been given a seemingly\nexecutive     function,      their    role     is   limited     to\n&quot;recommending&quot; works and actual implementation is\ndone by the local authorities. There is no removal of\nchecks and balances since these are duly provided and\nhave to be strictly adhered to by the Guidelines of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                     13</span>\n\n\n\n\n      Scheme and Parliament.

In\n     succinct, the Government cannot act in a manner, which\n     would benefit a private party at the cost of the State;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   16</span>\n\n\n\n\n      such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary\n      to public interest.

In other cases, the State Governments\n      may agree to provide legal expenses but subject to the\n      condition that in case is lost, the officer has to bear the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                    18</span>\n\n\n\n\n      entire cost of litigation.

In the aforesaid case, one Shankar @\n\nGauri Shankar @ Auto Shankar was charged and tried for\n\nas many as six murders.

The Inspector General of Prisons\n\nwrote a letter dated 15.06.1994 to the magazine requesting\n\nit to stop publishing the serial forthwith and in those\n\ncircumstances, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid\n\ncase, in paragraph 26 has held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">              &quot;26. We may now summarise the broad principles\n          flowing from the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life\n          and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by\n          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a\n          right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family,\n          marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and\n          education among other matters. None can publish\n          anything concerning the above matters without his\n          consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and whether\n          laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">3</span>\n    (1994) 6 SCC 632\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                20</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe right to privacy of the person concerned and would be\nliable in an action for damages. Position may, however,\nbe different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\ncontroversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that\nany     publication   concerning    the   aforesaid   aspects\nbecomes unobjectionable if such publication is based\nupon public records including court records. This is for\nthe reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public\nrecord, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it\nbecomes a legitimate subject for comment by press and\nmedia among others. We are, however, of the opinion that\nin the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception\nmust be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the\nvictim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like\noffence should not further be subjected to the indignity of\nher     name    and   the   incident   being   publicised   in\npress/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\nabove -- indeed, this is not an exception but an\nindependent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\nobvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of\naction for damages is simply not available with respect to\ntheir acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\nofficial duties. This is so even where the publication is\nbased upon facts and statements which are not true,\nunless the official establishes that the publication was\nmade (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant\n(member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\nafter a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not\nnecessary for him to prove that what he has written is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                   21</span>\n\n\n\n\n      true. Of course, where the publication is proved to be\n      false and actuated by malice or personal animosity, the\n      defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n      damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not\n      relevant to the discharge of his duties, the public official\n      enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as\n      explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that\n      judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for\n      contempt of court and Parliament and legislatures\n      protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_21\">104</a>\n      respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n      exceptions to this rule.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">         (4) So far as the Government, local authority and\n      other organs and institutions exercising governmental\n      power are concerned, they cannot maintain a suit for\n      damages for defaming them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">         (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_22\">Official\n      Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or any similar enactment or provision\n      having the force of law does not bind the press or media.\n         (6) There is no law empowering the State or its\n      officials to prohibit, or to impose a prior restraint upon\n      the press/media.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">25.   The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case has\n\nfinally held that the petitioners therein have right to publish\n\nthe life story/autobiography of Shankar @ Gauri Shankar @\n\nAuto Shankar and the State or its officials cannot prevent or\n\nrestrain the said publication. It was also held that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  22</span>\n\n\n\n\nremedy of the affected public officials/public figures, if any,\n\nis after the publication only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">26.   This Court is of the considered opinion that the facts\n\nand circumstances of the aforesaid case and the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case are altogether different.\n\nIn the present case, it is a case where respondent No.2 has\n\nparticipated in a private event, some article has been\n\npublished by the Outlook English Weekly Magazine and\n\nsome comments have been against the IAS Officer and\n\nagainst the Chief Minister. Respondent No.2 wanted to file a\n\nsuit claiming damages and it is certainly not at all the\n\naction of the State Government against the Outlook\n\nMagazine and therefore, exercise of power by the State\n\nGovernment in sanctioning the amount to the respondent\n\nNo.2 can never be included under the term &#x27;grant for any\n\npublic purpose&#x27; keeping in view the <a href=\"/doc/1146668/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 282</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">27.
