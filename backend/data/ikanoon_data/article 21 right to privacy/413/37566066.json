Moreover, as per Telegram, it being\n                          an intermediary under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_11\">IT Act</a>, none of the pre-conditions which permit the\n                          intermediary to disclose the identity of the users, as per the IT Guidelines are\n                          satisfied.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                          15.    This Court, first, notes that the fact that the infringing content was\n                          disseminated on various channels on the Telegram app, is not in dispute. Such\n                          channels are being blocked by Telegram. However, the users on Telegram are\n                          creating new channels and operating the same in private mode, hence they are\n                          able to mask their identity. On the said channels, the infringing copyrighted\n                          works have been shared, communicated, and uploaded. Charges are also being\n                          collected by the infringers, for providing the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                          16.    The discovery application filed by the Plaintiffs, sets out the manner in\n                          which a Telegram account can be opened and the app can be downloaded by\n                          the users. According to the Plaintiffs, the Telegram app permits users to\n                          operate their businesses, either through a public channel or private channels.\n                          If they operate through private channels, the phone numbers or other details\n                          would not be visible. Thus, it is not possible to locate the owners of such\n                          channels. Such information is exclusively available only with Telegram.\n                          Since Telegram also makes secret chats possible, the phone numbers cannot\n                          be traced and the identity of the person(s) is also unknown.

For\n                          example:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">                          17.    The Plaintiffs, thus, realized that amounts were being charged by one\n                          private operator who was running one of the private channels for sharing the\n                          Plaintiffs&#x27; course material unauthorizedly. Pursuant to the injunction order\n                          granted by this Court dated 28th July, 2020, the channels which were being\n                          run earlier were blocked and now the said channel operators have taken refuge\n                          under privacy services and secret chat features to hide their own identity and\n                          have created new channels. Thus, the original works of the Plaintiffs are being\n                          transmitted on channels, which are created almost instantaneously, if an\n                          earlier channel is blocked. For example, the comparison between the earlier\n                          and new channels, has been tabulated by the Plaintiffs illustratively, as below:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                          CS (COMM) 282/2020                                                   Page 10 of 51</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signing Date:31.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">12:12:31</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">                                  S.no.

Thus, infringement of copyright is indisputably a serious matter as it\n                          involves valuable rights of owners of copyright. The significance of the\n                          protection and enforcement of such rights cannot be diminished, merely due\n                          to the growth of technology, which has made infringers easy to hide and\n                          conceal their illegal activities. The propensity of infringers to conceal and hide\n                          is the very reason due to which the provisions of law are widely worded. The\n                          definition of &quot;plate&quot; includes &quot;any device used for reproducing copies of the\n                          work.&quot; The definition of &quot;infringing copy&quot;, as extracted above, is broad\n                          enough to cover electronic copies which are circulated on Telegram channels.\n                          Electronic devices including smart phones, computers, servers, and such other\n                          devices, which permit copies to be made and to be disseminated would\n                          undoubtedly fall within the said definitions.

Moreover, apart from an injunction, one of the most significant\n                          remedies that an IP owner or a copyright owner is vested with, is the right to\n                          claim damages. Such damages, especially in cases of infringers who are\n                          earning large sums to the detriment and at the cost of the copyright owner,\n                          acts as a deterrent against further infringement.

Accordingly, the grant of injunction per se in the absence\n                          of commensurate damages or monetary deterrents, would be a toothless relief.\n                          Such orders do not constrain the infringers from simply creating new\n                          infringing channels and even profit off of their infringement, till the time the\n                          plaintiff is able to seek an injunction for every new channel.

While it intervenes to protect legitimate State\n                                     interests, the State must nevertheless put into place a\n                                     robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold\n                                     requirement. These three requirements apply to all\n                                     restraints on privacy (not just informational privacy).\n                                     They emanate from the procedural and content-based\n                                     mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement that there\n                                     must be a law in existence to justify an encroachment\n                                     on privacy is an express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21.</a> For,\n                                     no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty\n                                     except in accordance with the procedure established by\n                                     law. The existence of law is an essential requirement.\n                                     Second, the requirement of a need, in terms of a\n                                     legitimate State aim, ensures that the nature and content\n                                     of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the\n                                     zone of reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 14</a>, which\n                                     is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. The\n                                     pursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law\n                                     does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy,\n                                     as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial\n                                     review does not reappreciate or second guess the value\n                                     judgment of the legislature but is for deciding whether\n                                     the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from\n                                     palpable or manifest arbitrariness. The third\n                                     requirement ensures that the means which are adopted\n                                     by the legislature are proportional to the object and\n                                     needs sought to be fulfilled by the law. Proportionality\n                                     is an essential facet of the guarantee against arbitrary\n                                     State action because it ensures that the nature and\n                                     quality of the encroachment on the right is not\n                                     disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence, the\n                                     threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the\n                                     mutual interdependence between the fundamental\n                                     guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                          CS (COMM) 282/2020                                                     Page 45 of 51</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">Signing Date:31.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">12:12:31</span>\n                                      the protection of life and personal liberty, on the other.\n                                     The right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of the\n                                     right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in\n                                     Part III is subject to the same restraints which apply to\n                                     those freedoms.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">                                     XXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                                     328.

While it states that proof of\n                                 infringement is required, it has already blocked various infringing\n                                 channels and abided by the order dated 28 th July, 2020, without\n                                 demanding further proof, including private channels. In any event, this\n                                 Court has found a prima facie case of infringement, which is sufficient\n                                 to direct Telegram to enable the Plaintiffs to available of their remedies\n                                 under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_107\">Copyright Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">                          46.    In view of the above factual and legal position, in the opinion of this\n                          Court, merely because Telegram chooses to locate its server in Singapore, the\n                          same cannot result in the Plaintiffs&#x27; - who are copyright owners of course\n                          materials - being left completely remediless against the actual infringers,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                          CS (COMM) 282/2020                                                    Page 49 of 51</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">By:DEVANSHU JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">Signing Date:31.08.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">12:12:31</span>\n                           especially in order to claim damages and avail of other legal remedies in\n                          accordance with law. If such an argument is accepted, in the current world\n                          where most dissemination happens through online messaging services and\n                          platforms, IP violations would go completely unchecked. This cannot be the\n                          intention of law. The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_108\">IT Act</a> and the Rules made therein have\n                          to be construed harmoniously with the rights and remedies provided to the\n                          copyright owners under the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_109\">Copyright Act</a>. Indian Courts are competent to\n                          decide issues relating to infringement of copyright and the mere fact that\n                          Telegram is operating a messaging service in India which chooses not to\n                          locate its servers in India cannot divest the Indian Courts from dealing with\n                          copyright disputes or divest copyright owners from availing their remedies in\n                          Indian Courts. In the present age of cloud computing and diminishing\n                          national boundaries in data storage, conventional concepts of territoriality\n                          cannot be strictly applied. The dynamic evolution of law is essential to ensure\n                          appropriate remedies in case of violation of copyright and other IP laws.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">                          47.
