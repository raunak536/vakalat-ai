The\n                  core grievance is the trial court&#x27;s refusal to direct the preservation and\n                  production of Call Detail Records (CDRs) of:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                   Investigating Officer (IO) Rajat Kumar,\n                   Alleged accomplices Mr. Jawahd and Mr. Ashi @ Anas,\n                   Other members of the CGST North Office raiding team,\n                  for the period 21.10.2024 to 24.10.2024.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           2.

A court in revision considers the\n            material only to satisfy itself about the legality and propriety of the findings, sentence and\n            order and refrains from substituting its own conclusion on an elaborate consideration of\n            evidence. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">18.

A plain reading on the above quoted provision makes it evidently clear that the powers\n     conferred therein are enabling in nature, aimed at arming the Court or any Officer of the\n     Police Station concerned to enforce and to ensure production of any document or other\n     things, &quot;necessary or desirable&quot;, for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other\n     proceedings under the Code, by issuing summons or written orders to those in possession of\n     such materials. Therefore, sine qua non of an order under this Section is consideration of the\n     Court that the production of the documents concerned is desirable and necessary for the\n     purpose of trial. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/7496/\" id=\"a_38\">State of Orissa vs. Debendra Nath\n     Padhi</a>, 2005 (1) SCC 568 held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">             &quot;25. Any document or other thing envisaged under the aforesaid provision can be\n             ordered to be produced on finding that the same is &quot;necessary or desirable for the\n             purpose of investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code&quot;. The first\n             and foremost requirement of the section is about the document being necessary or\n             desirable. The necessity or desirability would have to be seen with reference to the\n             stage when a prayer is made for the production. If any document is necessary or\n             desirable for the defence of the accused, the question of invoking <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 91</a> at the\n             initial stage of framing of a charge would not arise since defence of the accused is not\n             relevant at that stage. When the section refers to investigation, inquiry, trial or other\n             proceedings, it is to be borne in mind that under the section a police officer may move\n             the court for summoning and production of a document as may be necessary at any of\n             the stages mentioned in the section. Insofar as the accused is concerned, his\n             entitlement to seek order under <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 91</a> would ordinarily not come till the stage of\n             defence. When the section talks of the document being necessary and desirable, it is\n             implicit that necessity and desirability is to be examined considering the stage when\n             such a prayer for summoning and production is made and the party who makes it,\n             whether police or accused. If under Section 227, what is necessary and relevant is\n             only the record produced in terms of <a href=\"/doc/67948107/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 173</a> of the Code, the accused cannot at\n             that stage invoke <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 91</a> to seek production of any document to show his\n             innocence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1498883\" id=\"span_31\">Under <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 91</a> summons for production of document can be issued by\n             court and under a written order an officer in charge of a police station can also direct\n             production thereof. <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 91</a> does not confer any right on the accused to produce\n             document in his possession to prove his defence. <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 91</a> presupposes that when\n             the document is not produced process may be initiated to compel production thereof.\n             Reliance on behalf of the accused was placed on some observations made in the case\n             of <a href=\"/doc/1498883/\" id=\"a_46\">Om Parkash Sharma v.

State</a> [(1999) 49 DRJ 202] . Mr Altaf\n             Ahmed, the learned ASG for the respondents not only contended that the decisions\n             relied upon for the appellants would not justify the claim of the appellant in this case,\n             at this stage, but also invited, extensively our attention to the exercise undertaken by\n             the courts below to find out the relevance, desirability and necessity of those\n             documents as well as the need for issuing any such directions as claimed at that stage\n             and consequently there was no justification whatsoever, to intervene by an\n             interference at the present stage of the proceedings.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">     Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 91</a> is concerned, it was rightly held that the width of the powers of that\n     section was unlimited but there were inbuilt, inherent limitations as to the stage or point of\n     time of its exercise, commensurate with the nature of proceedings as also the compulsions\n     of necessity and desirability, to fulfil the task or achieve the object. Before the trial court the\n     stage was to find out whether there was sufficient ground for proceeding to the next stage\n     against the accused.

Further, the observations cannot be understood to\n     mean that the accused has a right to produce any document at the stage of framing of charge\n     having regard to the clear mandate of Sections 227 and 228 in Chapter 18 and Sections 239\n     and 240 in Chapter 19.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">     We are of the view that jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 91</a> of the Code when invoked by the\n     accused, the necessity and desirability would have to be seen by the court in the context of\n     the purpose -- investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code.

The first\n                 and foremost requirement of the section is about the document being necessary or\n                 desirable. The necessity or desirability would have to be seen with reference to the\n                 stage when a prayer is made for the production. If any document is necessary or\n                 desirable for the defence of the accused, the question of invoking <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 91</a> at the\n                 initial stage of framing of a charge would not arise since defence of the accused is not\n                 relevant at that stage. When the section refers to investigation, inquiry, trial or other\n                 proceedings, it is to be borne in mind that under the section a police officer may move\n                 the court for summoning and production of a document as may be necessary at any of\n                 the stages mentioned in the section. Insofar as the accused is concerned, his\n                 entitlement to seek order under <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 91</a> would ordinarily not come till the stage of\n                 defence. When the section talks of the document being necessary and desirable, it is\n                 implicit that necessity and desirability is to be examined considering the stage when\n                 such a prayer for summoning and production is made and the party who makes it,\n                 whether police or accused. If under Section 227, what is necessary and relevant is\n                 only the record produced in terms of <a href=\"/doc/67948107/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 173</a> of the Code, the accused cannot at\n                 that stage invoke <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 91</a> to seek production of any document to show his\n                 innocence. Under <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 91</a> summons for production of document can be issued by\n                 court and under a written order an officer in charge of a police station can also direct\n                 production thereof. <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 91</a> does not confer any right on the accused to produce\n                 document in his possession to prove his defence. <a href=\"/doc/33230118/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 91</a> presupposes that when\n                 the document is not produced process may be initiated to compel production thereof.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">         7. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162165013\" id=\"span_40\">In <a href=\"/doc/162165013/\" id=\"a_63\">Hardeep Singh v.

The court is the sole repository of justice and a duty is cast upon it to uphold the\n                 rule of law and, therefore, it will be inappropriate to deny the existence of such\n                 powers with the courts in our criminal justice system where it is not uncommon that\n                 the real accused, at times, get away by manipulating the investigating and/or the\n                 prosecuting agency. The desire to avoid trial is so strong that an accused makes efforts\n                 at times to get himself absolved even at the stage of investigation or inquiry even\n                 though he may be connected with the commission of the offence.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">         8.

It does not mean that the defence has\n         a right to invoke <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 91</a> CrPC dehors the satisfaction of the court, at the stage of charge.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">                                                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">20.

However, sine qua non of an order under this Section is consideration of the Court that\n\n   the production of the documents concerned is desirable and necessary for the purpose\n   of trial.

All that we are concerned with is whether call details which the appellant is demanding\n         can be denied to him on the ground that such details are likely to prejudice the case of the\n         prosecution by exposing their activities in relation to similar other cases and individuals. It is\n         not however in dispute that the call details are being summoned only for purposes of\n         determining the exact location of the officers concerned at the time of the alleged arrest of the\n         appellant from Yashica Palace hotel near the bus stand. Ms. Makhija made a candid\n         concession that any other information contained in the call details will be of no use to the\n         appellant and that the appellant would not insist upon disclosure of such information. That in\n         our opinion simplifies the matter in as much as while the call details demanded by the\n         appellant can be summoned in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 65B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act such details\n         being relevant only to the extent of determining the location of officers concerned need not\n         contain other information concerning such calls received or made from the telephone\n         numbers concerned.
