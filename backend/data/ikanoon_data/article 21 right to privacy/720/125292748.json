The complainant Anil Kumar Gupta used to sell fruits on Thelia and on the date of incident i.e. 07.06.1989 at about 08.30 am when he was out of his house for selling the fruits, Smt. Tanno @ Tarawati wife of Ashok Kumar and Laxmi Narain @ Pappu came to his house and on the pretext that Nani is sick, by enticing and inducing on the false pretext, they took away the victim from the house of the complainant. When he returned home, the victim (his sister), was not found in the house and then neighbours informed that his Mausi and Mama, the above named accused persons, had visited in the morning and took his sister with them. The complainant visited the house of Nani where he was informed that they have gone to Lakhimpur Kheri and again when she was not found there, the complainant complained the fact to the police station by means of a complaint (Ext. Ka-1). The prosecution story reveals that the victim, sister of the complainant, was induced on the false pretext and kidnapped by accused with intention to marry with a person against her will or against the desire of the complainant, who is the brother of the victim. The case was initially registered under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 363</a> and <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_11\">366</a> IPC against accused/appellants Laxmi Narain, Tanno @ Tarawati and Tej Ram and later on after investigation, it was found that the victim was subjected to false marriage and one Radhey Shyam induced on the false pretext of marriage and committed sexual intercourse with the victim against her desire and will and thus, after investigation, a charge sheet under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 363</a> and <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_13\">366</a> IPC against Laxmi Narain, second charge sheet under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_15\">366</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_16\">376</a> IPC against Radhey Shyam, Tej Ram and Smt.

Tanno @ Tarawati and appellant no.5 Laxmi Narain, who happen to be Mausi and Mama respectively of the victim, can never be convicted for the reason that in the first information report the complainant himself has narrated that they were looking after the care of the victim and the complainant. In this way, they were working as guardians of the victim and the complainant after the death of their parents. After the death of the parents, the complainant and victim were residing together. The complainant used to go out of the house for business purpose for selling of the fruits. His maternal uncle (Mama) and Mausi came to the house and persuaded by way of inducement and on the false pretext that her Nani is sick, took away the minor, a 13 years&#x27; old victim to their house.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.\tIt has been contended by learned counsel for the State that if virtually Nani was sick then there was no need to come with Mausi and after reaching at the house of Nani it came to the knowledge of the victim that her Nani was alright and there was nothing adverse with the health of her Nani. Secondly, even if the theory of taking the victim to the house of Nani is taken into account, appellant no.5 (Mama) was sufficient to come at the house of the victim to take away the girl with the consent of the brother or he had simply intimated the brother of the victim to come and see his/her Nani but the theory is otherwise. The victim was taken away on the false pretext that Nani was sick though it was not correct and secondly the appellant no.5, who happens to be Mama of the victim, comes at the house of the victim with appellant no.1 Smt. Tanno @ Tarawati so that the victim may be persuaded and convinced to follow them. Simply coming on a certain intervals at the house of the victim can never be said to be entrustment of the minor in the custody of the appellants. In fact after the death of the parents, the victim was residing with her brother who was taking care of all these things and at the time of occurrence the complainant/brother of the victim was lawful guardian within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 361</a> IPC. In this way, the appellants had taken away the girl, who was minor aged about 13 years at the time of occurrence, from the lawful guardianship of the complainant with intention that she may be compelled to marry with another person against her will.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.\tOn behalf of the appellants, it has further been contended that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that the girl was taken away from the custody of the lawful guardian. Appellant nos. 1 and 5 had submitted that since being close relatives they were visiting the house of the victim on certain intervals to look after and care them, it cannot be said that they were not lawful guardians of the victim at the time of incident. It has further been argued on behalf of the appellants that maternal uncle/Mama and Mausi of the victim had absolute right to the custody of the minor girl in the absence of father and mother and on that basis it has been submitted that charge of kidnapping is not sustainable against appellant nos. 1 and 5.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">9.\tIn view of this Court, the contention is neither correct nor acceptable. The circumstances of the victim and the complainant reveals that after the death of their parents, they were residing in the house and the brother was actual and natural guardian looking after the care of the minor. No such right exists in maternal uncle or anyone on the mother side in a circumstance as mentioned in the present case. For considering the lawful guardianship, the interest of the minor shall be taken into account. The circumstances reveal that the minor was taken away from her house in absence of her brother on false pretext that her Nani was sick though later on it was found wrong. The victim, a minor girl, against whom it was argued that appellant nos. 1 and 5 were lawful guardian, permitted or associated other accused Radhey Shyam to take away and on the false pretext of marriage committed forceful sexual intercourse in a drunken position. All these facts reveal and narrate that the appellants were not working in the interest of the minor. From the moment they permitted the minor to go with Radhey Shyam, the next accused, or associated in the activities like false marriage and forcing the victim to go with Radhey Shyam where she was compelled to have sexual intercourse with other accused Radhey Shyam reveals that the conduct of the appellants as such in no way shall be deemed to be conduct in the interest of the victim, the minor. The explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 361</a> IPC runs to say that the words lawful guardian in this Section include any person lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of said minor or other person. On the basis of above facts, appellant nos. 1 and 5 could not claim to be lawful guardian of the minor.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">10.\tIt has further been contended by learned counsel for the State that in considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 361</a> IPC and other cognate Sections of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">Indian Penal Code</a> it was necessary to bear in mind that these provisions were intended more for the protection of the minors and persons of unsound mind themselves that for the rights of the guardians of such persons. <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 361</a>, <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_26\">363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_27\">366</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1629021/\" id=\"a_28\">368</a> IPC are quoted below:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;361. Kidnapping from lawful guardianship.--Whoever takes or entices any minor under 1[sixteen] years of age if a male, or under 2[eighteen] years of age if a female, or any person of unsound mind, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound mind, without the consent of such guardian, is said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship. Explanation.--The words &quot;lawful guardian&quot; in this section include any person lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of such minor or other person.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">363. Punishment for kidnapping.--Whoever kidnaps any person from 1[India] or from lawful guardianship, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her mar­riage, etc.--Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1[and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall be punishable as aforesaid].\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">368. Wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person.--Whoever, knowing that any person has been kidnapped or has been abducted, wrongfully conceals or confines such person, shall be punished in the same manner as if he had kidnapped or abducted such person with the same intention or knowledge, or for the same purpose as that with or for which he conceals or detains such person in confinement.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">11.\tIn light of above facts, the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that appellant nos.1 and 5 were working as a lawful guardian is not tenable. Thus, at the time of occurrence brother, the complainant, was lawful guardian of the victim who was taken away from the custody of the lawful guardianship.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">12.\tThe story further reveals that after reaching at Shukla Ganj, the house of her Nani, she did neither found her brother there nor Nani was sick. From Shukla Ganj, Smt. Tanno @ Tarawati, Laxmi Narain and Tej Ram, who were present at Shukla Ganj, took her to Ganga Ghat station, boarded into the train and after boarding into the train, Laxmi Narain @ Pappu returned back while Smt. Tanno @ Tarawati and Tej Ram accompanied the victim. When the train reached at Unnao station the victim requested to get down  from the train on the pretext to ease herself but no attention was paid and she was brought to Sitapur and then to Lakhimpur Kheri where she was kept in the house of Tej Ram and Munni Devi, for 3-4 days. Co-accused Munni Devi knowing that the minor has been kidnapped or has been abducted, wrongfully confined her in her house and assisted with all other co-accused to go to court premises at Lakhimpur Kheri for marriage and compelled her to visit at temple and follow Radhey Shyam who compelled minor victim to have sexual intercourse. This was the reason the trial court found her guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1629021/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 368</a> IPC. The brother of the victim reached there amidst but he was not permitted to meet his sister and he returned back. The prosecution story further reveals that all the accused persons were there with Radhey Shyam took the minor to the Court at Lakhimpur Kheri for marriage and obtained her thumb impression forcibly. She was compelled to marry with Radhey Shyam though she was not willing and she was taken to one of the temple for marriage ceremony and after that she was sent with Radhey Shyam who had sexual intercourse with her forcibly without her consent. The statement of the witness/victim reveals that accused Radhey Shyam was in a drunken state and committed the offence of sexual intercourse without the consent of the minor on the false pretext of marriage. The brother of the victim after returning from the house of Tej Ram lodged the first information report and police reached there and the victim was recovered and the accused persons were arrested. The victim was brought to Lucknow and Unnao and was sent for medical examination.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">13.\tLearned counsel for the appellants has further taken ground and argued that the victim/prosecutrix was major at the time of occurrence.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">14.\tIn the first information report the age of the victim has been endorsed as 13 years. For the assessment of her age on the basis of fusion of bones and physical development, X-ray of right wrist and right elbow was taken and was sent for medical report. The Medical Officer who has proved Ext. Ka-2 and Ext. Ka-3 has stated on oath that the victim was about 15 years of age.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">15.\tNow the question is as to whether in absence of any educational certificate the report submitted by the Medical Officer on the basis of fusion of bones or physical development of the victim and teeth as well can be taken into account.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">16.\tDetermination of age has become very relevant to fix the criminal liability upon a person for the reason that under <a href=\"/doc/1530896/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 82</a> Indian Penal Code (hereinafter called <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a>), a child below the age of 7 years is not supposed to commit an offence. If a child between 7 and 12 years commits an offence, his immaturity and understanding of things is to be determined by the court under <a href=\"/doc/1703265/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 83</a> IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 361</a> IPC makes the kidnapping of a boy below 16 years and of a girl below 18 years from lawful guardianship an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1892519/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 363-A</a> IPC- kidnapping of a minor for maiming/begging is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1559723/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 366-A</a> IPC- procuration of a minor girl below 18 years is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1371751/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 366-B</a>- importing a girl below 21 years of age from a foreign land for the purpose of prostitution is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1684623/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 369</a> IPC, kidnapping/ abducting a child under the age of 10 years, with intent to steal from his person, is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/1938563/\" id=\"a_38\">Sections 372</a>, <a href=\"/doc/530949/\" id=\"a_39\">373</a> selling and purchasing a minor below 18 years of age for the purpose of prostitution is an offence. Under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 375</a> IPC, rape even with the consent of a girl below 16 years or sexual intercourse with his wife below 15 years is an offence.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">17.\tAttainment of majority under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/80664820/\" id=\"a_41\">Indian Majority Act, 1875</a>, competence for bail a witness, as the law may provide minimum age for being a witness; eligibility for employment etc. one of paramount importance. There may be cases where employee may approach the court for correction of date of birth and <a href=\"/doc/117218345/\" id=\"a_42\">in that case</a> also, determination of age may become a relevant factor in this regard. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">18.\tAge of a person can be determined by examination of following parts of the body:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(i) Teeth (Dental age):- First the child has twenty milk teeth (temporary/deciduous teeth), which are replaced by permanent teeth after the age of five/six years, which takes two years to have complete set except the third molar, which erupts at the age of seventeen and above. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(ii) Height:- Generally, according to geographical situation, a person attains the height according to his age, but it does not provide for any general rule and may vary from person to person, depending upon the family conditions, including heredity/mal-nutrition etc. \n \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(iii) Weight:- A person may have a particular weight on attaining a particular age, or he gains weight according to age upto a certain limit. But no general formulae can be treated as weight depends upon race, climate, dietic, hereditary factors and other conditions.   \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(iv) General appearance (Minor signs):- Some idea may be taken regarding the age of a person from his appearance in general. For determining the age etc., the second sex character may also be relevant. The growth of hairs appears first on the pubes and then in the axillae (arm-pits). The first sign of beginning puberty is found with the appearance of hair along labia. In the case of girls, it commences with the appearance of soft and pale coloured browny hair on the pubes at the age of about thirteen years and a few sparse dark hairs appear at about fourteen years. The growth becomes thicker in the course of a year and two when hair commence to grow in the axillae. The development of breasts in girls commences from 13 to 14 years, but it is liable to be affected by loose habits and social environment. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(v) Ossification of bones:- This is a relevant factor for determination of the age. Ossification of bones occur upto the age of 18 years and it is examined seeing the fusion of the bones at the wrist, elbow and pelvis. But this factor becomes irrelevant on attaining the age of 18 years because by that time, fusion may completely take place. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">19.\tIn a child bones are not fully ossified (consolidated). Ossification centres for different bones appear at different ages and fuse or unite with the main bone at different ages. With the help of x-rays, it is possible to determine the extent of ossification and the union of epiphytic bones. This gives a fairly good estimate within a margin of 2 years. Appearance of ossification alter and fusion is at a different stage. For the purpose of  determining the age, study of ossification of bones of wrist, elbow and pelvis is very important. In case of wrist joint, there are about eight small and 2 long bones and completion of the said bones takes place at different age and all of them do not attain the fusion simultaneously. Similarly, for pelvis bone ossification centres, appear around 14 years of age and fuse between 17-20 years. The 3/4 gap appears in pelvis bone which are filled up after a time but generally they are completed by the age of 18 to 20 years. Different bones take different time to gain fusion. Similarly, in the case of elbow, there appears to be a gap in the bones and its completion takes place.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">20.\tIn light of above facts, I have considered the medical report submitted by the Medical Officer on the basis of  fusion of bones and development of physique and the statement of the doctor who had been examined to verify the X-ray report and age, I am of the view that the version of the expert/doctor who had opined the age of the victim about 15 years of age cannot be denied only on the basis of argument of learned counsel for the appellants and thus this Court is of the view that the victim was minor at the time of incident.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">21.\tNow the question is as to whether the accused Radhey Shaym has committed an offence within the definition of <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 376</a> IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 376</a> IPC reads as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;Whoever, except in the cases provided for in sub-section (2), commits rape, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than seven years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">22.\tIn the statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. he has stated that report was falsely lodged against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. There is a police report and evidence that the victim was taken to Lakhimpur Kheri in the house of the co-accused where the appellant Radhey Shyam was also present and the victim was taken to one of the temple where a false story of sindoor and bangles was given to the victim and after that she was induced to follow Radhey Shyam and was compelled for sexual intercourse without her will or consent. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134531\" id=\"span_2\">23.\tWhile considering the trial of rape cases, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/134531/\" id=\"a_46\">State of A.P. v.

Before parting with the case we would like to point out that the Courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader       probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor       contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the witnesses, which are not of a fatal nature to throw out allegations of rape. This is all the more important because of late crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an     irony that while we are celebrating woman&#x27;s rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour.

We must remember that a rapist not only violates the victim&#x27;s privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault - it is often destructive of the whole       personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Court, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases       with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. ..... &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">25.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91149\" id=\"span_5\">In Rameshwar S/o.Kalyan <a href=\"/doc/91149/\" id=\"a_49\">Singh v. The State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1952 SC 54), the accused was charged with the offence of raping a girl below eight years of age. The Supreme Court held that the High Court was right in holding that the guilt of the accused was proved by the evidence of the victim which was legally corroborated by the girl&#x27;s statement to her mother. The Supreme Court held thus:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">            &quot;Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the  victim of an outrage. If she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise. .. That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it Is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences. The only clarification necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of jury. In these cases, it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it  unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the  particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corroboration in that particular case. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\t  The nature and extent of the corroboration is required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it. Here, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville&#x27;s case,(1916) 2, K. B. 658 at p. 664 to 669. It would be impossible, indeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration. Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged.

As a rule of prudence, however, it has been emphasised that Courts should normally look for some corroboration of her testimony in order to satisfy itself that the prosecutrix is telling the truth and that a person, accused of abduction or rape,      has not been falsely implicated. The view that, as a matter of law, no conviction without corroboration was possible has not been accepted. The only rule of law is the rule of prudence namely the advisability of corroboration should be present in the mind of the Judge or the Jury, as the case may be. There is no rule of practice that there must in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. As to what type of corroboration may be required when the court is of the opinion that it is not safe to dispense with that requirement, it has also been laid down that the type of corroboration required must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence with which a person is charged.<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1502418\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1420504\" id=\"span_11\">(See <a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_54\">Rameshwar v.

That is why  an  elaborate  rescanning     of  the jurisprudential sky through the lenses of &#x27;logos&#x27; and &#x27;ethos&#x27;, has been necessitated.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? To do so is to justify the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominated society. We must analyze the argument in support of the need for corroboration and    subject it  to  relentless and remorseless cross-examination. And we must do so with a logical, and not an opinionated, eye in the light of probabilities with our feet firmly planted on the soil of India and with our eyes focussed on the Indian horizon. We must not be swept off the feet by the approach made in the western world which has its own social milieu, its own social mores, its own permissive values, and its own code of life. Corroboration may be considered essential to establish a sexual offence in the backdrop of the social ecology of the western world. It is wholly unnecessary to import the said concept on a turnkey basis and to transplant it on the Indian soil regardless of the altogether different atmosphere, attitudes, mores, responses of the Indian society, and its profile. The identities of the two worlds are different. The solution of problems cannot therefore be identical. It is conceivable in the western society that a female may level false accusation as regards sexual molestation against a male for several reasons such as : (1) The female may be a &#x27;gold digger&#x27; and may well have an economic motive- to extract money by holding out the gun of prosecution or public exposure.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(2) She may be suffering from psychological neurosis and may see an escape from the neurotic prison by phantasizing or imagining a situation where she is desired, wanted, and chased by males.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">(3) She may want to wreak vengeance on the male for real or imaginary wrongs. She may have a grudge against a particular male, or males in general, and may have the design to square the account.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">(4) She may have been induced to do so in consideration of economic rewards, by a person interested in placing the accused in a compromising or embarrassing position, on account of personal or political vendetta.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(5) She may do so to gain notoriety or publicity or to appease her own ego or to satisfy her feeling of self-importance in the context of her inferiority complex.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(6) She may do so on account of jealous.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(7) She may do so to win sympathy of others.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(8) She may do so upon being repulsed.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">         Without the fear of making too wide a statement, or of overstating the case, it can be said that rarely will a girl or a woman in India make false allegations of sexual assault on account of any such factor as has been just enlisted. The statement is generally true in the context of the urban as also rural     society. It is also by and large true in the context of the sophisticated not so sophisticated, and unsophisticated society. Only very rarely can one conceivably come across an exception or two and that too possibly from amongst the urban elites. Because :- (1) A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred, (2) She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the Society or being looked down by the society including by her own family     members, relatives, friends, and neighbours, (3) She would have to brave the whole world. (4) She would face the risk of losing the love and respect of her own husband and near relatives, and of her matrimonial home and happiness being shattered. (5) If she is unmarried, she would apprehend that it would be difficult to secure an alliance with a suitable match from a respectable or an acceptable family. (6) It would almost inevitably and almost invariably result in mental torture and suffering to herself. (7) The fear of being taunted by others will always haunt her. (8) She would feel extremely embarrassed in relating the incident to others being overpowered by a feeling of shame on account of      the upbringing in a tradition bound society where by and large sex is taboo. (9) The natural inclination would be to avoid giving publicity to the incident lest the family name and family honour is brought into controversy. (10) The parents of an unmarried girl as also the husband and members of the husbands&#x27; family of a married woman, would also more often than not, want to avoid publicity on account of the fear of social stigma on the family name and family honour. (11) The fear of the victim      herself being considered to be promiscuous or in some way responsible for the incident regardless of her innocent. (12) The reluctance to face interrogation by the investigating agency, to face the Court, to face the cross-examination by counsel for the culprit, and the-risk of being disbelieved, act as a deterrent. ....&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">33.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199575\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/199575/\" id=\"a_60\">State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain</a> (AIR 1990 SC 658), it was held thus:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">&quot;A prosecutrix of a sex-offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_61\">The Evidence Act</a> nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under S. 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_62\">Evidence Act</a> similar to illustration (b) to<a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_63\"> S. 114</a> which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend  assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage:\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">&quot;It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the Court   finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">It would have proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex-violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the Western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the Court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a  person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts     must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity.&quot;\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">34.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/1046545/\" id=\"a_64\">State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh and others</a> (AIR 1996 SC 1393), the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">&quot;The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases  involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations  which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent    bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in  the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost at par with the evidence of an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable, Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a Victim of another person&#x27;s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Inferences have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity least that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a    casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">35.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366037\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/366037/\" id=\"a_65\">Aman Kumar and another v.

In the latter case, there is injury on the physical form, while in the former it is both physical as well as psychological and emotional. However, if the Court of facts finds it difficult to accept the version of the prosecutrix on its face value, it may search for evidence, direct or circumstantial, which would lend assurance to her testimony.

The High Court also totally overlooked the prosecution evidence, which inspired confidence and merited acceptance. It is now well settled principle of law that conviction can be founded on the testimony of the prosecutrix alone unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration.

It is further stated that consent supposes three things- a physical power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue influence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the mind.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">52.\tStroud&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary (Fourth Edition), Volume 1 (1971) at page 555 explains the expression &#x27;consent&#x27;, inter alia, as under :-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48792753\" id=\"span_36\">&quot;Every &#x27;consent&#x27; to an act, involves a submission; but it by no means follows that a mere submission involves consent,&quot; e.g. the mere submission of a girl to a carnal assault, she being in the power of a strong man,  is not consent (per <a href=\"/doc/48792753/\" id=\"a_92\">Coleridge J., R. v.

It is purely and solely a mental process to be ascertained, in a prosecution for rape, by what the prosecuting witness may have said or done. It being a mental process there is no other manner by which her will can be ascertained, and it must be left to the jury to determine that will by her acts and statements, as disclosed by the evidence. It is but natural, therefore, that in charging the jury upon the subject of rape, or assault with intent to commit rape, the courts should have almost universally, and, in many cases, exclusively, discussed &quot;consent&quot; and resistance. There can be no better evidence of willingness is a condition or state of mind no better evidence of unwillingness than resistance. No lexicographer recognizes &quot;consent&quot; as a synonym of willingness, and it is apparent that they are not synonymous. It is equally apparent, on the other hand, that the true relation between the words is that willingness is a condition or     state of mind and &quot;consent&quot; one of the evidences of that condition. Likewise resistance is not a synonym of unwillingness, though it is an evidence thereof. In all cases, therefore, where the prosecuting witness has an intelligent will, the court should charge upon the elements of &quot;consent&quot; and resistance as being proper elements from which the jury may infer either a favourable or an opposing will. It must, however, be recognized in all cases that the real test is whether the assault was committed against the will of the prosecuting witness. State v.

The factum of admission of two fingers could not be held adverse to the prosecutrix, as it would also depend upon the size of the fingers inserted.

There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be acted upon without corroboration in material particulars, for the reason, that she stands on a much higher pedestal than an injured witness.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1843796\" id=\"span_49\">68.\tThe Court while dealing with the issue in <a href=\"/doc/1843796/\" id=\"a_109\">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Munshi</a> AIR 2009 SC 370, has expressed its anguish and held that even if the victim of rape was previously accustomed to sexual intercourse, it cannot be the determinative question. On the contrary, the question still remains as to whether the accused committed rape on the victim on the occasion complained of. Even if the victim had lost her virginity earlier, it can certainly not give a licence to any person to rape her. It is the accused who was on trial and not the victim. So as to whether the victim is of a promiscuous character is totally an irrelevant issue altogether in a case of rape. Even a woman of easy virtue has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone, because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone. A prosecutrix stands on a higher pedestal than an injured witness for the reason that an injured witness gets the injury on the physical form, while the prosecutrix suffers psychologically and emotionally.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">69.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"128137606\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/128137606/\" id=\"a_110\">Narender Kumar v. State (NCT of Delhi) MANU/SC/0481/2012</a>: AIR 2012 SC 2281, the Court dealt with a case where the allegation was that the victim of rape herself was an unchaste woman, and a woman of easy virtue. The court held that so far as the prosecutrix is concerned, mere statement of prosecutrix herself is enough to record a conviction, when her evidence is read in its totality and found to be worth reliance. The incident in itself causes a great distress and humiliation to the victim though, undoubtedly a false allegation of rape can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well. The <a href=\"/doc/128137606/\" id=\"a_111\">Court further held</a> as under:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974122\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046545\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"524900\" id=\"span_53\">&quot;Even in cases where there is some material to show that the victim was habituated to sexual intercourse, no inference of the victim being a woman of &quot;easy virtues&quot; or a women of &quot;loose moral character&quot; can be drawn. Such a woman has a right to protect her dignity and cannot be subjected to rape only for that reason. She has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone. Merely because a woman is of easy virtue, her evidence cannot be discarded on that ground alone rather it is to be cautiously appreciated.

So, the courts should deal with such cases sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an offence against the person of a woman, rather a crime against the entire society. It is a crime against basic human rights and also violates the most cherished fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">72.\tIn view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985, rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not retraumatize them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based violence. The State is under an obligation to make such services available to survivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be taken to ensure their safety and there should be no arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">73.\tIn light of above submissions and discussions, this Court is of the view that the point of minority of the victim and the point of kidnapping from the lawful guardianship and committing rape have been fully discussed by the learned trial court and there is no infirmity, illegality or irregularity in convicting the appellants/accused.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">74.\tLearned counsel for the appellants has further submitted that a lenient view should be taken on the point of sentence.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">75.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"499823\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"800569\" id=\"span_56\">In   <a href=\"/doc/800569/\" id=\"a_120\">Sevaka Perumal and another v.

Sentence is to be imposed regard being had to the nature of the offence and the manner in which the offence has been committed. The fundamental purpose of imposition of sentence is based on the principle that the accused must realize that the crime committed by him has not only created a dent in his life but also a concavity in the social fabric.   The purpose of just punishment is designed so that the individuals in the society which ultimately constitute the collective do not suffer time and again for such crimes, for it serves as a deterrent. The Court observed, true it is, on certain occasions, opportunities may be granted to the convict for reforming himself but it is equally true that the principle of proportionality between an offence committed and the penalty imposed are to be kept in view.
