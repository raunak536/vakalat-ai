They also submitted that <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the\nRTI Act, 2005 can only be invoked if the CPIO intends to disclose the personal\ninformation and therefore, once the CPIO is satisfied that the information is to be\ndenied under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11</a> is not required to be\ninvoked. They stated that prima facie no larger public interest is involved in the\nmatter and hence, the CPIO did not intend to disclose this information.\nDecision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">6.    This Commission observes that the opening words of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11</a> of the RTI\nAct are &quot;CPIO...intends to disclose&quot; which indicate that the procedure of Section\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                          Page 2 of 8</span>\n 11 has to be followed only if CPIO intends to disclose the third party information.\n<a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 which deals with the &#x27;third party information&#x27;\nreads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         &quot;11.

Central Information Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein,\nit has been held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">          &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n          cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n          respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n          immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n          lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n          Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n          accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n          and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n          sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n          respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n          whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n          &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n          the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">          13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n          the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n          issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n          censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n          as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The\n          performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily\n          a matter between the employee and the employer and normally\n          those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under\n          the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n          no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the\n          other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n          invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n          the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n          Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n          larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n          appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n          those details as a matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n          &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n          under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n          larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n          the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                          Page 4 of 8</span>\n           satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n          such information.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">8.      Henceforth, the legal issue to be decided herein is whether the appellant\nclaiming to be the legally wedded husband of Ms. Mamta @ Mamta Arora is\nentitled to seek information regarding her bank details &amp; income tax returns. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_6\">In\nthis regard, it is apt to mention the decision dated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High\nCourt of Delhi in W.P.(C) 803/2009 titled as <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_23\">Vijay Prakash v. UOI &amp; others</a>\nwherein it has been clarified that in a private dispute between husband and wife,\nthe basic protection afforded by virtue of the exemption from disclosure enacted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> cannot be lifted or disturbed unless the petitioner is able to\njustify how such disclosure would be in &#x27;public interest&#x27;. In the matter at hand, the\nappellant has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought is for larger\npublic purpose. Accordingly, the CIC&#x27;s order dated 03-02-2015 in\nCIC/SA/A/2014/000433 is not applicable to the facts of this case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_7\">9.      Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger public\ninterest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated 11-06-2015\nrendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 8753 of 2013\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_25\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n          misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n          imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n          which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n          said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n          fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n          unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_8\">10.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable to\n      the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n      W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n      returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           Page 5 of 8</span>\n      Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n     Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and information\n     provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public activity.&quot; In my\n     view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The act of filing\n     returns with the department cannot be construed as public activity.\n     The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public\n     nature and not necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The\n     expression &quot;public activity&quot; would denote activity done for the public\n     and/or in some manner available for participation by public or some\n     section of public. There is no public activity involved in filing a\n     return or an individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held that the same\n     was justified &quot;in the larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144795012\" id=\"span_10\">11.

From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Ms. Mamta @ Mamta Arora\nbeing a person other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the definition of\n&#x27;third party&#x27;.
