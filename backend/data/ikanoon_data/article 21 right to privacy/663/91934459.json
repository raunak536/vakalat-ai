The written submissions are taken on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.     The appellant contended that she is the legally wedded wife of Mr. P.L.R\nShenoy and therefore, she has every right to know his address as per the PAN\ndata.

The respondent contended that the PAN data is held by the Income Tax\nDepartment in a fiduciary capacity and therefore, it cannot be provided to any\nother person except the PAN holder. In the instant case, the PAN holder has not\ngiven his consent for sharing the PAN details with the appellant. Therefore, they\nhave claimed exemptions u/<a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> r/w <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act,\n2005 for denying the personal details of PAN data.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">Decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_2\">6.     With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of PAN data which forms part of the income tax\nreturns of an individual, this Commission refers to the judgment dated 03-10-\n2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in SLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012\ntitled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_9\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns\n         are &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from\n         disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act,\n         unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public\n         Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or\n         the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public\n         interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_3\">7.     The present matter wherein the appellant has sought the PAN details of\nher husband can be distinguished from the decision dated 15-05-2018 of the\nDivision Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh on the\npremise that in that matter the information was sought regarding an employee&#x27;s\nsalary from the employer being a government department i.e. the BSNL which\notherwise was obliged to disclose the remuneration of its employee in view of\n<a href=\"/doc/1493389/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 4(1)(b)(x)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 and no direction was given by the\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh to disclose the details of the Income\nTax Returns of the employee. Moreover, the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_12\">Girish Ramachandra Deshpande</a> (supra) was only\ndistinguished with regard to the limited point that wife was entitled to know the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                       Page 2 of 7</span>\n remuneration details of her husband. No other opinion/decision was conveyed\nregarding other personal information. Therefore, this Commission does not\nagree with the contentions put forth by the appellant for disclosure of PAN\ndetails of her husband.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8.      Henceforth, the legal issue to be decided herein is whether the appellant\nclaiming to be the legally wedded wife of Mr. P.L.R Shenoy is entitled to seek\ndetails of his income tax returns i.e. PAN data. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_5\">In this regard, it is apt to\nmention the decision dated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in\nW.P.(C) 803/2009 titled as <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_13\">Vijay Prakash v. UOI &amp; others</a> wherein it has\nbeen clarified that in a private dispute between husband and wife, the basic\nprotection afforded by virtue of the exemption from disclosure enacted under\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> cannot be lifted or disturbed unless the petitioner is able to\njustify how such disclosure would be in &#x27;public interest&#x27;. In the matter at hand,\nthe appellant has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought is for\nlarger public purpose.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_6\">9.      Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, PAN details\nof third party cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger\npublic interest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated\n11-06-2015 rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No.\n8753 of 2013 titled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_15\">Shailesh Gandhi v. The Central\nInformation Commission</a>, wherein, it has been observed as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">          &quot;16...The Petitioner possibly being aware of the said position\n          has therefore sought to contend that filing of the Income Tax\n          Returns is a public activity. I am afraid the said contention is\n          thoroughly misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can\n          be no stretch of imagination be said to be a public activity, but\n          is an obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his\n          taxes and since the said information is held by the Income Tax\n          Department in a fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed\n          to be revealed unless the pre-requisites for the same are\n          satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_7\">10. The Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in the decision of <a href=\"/doc/69052901/\" id=\"a_16\">Naresh Kumar\nTrehan v. Rakesh Kumar Gupta</a> in W.P.(C) 85/2010 &amp; CM Nos.156/2010 &amp;\n5560/2011 dated 24-11-2014 has observed as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;25. Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable\n      to the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n      W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n      returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n      Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                        Page 3 of 7</span>\n       Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and\n      information provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public\n      activity.&quot; In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The\n      act of filing returns with the department cannot be construed as\n      public activity. The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean\n      activities of a public nature and not necessarily act done in\n      compliance of a statute. The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would\n      denote activity done for the public and/or in some manner\n      available for participation by public or some section of public.\n      There is no public activity involved in filing a return or an\n      individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n      authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n      assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held that the\n      same was justified &quot;in the larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73569780\" id=\"span_9\">11.

Under\n      such exemption clause, the disclosure may be refused if the\n      request pertains to personal information, the disclosure of which\n      has no relation to any public activity or interest or which would\n      cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual.

From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Mr. P.L.R Shenoy being a\nperson other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the definition of &#x27;third\nparty&#x27;. Moreover, Mr. P.L.R Shenoy has also refused his consent.

Similarly, professional records, including\n        qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs,\n        disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information.\n        Medical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of hospitals\n        and doctors visited, findings recorded, including that of the\n        family members, information relating to assets, liabilities,\n        income tax returns, details of investments, lending and\n        borrowing, etc. are personal information.
