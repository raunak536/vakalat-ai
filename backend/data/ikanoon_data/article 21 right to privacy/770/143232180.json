SONAK, J.\n            Date of Reserving the Judgment : 20 September 2016\n            Date of Pronouncing the Judgment : 02 March 2017\n\n COMMON JUDGMENT :\n\n 1]        Since, common issues of law and fact arise in this batch of\n petitions, we propose to dispose them, with a common judgment and\n order. For this purpose, Writ Petition No. 6620 of 2012 is treated as a\n lead petition, since the pleadings have been mainly filed therein.\n Learned counsel for the parties also agree that this would be an\n appropriate course of action to adopt.\n\n\n 2]       Between the years 1994 and 1999, the ancestral lands and\n houses held by the petitioners were acquired by the State Authorities\n since the same were to be submerged under the Nira Deoghar\n Irrigation Project Waters. In all, about 91 hectares land was acquired,\n for which, compensation, including solatium and interest was\n determined at Rs.57.25 lakhs, corresponding to Rs.63000/- per\n hectare. This was in the year 1996. Since the petitioners were to be\n rehabilitated in the lands due to receive the benefit of irrigation project,\n the petitioners were required to deposit 65% of such compensation\n with the State Authorities as a part of the occupancy price. This the\n petitioners did in the year 1996 itself. In the year 2001, when\n submergence was imminent, the petitioners alongwith their family\n members and cattle were physically uprooted and relocated in the\n\n\n                                                                           7 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                      8   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n village      Shedgewadi       in   the   neighbouring      district     of    Satara.\n Unfortunately, the State Authorities, quite insensitive to the trauma of\n such up-rootment from ancestral lands and houses, failed to provide\n any rehabilitation measures at Shedgewadi. In particular, the lands\n allotted to the petitioners were barren, on account of inadequate water\n supply and complete lack of irrigation facilities.\n\n\n 3]       The Nira Deoghar Irrigation Project conceived in the year 1984\n was to inter alia comprise the Nira Deoghar Dam, Left Bank Canal\n (length      21 kms) and Right Bank Canal (length 208 kms).\n Shedgewadi, where the petitioners have been allotted lands is located\n at a distance of about 5 kms. from the villages of Bhade and Andori,\n through which, the Right Bank Canal is meant to pass at kms. 48-49\n from the starting point. Therefore, what was contemplated was that the\n construction of the Right Bank Canal would be at least substantially\n complete by the time the petitioners are uprooted from the affected\n zone and rehabilitated in the benefited zone by the year 2000-2001.\n However, the actual construction of the Right Bank Canal commenced\n only in the year 2001 and by the year 2008 the construction\n progressed only up to 19 kms. from the starting point. In the meantime,\n the petitioners were left to suffer their fate on account of deprivation of\n adequate water supply and irrigation facilities, which left them without\n any source of livelihood worth the name.\n\n\n 4]       The petitioners, despite their unfortunate predicament made\n several representations to the State Authorities urging early completion\n of construction of the Right Bank Canal so that water supply and\n irrigation facilities are made available to the petitioners in compliance\n with the statutory mandate of the <a href=\"/doc/199574344/\" id=\"a_1\">Maharashtra Project Affected\n Persons Rehabilitation Act, 1999</a> (said Act), as also the promise of\n\n                                                                               8 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                      ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                 9    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n social and economic justice enshrined in the preamble to the\n Constitution of India. However, all that the petitioners met with, were\n assurances, which, despite lapse of several years, hardly translated\n into any action. The petitioners contend that there is callous inaction,\n lethargy and apathy on the part of the State Authorities, which has\n resulted in depriving the petitioners, not just their statutory entitlements\n but also their basic human rights and in particular their right to\n livelihood as guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.                   After\n exhaustion of remedies by address of several representations, the\n petitioners have instituted these petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the\n Constitution complaining about the gross violation of their right to\n livelihood. By way of redressal, they have applied for the issue of\n appropriate writ to direct the State Authorities to complete the\n construction of the Right Bank Canal at least upto the villages of\n Bhade and Andori, so that some modicum of irrigation facility is made\n available to the lands allotted to them at Shedgewadi and for some\n compensation.\n\n\n 5]        Mr. Gaurav Potnis, learned counsel for the petitioners, after\n taking us through the pleadings and the affidavits-in-reply filed by the\n State Authorities, submits that the State Authorities, by their callous\n inaction and apathy have violated not only provisions of the\n <a href=\"/doc/199574344/\" id=\"a_4\">Maharashtra Project Affected Persons Rehabilitation Act, 1999</a> (said\n Act), but also, the fundamental rights of the petitioners as guaranteed\n by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Mr. Potnis submits that the\n lands and houses of the petitioners now acquired, were located in the\n affected zone of the Nira Deoghar Irrigation Project. The petitioners, in\n the year 1996 itself have already deposited 65% of the compensation\n amount towards acquisition of their lands and houses with the\n rehabilitation authorities. However, the lands allotted to the petitioners\n\n                                                                           9 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                10    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n at Shedgwadi are totally barren, being bereft of water supply or\n irrigation facility. Mr. Potnis submits that the obligation in terms of\n <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_6\">section 10</a> of the said Act is to rehabilitate the petitioners in areas\n receiving the benefit of irrigation from the project, for which, their lands\n and houses came to be acquired. The allotment of the lands, which\n have neither any water supply nor irrigation facility, does not amount to\n rehabilitation in areas receiving the benefit of irrigation from the\n irrigation project. Accordingly, Mr. Potnis submits that this is a case of\n breach of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_7\">section 10</a> of the said Act.\n\n\n 6]       Mr. Potnis further submits that after the acquisition of the\n petitioners&#x27; lands and houses in the affected zone, the petitioners were\n completely uprooted from the areas held by them and before them,\n their ancestors for generations together. Mr. Potnis submits that the\n petitioners were carrying on agriculture in the affected zone and the\n acquisition of their lands and houses, has resulted not merely in the\n acquisition of their property, but also, such acquisition has resulted in\n virtually taking away their right to livelihood. Mr. Potnis submits that\n from the year 2001 onwards, the respondents have been assuring the\n petitioners that the construction of the Right Bank Canal, which is to\n irrigate the lands allotted to the petitioners would be completed.\n However, on account of lack of executive will, combined with inaction\n and apathy, such construction is not being completed, as a result of\n which, the petitioners have been deprived their right and livelihood as\n guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Mr. Potnis, finally\n submits that this is a fit case where the order dated 8 December 2015\n made by this Court awarding compensation of Rs.15,000/- per month\n for each of the petitioners is made absolute and further, time bound\n directions are issued to the State Authorities, to complete the\n construction of the Right Bank Canal and provide water and irrigation\n\n                                                                          10 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                   11   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n facilities to the lands allotted to the petitioners. Mr. Potnis has relied\n upon the decisions in Olga Tellis and ors. Vs. Bombay Municipal\n Corporation and ors1, Bhusawal Municipal Council Vs. Nivrutti R.\n Phalak and ors2, Rudul Sah Vs. State of Bihar3, Challa Ramkonda\n Reddy and ors. Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh by Dist. Collector,\n Kurnool4 and Devki Nandan Prasad Vs. State of Bihar5.\n\n\n 7]        Mr. Nitin Deshpande, learned Additional Government Pleader\n (AGP) with admirable restraint submitted that there is no obligation\n under the said Act to allot any land to project affected persons like the\n petitioners, since <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_9\">section 10</a> of the said Act makes it very clear that the\n lands can be allotted subject to availability and not otherwise. He\n submitted that despite such position, the State Authorities did allot\n lands to the petitioners at Shedgewadi and has made all efforts to\n provide irrigation facility to such lands, even though, there is no\n statutory or constitutional obligation in this regard. He submitted that\n there may be some delay but there is no negligence on the part of the\n State Authorities, since, the delay is entirely for reasons beyond the\n control and contemplation of the State Authorities. He submits that the\n delay was mainly for the following three reasons:\n           i]      Litigations by various land owners from the benefited zone\n           resisting acquisition of their lands for the construction of the\n           Right Bank Canal;\n           ii]     Delay in obtaining clearances from the Ministry of\n           Environment and Forest (MOEF) in respect of part of the\n           construction of the Right Bank Canal affected by forest lands ;\n           and\n\n 1     1985 (3) SCC 545\n 2     2015 (14) SCC 327\n 3     (1983) 4 SCC 141\n 4     AIR 1989 AP 235\n 5     1983(4) SCC 20\n\n                                                                            11 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                           12      JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n           iii]    Paucity of funds.\n\n\n 8]        Mr. Deshpande also submitted that the State Authorities, in the\n matter of construction of dams or irrigation project exercise sovereign\n functions and therefore, are entitled to sovereign immunity, assuming\n without accepting that there has been some negligence on the part of\n the officers, in the matter of providing water and irrigation facilities to\n the petitioners&#x27; lands. He submits that, in such circumstances, the\n State Authorities cannot be saddled with any liability for payment of\n compensation. In support of such proposition, Mr. Deshpande relied\n upon the judgment of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Vidarbha\n Irrigation Development Corporation Vs. Joint Commissioner of\n Income Tax decided on 22 July 2015, which according to him has held\n that the State Authorities discharge sovereign function when comes to\n construction of dams and irrigation projects. As regards sovereign\n immunity, Mr. Deshpande relies upon the decisions in cases of\n Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Vs. The\n Secretary of State for India6, State of Rajasthan Vs.

He\n submitted that some of the petitioners, have in fact, undertaken\n agricultural operations by sourcing water in this manner. He submitted\n that      nothing prevented the petitioners from applying to the State\n Authorities for water by means of lift irrigation facilities through some\n other irrigation project proximate to Shedgewadi. All these according\n to Mr. Deshpande are matters which involve adjudication into disputed\n questions of fact, which exercise may not be undertaken by this Court\n in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n 15    (2005) 10 SCC 1\n 16    (2002) 7 SCC 478\n 17    (2000) 4 SCC 543\n 18    (2008) 12 SCC 675\n 19    PIL No.10 of 2012 decided on 15/12/2014 (OOCJ Bombay)\n 20    (1984) 2 MLJ 451\n 21    AIR 2000 SC 3751\n\n                                                                                      13 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                              ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                  14   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n 10]      For all the aforesaid reasons, Mr. Deshpande submitted that the\n petitions may be dismissed and even the order dated 8 December\n 2015, by which this Court directed payment of compensation to the\n petitioners be recalled or varied. Mr. Deshpande by reference to\n certain documents submitted that at least three or four petitioners have\n sold the lands alloted to them at Shedgewadi, presumably for some\n profit and at least such petitioners are not entitled to any reliefs\n whatsoever in these petitions.\n\n\n 11]      The rival contentions now fall for our determination.\n\n\n 12]      There is no serious dispute with regard to the basic facts. The\n Nira Deoghar Irrigation Project was conceived some time in the year\n 1984 to comprise inter alia Nira Deoghar Dam, Left Bank Canal (length\n 21 kms) and the Right Bank Canal (length 208 kms.). The construction\n of the actual dam and presumably even the Left Bank Canal was\n completed by the year 2000. However, the construction of the Right\n Bank Canal commenced only in the year 2001 and up to the year\n 2008, hardly length of 19 km was covered. Between 2008 and 2014,\n there was no construction. The construction resumed only a good two\n years after institution of these petitions. Except for vaguely urging that\n the petitioners could have sunk wells or bore-wells or applied for\n irrigation facility from some other project, there is no denial that\n irrigation facility is till date not made available to the lands allotted to\n the petitioners at Shedgewadi, by way of supposed rehabilitation.\n\n\n 13]      From the year 1984 till date, the issue of rehabilitation of project\n affected persons is governed principally by the following legislations:\n          i]       Maharashtra Resettlement of Project Displaced Persons\n          Act, 1976;\n\n                                                                            14 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                      15    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n          ii]     <a href=\"/doc/199574344/\" id=\"a_11\">Maharashtra Project Affected Persons Rehabilitation Act,\n          1986</a>; and\n          iii]    <a href=\"/doc/199574344/\" id=\"a_12\">Maharashtra Project Affected Persons Act, 1999</a> (said Act)\n\n\n 14]      Besides, the issue is also governed by some Government\n Resolutions (GRs), which supplement or assist in the implementation\n of the aforesaid legislations. The policies with regard to rehabilitation\n are     to      some     extent   reflected   in   the   &quot;Punarvasan Arakada&quot;\n (Rehabilitation Plan) and the &quot;Water Policy&quot; formulated by the State\n Government. The Government of India has also formulated the\n National Rehabilitation and Settlement Policy 2007. In the preamble to\n this policy, there is acknowledgement that acquisition of private\n property by the State leads to involuntary displacement of people,\n depriving them of their land, livelihood and shelter; restricting their\n access to traditional resource base, and uprooting them from their\n socio cultural environment. These have traumatic, psychological and\n socio cultural consequences on the affected population which call for\n protecting their rights. There is imperative need to recognise\n rehabilitation and resettlement issues as intrinsic to the development\n process formulated with the active participation of the affected\n persons, rather than as externally imposed requirements. The\n displacement process often poses problem that make it difficult for the\n affected persons to continue their earlier livelihood activities after\n resettlement. This requires careful assessment of the economic\n disadvantage and the social impact of displacement. There must be a\n holistic effort aimed at improving the all-round living standards of the\n affected people. Chapter VII of the policy specifically recommends\n allotment of land in command area of project, to the extent possible, to\n families affected by irrigation or hydel projects. In case a family cannot\n be given land in command area of project or the family opts not to take\n\n                                                                                 15 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                        16   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n lands, such a family may be given monetary compensation on\n replacement costs basis for their lands lost, for purchase of suitable\n lands elsewhere.              In case of irrigation or hydel projects, the State\n Governments may formulate suitable schemes for providing land to the\n affected families in the command area of the project by way of pooling\n of the lands that may be available or, otherwise, would be made\n available in command areas of such project. In addition to this, the\n National Policy recommends several other benefits to persons affected\n by irrigation projects.\n\n\n 15]      This means that, at least on paper, there is robust mechanism in\n place to address and redress the issues of rehabilitation of project\n affected persons. The enactment of legislations and the formulation of\n policies is one thing, however, implementation of the same, is quite\n another. The facts and circumstances in these batch of petitions, is a\n clear instance where the authorities enjoined to implement the\n rehabilitation schemes display scant and insensitive regard, when it\n comes to actual implementation.\n\n\n 16]      The State Authorities, consistent with the provisions of the\n aforesaid legislations, issued necessary notifications declaring the\n &quot;affected zone&quot; and &quot;benefited zone&quot; in respect of the Nira Deoghar\n Irrigation Project. The affected zone, inter alia, included the areas\n actually required and acquired for the purposes of construction of Nira\n Deoghar Dam, as also areas which were expected to be submerged\n by the dam waters. The benefited zone, included areas which were to\n receive the benefit of irrigation facilities from out of Nira Deoghar\n Irrigation Project. The petitioners held lands and houses in the village\n of    Dapkeghar, Tal. Khandala, Dist. Pune. Since, such lands and\n houses were to be submerged in the Nira Deoghar Dam waters, they\n\n                                                                                 16 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                17   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n were included in the affected zone.\n\n\n 17]      The State Authorities, by invoking the doctrine of eminent\n domain, vide award dated 25 March 1996 made under the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_13\">Land\n Acquisition Act, 1894</a>, acquired the petitioners&#x27; lands and houses at\n Dapkeghar in the affected zone. In all, about 91 hectares land was\n acquired, for which, compensation, including solatium and interest was\n determined at Rs.57.25 lakhs, corresponding to Rs.63000/- per\n hectare. Such acquisition, in reality involved, not just the acquisition of\n petitioners&#x27; ancestral lands and houses, but also, the petitioners only\n source of livelihood, i.e., agriculture, for which, no separate\n compensation was ever determined, possibly because there is no such\n requirement in the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_14\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a>. Out of the\n compensation so determined, the petitioners were required to deposit\n with the Collector 65% of the amount of compensation by way of\n compliance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/47584713/\" id=\"a_15\">section 16(2) (b)</a> of the said Act, to\n which detailed reference shall be made in the course of this judgment.\n\n\n 18]      The construction of Nira Deoghar Dam was substantially\n completed by the year 2000-2001.

In fact, since the lands allotted to the petitioners at Shedgewadi\n were bereft of adequate water supply or irrigation facility, such\n allotment can hardly be styled as compliance with the statutory\n obligations prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/86895243/\" id=\"a_18\">section 10 (1)</a> of the said Act, which, no doubt\n subject to availability of sufficient land for the purpose, contemplates\n the rehabilitation of affected persons from the affected zone under an\n irrigation project, &quot;on land in the villages or areas receiving the\n\n                                                                          17 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:02 :::\n  skc                                 18    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n benefit of irrigation from such project&quot;.\n\n\n 19]      <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 10</a> of the said Act which is concerned with the\n rehabilitation of the affected persons, reads thus:\n        &quot;10.

In the context of the provisions of section 10 of the\n Maharashtra Resettlement of Project Displaced Persons Act, 1976, the\n Full Bench of this Court in Ganpat Pawar Vs. Special Land\n Acquisition Officer22 , after quoting the provision, has held as follows:\n          &quot;9.   The provisions of Chapter III are important and must be\n          noticed in some details. <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 10</a>, the first section in Chapter\n 22 AIR 1984 Bom 382\n\n                                                                           22 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 23   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n          III, states as follows:\n                  &quot;The State Government shall resettle as many displaced\n          persons as possible on land in the benefited zone or in other\n          villages or areas (being villages and areas specified by the State\n          Government by an order in writing for that purpose) in\n          accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made\n          thereunder&quot;.\n\n          This section stipulates, in our opinion, that when the question of\n          resettlement of displaced persons is to be tackled, it is to be so\n          done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules\n          made thereunder. It may also be noted that the section\n          mentions that the State Government shall resettle &quot;as many\n          displaced persons as possible&quot;. In other words, there is no\n          obligation on the State Government, under this section at any\n          rate, to resettle all the persons who have been displaced as a\n          result of any project undertaken by the Government. The\n          resettlement itself, when undertaken, has to be done in\n          accordance with the provisions of the Act. The obligatory\n          nature of the duty cast under <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 10</a> is relating to the\n          duty which is to be performed in accordance with the\n          provisions of this Act and not the duty in relation to the\n          settlement of the persons displaced as a result of any\n          project.&quot;\n                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n 23]      Although, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/86895243/\" id=\"a_33\">section 10(1)</a> of the said Act with\n which we are directly concerned are more emphatic on the issue of\n rehabilitation, applying the dictum of the Full Bench in Ganpat Pawar\n (supra), it is quite clear that the resettlement itself, when undertaken,\n has to be done in accordance with the provisions of the act. The\n obligatory nature of the duty cast, clearly relates to the duty which is to\n be performed in accordance with the provisions of the act. When\n considered from such perspective, we find that the State Authorities, in\n the present case, were obliged to rehabilitate the petitioners, who are\n admittedly project affected persons, &quot;on land in villages or areas\n receiving benefit of irrigation from such project&quot;. The contention\n that there was no obligation to provide rehabilitation upon lands\n receiving the benefit of irrigation, is therefore, unacceptable. The\n\n                                                                           23 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                24   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n provisions of <a href=\"/doc/151429747/\" id=\"a_34\">section 16(3)</a> , including in particular the proviso thereto,\n makes this position quite clear. This proviso states that the first\n installment of the remaining amount towards occupancy price shall be\n recovered &quot;one year after the irrigation facility is made available to\n him&quot;. This provision also contemplates the making available of\n irrigation facility to the lands alloted to the project affected persons as\n and by way of rehabilitation. The State Authorities, have not seriously\n disputed this position any time in the past. The contentions belatedly\n raised, are only for the purpose of avoiding payment of any\n compensation for the unreasonable delay in completing the works on\n the Right Bank Canal at least up to the villages of Bhade and Andori,\n so that facility of irrigation is available to the lands allotted to the\n petitioners at Shedgewadi.\n\n\n 24]        The petitioners have graphically described the trauma they\n underwent on account of their uprootment from the affected zone . The\n petitioners have stated that there were hardly any amenities provided\n by the State Authorities at Shedgewadi, notwithstanding the\n beneficent and generous provisions set out in <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_35\">section 10</a> or <a href=\"/doc/87937857/\" id=\"a_36\">section 16</a>\n of the said Act. They have graphically described the manner in which\n they, alongwith their family members and cattle were virtually herded\n from the affected zone to the so called benefited zone at Shedgewadi\n and there condemned to begin life anew, without any serious financial\n or social support from the mighty State. The petitioners make\n reference to the Punarvasan Arakada (Rehabilitation Plan) and the\n Water Policy formulated by the State Government. These policies\n speak of &quot;rehabilitation first, development later&quot;. This means the policy\n of pre-rehabilitation. It is high time that the State Authorities consider\n with utmost seriousness and sensitivity, the actual implementation of\n their own policies, rather than permit the same to degenerate into\n\n                                                                          24 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 25   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n mere paper policies or populist slogans.\n\n\n 25]        The position that the lands allotted to the petitioners at\n Shedgewadi had no benefit of irrigation facilities is virtually conceded\n by the respondents. Even otherwise, there is overwhelming material\n on record, which establishes this position. At a belated stage, however,\n the State Authorities have attempted to raise some dispute by\n contending that it was always open to the petitioners to sink wells,\n bore-wells, with the help of which they could have used the lands\n allotted to them for purposes of agriculture. There is also a faint plea\n that the petitioners could have applied for water supply from some\n other irrigation project and had the petitioners made such application,\n the State Authorities would have considered the same. Such\n unsubstantiated pleas hardly inspire any confidence and are not borne\n from the material on record. If indeed, it was possible for the State\n Authorities to provide the benefit of irrigation to the lands allotted to the\n petitioners at Shedgewadi, from out of other irrigation projects in the\n locality, then, it was the duty of the State Authorities to do so, rather\n than fault the petitioners for having failed to seek such benefit from the\n State Authorities. Again, to say that the petitioners could have very well\n sunk wells or bore-wells at or near the allotted lands, in order to avail\n the benefit of water supply, is hardly a plea expected from the State\n Authorities, if the promise of social and economic justice enshrined in\n the preamble to our Constitution is to have some meaning. It is also\n pertinent to note that such pleas were mainly taken by the State\n Authorities in their affidavits dated 11 July 2016 and 28 July 2016 filed\n after this Court, by order dated 8 December 2015 directed payment of\n compensation to the petitioners and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court , by its\n order dated 12 February 2016 declined to stay the direction for\n payment of compensation. It is quite apparent that all such vague and\n\n                                                                           25 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 26   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n unsubstantiated pleas, unsupported by the material on record are only\n for the purposes of avoiding the payment of compensation to the\n petitioners.\n\n\n 26]      Although, the State Authorities were required to rehabilitate the\n petitioners inter alia, by way of allotment of land in villages or areas\n receiving the benefit of irrigation from the Nira Deoghar Project , this\n was not achieved, because the State Authorities commenced the\n construction of the Right Bank Canal only in the year 2001, which was\n incidentally the year in which the petitioners were uprooted from the\n affected zone and relocated at Shedgewadi. From the year 2001-\n 2008, the State Authorities could manage to complete construction\n only upto the length of km 01 to km 19 (19 kms.) , when in fact, the\n total length of the Right Bank Canal was proposed as 208 kms. Even\n Shedgewadi, where the petitioners have been allotted lands is at a\n distance of about 5 kms from the villages of Bhade and Andori,\n through which the Right Bank Canal is to pass at kms 48 and 49 from\n the starting point. From the year 2008 to 2014, there was virtually no\n progress whatsoever upon the construction of the Right Bank Canal.\n\n\n 27]      The petitioners addressed several representations to the State\n Authorities pointing out their plight, on account of lack of water supply\n and irrigation facilities at Shedgewadi. The petitioners were assured\n that the construction upon the Right Bank Canal would recommence.\n However, such assurances were only on paper and at the site, there\n was really no progress on the construction of the Right Bank Canal.\n Left with no alternative, the petitioners instituted these petitions in the\n year 2012 seeking appropriate writ for completion of the construction\n and provision of water supply and irrigation facility as well as\n compensation.\n\n                                                                          26 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                       27   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n 28]      Initially, since this court was keen upon ensuring that the State\n Authorities take some serious and emergent steps to recommence the\n construction upon the Right Bank Canal so that there is some lasting\n benefit to the petitioners, the petitioners were prevailed upon to delete\n the prayers seeking compensation, which, the petitioners, in the same\n spirit, complied with. This is reflected in the order dated 19 October\n 2012 made in these petitions. From time to time, the State Authorities\n were directed to file affidavits indicating the progress, if any, in the\n matter of recommencement of construction upon the Right Bank\n Canal, so that the petitioners could have the benefit of irrigation\n facilities.     Despite       availing   several   opportunities       and      several\n indulgences, the State Authorities did not even bother to file any\n counter affidavit until 18 February 2013, a good seven months since\n the date of the institution of the petitions.\n\n\n 29]      Finally, on 18 February 2013, Shri. Shivaji Rajale, Executive\n Engineer, Nira Deoghar Project filed a counter affidavit vaguely and\n evasively denying the averments in the petitions. He has stated that\n the construction of the Right Bank Canal could not be completed on\n account of litigation by land owners in the benefited zone, delay in\n obtaining the approval from MOEF and paucity of funds. He has also\n made certain vague statements that it was possible for the petitioners\n to sink wells and bore-wells and thereafter undertake agricultural\n operations. In the affidavit, however, Mr. Rajale, after acknowledging\n the entitlement of the petitioners in terms of the said Act, has only\n repeated some vague assurances regards completion of the\n construction of Right Bank Canal. Certain relevant extracts from the\n affidavit dated 18 February 2013 read thus:\n        &quot;7.          .........I state that thus as per the provisions of the\n        Rehabilitation Act, the project affected person/s is entitled to\n\n\n                                                                                27 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                        ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 28   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        receive the benefits under the Rehabilitation Act if he deposit\n        occupancy price of the land i.e. sixty five percent of the amount of\n        compensation and the remaining amount of the occupancy price\n        as determined by the Collector. I further state that the proviso\n        of Sub-clause 3 is more important to the effect that the first\n        installment of such recovery shall commence one year after\n        the irrigation facility is made available to him. I state that in\n        the present case, as the occupancy price of the land/s i.e. 65% of\n        the amount of compensation was deposited, the Petitioner/s\n        accordingly allotted the land/s from the benefited zone as project\n        affected persons and therefore complied the requirements of the\n        Rehabilitation Act irrespective of the facts of claiming the\n        remaining amount of the occupancy price. I further state that the\n        remaining amount of the occupancy price is not recovered\n        by the concerned authority because of the irrigation facility\n        is not made available to him. I state that the relief by way of\n        monetary compensation, if granted and/or allowed, then in that\n        case, it would be a case of project affected person getting both\n        i.e. the land/s under the provisions of Rehabilitation Act and the\n        relief of monetary compensation.&quot;\n\n        8.     I state that, the construction of dam of Nira Deoghar Project\n        commenced in the year 1993-94 i.e. before the formation of\n        MKVDC and the water storage of the said project is completed in\n        two stages i.e. firstly in the year 2000 and secondly in the year\n        2008. I, therefore, state that the water storage of the said Nira\n        Deoghar Project is completed by all means in the year 2008. I\n        state that, as per the project report of Nira Deoghar Project, the\n        dam is having two canal systems namely Left Bank Canal &amp; Right\n        Bank Canal. The length of Left Bank Canal is 22 K.M. whereas\n        the length of Right Bank Canal is 208 K.M. which starts from\n        village Salav of Bhor Tehsil, Dist-Pune and ends at Mandki of\n        Malshiras Tehsil, Dist. Solapur. I state that village Bhade and\n        Andori comes within the jurisdiction of Tehsil Khandala, District\n        Satara and those villages are situated in the command of Right\n        Bank Canal. I state that, the actual work of canal is started in the\n        year 2000-01. I state that though the actual work of canal is\n        started in the year 2000-2001 till today, the work from K.M.\n        No. 1 to 19 is completed by the end of June 2008. I further\n        state that even though the land acquisition process was\n        completed by the Land Acquisition Officer still some of the land\n        owner/s had filed civil suits before the Civil Court at Pune so also\n        before this Hon&#x27;ble Court and challenged the entire acquisition\n        procedure. I further state that because of the said litigation, the\n\n\n                                                                           28 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 29    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        work of canal was held up for considerable period. I further state\n        that unfortunately the sufficient funds were also not available for\n        the completion of the entire canal.\n\n        9.     I state that the Right Bank canal crosses through N.H. No.\n        4 from the area of village Shirval. Some of the land/s which are\n        situated by both the sides of N.H. No. 4 possessed non\n        agricultural activities and therefore the process of acquisition was\n        held up because of various reasons came across to the Land\n        Acquisition Officer. I further state that the part of K.M. No. 48 and\n        49 of Right Bank Canal also crosses the land owned by the forest\n        department. I have therefore no alternate but to forward a\n        proposal to the Ministry of Environment and Forest Department,\n        New Delhi for the permission to excavate the Right Bank canal\n        from K.M. No. 48 and 49. I state that the initial proposal is\n        forwarded in the year 2006 and formal approval is received from\n        the Ministry of Environment and Forest Department, New Delhi in\n        the month of September, 2008. I further state that I made the\n        compliance of the conditions putforth by the Ministry of\n        Environment and Forest Department, New Delhi and accordingly\n        the proposal for the final approval is submitted in the month of\n        January, 2011 to the Ministry of Environment and Forest\n        Department, New Delhi. I further state that till today I did not get\n        the final approval and/or permission from the Ministry of\n        Environment and Forest Department, New Delhi in order to\n        excavate the work of canal from the area referred hereinabove. I\n        state that village Bhade and Andori are situated within the\n        distance of 5 kilometer approximately from K.M. No. 48 and\n        49 of the said Right Bank Canal and therefore I state that\n        unless and until the work from K.M. No. 48 and 49 of the said\n        Right Bank Canal is completed, it would not be possible to\n        complete the canal work of village Bhade and Andori.\n\n        10. I state that in view of the reasons referred hereinabove\n        it was practically not possible to keep the continuity in order\n        to complete the entire work of Right Bank canal till today. I\n        state that if the issue of acquisition of N.H. No. 4 is resolved\n        so also if the final approval is received from Ministry of\n        Environment and Forest Department, New Delhi so also if\n        there is no issue of paucity of funds, then in that case, it\n        would be possible to complete the entire work of Right Bank\n        canal within appropriate period.\n                                                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n                                                                           29 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                    30   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n 30]      Relying upon the vague assurances in the aforesaid counter\n affidavit and in the fond hope that the State Authorities will take steps\n to recommence and complete the construction of the Right Bank Canal\n at least up to the village of Bhade and Andori, these petitions were\n adjourned from time to time. By November 2015, however, it was\n noticed that the State Authorities displayed no seriousness whatsoever\n in the matter. Therefore, on 18 November 2015, this court made the\n following order\n           &quot;1.    Heard the learned counsel for the Petitioners, the learned\n           counsel appearing for Respondent No. 5 and the learned AGP\n           appearing for the State. We have perused the order dated 19 th\n           October 2012 passed by the Division Bench of this Court. The\n           Petitioners are Project Affected Persons whose lands have\n           been acquired for public purposes of submergence of Neera\n           Deoghar Irrigation Project. After payment of necessary\n           occupancy price, the Petitioners have been allotted lands by\n           way of rehabilitation. What is pointed out is that there is\n           absolutely no water supply available to the lands allotted to the\n           Petitioners and, therefore, it is impossible for the Petitioners to\n           cultivate the said lands. From the Reply filed by the\n           Respondent No. 5, it appears to us that it is an admitted\n           position that for various reasons, the lands allotted to the\n           Petitioners are not irrigated lands. Thus, it appears to us that\n           the Petitioners who are agriculturists lost their agricultural lands\n           by way of compulsory acquisition and though the lands were\n           allotted by way of rehabilitation in the year 2002 or thereafter,\n           the Petitioners are unable to cultivate the same on account of\n           failure of the State to supply water.\n\n           2.     As noted earlier, from the Affidavit of Respondent No. 5,\n           prima facie it becomes an admitted position that there is no\n           water supply to the lands allotted to the Petitioners. Hence, we\n           direct that these Petitions shall be listed for final hearing on\n           30th November 2015 high upon board.\n\n           3.   We direct the Principal Secretary of the Revenue\n           Department as well as the Principal Secretary of Irrigation\n           Department to look into the issues raised by the Petitioners.\n\n            4.       We make it clear that if we find that the State does\n\n\n                                                                             30 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 31   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n            not come forward with a concrete solution by the next\n            date, the Court will consider the question of passing an\n            interim order directing payment of reasonable\n            compensation to the Petitioners till the date on which the\n            water supply is made available to the Petitioners. We\n            also make it clear that a case for grant of compensation\n            at the minimum rate of Rs. 15,000/- per month to each\n            Petitioner will have to be considered.\n\n            5.    Needless to state that the responsible Officers of\n            the concerned Ministry shall be personally present in the\n            Court on the next date.&quot;\n\n 31]       When the matter was called out on 30 November 2015, learned\n Addl.Government Pleader (AGP) appearing for the State Authorities\n applied for adjournment stating that he has received no instructions in\n the matter. Accordingly, quite reluctantly, the matter was adjourned to 8\n December 2015, since it was assured that the instructions would be\n available by the said date.\n\n\n 32]      On 8 December 2015, once again, no affidavit was filed on\n behalf of the State Authorities. However, learned AGP placed on\n record a letter dated 8 December 2015 addressed to him by the\n Deputy Secretary to the Government in the Water Resource\n Department. The letter states that on 18 September 2015, in principle\n approval has been issued by the MOEF for             construction works in\n forest area and out of 11 conditions imposed therein, 10 conditions\n have been complied and by letter dated 30 August 2015 the State\n Authorities have requested the MOEF to dispense with the compliance\n of the remaining condition. The letter states that the decision of MOEF\n is expected by March 2016. The letter proceeds to state that all\n possible endeavour shall be made to complete the work at the earliest\n &#x27;subject to availability of funds&#x27;. The letter also states that if the\n petitioners apply for lift irrigation from Veer Dam and its canal, the\n\n                                                                          31 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 32   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n applications will be considered in terms of the Government policy laid\n down in Government Resolution dated 21 November 2002.\n\n\n 33]      This court, dissatisfied with the vague assurances in form of\n letter dated 8 December 2015, made a detailed order dated 8\n December 2015, recording that the State Authorities , by their inaction\n and lethargy have infringed the petitioners&#x27; right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article\n 21</a> of the Constitution and directed the State Authorities to pay to each\n of the petitioners compensation at the rate of Rs.15000/- per month\n effective from 1 December 2012. The State Authorities were directed\n to clear the arrears by end of February 2016 and to continue to pay\n compensation on or before the 10th day of each calender month, until,\n water supply and irrigation facility is made available to the lands\n allotted to the petitioners at Shedgewadi. The State Authorities were\n also directed to place on record the steps taken by them to provide\n water supply to the lands alloted to the petitioners at Shedgewadi in\n form of an affidavit on or before 22 February 2016. In paragraphs 5 to\n 16 of the order dated 8 December 2015, this court has observed as\n follows:\n         &quot;5.     We have perused the provisions of the said Act of 1999.\n         Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 10</a> of the said Act is relevant for our\n         consideration, which reads thus:\n             &quot;10. Rehabilitation of affected persons.-- (1) The State\n             Government shall in accordance with the provisions made by\n             or under this Act and subject to the availability of sufficient\n             land for the purpose, rehabilitate affected persons from the\n             affected zone under an irrigation project, on land in the\n             villages or areas receiving benefit of irrigation from such\n             project.&quot;\n\n        6.    Thus, it is an obligation of the State Government to\n        rehabilitate the project affected persons from the affected zone\n        under an irrigation project, on lands in the villages or areas\n        receiving benefit of irrigation from such project. Thus, the\n        obligation of the State is to allot such lands by way of\n\n                                                                           32 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                  33   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        rehabilitation to the Project Affected Persons which are receiving\n        benefit of irrigation from such Project. In the present case, the\n        acquired lands of the Petitioners were situated in the affected\n        zone of Neera Deoghar Project. Therefore, the obligation of the\n        State Government was to allot lands in villages or areas receiving\n        the benefit of irrigation from the said Project. Hence, the\n        Petitioners were entitled to the allotment of irrigated lands by way\n        of rehabilitation. Going by the Affidavit on record and what is\n        stated in the letter dated 8th December 2015 which is taken on\n        record and marked &quot;A1&quot; for identification, the admitted position is\n        that the Petitioners have been allotted lands by way of\n        rehabilitation which are not receiving benefit of irrigation from the\n        said Project. In the Affidavit on record and even in the letter dated\n        8th December 2015, the fact that as of today facility of irrigation is\n        not available to the allotted lands is accepted. Though\n        assurances have been given, even the outer limit within which the\n        water supply will be made available to the alloted lands has not\n        been set out. By amending the Petition, a prayer was made and\n        prayer clause (IV) has been added seeking a relief of payment of\n        Rs. 600/- per month in terms of Government Resolution dated\n        10th February 2000. The substantive prayer in the Petition is to\n        direct the Respondents to provide water to the lands allotted to\n        the Petitioners&#x27; within six months. The Petition is filed in July\n        2012.\n\n        7.    Taking the statements in letter dated 8th December 2015\n        as correct, there is no possibility of water supply being made\n        available to the lands allotted to the Petitioners in near future. The\n        decision of the Ministry of Environmental &amp; Forest (MOEF) of the\n        Government of India is likely to be received by March 2016.\n        Therefore, the construction work of the canal will commence\n        thereafter that also subject to availability of funds.\n\n        8.     Considering the admitted position that the State\n        Government has failed to comply with its legal obligation under\n        sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 10</a> of the said Act of 1999, we expected\n        the State Government to come out with a Scheme for allotting\n        alternate lands to the Petitioners. In fact, the Petitioners would\n        have been justified in making a prayer in the Petitions for\n        allotment of alternate lands. In response to the prayer in the in the\n        Petitions for release of water within six months, the stand taken\n        by the State Government in the letter dated 8th December 2015,\n        to say the least, is very shocking. It it contended that the\n        Petitioners will be entitled to the special grant of Rs. 400/- per\n\n\n                                                                            33 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 34    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        month from the date of their actual displacement from the lands\n        till the date of allotment of lands in the benefited zone. Therefore,\n        even according to the Policy of the Government, no amount is\n        payable to the Petitioners after the date of actual allotment\n        though the lands allotted to the Petitioners are in true sense not in\n        benefited zone. A stand is taken that the entire occupancy price is\n        not payable by the Petitioners and the balance price will be\n        payable by the Petitioners only after irrigation facility is made\n        available to the Petitioners.\n\n        9.     In paragraph 5 of the said letter dated 8th December 2015,\n        it is suggested that the Petitioners can seek lift irrigation from\n        Veer dam and its canals. However, there is no concrete\n        assurance that water supply will be made available to them\n        through the said scheme.\n\n        10. The obligation of the State Government is to allot lands\n        receiving benefit of irrigation from the project for which the\n        Petitioners&#x27; lands were acquired. The object of the said Act of\n        1999 is to rehabilitate the Project Affected Persons. Admittedly,\n        the agricultural lands held by the Petitioners which were their\n        source of livelihood were taken away by way of compulsory\n        acquisition.\n\n        11. After considering the entire scheme of the Act, it is\n        apparent that the obligation of the State Government is to provide\n        lands in villages or areas actually receiving benefits of irrigation.\n        The Petitioners have been allotted lands in a zone which is\n        described only on a paper as benefited zone of the project. From\n        the chart tendered across the bar it is clear that the lands were\n        allotted to the Petitioners from 2000 onwards on different dates.\n        Admittedly, the Petitioners are not in position to cultivate the\n        allotted lands for all these years due to the failure of the State to\n        supply water.\n\n        12. Thus, the Petitioners have been deprived of their livelihood\n        for considerably long time. The acquisition was completed in the\n        year 1996. We are of the view that this is nothing short of\n        violation of fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n        13. As far as the Government Resolution which is relied upon\n        in paragraph 4 of the letter dated 8th December 2015 is\n        concerned, the learned counsel for the Petitioners has tendered\n\n\n                                                                           34 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                  35    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        across the bar further Government Resolution dated 21st\n        January 2003 which shows that the Government Resolution\n        dated 21st November 2002 has been withdrawn.\n\n        14. Considering the fact that the State Government has not\n        only violated legal rights of the Petitioners under the said Act of\n        1999 but also violated fundamental rights of the Petitioners, this is\n        a fit case where till the disposal of the Petition, the State\n        government should be directed to pay compensation to the\n        Petitioners as the Petitioners are not in position to cultivate the\n        lands allotted to them by way of rehabilitation due to default by\n        the State. In view of the stand taken by the State, irrigation facility\n        can be made available only after the canal is constructed which\n        may take years.\n\n        15. We are conscious of the fact that there is no prayer made\n        specifically made for the grant of compensation during the\n        pendency of the Petition. We are also conscious of the fact that\n        under the order passed by this Court on 19th October 2012, the\n        Petitioners were directed to delete prayer clauses (iv) and (v).\n        Notwithstanding the deletion of these prayers, substantive prayer\n        directing the Respondents to provide water supply to the land\n        allotted to the Petitioners within six months remains. The stand\n        taken in the Reply filed by Mr. Shivaji Dadasaheb Rajale and the\n        stand taken in the letter dated 8 th December 2015, marked &quot;A1&quot;\n        for identification, show that there is absolutely no possibility of the\n        Petitioners getting water supply to their allotted lands in near\n        future though they are admittedly entitled to the same. Going by\n        the admitted position, if not from the date of respective\n        allotments, but at least from the date of filing of the Petitions, the\n        Petitioners were entitled to the water supply.\n\n        16. Notice for final disposal has already been issued in these\n        Petitions. Therefore, today we would have been justified in\n        passing an order directing the Respondents to provide water\n        supply to the Petitioners within a reasonable time. However, we\n        find that even if such direction is issued, it is impossible for the\n        State Government to comply with the said direction. The State\n        Government want Petitioners to apply for water supply through lift\n        irrigation scheme of some other project. If the State was\n        sensitive, it would have made the supply available through any\n        other scheme on its own. Therefore, considering the admitted\n        entitlement of the Petitioners and considering the admitted default\n        and the violation of legal and fundamental rights of the Petitioners\n\n\n                                                                            35 of 74\n\n\n::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::\n  skc                                 36   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        by the State Government, instead of issuing a direction to provide\n        water supply, for the time being, we propose to direct the State\n        Government to pay compensation to the Petitioners in each\n        Petition at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per month from 1st December\n        2012 till the date water supply is made available to their allotted\n        lands. Even taking into consideration the provisions of the\n        <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_41\">Minimum Wages Act</a>, a sum of Rs. 15,000/- per month to the\n        Petitioners in each Petition will be very reasonable. It is not\n        possible to accept the Government&#x27;s submission that even though\n        no water is being provided, the Petitioners are not entitled to any\n        compensation. This order shall continue to operate till actual\n        water supply is made available to the lands allotted to the\n        Petitioners. The livelihood of the Petitioners depends on water\n        supply. So long as water supply is not made available, the State\n        must makes sure that the Petitioners survive.&quot;\n\n 34]      The State Authorities did not file any affidavit on or before 22\n February 2016 in spite of directions in the aforesaid order dated 8\n December 2015. The State Authorities, however, instituted petitions\n for special leave to appeal (c) nos. 3403-3438 of 2016 before the\n Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in order to question the aforesaid interim order\n dated 8 February 2015. On 12 February 2016, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n Court has made the following order :\n            &quot;Upon hearing the counsel the Court made the following\n                                ORDER\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1\">            Applications for exemption from filing certified copy of\n            the impugned judgment are allowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">                   Ministry of Environment and Forests represented\n            by the Secretary is added as party at the request of the\n            learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner.\n            Cause title be amended accordingly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">                   Issue notice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">                   There will be no stay of the current compensation\n            at the rate awarded by the High Court.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"> 35]      Despite the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court declining stay upon the\n award of compensation, the State Authorities failed and neglected to\n pay compensation to the petitioners. The petitioners were therefore,\n\n\n                                                                          36 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                  37     JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n constrained to institute contempt petitions, which are pending\n consideration. The record indicates that some arrears have been\n deposited in this court but there is no clarity as to whether\n compensation as directed, has in fact been paid to the petitioners or\n not.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\"> 36]      On 11 July 2016, Bapusaheb R. Pawar, Executive Engineer, Nira\n Deoghar Project, has filed an affidavit. On 28 July, 2016, Ravindra E.\n Upasani,        Superintending   Engineer     and     Deputy        Secretary        to\n Government of Maharasthra, Water Resources Department, has filed\n an affidavit. There is no appreciable difference in the contents of the\n two affidavits. The entire       thrust of these affidavits is to resist the\n payment of compensation to the petitioners. In these affidavits, whilst\n not disputing the indisputable delay in providing water and irrigation\n facilities to the lands allotted to the petitioners, the deponents have\n referred to several reasons, or rather, excuses in order to justify such\n culpable delay. These affidavits also state that some of the petitioners\n have sold the lands allotted to them at Shedgewadi between the\n years 2013 and 2015 and at least such petitioners should be denied\n compensation or any other relief.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\"> 37]        One of the peculiar features of these two affidavits is the\n invocation of several &quot;doctrines&quot; by the State Authorities for several\n purposes. They invoke the doctrine of eminent domain when it comes\n to acquisition of petitioners property from the affected zone. They\n invoke the doctrine of sovereign immunity when it comes to payment\n of compensation to the petitioners. They invoke the doctrine of faith\n and duty to take care when it comes to explaining the delay for non\n completion of the works upon the Right Bank Canal, in the context of\n acquisition of lands in the benefited zone or undertaking construction\n\n                                                                             37 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                38    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n activities in forest areas without permission from the MOEF. They\n invoke the doctrine of larger public good to contend that the\n petitioners, as private citizens, must not complain about acquisition of\n their property or delay in making available water and irrigation facilities\n to the land allotted to them, since, making such facility available to\n them is not a priority, taking into consideration the paucity of finances\n with the State Authorities. As if all this was not enough, the State\n Authorities, in these affidavits also invoke the doctrine of public trust to\n state that such doctrine is not &quot;necessarily confined to natural\n resources only&quot; but has a &quot;broad application and it applies with equal\n force to the finances of the State&quot;. These affidavits also invoke\n &quot;precautionary and public interest principle&quot; stating that the State\n Authorities are duty bound to spend amounts &quot;purely in public interest\n and by exercising due care and caution&quot;. Finally, these affidavits state\n that the State Authorities , in construction of dam and canal discharge\n &quot;non profit making welfare function of the State Government, which is\n sovereign in nature&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\"> 38]      The affidavits also state that the award of compensation would\n involve adjudication into disputed questions of fact and therefore, the\n petitioners must be relegated to the ordinary remedies of instituting\n civil suits, if they so desire. The affidavits also state that some of the\n petitioners have sold the allotted lands to third parties and are\n therefore, not entitled to any reliefs in the petitions instituted by them.\n The affidavits set out that the Nira Deoghar Project, when conceived in\n 1984 had a budget sanction of 61.47 crores, but by the year 2002, the\n budget was revised to 910.90 crores, suggesting that it may not be\n possible to expend further amounts upon the project. The affidavits\n also state that compensation can be awarded under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 226</a> of the\n Constitution only where &quot;facts were gross and almost undisputed&quot;, as if\n\n                                                                          38 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                        39    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n to suggest that unreasonable delay of over 16 years in the present\n case is not gross and was in any manner, disputed. It is necessary to\n note that in the initial affidavit, no such pleas were taken or in any\n case seriously taken. It is only after this court directed the payment of\n compensation and such direction was not stayed by the Hon&#x27;ble\n Supreme Court , these affidavits have been filed. We are sorry to note\n that the tenor and the contents of such affidavits betray the sense of\n responsibility and sensitivity towards the plight of the project affected\n persons like the petitioners who have been deprived their right to\n livelihood at least since the year 2001.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_9\"> 39]      The only redeeming feature of the aforesaid affidavits is that\n they state that the construction of the Nira Deoghar Right Bank Canal\n is now completed up to kms 39 in all respects and water facility is\n made available to the land owners around the same. The affidavits\n also state that the works between kms 40 and 65 are also nearing\n completion barring some hurdles like construction of aqueduct in km\n no.40, high way crossing in km 43 and permission from MOEF for\n construction of canal having length of 300 meters (0.3 kms) through\n forest area in kms. 48 and 49. This indicates at least some progress,\n even though, the affidavits do not state even the approximate time\n within which the works will be completed and water supply and\n irrigation     facility       made   available   to   the    petitioners&#x27;       lands      at\n Shedgewadi.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\"> 40]      The petitioners, in response to the aforesaid two affidavits, have\n filed detailed affidavits-in-rejoinder. Therein, the petitioners have dealt\n with the vague allegations in the affidavits filed by the State Authorities\n that the lands allotted to the petitioners have some modicum of water\n\n                                                                                   39 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                  40   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n supply or in any case, the lands are capable of being irrigated with the\n help of water from some other projects which are in fact, not even in\n the vicinity. They have pointed out that few wells or bore wells have\n been sunk by some original land owners from Shedgewadi and not\n persons like petitioners relocated there. They have pointed out that\n other irrigation projects are at quite some distance away and even the\n State Authorities are aware that such projects can offer no succor to\n the petitioners or the lands allotted to the petitioners.             They have\n pointed out the particulars of their family members and the serious\n livelihood issues which they face on account of the inaction of the\n State in providing them effective rehabilitation since 2001.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"> 41]      On the aspect of sale of alloted lands by some of the petitioners,\n they have offered the following explanation:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          (i)     The petitioner in Writ Petition No. 7975 of 2012, one\n          Maruti Balu Pawagi was suffering from cancer and has sold the\n          allotted land of     Shedgewadi, after        obtaining       necessary\n          permission from the authorities, in order to pay for his medical\n          expenses, such sale was effected after the institution of the\n          petition in the year 2012, vide Deed dated 13 February 2013;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          (ii)    The petitioner in Writ Petition No. 11731 of 2012 was 80\n          year of age and was required to maintain his son, who is\n          physically challenged, therefore, on 9 July 2015, he had no\n          option than to sell his land.

The affidavit states that normally no farmer will sell\n his irrigated lands as it is only source of his livelihood. In any case, the\n petitioners state that the isolated instance referred to earlier in fact\n fortify the petitioners&#x27; case that the State Authorities have virtually\n deprived the petitioners of their livelihood and thereby infringed <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article\n 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"> 43]      After the affidavits-in-rejoinder were filed by the petitioners, Mr.\n S.N. Bolbhat, Executive Engineer, Nira Deoghar Project has filed\n affidavit dated 20 September 2016. In this affidavit, fortunately, the\n averments in the affidavit-in-rejoinder set out quite candidly and plainly\n by the petitioners have not been contested.

The petitioner in Writ Petition No.\n 7975 of 2012 was suffering from cancer and has sold the allotted land\n with the permission of the authorities in order to pay for his medical\n expenses. The petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 9092, 8870 and 7829 of\n 2012 have sold only portion of the allotted lands to the adjoining land\n owners, who had the benefit of some water supply through the wells\n sunk by them upon their property. These are presumably the original\n land owners at Shedgewadi. The objection based upon sale of the\n allotted lands, applies only to the petitioners in these five petitions. In\n fact, the explanation offered , which has not been disputed, suggests\n that such petitioners have sold the allotted lands or portions thereof\n with permission from the authorities out of sheer desperation and for\n the purposes of mere existence and survival. The State Authorities\n have virtually pushed these petitioners to such a point and therefore, it\n hardly behoves the State Authorities to raise objections of the nature\n as found in the affidavits dated 11 July and 28 July 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"> 45]      We must note however, that the affidavit dated 20 September\n 2016 filed by Mr. S.N.

Now, the State Government has taken a\n          policy decision to dig pipeline 1 meter below the ground level so\n          that the farmers would not loose their lands and the government\n          need not pay monetary compensation because of the ownership\n          of the land at such a depth vests in the State Government.

Such retention of compensation\n was because the State Authorities, consistent with their statutory\n obligations under the said Act, had agreed to allot the petitioners\n alternate lands in villages and areas having the benefit of irrigation\n project. In reality however, the lands allotted to the petitioners at\n Shedgewadi are found to be barren for want of adequate water supply\n and irrigation facility. The material on record establishes that from the\n year 2001, the petitioners have been clamoring for water supply and\n irrigation facility , which, the State Authorities were obliged to provide,\n\n\n                                                                           43 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                               44    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n not just in terms of the said Act, but also, as a measure of their\n constitutional obligation.

Such\n deprivation for such length of time constitutes deprivation of right to\n livelihood otherwise than by the procedure prescribed by law. The\n record, including the desperate sales by some of the petitioners,\n indicate that the State Authorities, by their inaction and apathy, denied\n the petitioners their very right to livelihood as guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a>\n of the Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"921501\" id=\"span_9\">47]      In <a href=\"/doc/921501/\" id=\"a_46\">Sahyadri Punarvasan Gaothan Vikas Sanstha vs.\n Pandharpur Municipal Council23, Division Bench</a> of this Court was\n concerned with the grievances of persons displaced by the Kanhar\n Dam in Satara District in the matter of proper implementation of the\n resettlement programme.

The\n mandate is clear. Right to live has to be made meaningful, purposeful\n and relevant. It is not as if only the urban population is entitled to the\n benefit of basic amenities. It is a misnomer and the misconception\n when we proceed on the basis that the people living in the villages do\n not require toilets, open spaces, markets, burial grounds, roads,\n electricity and water supply. Even after 57 years of independence, we\n are unable to provide these basic amenities. The response of State is\n not at all encouraging. It is unfortunate that absolutely no attention is\n paid to these aspects when implementing and undertaking public\n project. The courts including the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\n highlighted the matter of total rehabilitation. In fact, the need of hour is\n to first habitate and then commence the work. However, neither this\n nor rehabilitation has been done sincerely and honestly. Funds are\n allocated but rarely disbursed. If disbursed, there is no account of\n actual expenditure. Although expended on paper, at site, nothing is\n visible. It is time that rehabilitation is done sincerely, honestly and\n diligently.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"> 48]      In Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltde. &amp; anr. V.

The State, instead of providing with adequate\n means of livelihood, deprives them only source of livelihood. No doubt,\n the State pays compensation towards the acquisition of land. The\n reality however, is that such compensation on account of the erosion in\n the value of the rupee, increased cost of living, even if the entire\n capital is saved, is not sufficient. The land which has been acquired,\n most of the times, has sustained these families for generations. This\n should be an eye opener to the State, policy maker and decision\n maker, that any policy which results in the family being displaced from\n the lands for industrial projects or other projects, the State must fine\n tune the rehabilitation package, which apart from being paying\n compensation for the lands acquired, will also as far as possible\n provide to such displaced families including agricultural laborers,\n preference for jobs in the industry that will come up. Such an exercise\n is perhaps required to make the concept of life, guaranteed under\n <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> more meaningful. The State is bound to act in accordance\n with the preambular concepts of the constitution. An enlightened State,\n committed to economic and social justice must articulate these\n preambular concepts. A practical approach is required in the context of\n problems faced by displaced persons.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1875824\" id=\"span_12\">49]      In <a href=\"/doc/1875824/\" id=\"a_49\">N.D Jayal Vs.

A farmer&#x27;s life is a tale of continuous experimentation\n        and struggle for existence. Mere words or a visual can never\n        convey what it means to live a life as an Indian farmer.\n        Unless one experiences their struggle, that headache, he will\n        never know how it feels. The risks faced by the farming\n        community are many: they relate to natural calamities such as\n        drought and floods; high fluctuation in the prices of input as well\n        as output, over which he has no control whatsoever; a credit\n        system which never extends a helping hand to the neediest;\n        domination by middlemen who enjoy the fruits of a farmer&#x27;s hard\n        work; spurious inputs, and the recent phenomenon of labour\n        shortages, which can be conveniently added to his tale of woes.\n        Of late, there have been many cases of desperate farmers\n        ending their lives in different parts of the country. The\n        principles of economics provide for the producer of a commodity\n        to determine his prices but an Indian farmer perhaps is the only\n        exception to this principle of economics, for even getting a decent\n        price for their produce is difficult for them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">        19. Economic growth through the 1990s had made India a\n        more market-oriented economy, but had failed to benefit all\n        Indians equally. The problems that plagued the farmers several\n        decades ago are still glaringly present today; there is little credit\n        available. What is available is very expensive. There is no advice\n        on best practice in conducting agriculture operations. Income\n        through farming is not enough to meet even the minimum needs\n        of a farming family.

We do not see any justification in the appellant approaching\n        this Court with an object to get an interim order so as not to make\n        any payment of enhanced amount of compensation. Such\n        attitude not only amounts to high-handedness and\n        arbitrariness on its part, rather it may cause serious\n        prejudice to the respondents. The excuse that the appellant\n        Council has paucity of fund cannot be accepted as a justified\n        cause to entertain the petition. If the land is to be acquired, law\n        requires prompt payment of compensation. In case the party by\n        whom or for whom the land is acquired is not in a position to\n        make the payment of compensation, the person aggrieved\n        becomes entitled to get the land restored.

In\n        such a fact situation, the Court cannot sit limply and allow\n        the defaulter to go scot-free and force the person seeking\n        protection to lose hope. The Court cannot adopt an\n        indifferent and passive attitude in such circumstances. The\n        appellant is directed to make the payment of the enhanced\n        amount of compensation within a period of ten weeks from today,\n        failing which it must restore the possession of the suit land to the\n        persons aggrieved who in turn would refund the entire amount\n        received as compensation.

The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\n suggested that one of the solutions is to make the land losers also the\n beneficiaries of the acquisition, so that they do not feel alienated but\n welcome the acquisition. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has referred to\n its earlier view in <a href=\"/doc/280623/\" id=\"a_64\">Land Acquisition Officer Vs. Mahaboob30</a>, to\n describe the plight of a land loser, particularly when the State delays\n payment of compensation :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                  &quot;As the landowner does not get the full compensation in\n          one lump sum, he is not in a position to purchase an alternative\n          land. When the land is acquired, he loses his means of\n          livelihood, as he knows no other type of work. The result is, he\n          is forced to spend the compensation received in piecemeal, on\n          sustenance of his family when he fights the legal battles for\n          increasing the compensation and for recovering the increases\n          granted, by levying execution. The result is that whatever\n          compensation is received piecemeal, gets spent for the\n          sustenance of the family, and litigation cost during the course of\n          prolonged litigation. At the end of the legal battle, he is hardly\n          left with any money to purchase alternative land and by then the\n          prices of land would have also increased manifold, making it\n          impossible to purchase even a fraction of the land which he\n          originally possessed. Illiteracy, ignorance, and lack of\n          counselling add to his woes and the piecemeal compensation is\n          dissipated leaving him with neither land, nor money to buy\n          alternative land, nor any means of livelihood. In short, he is\n          stripped of his land and livelihood.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"> 54]      From the analysis of the provisions of the said Act as also the\n law laid down on the subject by this Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n Court, we are of the opinion that the State Authorities were both,\n\n 30 (2009) 14 SCC 54\n\n                                                                           52 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                53   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n statutorily as well as constitutionally obliged to provide to the\n petitioners land receiving the benefit of irrigation from the Nira\n Deoghar Project or at least, to make available to the lands allotted to\n the petitioners some reasonable amount of water supply and irrigation\n facility, so as to render such lands fit for agriculture. Such obligation\n can be culled out not merely from the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/78771723/\" id=\"a_65\">section 10</a> of the\n said Act, but also, the provisions of the Constitution of India, including\n but not restricted to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 21</a> thereof. In the facts of the present case,\n the need to comply with such obligation was even greater since, the\n petitioners, on account of the acquisition of their ancestral lands and\n houses from the affected zone had been virtually rendered destitute.\n This was not a case of simple acquisition of land and houses but\n rather, this was a case of acquisition of the very livelihood of the\n petitioners. From 1996 onwards, the State Authorities have retained\n with themselves 65 % of the otherwise meagre compensation awarded\n to the petitioners for the acquisition of their lands and houses in the\n affected zone. The ancestral lands and houses of the petitioners were\n submerged under the Nira Deoghar Dam Waters by the year 2000.\n <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"681001\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1875824\" id=\"span_28\">The petitioners were uprooted from their environs and relocated at\n Shedgewadi, without any measures of rehabilitation worth the name\n being provided for them.

The\n Supreme Court has decried the attitude of the State Authorities in even\n acknowledging the existence of the problem.

In such a situation, it is the duty of the court\n to intervene, even though, such intervention are often pejoratively and\n unfortunately described as judicial activism. The Supreme Court has\n quoted with approval Justice Michael Kirby, a former Judge of the\n High Court of Australia who says in his Hamlyn Lecture &quot;Judicial\n Activism -- Authority, Principle and Policy in the Judicial Method&quot; with\n reference to our country as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">               &quot;The acute needs of the developing countries of the\n        Commonwealth have sometimes produced an approach to\n        constitutional interpretation that is unashamedly described as\n        &quot;activist&quot;, including by Judges themselves. Thus, in India, at least\n        in most legal circles, the phrase &quot;judicial activism&quot; is not viewed\n        as one of condemnation. So urgent and numerous are the needs\n        of that society that anything else would be regarded by many--\n        including many Judges and lawyers--as an abdication of the final\n        court&#x27;s essential constitutional role.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">               One instance may be cited from Indian experience: the\n        expansion of the traditional notion of standing to sue in public\n        interest litigation. The Indian Supreme Court has upheld the right\n        of prisoners, the poor and other vulnerable groups to enlist its\n        constitutional jurisdiction by simply sending a letter to the Court.\n        This might not seem appropriate in a developed country. Yet it\n        appears perfectly adapted to the nation to which the Indian\n        Constitution speaks. Lord Chief Justice Woolf recently confessed\n        to having been astounded at first by the proactive approach of the\n        Indian Supreme Court in this and other respects. However, he\n        went on:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">               &#x27;...

The basic\n facts in the present case, are really not in dispute. Some minor and\n inconsequential disputes attempted to be created by the State\n Authorities quite belatedly (i.e. after this court vide order dated 8\n December 2015 directed payment of compensation and such direction\n was not stayed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in its order dated 12\n February 2016) cannot deflect the jurisdiction of this court to award\n compensation to the petitioners as a public law remedy, now that the\n infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioners is established.\n There is really no merit in the contention of the State Authorities that\n the unreasonable delay in providing water supply and irrigation facility\n to the lands allotted to the petitioners after they were ousted from the\n\n                                                                            57 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                               58    JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n affected zone on account of submergence of their lands and houses,\n was for any genuine causes , beyond the control or contemplation of\n the State Authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"> 59]      The first reason stated for such unreasonable delay is the\n institution of the litigations by various land owners from the benefited\n zone resisting acquisition of their lands for the construction of Right\n Bank Canal. In the affidavits, the State Authorities except for raising\n such a plea have not bothered to substantiate the same even broadly.\n There are no particulars whatsoever of the litigations, if any, instituted\n by the lands owners in the benefited zone , on account of which the\n construction of the Right Bank Canal was thwarted. The State\n Authorities, who have , in their affidavits dated 11 July 2016 and 28\n July 2016 relied quite heavily upon the doctrine of eminent domain and\n who are armed with powers as well as wherewithal for compulsory\n acquisition, can hardly raise such defences with any degree of\n seriousness.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> 60]      The second reason stated is the delay in obtaining clearances\n from MOEF in respect of part of the construction of the Right Bank\n Canal through designated forest areas. Again, we are satisfied that this\n is only a bogey raised by the State Authorities. The total length of the\n Right Bank Canal is meant to be 208 kms. In order to provide irrigation\n facility to the lands alloted to the petitioners at Shedgewadi , the\n Canal has to be completed up to the villages of Bhade and Andori at\n kms. 48-49. Out of this, Canal up to the length of 300 meters,i.e., 0.3\n kms. is to pass through designated forest areas. This position was\n known to the State Authorities in the year 2001 itself. The clearance\n from MOEF was however, applied for only in the year 2006 and the\n State Authorities took almost five years to comply with the conditions\n\n                                                                         58 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                 ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:03 :::</span>\n  skc                                59   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n set out in the provisional approval. This is nothing but lethargy. No\n sooner this court, by its order dated 8 December 2015 awarded\n compensation to the petitioners, and such award was not stayed by\n the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court on 12 February 2016, the State Authorities\n pursued the matters with the MOEF with utmost zest. Accordingly, this\n reason cited, is by no means sufficient to resist the payment of\n compensation to the petitioners.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"> 61]       The third reason stated is &quot;paucity of funds&quot;. In the facts and\n circumstances of the present case, we are unable to accept such\n reason or such defence. The State Authorities have spent of crores of\n rupees on the Nira Deoghar Project. The State Authorities have\n retained 65% of the compensation otherwise payable to the petitioners\n for the acquisition of their ancestral lands and houses in the affected\n zone since 1996 on the solemn promise that the petitioners would be\n alloted lands in the benefited zones having the benefit of irrigation. The\n State Authorities have however, reneged upon such solemn promise,\n the provisions of the said Act or the constitutional obligations\n notwithstanding. In such circumstances, as observed earlier, there is\n statutory as well as constitutional obligation upon the State Authorities\n to provide for reasonable water supply and irrigation facilities to the\n lands alloted to the petitioners. The failure on the part of the State\n Authorities to do so, therefore, constitutes breach of statutory as well\n as constitutional obligations. Such constitutional obligations at least,\n cannot be avoided easily by vaguely raising the plea of &quot;paucity of\n funds&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"> 62]      In Municipal Council, Ratlam vs. Shri.

The Supreme Court observed that the\n plea of municipality that notwithstanding the public nuisance financial\n inability validly exonerates it from statutory liability has no juridical\n basis. The criminal procedure code operates against statutory rights\n under Part III of the Constitution have to be respected by the State\n regardless of budgetary provision. Otherwise, a profligate statutory\n body or pachydermic governmental agency may legally defy duties\n under the law by urging in self-defence a self -created bankruptcy or\n perverted expenditure budget. That cannot be. Finally, the Supreme\n Court has held that law will relentlessly be enforced and the plea of\n poor finance will be poor alibi when people in misery cry for justice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1307719\" id=\"span_38\">63]      In <a href=\"/doc/1307719/\" id=\"a_82\">State of Maharashtra vs. Manubhai P.

Nagendra Rao Vs. State of A.P</a> 41, in the context of the\n doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held\n that no civilized system can permit an executive to play with the people\n of its country and claim that it is entitled to act in any manner as it is\n sovereign. The concept of public interest has changed with the\n structural change in the society. No legal or political system today can\n place the State above the law as it is unjust and unfair for a citizen to\n be deprived of its property illegally by negligent acts of the officers of\n the State without any remedy. From sincerity, efficiency and dignity of\n State as a juristic person, propounded in the 19th Century as a sound\n sociological basis for State immunity, the circle has gone round and\n the emphasis now is more on liberty, equality and the rule of law. The\n modern social thinking of progressive society and the judicial approach\n is to do away with the archiac State protection and place the State or\n the Government on par with any other juristic legal entity. The\n movement now is from &quot;State irresponsibility to state responsibility.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"> 72]      As noted earlier, this is not a fit case to relegate the petitioners\n to the ordinary remedy of instituting suits against the State Authorities\n now that the infringement of their fundamental right guaranteed by\n <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is established. It is even otherwise well\n settled that a constitutional court is vested with the jurisdiction to\n award compensation, particularly where such award is consequential\n upon the deprivation of fundamental right of the petitioners. In Rudul\n Sah (supra), the petitioner upon establishing that his detention had\n\n 41 (1994) 6 SCC 205\n\n                                                                            65 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:04 :::</span>\n  skc                                  66   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n violated his fundamental rights applied to the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n for compensation in the petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. In\n this context, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court at paragraphs 10 and 12\n observed thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        &quot;10. We cannot resist this argument. We see no effective\n        answer to it save the stale and sterile objection that the petitioner\n        may, if so advised, file a suit to recover damages from the State\n        Government. Happily, the State&#x27;s counsel has not raised that\n        objection. The petitioner could have been relegated to the\n        ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to compensation was\n        factually controversial, in the sense that a civil court may or may\n        not have upheld his claim. But we have no doubt that if the\n        petitioner files a suit to recover damages for his illegal detention,\n        a decree for damages would have to be passed in that suit,\n        though it is not possible to predicate, in the absence of evidence,\n        the precise amount which would be decreed in his favour. In\n        these circumstances, the refusal of this Court to pass an\n        order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will be\n        doing mere lip-service to his fundamental right to liberty\n        which the State Government has so grossly violated. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_104\">Article\n        21</a> which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be\n        denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court\n        were limited to passing orders of release from illegal\n        detention. One of the telling ways in which the violation of that\n        right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the\n        mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a> secured, is to mulct its violators in the\n        payment of monetary compensation. Administrative sclerosis\n        leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights\n        cannot be corrected by any other method open to the\n        judiciary to adopt. The right to compensation is some\n        palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act\n        in the name of public interest and which present for their\n        protection the powers of the State as a shield. If civilisation is\n        not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too\n        well known to suffer mention, it is necessary to educate ourselves\n        into accepting that, respect for the rights of individuals is the true\n        bastion of democracy. Therefore, the State must repair the\n        damage done by its officers to the petitioner&#x27;s rights. It may have\n        recourse against those officers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        .....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        ....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">        12.

This observation\n        may tend to raise a doubt that the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 32</a> could\n        be denied &quot;if the claim to compensation was factually\n        controversial&quot; and, therefore, optional, not being a distinct\n        remedy available to the petitioner in addition to the ordinary\n        processes. The later decisions of this Court proceed on the\n        assumption that monetary compensation can be awarded for\n        violation of constitutional rights under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 32</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 226</a> of\n        the Constitution, but this aspect has not been adverted to. It is,\n        therefore, necessary to clear this doubt and to indicate the\n        precise nature of this remedy which is distinct and in\n        addition to the available ordinary processes, in case of\n        violation of the fundamental rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">        ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        17.

The defence of\n        sovereign immunity being inapplicable, and alien to the\n        concept of guarantee of fundamental rights, there can be no\n        question of such a defence being available in the\n        constitutional remedy.

To the same effect are the observations of\n        Venkatachaliah, J.

We respectfully concur with the view that the court is not\n        helpless and the wide powers given to this Court by <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 32</a><a href=\"/doc/63881/\" id=\"a_118\">,\n\n                                                                           68</a> of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:04 :::</span>\n  skc                                 69   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n        which itself is a fundamental right, imposes a constitutional\n        obligation on this Court to forge such new tools, which may be\n        necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the\n        fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution, which enable\n        the award of monetary compensation in appropriate cases,\n        where that is the only mode of redress available. The power\n        available to this Court under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 142</a> is also an enabling\n        provision in this behalf. The contrary view would not merely\n        render the court powerless and the constitutional guarantee a\n        mirage, but may, in certain situations, be an incentive to\n        extinguish life, if for the extreme contravention the court is\n        powerless to grant any relief against the State, except by\n        punishment of the wrongdoer for the resulting offence, and\n        recovery of damages under private law, by the ordinary process.\n        If the guarantee that deprivation of life and personal liberty\n        cannot be made except in accordance with law, is to be real,\n        the enforcement of the right in case of every contravention\n        must also be possible in the constitutional scheme, the\n        mode of redress being that which is appropriate in the facts\n        of each case. This remedy in public law has to be more\n        readily available when invoked by the have-nots, who are\n        not possessed of the wherewithal for enforcement of their\n        rights in private law, even though its exercise is to be\n        tempered by judicial restraint to avoid circumvention of\n        private law remedies, where more appropriate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">        21. We may also refer to <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 9(5)</a> of the International\n        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 which indicates that\n        an enforceable right to compensation is not alien to the concept\n        of enforcement of a guaranteed right. <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 9(5)</a> reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">              &quot;Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or\n              detention shall have an enforceable right to compensation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">        22.

This was indicated in Rudul Sah and certain\n        further observations therein adverted to earlier, which may tend\n        to minimise the effect of the principle indicated therein, do not\n        really detract from that principle. This is how the decisions of this\n        Court in Rudul Sah and others in that line have to be understood\n        and Kasturilal distinguished therefrom.

The public law proceedings serve a different purpose than\n        the private law proceedings. The relief of monetary\n        compensation, as exemplary damages, in proceedings under\n        <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 32</a> by this Court or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 226</a> by the High Courts,\n        for established infringement of the indefeasible right guaranteed\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is a remedy available in public\n        law and is based on the strict liability for contravention of the\n        guaranteed basic and indefeasible rights of the citizen. The\n        purpose of public law is not only to civilize public power but\n        also to assure the citizen that they live under a legal system\n        which aims to protect their interests and preserve their\n        rights. Therefore, when the court moulds the relief by\n        granting &quot;compensation&quot; in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 32</a> or\n        226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of\n        fundamental rights, it does so under the public law by way of\n        penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the\n        public wrong on the State which has failed in its public duty\n        to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen. The payment\n        of compensation in such cases is not to be understood, as it\n        is generally understood in a civil action for damages under\n        the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by\n        an order of making &#x27;monetary amends&#x27; under the public law\n        for the wrong done due to breach of public duty, of not\n        protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen. The\n        compensation is in the nature of &#x27;exemplary damages&#x27; awarded\n        against the wrongdoer for the breach of its public law duty and is\n        independent of the rights available to the aggrieved party to claim\n        compensation under the private law in an action based on tort,\n        through a suit instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction or/and\n        prosecute the offender under the penal law.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n 74]      As regards the quantum of compensation, we endorse the\n reasoning in the order dated 8 December 2015, by which we had\n directed the State Authorities to pay Rs.15,000/- per month to each of\n the petitioners effective from 1 December 2012 until, the State\n\n                                                                           71 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:04 :::</span>\n  skc                               72   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n Authorities make available to the petitioners and the lands allotted to\n them some reasonable water supply and irrigation facility. The material\n on record has established that the petitioners have been deprived their\n right to livelihood from the year 2001 when they were ousted from their\n ancestral lands and houses in the affected zone and relocated at\n Shedgewadi without any significant rehabilitation measures and more\n particularly without benefit of reasonable water supply or irrigation\n facilities. Although, the petitioners seek compensation from the year\n 2001, we are not inclined to consider such relief since, petitions were\n instituted in the year 2012 and further the State Authorities have now\n undertaken to provide reasonable water supply and irrigation facilities\n to the lands allotted to the petitioners as expeditiously as possible and\n in any case by 31 October 2017. The undoubted trauma which the\n petitioners have faced for all these years, is however, factored to some\n extent in determining the quantum of compensation. The material on\n record indicates that the petitioners families comprise at least five to\n six members. All these are relevant considerations for determination of\n the quantum of compensation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\"> 75]      Further, we note the compensation awarded for acquisition of\n the petitioners&#x27; lands and houses in the affected zone in the year 1996\n was quite meagre and out of the same, the State Authorities have\n retained 65% amount. In terms of Notification dated 20 October 2005\n issued by Ministry of Labour and Employment under the provisions of\n the <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_130\">Minimum Wages Act, 1948</a>, the minimum rate of wages per day\n per employee payable in employment in agriculture was in the range of\n Rs.102/- to Rs.153/-. In terms of Notification dated 1 September 2016,\n the Ministry of Labour and Employment has proposed revision of the\n rates of minimum wages payable to employees engaged in agriculture.\n This ranges between Rs.300/- to Rs.438/-        per day per employee.</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">\n\n                                                                        72 of 74\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">::: Uploaded on - 03/03/2017                ::: Downloaded on - 05/03/2017 00:58:04 :::</span>\n  skc                                73   JUDGMENT-WP-6620-12-GROUP MATTER\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1628260\" id=\"span_65\">These are rates of wages payable to employees engaged in\n agriculture.

In this case, the Hon&#x27;ble\n Supreme Court has held that payment of compensation in such cases\n is not to be understood, as it is generally understood in a civil action\n for damages under the private law, but in the broader sense of\n providing relief by an order of making &quot;monetary amends&quot; under the\n public law for the wrong done due to breach of public duty, of not\n protecting the fundamental right of the citizen.
