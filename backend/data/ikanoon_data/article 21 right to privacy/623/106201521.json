Road, Ahmedabad, near Rajpath Club\nCross Roads, he was compelled to wait by the traffic police\nconstables because of\nthe passing of the convoy of the respondent No.3, the Chief Minister\nof the State, who was on his way to attend a private function.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">According to the petitioner, on inquiry, a particular police\nconstable told him that it was not possible for him to say when the\nrespondent no. 3 would pass through the said road and that all the\npersons including the vehicles passing through the area were required\nto wait till such convoy would pass through.  The writ-petitioner\nfurther alleged that in the said gridlock, there were, among others,\ntwo 108-ambulance\nvans, which carried\nICU patients, and those two ambulances were also asked to wait.  The\npetitioner contends that he was kept waiting for more than 45 minutes\nand in the process, the two patients carried in those two 108\nAmbulance vans died\nin the absence of immediate medical treatment.   No details of those\ntwo patients, however, have been disclosed in the petition. The\npetitioner alleged that in the recent past, the Central Government\nRailway Minister, Mr. Dinesh Trivedi, visited the city of Ahmedabad\nfor attending a Railway function, but he did not adopt such\nextraordinary attitude for demonstrating his\npower as Central Government Minister.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\"> By way of amendment, though not supported by affidavit, the\npetitioner stated that a former Chief Justice of this Court could not\nattend a function in view of the traffic jam due to passing of convey\nof the respondent No.3.  It is further contended that the respondent\nNo.3, by virtue of holding office as Chief Minister of the State,\ncannot enjoy any higher right than that of an ordinary citizen for\nthe purpose of his movements within the city.  Lastly, it is\ncontended that huge amount of money has\nbeen spent for making excess unnecessary security arrangement for the\nrespondent No.3.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.\tThis\napplication is opposed by the State of Gujarat.  The learned\nGovernment Pleader appearing on behalf of the State-respondent, at\nthe outset, submitted before us that he would place before us the\npolicy adopted by the security personnel of the Chief Minister\nregulating the passing of his convoy in the public road, and\naccordingly, we adjourned the matter for production of such\ninstructions. Ultimately, on the last date of hearing, Mr. Jani, the\nlearned Government Pleader, not only placed before us the Rules and\nInstructions framed for the protection of the respondent No.3, but\nalso placed before us various intelligence reports received by the\nState Government regarding the threat to the security of the\nrespondent No.3.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.\tAt\nthis stage, Mr. Pandit, the learned advocate appearing on behalf of\nthe petitioner, vehemently contended that all these documents should\nbe given in the form of an affidavit, otherwise, this Court should\nnot look into those papers.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.\tWe\nhave, however, turned down the aforesaid prayer of Mr. Pandit for\nputting those intelligence report on the threat to the security of\nthe respondent No.3 from various sources on affidavit. In our view,\nthe State can reasonably contend before us that in view of those\nsecret information received, it is entitled under the law not to\ndisclose those reports by way of an affidavit.  We also find\nsubstance in the contention of Mr. Jani that the secret Rules and\nInstructions prepared by the State Government for the protection of\nthe Chief Minister, in view of huge number of threat to his life\nreceived from various sources, should not be disclosed; otherwise,\nthe efficacy of such instructions would be frustrated.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6.\tMr.\nJani, however, has prepared a separate note showing various\ncategories of persons for whom the State Government gives security\nand copy of such note has been handed over to Mr. Pandit.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">7.\tTherefore,\none of the questions that falls for determination in this application\nis whether any case has been made out for passing directions upon the\nState Government to cut down the arrangement of security by branding\nthe same as excess.  The other question is whether we should pass any\ndirection upon the respondent authorities for minimizing the\nharassment caused to the public because of detaining of the running\nvehicles on the way of the convoy of the Chief Minister.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_1\">8.\tBefore\nentering into those questions, it would be appropriate to refer to\nthe following observations of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_1\">Common\nCause (A Registered Society) vs. Union of India</a> reported in AIR 2008\nSC 2116 where the Apex Court succinctly explained the powers of a\nwrit-court taking over the functioning of the Legislature or\nExecutive while deciding a Public Interest Litigation:</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_2\">&quot;47. We have gone deep\ninto the subject of Judicial activism and public interest litigation\nbecause it is often found that courts do not realize their own\nlimits. Apart from the doctrine of separation of powers, courts must\nrealize that there are many problems before the country which courts\ncannot solve, however much they may like to. It is true that the\nexpanded scope of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">21</a> which has been created by this\nCourt in various judicial decisions e.g. <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_4\">Smt. Maneka Gandhi vs. Union\nof India and Anr.</a>, AIR 1978 SC 597, have given powerful tools in the\nhands of the Judiciary. However, these tools must be used with great\ncircumspection and in exceptional cases and not as a routine manner.\nIn particular, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution must not be misused by\nthe Courts to justify every kind of directive, or to grant every kind\nof claim of the petitioner.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"709776\" id=\"span_4\">For instance, this Court has held that\nthe right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> does not mean mere animal\nexistence, but includes the right to live with dignity vide <a href=\"/doc/709776/\" id=\"a_7\">Olga\nTellis vs. Bombay Corporation</a>, AIR 1986 SC 180; D.T.C. vs. D.T.C.\nMazdoor Congress Union, AIR 1991 SC 101 (paras 223, 234, 259);\n<a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_8\">Francis Coralie Mullin vs. Union Territory Delhi Administrator</a>, AIR\n1981 SC 746. However,\nthese decisions must be understood in a balanced way and not in an\nunrealistic sense. For example, there is a great deal of poverty in\nthis country and poverty is destructive of most of the rights\nincluding the right to a dignified life. Can then the Court issue a\ngeneral directive that poverty be abolished from the country because\nit violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution? Similarly, can the Court\nissue a directive that unemployment be abolished by giving everybody\na suitable job? Can the Court stop price rise which now-a-days has\nbecome an\nalarming phenomenon in our country? Can the Court issue a directive\nthat corruption be abolished from the country? <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> is not a\n&#x27;brahmastra&#x27; for the judiciary to justify every kind of directive.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;50. The justification\ngiven for judicial activism is that the executive and legislature\nhave failed in performing their functions. Even if this allegation is\ntrue, does it justify the judiciary in taking over the functions of\nthe legislature or executive? In our opinion it does not, firstly\nbecause that would be in violation of the high constitutional\nprinciple of separation of powers between the three organs of the\nState, and secondly because the judiciary has neither the expertise\nnor the resources for this.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">If the legislature or executive are not functioning properly it is\nfor the people to correct the defects by exercising their franchise\nproperly in the next elections and voting for candidates who will\nfulfil their expectations, or by other lawful means e.g. peaceful\ndemonstrations and agitations, but the remedy is surely not by the\njudiciary in taking over the functions of the other organs.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1921640\" id=\"span_5\">9.\tAt\nthis juncture, it will also be profitable to refer to the following\nobservations of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1921640/\" id=\"a_11\">Delhi\nDevelopment Authority, N.D. and Anr. v. Joint Action Committee,\nAllottee of SFS Flats and others</a>, reported in AIR 2008 SC 672, where\nthe said court elaborated the above principle with the following\nobservations:</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;Policy decision:\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">59. \tAn executive order\ntermed as a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial\nreview. Whereas the superior Courts may not interfere with the nitty\ngritties of the policy, or substitute one by the other but it will\nnot be correct to contend that the Court shall like its judicial\nhands off, when a plea is raised that the impugned decision is a\npolicy decision. Interference therewith on the part of the superior\nCourt would not be without jurisdiction as it is subject to judicial\nreview.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">60. \tBroadly, a policy\ndecision is subject to judicial review on the following grounds:\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(a) \tif it is\nunconstitutional;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(b) \tif it is dehors the\nprovisions of the Act and the Regulations;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(c) \tIf the delegatee has\nacted beyond its power of delegation;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(d) \tif the executive policy\nis contrary to the statutory or a larger\n \n\n\n \tpolicy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1702971\" id=\"span_6\">10.\tA three-judge-bench of the\nSupreme Court earlier in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1702971/\" id=\"a_12\">Union of India and another v.

It has its roots long\nback and its scope and extent varies from case to case. It is\nconsidered to be the basic feature of the Constitution. The\nCourt in exercise of its power of judicial review would jealously\nguard the human rights, fundamental rights and the citizens&#x27; right of\nlife and liberty as also many non-statutory powers of Governmental\nbodies as regards their control over property and assets of various\nkinds which could be expended on building hospitals, roads and the\nlike, or overseas aid,or compensating victims of crime\n(See for example,\n<a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_13\">R. v. Secretary of State</a> for the Home Department, ex parte Fire\nBrigades Union (1995) 2 WLR 1.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">31. \tThe Court, however,\nexercises its power of restraint in relation to interference of\npolicy. In his recent book &#x27;Constitutional Reform in the UK&#x27; at page\n105, Dawn Oliver commented thus :\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">&quot;However, this concept\nof democracy as rights-based with limited governmental power, and in\nparticular of the role of the Courts in a democracy, carries high\nrisks for the Judges - and for the public. Courts may interfere\ninadvisedly in public administration. The case of Bromley London\nBorough Council v. Greater London Council ((1983) 1 AC 768, HL) is a\nclassic example. The House of Lords quashed the GLC cheap fares\npolicy as being based on a misreading of the statutory provisions but\nwere accused of themselves misunderstanding transport policy in so\ndoing. The Courts are not experts in policy and public administration\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">- hence Jowell&#x27;s point that the Courts should not step beyond their\ninstitutional capacity (Jowell, 2000). Acceptance of this approach is\nreflected in the judgments of Laws LJ in International Transport Roth\nGmbH v Secretary of State for the Home Department ((2002) EWCA Civ\n158 (2002) 3 WLR 344) and of Lord Nimmo Smith in Adams v. Lord\nAdvocate (Court of Session, Times 8 August 2002) in which a\ndistinction was drawn between areas where the subject-matter lies\nwithin the expertise of the Courts (for instance, criminal justice,\nincluding sentencing and detention of individuals) and those which\nwere more appropriate for decision by democratically elected and\naccountable bodies. If the Courts step outside the area of their\ninstitutional competence, Government may react by getting Parliament\nto legislate to oust the jurisdiction of the Courts altogether. Such\na step would undermine the rule of law. Government and public opinion\nmay come to question the legitimacy of the Judges exercising judicial\nreview against Ministers and thus undermine the authority of the\nCourts and the rule of law.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">32. \tIt is not possible to\nlay down the standard exhaustively as to in what situation a writ of\nmandamus will issue and in what situation it will not.\nIn other words, exercise of its discretion by the Court will also\ndepend upon the law which governs the field, namely, whether it is a\nfundamental law or an ordinary law.&quot;\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(Emphasis\nby us).\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">11.\tBearing\nin mind the aforesaid proposition of law, we now propose to enter\ninto the questions involved in this case.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12.\tSo\nfar as the first question is concerned, i.e. whether\nany case has been made out for passing directions upon the State\nGovernment to cut down the arrangement of security by branding the\nsame as excess, we are of the view that the question as to the\narrangement of the security of the Chief Minister is exclusively\nwithin the domain of the Executives and it is for that branch to\ndecide the extent of security arrangement necessary for the\nprotection of the Chief Minister having regard to the nature of\nsecurity threats. The court in that field cannot pass any direction\nupon the Executives regarding the extent of security necessary for\nthe above purpose. Regarding the allegation of unnecessary\nexpenditure of public money for the security of the respondent no. 3,\nwe propose to rely upon the observations of this very bench in a\nrecent case of\nRAJESH\nLAXMICHAND MOTA Versus THE STATE OF GUJARAT THROUGH THE CHIEF\nSECRETARY &amp; OTHERS\nbeing Writ Petition (PIL) No.21 of 2012\ndisposed of on February 21, 2012 while deciding the question of\nextent of jurisdiction of a writ-court in a Public Interest\nLitigation to question the expenditures made by a State for any\ncause:\n</p>\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\t\t&quot;In\nthe background of this analysis of the constitutional scheme on\nfinancial power of the State, we do not think this Court is competent\nto go into the question as to whether the expenditure incurred by the\nGovernment is for a public purpose or not, or whether it is wise or\nnot. Our Constitution envisages that the executive is responsible to\nthe legislature and every policy and action is subject to its\nscrutiny and that is in consonance with Westminister system of\nParliamentary democracy. Judicial interference is permissible when\nthe action of the Government is unconstitutional and not when such\naction is not wise or that the extent of expenditure is not for good\nof the State. All such questions must be thrashed out in the\nlegislature and not in Courts. The complaint of the petitioner is in\nthe nature of criticism of the Governmental expenditure and the\nwisdom thereof. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\t\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_8\">But, we are of the view\nthat such an exercise can be done only in other forums and in the\nmanner and method as suggested by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_14\">Common Cause</a>\n(supra)\nand not before this Court. If such questions are allowed to be raised\nbefore court, every expenditure of the State can be called in\nquestion, both as to the nature and extent thereof, in which event\nthe functioning of the Government itself will be hampered.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">13.\tWe,\ntherefore, hold that the question of expenditure for the security of\nthe Respondent no. 3 is beyond the province of this court.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">14.\tHowever, in making such\narrangement if the Executives take any step, which directly invades\nany of the legal or fundamental rights of a citizen, a writ-court is\ndefinitely entitled to pass appropriate order for protecting the\nlegal and the fundamental right of a citizen.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">15.\tIn the case before us, the\npetitioner failed to disclose even the names of the two patients who\nallegedly died after being deprived of medical treatment due to\nrestraint order passed by the police authority while passing the\nconvoy of the Chief Minster. Thus, the aforesaid allegation is\nwithout any basis. However, the fact that due to the measures\nrequired to be adopted for the security of the Respondent No. 3 as\ncontained in the Secret Rules and Instruction derangement of traffic\nsystem is inevitable has not been  seriously disputed by the learned\nGovernment Pleader and such fact has also been proved by the\nphotographs published in the newspaper annexed to the application.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">16.\tWe have gone through the\nRules and Instructions for the protection of the Chief Minister of\nGujarat issued by the Government of Gujarat, Home Department which\nhave been placed before us by Mr. Jani. In the said Rules and\nInstructions, although it is provided that\nthe traffic should be stopped at inter-sections for\na minimum period\nwithout compromising with the security, no provision has been made\nregarding smooth passage of Fire Brigade, Ambulance or the vehicles\ncarrying patients. Even no indication has been given defining the\nminimum period\nof detention of ordinary vehicles or pedestrians for passing of the\nconvoy of the Chief Minister in those Rules and Instructions.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">17.\tIn our opinion, although\nMr. Jani is quite justified in contending that there should not be\nany compromise with the security arrangement of the Chief Minister,\nyet, we cannot lose sight of the fact that in the process of\nmaintaining the security arrangement, it is the duty of the State to\nsee there is no inconvenience caused to the ordinary public in their\ndaily activities. In a State like Gujarat, where the temperature in\nthe summer rises up to 45 degree Centigrade, it is inhuman to compel\nthe Scooterists or pedestrians to wait under the sun without\nmovement. An infant or aged person above 60 years of age may become\nseriously ill if he is asked to wait in such circumstances for even\n15 minutes. The cases of patient are needless to mention.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">18.\tThe State, in our opinion,\nis also under obligation to take into consideration the fact that the\nexaminees are required to reach their examination centres in time,\nthe employees are under compulsion to attend their office punctually,\nthe students are required to reach their schools and colleges at a\ngiven hour and the doctors are required to attend their patients in\nemergency. In fact, everybody in a civilized society has his own\ntime-schedule and has a right to demand that the same should not be\ndisturbed.  Thus, the period of detention should be minimal and\nshould not ordinarily exceed the time of stoppage experienced by a\ncitizen in an ordinary traffic control signal. The State, in this\nconnection, should adopt the procedures followed in advanced foreign\ncountries in regulating the security arrangement of the dignitaries\nof the States. \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">19.\tWe, therefore, direct the\nState-Respondents to incorporate in the Rules and Instruction\nspecific direction regarding smooth passage of the traffic so that\nthe rights of the ordinary citizen are in no way affected and at the\nsame time, the action of the State in maintaining security of the\nhigh dignitaries in no way violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia. In the existing Rules and Instruction, the direction regarding\ndetention of the ordinary vehicles is framed in a vague manner, which\nis capable of being abused. In other words, unbridled power has been\ngiven to police authority to detain the running vehicles and\npedestrians in the name of security arrangement without providing any\nguidelines as to time of detention of the vehicles or making\nalternative ways of public and meeting their emergent situations.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">20.\tAs pointed out by the\nSupreme Court in the case of District\nRegistrar and Collector, Hyderabad vs. Canara Bank reported in AIR\n2005 SC 186, any law\ninterfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple\ntest: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must\nwithstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred\nunder Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">(iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">14.

However, such Rule is not applicable to a\nmarriage party procession or funeral procession of a person who has\ndied natural death if the number of participants in such procession\nis less than one hundred.  Therefore, even according to the existing\nlegislation, only a procession containing maximum one hundred\npersons, which takes less than two minutes to pass through a\nparticular point, does not require permission. For detaining public\nfor more than that amount of time in a public place, the permission\nof a person holding responsible post of the Police Commissioner or\nhis delegated authority is necessary, whereas under the Secret Rules\nand Instruction framed for protection of the Respondent no. 3 no\nguidelines have given for preventing the public from its free use of\npublic streets.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">23.\tFor the above reasons, the\nRespondents are directed to constitute a high power committee of\nexperts who will find out the ways of removing the difficulties faced\nby the ordinary citizen and at the same time, take full measures in\nprotecting the securities of the high dignitaries.
