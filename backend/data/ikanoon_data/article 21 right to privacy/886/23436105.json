The technological age has produced digital platforms – not like the\n\nrailway platforms where trains were regulated on arrival and departure.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">These digital platforms can be imminently uncontrollable at times and\n\ncarry their own challenges. One form of digital platforms are the\n\nintermediaries that claim to be providing a platform for exchange of ideas\n\nwithout any contribution of their own. It is their say that they are not\n\nresponsible for all that transpires on their platform; though on complaints\n\nbeing made, they do remove offensive content based on their internal\n\nguidelines. The power and potentiality of these intermediaries is vast,\n\nrunning across borders. These are multinational corporations with large\n\nwealth and influence at their command. By the very reason of the\n\nplatform they provide, their influence extends over populations across\n\nborders. Facebook is one such corporation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">2.    A testament to the wide-ranging services which Facebook offers is\n\n1 “Preface”; See A. M. Singhvi et. al., The Law of Emergency Powers –\nComparative Common Law Perspectives (Springer, 2020).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        [2]</span>\n\fthe fact that it has about 2.85 billion monthly active users as of March,\n\n2021.2 This is over 1/3rd of the total population of this planet. In the\n\nnational context, Facebook is the most popular social media platform in\n\nIndia with about 270 million registered users. Such vast powers must\n\nnecessarily come with responsibility. Entities like Facebook have to\n\nremain accountable to those who entrust them with such power. While\n\nFacebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a\n\nvoice to the voiceless and a means to escape state censorship, we cannot\n\nlose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for\n\ndisruptive messages, voices, and ideologies. The successful functioning\n\nof a liberal democracy can only be ensured when citizens are able to\n\nmake informed decisions. Such decisions have to be made keeping in\n\nmind a plurality of perspectives and ideas. The information explosion in\n\nthe digital age is capable of creating new challenges that are insidiously\n\nmodulating the debate on issues where opinions can be vastly divided.\n\nThus, while social media, on the one hand, is enhancing equal and open\n\ndialogue between citizens and policy makers; on the other hand, it has\n\nbecome a tool in the hands of various interest groups who have\n2 Facebook, Press Release, Facebook reports 1st Quarter 2021 Results, (2021)\naccessible at https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/facebook-reports-first-\nquarter-2021-results-301279518.html.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                          [3]</span>\n\frecognised its disruptive potential. This results in a paradoxical outcome\n\nwhere extremist views are peddled into the mainstream, thereby\n\nspreading misinformation. Established independent democracies are\n\nseeing the effect of such ripples across the globe and are concerned.\n\nElection and voting processes, the very foundation of a democratic\n\ngovernment, stand threatened by social media manipulation. This has\n\ngiven rise to significant debates about the increasing concentration of\n\npower in platforms like Facebook, more so as they are said to employ\n\nbusiness models that are privacy-intrusive and attention soliciting. 3 The\n\neffect on a stable society can be cataclysmic with citizens being\n\n‘polarized and parlayzed’ by such “debates”, dividing the society\n\nvertically. Less informed individuals might have a tendency to not verify\n\ninformation sourced from friends, or to treat information received from\n\npopulist leaders as the gospel truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">3.    It is interesting to note that the Oxford Dictionary in 2016 chose\n\n“Post-Truth” as the word of the year. The adjective has been defined as\n\n“relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less\n\n\n3 UNESCO, Concept Note, Media for Democracy, Journalism and Elections in times\nof           Misinformation,              (2019)          accessible        at:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/wpfd2019_concept_note_en.pdf.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                           [4]</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\finfluential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and\n\npersonal belief.”4 This expression has a period relevance when it came to\n\nbe recognised contextually with divided debates about the 2016 US\n\nPresidential Elections and Brexit – two important events with effects\n\nbeyond their territorial limits. The obfuscation of facts, abandonment of\n\nevidentiary standards in reasoning, and outright lying in the public sphere\n\nleft many aghast. A lot of blame was sought to be placed at the door of\n\nsocial media, it being a source of this evolving contemporary\n\nphenomenon where objective truth is becoming a commodity with\n\ndiminishing value. George Orwell, in his 1943 essay titled “Looking\n\nBack on the Spanish War” had            expressed “…the very concept of\n\nobjective truth is fading out of the world. After all, the chances are that\n\nthose lies, or at any rate similar lies will pass into history”5 – the words\n\nhave proved to be prophetic.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.    In the conspectus of the aforesaid, it is difficult to accept the\n\nsimplistic approach adopted by Facebook - that it is merely a platform\n\nposting third party information and has no role in generating, controlling\n\n4    Oxford      Dictionary Word    of   the    Year   2016,   accessible    at:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2016/.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">5 See K.

The endeavour to hide behind such\n\nsimplistic models have been found to be unacceptable by the UK\n\nParliament. The House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\n\nSelect Committee in its 2018 Report had opined that this would amount\n\nto shirking of their responsibilities with respect to content regulation on\n\ntheir site.6\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">5.     Serious questions have been raised about whether there is a faulty\n\narchitecture of such intermediary platforms and whether the kind of free,\n\nliberal debate which they sought to encourage has itself become a\n\ncasualty, defeating the very objective of providing that platform. It is too\n\nlate in the day for companies like Facebook to deny that they use\n\nalgorithms (which are sequences of instructions) with some human\n\nintervention to personalise content and news to target users. The\n\nalgorithms select the content based on several factors including social\n\nconnections, location, and past online activity of the user. These\n\nalgorithms are often far from objective with biases capable of getting\n\n\n6 Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, U.K. House of Commons,\nDisinformation and &#x27;fake news&#x27;: Final Report, 20-44 (18/02/2019), accessible at:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/1791/1791.\npdf.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                            [6]</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\freplicated and reinforced.

In fact, in the proceedings before us, it is their contention that there\n\nare times when they are at the receiving end of both groups alleging bias\n\ntowards the other but then this is a sequitur to their ability to decide\n\nwhich content to amplify, suggest, and elevate. Internationally, Facebook\n\nhas had to recognise its role in failing to prevent division and incitement\n\nof offline violence in the context of the stated ethnic cleansing in\n\nMyanmar where a crescendo of misinformation and posts, somehow\n\nmissed by Facebook employees, helped fuel the violence. 7 The platform\n\nsimilarly apologised for its lack of serious response to evident signs of\n\nabuse of the platform in Sri Lanka, which again is stated to have stoked\n\nwidespread violence in 2018 in the country and had to acknowledge its\n\nneed to be regulated though the exact method is still unclear and a\n\nprerogative of law making authority.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">7 Facebook admits it was used to &#x27;incite offline violence&#x27; in Myanmar , BBC\n(06/11/2018), accessible at: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46105934.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">Joshua Brustein, Facebook Apologizes for Role in Sri Lankan Violence , Bloomberg\n(13/05/2020), accessible at: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-\n12/facebook-apologizes-for-role-in-sri-lankan-violence.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                            [7]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">\f7.    There have been endeavours in light of the aforesaid by countries\n\nlike Australia, US, the UK, and the EU for ways to regulate platforms\n\nsuch as Facebook in an efficient manner but their efforts are still at a\n\nnascent stage as studies are undertaken to understand the dynamism of\n\nthe platform and its disruptive potential. A recent example has been\n\nAustralia’s effort to formulate a legislation that would require Facebook\n\nto pay publishers for using their news stories. The law was seen as a tool\n\nto regulate the platform’s unchecked influence over political discourse,\n\nsociety, and democracy. In response, Facebook blocked all news on its\n\nplatform across the country with the result that there was some relaxation\n\nbut ultimately a via media was found. The US has also seen heated\n\ndebates arising from the 2016 Presidential elections with allegations of\n\nsupposed interference by Russia allegedly facilitated by platforms like\n\nFacebook. Last year, the EU formulated legislative proposals namely the\n\nDigital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, setting out rules for\n\nplatforms to follow.8\n8 News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code Bill, 2020 was\nformulated by Australia; See Alex Barker, Jamie Smyth et al., Facebook bans\nAustralian news as impact of media law is felt globally, Financial Times\n(18/02/2021), accessible at: https://www.ft.com/content/cec5d055-c2d1-4d5f-\na392-a6343beb0b01.

We have penned down a detailed introduction to appreciate the\n\ngravity of what was debated before us in the context of Facebook’s hands\n\noff approach, who have urged that they cannot be compelled to\n\nparticipate in proceedings of Sub Committees formed by the Parliament\n\nor the Legislative Assemblies. The immense power that platforms like\n\nFacebook wield has stirred a debate not only in our country but across the\n\nworld. The endeavour has been to draw a line between tackling hate\n\nspeech and fake news on the one hand and suppressing legitimate speech\n\nwhich may make those in power uncomfortable, on the other. This\n\ndelicate balance has thus far only been maintained by the intermediaries\n\nby being value-neutral. The significance of this is all the more in a\n\ndemocracy which itself rests on certain core values. This unprecedented\n\ndegree of influence necessitates safeguards and caution in consonance\n\nwith democratic values.

The second development took place on 31.08.2020 when the\n\nChairman of the Committee held a press conference (“the press\n\nconference”) wherein he summarised the complaints received in the\n\nhearings conducted between 25.08.2020 and 31.08.2020. In this process,\n\nhe stated that it prima facie appeared that Facebook had colluded with\n\nvested interests during the Delhi riots in February, 2020. Comments were\n\nalso made by the Chairman to the effect that Facebook ought to be treated\n\nas a co-accused and an independent investigation should be carried out\n\ninto its role in the riots. It was stated that if the investigation uncovered\n\nstrong evidence against Facebook, a supplementary chargesheet should\n\nbe filed in this regard (we may note here itself that the stand taken during\n\nthe course of arguments was that these were not the Chairman’s own\n\nviews but were merely the views expressed by the Committee). Since\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                        [19]</span>\n\fFacebook had not been heard, it was observed in the press conference\n\nthat before any action is taken in writing, Facebook should be given a\n\nchance to appear before the Committee.        Consequently, notice for\n\nappearance was issued on 10.09.2020 (“First Impugned Summons”) by\n\nthe Assembly to Mr. Ajit Mohan in the capacity of Vice President and\n\nManaging Director of Facebook India. The First Impugned Summons\n\nhighlighted the factum of numerous complaints alleging intentional\n\nomission and deliberate inaction on the part of Facebook in tackling hate\n\nspeech online. The Article was also referred to and Mr. Ajit Mohan was\n\ncalled upon to deliver insights to the Committee with respect to Facebook\n\nIndia’s internal functioning and enforcement of policies in view of the\n\nspecial knowledge that he possessed. It was clearly stated that he was\n\nbeing called as a witness for testifying on oath before the Committee on\n\n15.09.2020. Significantly, no consequences in the form of breach of\n\nparliamentary privilege were intimated in case Mr. Ajit Mohan refused to\n\nappear.

It was Mr. Salve’s view, that this would not really\n\nbe a redeeming feature and the matter still had to be debated.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">24.   Notably, a discordant note did arise in the stands canvassed on\n\nbehalf of the Assembly by Dr. Singhvi and on behalf of the Committee by\n\nDr. Rajeev Dhavan.      In the perspective of Dr. Dhavan, the earlier\n\nsummons were as good in law as the New Summons and, thus, it made\n\nno difference. Obviously, Dr. Singhvi thought otherwise, as there would\n\nhave been no occasion to withdraw the earlier summons and issue a fresh\n\nsummons. We say so as this is one aspect emphasised in the course of\n\narguments in rejoinder by Mr. Salve.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">25.   One aspect to be noticed is that the New Summons dated\n\n03.02.2021 has been issued by the Deputy Secretary of the Committee.\n\nThus, on the one hand, the Committee deemed it appropriate to withdraw\n\nthe earlier summons and issue a fresh one (apparently wiser after some\n\narguments from Mr. Salve and possibly some remarks of the Court) while\n\non the other hand as an intervening entity, peculiarly, the stand of Dr.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                    [32]</span>\n\fDhavan was that this was not required to be done! On this, we say no\n\nmore.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_59\">\nThe Submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">26.     In his opening arguments Mr. Salve punched hard on the issue that\n\nniceties aside, one has to consider the true intent with which the\n\nsummons was issued. In short, it was his say that the objective was to\n\nfile a supplementary chargesheet and rope in Facebook. To substantiate\n\nthis contention, he refers to three factors, i.e. (a) Para 4 (vii) read with 4\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">(i) of the terms of reference of the Committee; (b) the Article and (c) the\n\npress conference dated 31.08.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">27.     The aforesaid was in the background of what was a politically\n\npolarised issue and Mr. Salve contended that the Petitioner had no intent\n\nto become part of such a debate. The parent company (Facebook Inc.)\n\nbeing an intermediary based in the US, could hardly be expected to be\n\nroped into this political battle which formed the basis of the summonses\n\nthat have been issued. It was emphasised that the Committee’s actions\n\namounted to a clear and present danger of coercive action, which was in\n\nviolation of Petitioner No. 1’s fundamental rights. In the process of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                         [33]</span>\n\freading his note of arguments, which were more detailed with different\n\nnuances, broadly four issues were sketched out:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">       Does a House have a privilege to summon a person to give\n\n          evidence who is not directly or indirectly part of the executive?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">       Do powers of privilege extend to summoning an individual and\n\n          compelling them to give evidence on matters of fact or seek\n\n          their opinion on any subject matter?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">       If there does indeed exist a privilege, how is the same to be\n\n          reconciled with an individual’s right to privacy and free speech?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">       Is the House constrained by the subject matter which constitutes\n\n          a part of the business of the House relating to its legislative\n\n          functions?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">In light of these four issues canvassed by Mr. Salve, we propose to set out\n\nthe detailed arguments and thereafter proceed with our analysis under\n\nthree broad heads – (a) the privileges issue, (b) privilege, right to privacy\n\nand free speech and (c) legislative competence.\nPrivilege Issue\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">28.   Mr. Salve took us through the history of the notion of privilege,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                        [34]</span>\n\fhow it emanated, and how it is to be understood in the current context.\n\nHe urged that privilege is a special right enjoyed by the House as a shield\n\nin order to enable it to work without fear or interference. It owes its\n\norigination in the United Kingdom under the rubric of the constitutional\n\nrole of the House of Commons (functioning as a court). This role,\n\nhowever, has to be appropriately adapted to the Indian Constitution\n\nwhere there is a sharp separation of powers. A distinction was, thus,\n\nsought to be drawn that while privileges have arisen by virtue of House\n\nof Commons being a Court (with powers such as summoning persons to\n\nits “bar”) it cannot be read into the privileges of a Parliament of a\n\nrepublic. It was, thus, argued that in the Indian context, parliamentary\n\nprivileges are strictly restricted to legislative functions. Privileges serve\n\nthe distinct purpose of safeguarding the integrity of the legislative\n\nfunctions against obstructions which could be caused by either members\n\nor non-members. Learned counsel sought to refer to certain judicial\n\npronouncements in this behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184521\" id=\"span_36\">(i) In <a href=\"/doc/184521/\" id=\"a_7\">State of Karnataka v.

Thus, they\n\ncould not be expanded into those of the House of Commons in\n\nEngland     for all purposes. The Constitution is sovereign or\n\nsupreme and thus, the Parliament as well as each legislature of the\n\nState in India enjoys only such legislative powers as the\n\nConstitution confers upon it. A distinction was made in the role\n\nperformed by the Parliament and Legislative Assembly while\n\nexercising its legislative power as against a court of justice. In\n\ntaking up proceedings which are quasi judicial in cases of\n\ncontempt of its authority and motions concerning its “privileges”\n\nand “immunities”, the House only seeks removal of obstructions to\n\nthe due performance of its legislative functions.

The alleged improper exemption of land was only an\n\n      executive act and it did not distort, obstruct, or threaten the\n\n      integrity of legislative proceedings in any manner observed the\n\n      Constitution Bench of five Judges. In coming to the conclusion,\n\n      the scope of the powers, privileges and immunities available under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1653644/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 105(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_13\">194(3)</a> have been discussed in paras 33 to 37.\n\n      It was noticed that they were not codified by way of statute till date\n\n      and, thus, the Supreme Court held that it could consider the\n\n      principles and precedents relatable to the British House of\n\n      Commons.

The distinctive\n                mark of a privilege is its ancillary character. The\n                privileges of Parliament are rights which are ‘absolutely\n                necessary for the due execution of its powers.’ They are\n                enjoyed by individual Members, because the House\n                cannot perform its functions without unimpeded use of\n                the services of its Members; and by each House for the\n                protection of its Members and the vindication of its own\n                authority and dignity.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196586094\" id=\"span_42\">(iii) The next judgment relied upon is in the case of Justice (Retd.)\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/196586094/\" id=\"a_15\">Markandey Katju v.

Since it provoked no response, these resolutions\n\n        were sought to be assailed by Justice (Retd.) Katju in judicial\n\n        proceedings before this Court. Since no aspect of privilege was\n\n        invoked and it was an expression of the views of the Parliament\n\n        falling within the domain of freedom of speech in Parliament, the\n\n        petition was rejected. It is in that context that a distinction was\n\n        made between the exercise of contempt or breach of privilege\n\n        where action was sought to be initiated against a citizen,-whether a\n\n        member or a non-member. The law has developed that the action\n\n        of such citizen must have interfered with fundamental functioning\n\n        of the House so as to enable the House to initiate any proceedings\n\n        against the citizen.

Similarly Rules 187 to 203 of the Rajya Sabha Rules\n\n      deal with issues concerning privileges. Thus, an inquiry would be\n\n      along the lines submitted by the petitioner only if such a privilege\n\n      action was proposed to be taken which was not so in that case.\n\n\nIn the conspectus of the aforesaid legal principles, it was urged that the\n\npetitioners in the instant case being non-members could only be\n\nsummoned if they had intruded upon any functions of the Assembly.\n\nTheir non-appearance or unwillingness to participate in the debate in\n\nwhich they were compelled to participate did not in any manner disrupt\n\nthe functioning of the Committee so as to face the consequences of\n\nbreach   of   privilege.   The   Committee    could   always   make     its\n\nrecommendations but the petitioners do not want to be part of it. There\n\nwere no legislative functions to be performed and thus, the contention\n\nwas that this was a case of expanding unbridled privileges in the garb of\n\nan amorphous set of rules to make an exception to the rule of law. As\n\nsuch, it was argued that the Terms of Reference had to be given a\n\nrestrictive meaning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_81\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                       [41]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">\f29.      Next, Mr. Salve sought to deal with the issue of judicial scrutiny of\n\nproceedings of the Assembly by seeking to canvas that there is no\n\nabsolute bar on Courts to look into the validity of the proceedings of the\n\nAssembly. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 212</a> of the Constitution read with\n\nrelevant sections of the GNCTD Act, if proceedings adopted by the\n\nAssembly suffer from lack of jurisdiction or are illegal or\n\nunconstitutional, a challenge can be made before the competent court.\n\nLearned senior counsel relied upon judicial pronouncements in Special\n\nReference No.1 of 196418, Raja Ram Pal v.

In Special Reference No.1 of 196421 the dispute arose out of a\n\nconflict between the legislature and the judiciary, if one may say so, as a\n\nconsequence of the power exercised by the U.P. Assembly in sentencing\n\none Keshav Singh to be detained in a civil prison for a period of 7 days\n\nand the judiciary (Allahabad High Court) enlarging him on bail\n\nthereafter. This was taken as an affront by the legislature, which passed a\n\n18   Supra note 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">19   Supra note 15.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">20   (2018) 7 SCC 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">21   Supra note 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                         [42]</span>\n\fresolution against the two concerned judges to be brought in custody\n\nbefore the House. A Full Bench of 28 judges consisting of the strength of\n\nthe Court thereafter assembled to deal with the petitions filed by the two\n\njudges against this resolution. The bench restrained the Speaker from\n\nissuing a warrant against the judges and the Marshal of the House from\n\nexecuting the warrant.      In order to resolve this confrontation, the\n\nPresident of India decided to exercise the power to make a reference to\n\nthis Court under <a href=\"/doc/4015076/\" id=\"a_17\">Art. 143(1)</a> of the Constitution. The reference was on the\n\nimportant question of the exercise of powers, privileges and immunities\n\nof the State legislature vis-à-vis the power of the High Court and the\n\nJudges to discharge their duties. Suffice to say that the opinion rendered\n\nby the Court in the reference was that the powers conferred on the High\n\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and the authority of the\n\nSupreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution are not subject to any\n\nrestrictions. It could not be said that a citizen cannot move the High\n\nCourt or the Supreme Court to invoke its jurisdiction, even in cases\n\nwhere fundamental rights have been violated. Once the judiciary was\n\nauthorized to consider the validity of the actions of the legislature, it was\n\nopined that the judiciary cannot be prevented from scrutinizing the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                        [43]</span>\n\fvalidity of the actions of the legislatures trespassing on the fundamental\n\nrights conferred on the citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">31.   In Raja Ram Pal22 a private channel’s telecast based on a sting\n\noperation in the “cash for query case” where 10 Members of Parliament\n\naccepted money through middlemen to raise certain questions in the\n\nHouse resulted in an inquiry and subsequent expulsion of these members\n\nfrom the House. The members challenged the said expulsion. The three\n\nquestions framed by the Supreme Court were all answered in the\n\naffirmative – (i) that the Supreme Court within our constitutional scheme\n\nhas the jurisdiction to decide the content and scope of powers, privileges\n\nand immunities of the legislature and its members; (ii) the power and\n\nprivileges of the legislature in India, in particular reference to <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_20\">Article\n\n105</a> of the Constitution, includes the power of expulsion of its members;\n\nand (iii) in case of expulsion, the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to\n\ninterfere to exercise such power and privileges. While rejecting the plea\n\non expulsion, the Court expounded on the scope of such judicial review.\n\nSignificantly, it was opined that though there would be a presumption\n\nthat the Parliament would always perform its functions and exercise its\n\n22 Supra note 15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                     [44]</span>\n\fpowers within a reasonable manner, there could be no scope for a general\n\nrule that the exercise of power by the legislature was not amenable to\n\njudicial review. This would neither be in the letter nor the spirit of the\n\nConstitution. The touchstone, however, would not be that of an ordinary\n\nadministrative action but the legislature could not be said to have the\n\nlicence even to commit a jurisdictional error.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">32.   In Kalpana Mehta and Ors.23 a vaccination drive conducted by\n\nNGOs without the vaccine going through all the pre-requisite trials\n\ncaused loss of life, resulting in a parliamentary standing committee being\n\nconstituted to inquire into the matter.       The report of the standing\n\ncommittee was sought to be relied on in a Public Interest Litigation\n\ndealing with the issue. The question which arose was whether such a\n\nreport of a standing committee could be relied upon in the judicial\n\nreview. The relevant observations for our purposes are the summary of\n\nconclusions which deal with the judicial review of such legislative action.\n\nIt was opined that constitutional courts are not prevented from\n\nscrutinising the validity of the actions of the legislature trespassing on the\n\nfundamental rights conferred on the citizens. There could, thus, be no\n\n23 Supra note 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                         [45]</span>\n\fimmunity to parliamentary proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1653644/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 105(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution though it was subject to the restriction contained in other\n\nconstitutional provisions such as <a href=\"/doc/1283667/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 122</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 212.</a>           The\n\nprohibition on the jurisdiction of the Court was restricted to the ground of\n\nirregularity of procedure but if the proceedings are tainted on account of\n\nsubstantive or gross illegality or unconstitutionality, there would be no\n\nprotection against judicial scrutiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_94\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">33.   Finally, on the issue of privileges, Mr. Salve referred to the\n\nprevalent position in some other countries regarding the exercise of\n\nprivilege powers. It was contended that such privilege powers could not\n\nbe used to compel speech, more so when the organisation in question is\n\nan American corporation. We may notice at this stage itself that we really\n\ndo not appreciate the second limb of this submission.          When these\n\ncorporations are working within the territory of our country and are\n\nsubject to the jurisdiction of this Court, then what kind of special\n\nprivilege would they have by reason of being an American corporation or\n\na corporation incorporated in any other country! Now turning to the two\n\nenactments sought to be referred to by learned senior counsel – the first\n\none is the Scotland Act, 1998, more specifically <a href=\"/doc/1514290/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 23</a> and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                                       [46]</span>\n\fGovernment of Wales Act, 2006, more specifically <a href=\"/doc/1619494/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 37</a>.

In the context of the aforesaid provisions, emphasis was laid on the\n\nexpression “may” to submit that there is no element of compulsion. The\n\nsecond aspect emphasised was that, as these legislations suggest,\n\nprivilege should relate to matters in connection with functions of the\n\nministers. This in turn was sought to be linked with the argument that\n\nwhat the Committee was seeking to perform was not a core function of\n\nthe Assembly and thus, cannot be said to be their function. Further, if\n\nonly an opinion was being sought, as had been urged by the respondents,\n\nthen it was submitted that oath could only be on a question of fact and\n\nnot a matter of opinion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_103\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">35.   Learned senior counsel also assailed the intent of the New\n\nSummons as only a subterfuge. Compelling experts to give an opinion in\n\na democratic polity, it was argued, would be an “abhorrent proposition”\n\nas it could only be a voluntary act. As such, the act of Assembly it was\n\nstated, reeked of constitutional arrogance. In fact, what senior counsel\n\nsought to stress was that his submission was not challenging the exercise\n\nof privilege power but the very existence of the same. In this behalf it\n\nwas stressed that the Assembly (the Committee being only a smaller\n\ngroup constituted) would have to reconcile with where their powers to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                     [48]</span>\n\fsummon originate from. Entry 39 of List II (Powers, privileges and\n\nimmunities of the Legislative Assemblies) could not be a source of power\n\nof the Assembly and the scenario was rather of a statutory source of\n\npower emanating from Section 18 of the GNCTD Act, which was enacted\n\nin pursuance of <a href=\"/doc/47094705/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 239AA (3)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/45318/\" id=\"a_27\">(3)(b)</a> of the Constitution. Thus,\n\na distinction was sought to be made between a power directly emanating\n\nfrom the Constitution and one flowing from a statutory provision. In the\n\ngiven facts, this was a case of the latter, which, it was urged would\n\nnecessarily have to be tested on the touchstone of Part III of the\n\nConstitution.   The relevant provisions are extracted hereinunder to\n\nappreciate the controversy:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_105\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">      “Article 239AA (3)(a) and (3)(b)\n      239AA.

It appears that the petitioners wanted to avail of the benefit of\n\nanother senior counsel, possibly to further buttress their submissions and\n\nthus, Mr. Arvind Datar, learned senior counsel sought to address us next,\n\non behalf of Petitioner No. 3, Facebook Inc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">38.    Mr. Datar, in an endeavour to trace out the constitutional history,\n\nreferred to the origin of powers and privileges by inviting our attention to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/14555586/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 71</a> of the Government of India Act, 1935. It was stressed that the\n\nprovincial legislatures had no powers but only privileges; they did not\n\nhave powers to punish people under that Act. Next, in the context of\n\nErskine May’s seminal commentary on Parliamentary Practices, it was\n\npointed out that Chapter XI deals with powers and Chapter XII deals with\n\nprivileges and immunities which are used interchangeably. 24         Power,\n\nhowever, remains, distinct. The primary power given to the House was\n\nto make laws or legislative powers. It is these powers from the Act of\n\n1935, which are stated to have been adopted under <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 194(3)</a> of the\n\n\n24 Erskine May’s Treatise on the law, privileges, proceedings, and usage of\nParliament, (Sir David Natzler, 25th Edition, 2019).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                                                       [51]</span>\n\fIndian Constitution, which applies to the State Government and every\n\nState Assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">39.   Learned senior counsel submitted that Delhi is different as it is on\n\na special footing being categorised as a Union Territory in <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 239AA</a>\n\nof the Constitution. Reiterating Mr. Salve’s argument, Mr. Datar stressed\n\nthat the powers and privileges conferred on the Delhi Assembly are not\n\nderived from the Constitution but by reason of statutory enactments, i.e.,\n\nSection 18 of the GNCTD Act.             The privilege and powers of the\n\nAssembly are, thus, undoubtedly to be tested against Part III of the\n\nConstitution. These being statutory in nature, the aspect of constitutional\n\nbalancing of powers with fundamental rights, as arose in In Special\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                             25</span>\nReference No.1 of 1964            and MSM Sharma26 does not arise in the\n\npresent case.       The privilege here is a “derivative” from an Act of\n\nParliament and not from any Constitutional provision.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_116\">40.   We now turn to the submissions of the respondents on this issue,\n\nwhich were as vehemently argued. Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel\n\n\n\n\n25 Supra note 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">26 Supra note 14.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                                                      [52]</span>\n\fseeking to address submissions on behalf of the Assembly, sketched out\n\nthe contours of his submissions as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">      (i) The occasion to argue privilege has not even arisen and was\n\n          premature as there was no actual notice of privilege. There\n\n          was, thus, no factual matrix before the Court to analyse the\n\n          exercise of the power and what was being sought by the\n\n          petitioners qua the aspect of privilege amounted to seeking an\n\n          advance ruling on the issue.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">      (ii) Were the arguments of the petitioners to be accepted, it would\n\n          have wide ramifications on the working of the committees\n\n          across the nation both at the State as well as the Parliamentary\n\n          levels. The argument of the petitioners, it was urged, had the\n\n          propensity to destroy the system of committees which had been\n\n          found historically to do yeoman work, possibly away from the\n\n          more aggressive stances in the Parliament.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">      (iii)   The petitioners could not be conferred with the privilege to\n\n          appear before the kind of committees they want to appear\n\n          before. The petitioners admittedly had appeared on more than\n\n          one occasion of a similar nature without any qualms.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                     [53]</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">\f      (iv)   In the similar vein, the reference to the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_31\">IT Act</a> was premature\n\n         as the Assembly was not debating any legislation of the issue\n\n         but only discussing a particular aspect.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      (v) Arguments of the petitioners were premised on lack of mutual\n\n         respect and difference between the organs of our democracy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      (vi)   Committee proceedings are House proceedings and the\n\n         Supreme Court would normally never interfere with House\n\n         proceedings and therefore also not with committee proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_120\">41.   The obvious political divergence between Central Government and\n\nthe State Government came out quite openly during the arguments where\n\nDr. Singhvi sought to put forth the argument that the bold stand of the\n\npetitioners stood on a support base from the Central Government. The\n\nappearance before the Parliamentary Committee was sought to be\n\njustified by the petitioners as being based on commercial and operational\n\nreasons and not in view of any compulsion (an aspect disputed by learned\n\nSolicitor General on behalf of the Central Government). The petitioners,\n\nit was argued, were actually canvassing a case on absence of any\n\ncommercial and operational consequences/compulsions rather than lack\n\nof jurisdiction. It was, however, fairly assured and rightly so, that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                                      [54]</span>\n\fAssembly and the Committee were not oblivious to the constitutional\n\nexclusion of entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II and the respondent would never\n\ncontend to encroach upon this constitutional demarcation. One aspect\n\nwhich Dr. Singhvi sought to emphasise, in our view not very\n\nconvincingly, was that the issue of the press conference was an\n\nafterthought, raised by the petitioners to create prejudice. We say so as\n\nthe press conference being held is not in doubt nor what transpired there.\n\nThe only turn which Dr. Singhvi could seek to give to this is that what the\n\nChairman of the Committee mentioned in the press conference were\n\nviews of the persons who had deposed and not his own view per se. To\n\nsay the least, we find this submission very difficult to accept and we will\n\ndeal with it at the relevant stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\">42.   The other aspect which Dr. Singhvi pointed out was the withdrawal\n\nof the Second Impugned Summons and the New Summons being issued,\n\nwhich no longer compelled Petitioner No.1 to appear before the\n\nCommittee. However, this aspect has been labeled as a “subterfuge” by\n\nMr. Salve, on account of the divergent views taken on the aspect of\n\nwithdrawal by Dr. Singhvi and Dr. Dhavan– and surprisingly so.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                                                      [55]</span>\n\fConsequently Dr. Singhvi will have to bear the burden of the cross for the\n\nsame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_124\">43.     On the specific plea of privilege Dr. Singhvi commenced by\n\nseeking to establish that all committees of legislatures have the power to\n\nsummon and compel attendance. Any power, without subsidiary powers\n\nto ensure implementation, it was urged, was akin to having no power at\n\nall. The power to compel attendance by initiating privilege proceedings\n\nis therefore, an essential power. The argument was further supplemented\n\nwith the contention that the power of privileges was amorphous in\n\ncommon law and the Parliament has consciously not codified this area of\n\nlaw so that they can cater to unimagined situations in the future.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">44.     Dr. Singhvi, in fact, cautioned that this Court should not embark on\n\nthe path suggested by Mr. Salve, who had argued that it was time that\n\nthese privileges were codified. Dr. Singhvi urged this Court to not even\n\nopine on the necessity of codifying such privileges and that the same\n\nshould be left to the Parliament, if they so desire without any nudge by\n\nthis Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                       [56]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">\f45.   Dr. Singhvi sought to erase the distinction between the exercise of\n\nprivilege powers under the Constitution and under the GNCTD Act by\n\nputting them on the same pedestal, urging that the two together provide\n\nfor the scheme of operation. Learned senior counsel referred to\n\nprovisions (7)(a) &amp; (b) of <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 239AA</a> in the context that the GNCTD\n\nAct was not to be deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution for\n\npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 368</a> of the Constitution notwithstanding that it may\n\ncontain any provision which amends or has the effect of amending the\n\nConstitution. The Assembly was, thus, submitted to be a privileged body\n\nwith members enjoying freedom of speech in the House as well as\n\nfreedom to vote and had all the privileges (under Section 18 of the\n\nGNCTD Act) as are enjoyed by Members of Parliament. It was thus\n\nurged that calling into question the proceedings of the Committee\n\namounted to calling into question the proceedings of the Assembly in a\n\ncourt of law for which the powers were not vested. The regulation of the\n\nprocedure of conduct of business was not subject to jurisdiction of the\n\ncourts. In order to establish parity of the privilege powers, Dr. Singhvi\n\ndrew the attention of the Court to <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 105</a> of the Constitution, Section\n\n18 of the GNCTD Act coupled with Rule 172 of the Rules.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                                      [57]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_64\">46.   On this aspect, parity was sought to be drawn by relying on\n\nParliamentary privileges in Entry 74 of List I and that of the Legislative\n\nAssembly in Entry 39 of List II which were stated to be pari materia.\n\nDelhi was no different, it was submitted, and thus the powers of the\n\nAssembly are the same under entry 39 of List II as any other Assembly in\n\nthe context of <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 239AA</a> of the Constitution. To further amplify this\n\naspect, learned counsel sought to draw strength from the observations of\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_36\">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India and Anr.</a> 27 which\n\ncomprehensively dealt with the segregation of powers between the State\n\nand the Central Government in view of an ongoing conflict on various\n\nissues in this behalf. It was opined by this Court that all entries in List II\n\nwill have full play except three specific entries which were excluded, i.e.\n\nentries 1, 2 &amp; 18.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">47.   In view of <a href=\"/doc/47094705/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 239AA(3)(a)</a> the power to summon and compel\n\nattendance was stated to be akin to that of any other legislative assembly.\n\nTestimonies before committees were stated to be mostly under oath and\n\nthe rationale for the same was that the process was solemn in nature and\n\nthat it would improve the quality of debate. There was stated to be no\n\n27 (2018) 8 SCC 501.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                                         [58]</span>\n\fcompeting entry in List I and the question of repugnancy would only\n\narise in terms of any entry in List III where there are central statutes in a\n\ngiven scenario. The committees of legislatures all over the country\n\n(including Delhi), thus, possess the power to compel attendance of\n\nwitnesses as a part of their constitutionally recognized powers and\n\nprivileges and there could be no distinction based on the kind of\n\ncommittee or the type of person who is summoned in exercise of these\n\npowers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">48.   We may note another submission of Dr. Singhvi where he\n\ncautioned the court against ruling in a manner wished for by the\n\npetitioners on account of its wider ramifications especially in the context\n\nof observations made in Kalpana Mehta And Ors.28on the importance of\n\ncommittees. Any hampering of the working of the committee would\n\nhamper the working of the Assembly as passing laws is not the only\n\nfunction of the Assembly. Thus, the practice of passing resolutions by\n\nAssemblies on the sense of the house would be disrupted. On the\n\nsignificance of the working of these committees, it is not necessary to go\n\ninto depth as the issue has been well considered in Kalpana Mehta And\n\n28 Supra note 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                        [59]</span>\n\fOrs.29 We, thus, consider it appropriate to only extract some of the\n\nrelevant paragraphs:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">      66. Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, was\n      quoted as saying in 1885 that “it is not far from the truth to say that\n      Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst\n      Congress in its Committee rooms is Congress at work.” This is\n      because most of the work of Congress was referred to committees\n      for detailed review to inform debate on the floor of the House.”\n          ….        ….           ….           ….            ….           ….\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">      “70.

Investigation of a complicated\n      social problem, prior to legislation, maybe and is frequently carried\n      out by such legislative committees, the value of whose service\n      cannot be exaggerated. They are useful for obtaining expert advice\n      when the problem is a technical one involving several branches\n      within an organization, or when experts are required to advise\n      upon a highly technical problem definable within narrow limits.\n      The provision of advice based on an inquiry involving the\n      examination of witnesses is also a task suitable for a committee.\n      The employment of small committees, chosen from the members\n      of the House, for dealing with some of the items of the business of\n      the House is not only convenience but is also in accordance with\n      the established convention of Parliament.

Dr. Singhvi concluded by emphasising that not a single judicial\n\nprecedent had been cited from our country or outside where the Court\n\nhad intervened at the stage of summoning of a witness by the legislature\n\n(sub-committee). Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Madras\n\nHigh Court in <a href=\"/doc/869459/\" id=\"a_38\">C. Subramaniam v. The Speaker, Madras Legislative\n\nAssembly.30 In</a> this case, on a speech being made by a former Member of\n\nthe Madras Assembly a show-cause notice was issued by the Speaker of\n\nthe Assembly as to why his conduct should not be treated as a breach of\n\nprivilege. The endeavour to assail the notice was rejected by the Full\n\nBench of the High Court, on the short ground that it was premature at\n\nthat stage as no action had been taken. It was held to be akin to a writ of\n\n\n30 AIR 1969 Mad 10.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                                      [61]</span>\n\fprohibition restraining the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly from\n\nproceeding further, which was virtually on the ground of absence of an\n\nab initio jurisdiction. It was further opined that the power vested under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 194(3)</a> of the Constitution empowered the Speaker with the right\n\nto call upon a third party like the writ petitioner to show cause against an\n\nalleged breach of privilege by way of contempt. In the facts of the\n\npresent case, it was urged, even a show cause notice had not been issued\n\nas the Petitioner had only been called upon to depose. Thus, there was\n\nnot even an initiation of any privilege proceedings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_141\">50.    We now turn to the arguments of Dr. Rajeev Dhavan on behalf of\n\nthe Committee which sought to intervene in the present proceedings. We\n\nmay note at the threshold that the Committee is really a creation of the\n\nAssembly, but it appears that like the petitioners, the respondents wanted\n\nassistance of more than one counsel in the belief that it would further\n\nadvance their case. In the process, as noticed above, some contradiction\n\nof stand came into being regarding the implication of the issuance of the\n\nNew Summons and withdrawal of the old one.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                       [62]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">\f51.   Dr. Dhavan laid great emphasis on the main functions of the\n\nCommittee as enunciated, taking a cue from its very description as a\n\n“Peace and Harmony Committee.” The main functions, thus, were to\n\nconsider viewpoints across society about prevalence of such a situation\n\nwhich had the potential to disturb communal peace and harmony or\n\nwhere communal riots had occurred and to examine in detail and identify\n\nthe factors responsible for it. This was coupled with the mandate to\n\nundertake   scientific   study   on   religious,   linguistic,   and   social\n\ncompositions of the population of Delhi NCR, with a view to identify and\n\nstrengthen the factors which unite people despite their diversity. The\n\nCommittee also sought to recommend measures to be undertaken by the\n\ngovernment towards establishing communal harmony and peace in the\n\nState. We may note with some trepidation Dr. Dhavan’s submissions\n\nwhile seeking intervention that even if a writ was issued to the Assembly\n\nit could not be deemed to have been issued to the Committee because the\n\nCommittee was an autonomous body which would eventually report to\n\nthe Assembly and thus, enjoys a separate legal existence. Suffice for us\n\nto say at this stage that if the Committee is the creation of the Assembly\n\nand seeks to derive its powers and strength from the Assembly, it is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                        [63]</span>\n\fsurprising to note a submission that the -Committee would not be bound\n\nby a direction of this Court if it was not specifically made a party. Be that\n\nas it may, we did permit the Committee to intervene and to that extent\n\nthere was no objection from Mr. Salve.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">52.   The initial rebuttal to the challenge is based on the anticipatory\n\nnature of the proceedings, being presumptive and pre-emptive. There are\n\nseveral stages of scrutiny before a breach of privilege notice is even\n\nissued; much less any conviction arising from such a breach of privilege.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18076\" id=\"span_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"320843\" id=\"span_73\">53.   It was further contended that no factual basis had been laid for the\n\nconcerns regarding the First and Second Impugned Summons and the\n\npress conference. Fundamental rights could not be said to be violated by\n\na mere issuance of summons. There was stated to be lack of specificity of\n\nany claim of mala fides which could not be general in character but must\n\nbe specifically pleaded and proved by all material particulars in relation\n\nto the persons concerned.31 This was an aspect absent in the present case.\n\nDr. Dhavan categorised the writ petition as a SLAPP (<a href=\"/doc/320843/\" id=\"a_40\">Strategic Lawsuit\n\n\n\n\n31 State of Madhya Pradesh v. Nandlal Jaiswal</a> (1986) 4 SCC 566; <a href=\"/doc/18076/\" id=\"a_41\">K.

Dr. Dhavan clarified the statements made by Mr. Raghav Chadha\n\nduring the press conference on 31.08.2020 to contend that it was merely a\n\nsummary of the complaints received by the Committee. They were stated\n\nnot to represent the Chairman’s views, the Committee’s conclusions or\n\nthe scope of the Committee’s functions. The Committee had not suo\n\nmoto decided that the petitioners were responsible for causing\n\ndisharmony. It had received complaints from several different people,\n\nwho specifically attributed the disharmony caused by the riots in Delhi to\n\nFacebook. The statements made in the press conference were, thus, not\n\nmade in bad faith and were simply repetitions of the depositions made to\n\nthe effect that Facebook may have had a role in the riots.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">55.   The contention on the Committee’s Terms of Reference\n\nrecommending criminal action was stated to be “toothless.” Thus, in a\n\nsense what was conceded was that the said part of the Committee’s Terms\n\nof Reference (i.e. in paragraph 4(vii)) was “otiose.” The Committee\n\ncould, at best, make recommendations. Whether criminal action was, in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                                     [65]</span>\n\ffact, initiated was entirely the remit of the police or the judiciary and in\n\nthat context no real threat was made to the petitioners either by the Terms\n\nof Reference or by the impromptu statements made by the Chairman in\n\nthe press conference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">56.   The aforesaid submissions, in our view, may have mollified the\n\npetitioners though apparently not Mr. Salve. As per his submissions, all\n\nthe aspects would have to be read together to come to a conclusion\n\nwhether the petitioners had a real concern to approach the Court or not.\n\nWe say so in the context of the Terms of Reference which included\n\nrecommending criminal action, the utterances of Mr. Raghav Chadha in\n\nthe press conference (undoubtedly in the background of the depositions\n\nbefore the Committee) and the limitation on the legislative domain by\n\ncarving out of certain entries from List II as applicable to the Assembly.\n\nWe will pen down our view on this aspect at a later stage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">57.   We now come to arguments of Dr. Dhavan that were in sync with\n\nwhat Dr. Singhvi had argued, i.e., in view of the judicial observations,\n\nthese committees are the eyes and ears of the Parliament, essential for the\n\ndemocratic polity. The functions performed by the committees are part\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                                       [66]</span>\n\fof the core legislative functions of State Assemblies, which may include\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_154\">(a) supervising administration, (b) taking evidence on legislation, and (c)\n\ndealing with a crisis or governance generally. In that context, Dr. Dhavan\n\npointed out that the petitioners had not challenged the constitution of the\n\nCommittee itself or its Terms of Reference. The petitioners had also not\n\nchallenged the summons issued by the Parliament despite Parliament’s\n\nthreat to initiate breach of privilege proceedings in case they refused to\n\nappear. As such, Facebook could not be said to have any issues while\n\nappearing before the Parliamentary Committee.               The role of\n\nintermediaries in governance was relevant and the testimony of the\n\npetitioners was important in that context. The refusal was sought to be\n\nlabeled down as one relating to “political reasons.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">58.   Dr. Dhavan then turned to the aspect of the distinction drawn by\n\nDr. Singhvi between members and non-members in the context of the\n\nlegislature’s power to summon witnesses or initiate breach of privilege\n\nproceedings.   He canvassed that no rule existed as per which non-\n\nmembers have the power to refuse a summons issued by a legislative\n\ncommittee. The core function of the legislature is democracy and not just\n\nto legislate, an aspect we agree with. Thus, it was the obligation of every\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                                      [67]</span>\n\fperson to cooperate with the legislature and appear when requested to\n\nassist in the realisation of this core function. There were several ways in\n\nwhich the legislature may seek democratic participation, one example\n\nwas appearance before committees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">59.   In support of the aforesaid plea, Dr. Dhavan illustrated the\n\nproposition by giving instances of notices issued to non-members which\n\nalso form a subject matter of a treatise by Dr. Dhavan “Only the Good\n\nNews: On the Law of the Press in India” published in 1987.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">             “- Thaniram (1975), (1975) XX P.D.

On the constitutional status of the Assembly, Dr. Dhavan sought to\n\nmake a distinction between all Union Territories on the one hand, and\n\nDelhi and Puducherry on the other. A second distinction was made\n\nbetween the Delhi and the Puducherry Legislative Assemblies.          The\n\nsignificant distinction was stated to be that while the Puducherry\n\nLegislative Assembly was empowered by <a href=\"/doc/39412218/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 239A</a>, the Delhi\n\nLegislative Assembly was created through an exercise of constituent\n\npower by the 69th <a href=\"/doc/109948506/\" id=\"a_43\">Amendment Act, 1991</a>. Thus, while <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 239AA</a>\n\nexcluded police power and public order from the scope of the Assembly’s\n\ncompetence, that did not detract from it being a full-fledged working\n\nLegislative Assembly similar to the Parliament. This aspect was stated to\n\nbe reinforced by Sections 33 to 37 of the GNCTD Act. In Dr. Dhavan’s\n\nview, the powers of privilege of the Assembly could be traced to <a href=\"/doc/99143401/\" id=\"a_45\">Article\n\n239AA(2)</a> <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_46\">&amp; (7)</a> of the Constitution, Section 18(3) of the GNCTD Act\n\nand Rules 160 and 172(4) of the Rules.    Dr. Dhavan drew strength from\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1690488/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 212(1)</a> to canvas that the Constitution grants internal autonomy to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                     [69]</span>\n\feach House of the State legislature and the validity of any proceedings\n\ncannot be questioned on an allegation of “irregularity of procedure.”32\n\nThere were conceded to be limitations to <a href=\"/doc/1690488/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 212(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution and this Court had held that interference with the internal\n\nfunctioning of the State Legislative Assemblies can only be limited to\n\ncases of “gross illegality and unconstitutionality.” 33 No such illegality\n\nhaving occurred in this case and only a summons being issued, no\n\nproceedings for breach of privilege had been initiated and no question\n\nhad been asked. As such there was no occasion whatsoever to call for\n\ninterference by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_164\">61.   Akin to Dr. Singhvi’s submission, Dr. Dhavan also emphasised on\n\nthe sui generis nature of parliamentary powers and privileges and\n\nvehemently opposed the suggestion that these privileges needed to be\n\ncodified. The powers and privileges of the legislature do not require a\n\nlaw and learned senior counsel sought to repel the argument of Mr. Salve\n\nthat the amorphous nature of privileges offends the law and due process.\n\nIt would not amount to claiming privilege as they want, as the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized a “Lakshman Rekha” to confine the extent and\n32 Supra note 14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">33 Supra notes 12 and 15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                                     [70]</span>\n\fexercise of their powers.34 There could be many other legal concepts that\n\nare similarly amorphous or in HLA Hart’s language “open textured.”\n\nThis would not amount to ipso facto undermining the credibility of these\n\nconcepts or reducing the importance of the meaning given to them by the\n\nSupreme Court. Thus, at this stage, the only question was whether a\n\nsimpliciter   issuance   of   summons    from   a   sub-committee    was\n\nconstitutionally improper to which the answer should be in the negative.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_167\">62.   The last set of arguments on this point by Mr. Tushar Mehta,\n\nlearned Solicitor General of India, were in a limited contour.        He\n\nsupported learned counsel for the respondents on the power of the\n\nParliament and Assemblies per se to summon but that would be subject to\n\njudicial review.    However, his next submission was in sync with the\n\nsubmission of the petitioners that the Assembly lacks legislative\n\ncompetence to deal with the subject matter in question. That being his\n\nsubmission, it was felt that a complete argument on privilege was not\n\nrequired to be considered. In substance, his contention was that the\n\nsummonses could not have been issued because of lack of legislative\n\ncompetence but if the Assembly had the legislative competence, then the\n\n34 Supra note 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_168\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                     [71]</span>\n\fprinciples as enunciated by learned counsel for the respondents were the\n\ncorrect principles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">      Privileges, Free Speech and Privacy\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">63.   We have dealt with the aspect of rival contentions arising from the\n\nprivilege of the House to summon a person, to compel them to give\n\nevidence on matters of fact, and seek their opinion – which are the first\n\ntwo questions framed by Mr. Salve under the head of privileges as\n\naforesaid. Having done so, we proceed to the third question dealing with\n\nthe interesting aspect of privileges vis-à-vis an individual’s right to\n\nprivacy and free speech.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">64.   We may at the threshold note that Mr. Salve had to deal with the\n\naspect raised by the respondents on the petition being premature – both in\n\nthe context of privilege per se and in the interaction between privileges\n\nand fundamental rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_175\">65.   Mr. Salve strongly refuted the plea of the petition being premature\n\non the basis of the summonses issued by the Committee where it was\n\nthreatened that “necessary action” would be taken against the petitioners\n\nfor breach of privilege if they do not appear. He submitted that even a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                                     [72]</span>\n\fthreatened breach of fundamental rights is sufficient to invoke\n\njurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution.35 Further\n\nelucidating on this aspect, Mr. Salve submitted that access to justice is a\n\nhuman right available where there is even a threat to personal liberties. 36\n\nIn that context, he stated that the Second Impugned Summons left no\n\nroom for doubt that Respondent No. 2 was determined that the failure to\n\nappear would constitute a breach of privilege for which “necessary\n\naction” will be taken, which included the risk of arrest and imprisonment.\n\nThis argument arose from the plea of Mr. Salve that the petitioner had a\n\nright to not appear and in the alternative a right to remain silent if he so\n\nappears.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">66.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147862660\" id=\"span_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1596466\" id=\"span_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"699319\" id=\"span_86\">In view of the aforesaid fact and the plea that the summons itself\n\nwas without jurisdiction, it was submitted that the threat of coercive\n\naction is itself without jurisdiction and a person need not wait for injury\n\nto occur before seeking the Court’s protection.37 Mr. Salve emphasised\n\nthe importance of the observations made in <a href=\"/doc/699319/\" id=\"a_50\">S.M.D. Kiran Pasha v.\n\nGovernment of A.P. and Ors.</a> , where the Court recognized that “if a\n35 K.K.

Ltd. v. State of Bihar and\n\nOrs.</a>, wherein the Court observed “It is, therefore, not reasonable to\n\nexpect the person served with such an order or notice to ignore it on the\n\nground that it is illegal, for he can only do so at his own risk and peril.”39\n\nThe certainty of a legal proposition qua the right of a person was, thus,\n\nemphasised by this Court observing “a person placed in such a situation\n\nhas the right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly\n\nwhere he stands and what he may or may not do.”40</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">67.   The plea raised by Mr. Salve is on the premise that even if a right\n\nof privilege validly accrued, the same would have to be narrowly\n\nconstrued and reconciled with the petitioner’s right under Part III of the\n\nConstitution . The First and Second Impugned Summons addressed to\n\nPetitioner No.1 explicitly stated that it was so addressed to him as the one\n\n“spearheading Facebook”, and thus, no option was left to Facebook to\n\n\n38 (1990) 1 SCC 328, at para 14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">39 (1955) 2 SCR 603 at para 7.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">40 Ibid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_182\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                         [74]</span>\n\fdecide who would appear before the Committee.

Learned counsel, once again, took us to <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 194(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution to contend that it provided that privilege powers would,\n\nfrom time to time, be defined. The submission was that the Constitution\n\nmakers had envisaged a clear ambit to be defined for privilege powers,\n\nwhich has unfortunately never happened. That is why, the plea has been\n\nmade to the effect that either this Court defines the privilege power or\n\ndirect/request the legislature to at least consider the issue of defining\n\nthese privilege powers on the pari materia basis as in Scotland and\n\nWales. In the context of the language of <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 194(3)</a>, it was submitted\n\nthat only such privileges are available to legislatures that can be\n\nexercised without impinging on fundamental rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">69.   In the conspectus of this general proposition, it was urged that the\n\nsummons issued to the petitioner violated his right to remain silent which\n\nwas not limited to <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 20 (which was inapplicable by virtue of these\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                     [75]</span>\n\fnot being criminal proceedings);</a> but also implicit in his rights under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.

The Court had taken the view that such\n\npowers, privileges, and immunities stood in the same position as Part III\n\nof the Constitution and that the fundamental right to free speech and\n\nexpression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> must yield to <a href=\"/doc/74909/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 194.</a> Mr. Salve\n\nsought to distinguish this proposition in view of subsequent judicial\n\ndevelopments. The principle propounded was submitted to have been\n\neroded by subsequent constitutional developments as per which the right\n\nto free speech under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 19</a> was to be seen as part of a trilogy of rights\n\n41 <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_69\">Selvi and Ors. v.

We have\n      already pointed out that the view taken by the majority in <a href=\"/doc/18076/\" id=\"a_80\">A.K.\n      Gopalan</a> case [AIR 1950 SC 27 : 1950 SCR 88 : 51 Cri LJ 1383]\n      was that so long as a law of preventive detention satisfies the\n      requirements of <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 22</a>, it would be within the terms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article\n      21</a> and it would not be required to meet the challenge of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 19.</a></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">      This view proceeded on the assumption that “certain articles in\n      the Constitution exclusively deal with specific matters” and where\n      the requirements of an article dealing with the particular matter in\n      question are satisfied and there is no infringement of the\n      fundamental right guaranteed by that article, no recourse can be\n      had to a fundamental right conferred by another article. This\n      doctrine of exclusivity was seriously questioned in R.C.

The majority Judges held that though a law of\n      preventive detention may pass the test of <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 22</a>, it has yet to\n      satisfy the requirements of other fundamental rights such as Article\n      19…”\n\n43 (1978) 1 SCC 248.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">44 (1970) 2 SCC 298.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">45 Supra note 43.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                                                       [77]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"301898\" id=\"span_99\">71.      We may note in the end an aspect which was raised in the writ\n\npetition, but not really contended on behalf of the petitioners: a similar\n\nquestion related to the interplay between the State Legislature’s privilege\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 194(3)</a> and a non-member’s fundamental rights was\n\npending before a 7-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/301898/\" id=\"a_86\">N. Ravi v.\n\nLegislative Assembly46</a> on account of a perceived conflict between MSM\n\nSharma47 and Special Reference No.1 of 196448. Dr. Singhvi mentioned\n\nthis issue only to distinguish and state that N.

Dr. Singhvi, on behalf of Respondent No.1, once again, at the\n\nthreshold submitted that akin to the privileges issue, this issue is also\n\npremature as no coercive action has been taken against the petitioner and\n\nnone was intended if the authorised representative fairly attended and\n\nparticipated in the proceedings as a witness. The transparency of the\n\nproceedings was sought to be emphasised as there was a live broadcast\n\n\n46   (2005) 1 SCC 603.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">47   Supra note 14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">48   Supra note 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">49   Supra note 46.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_199\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                                      [78]</span>\n\fand therefore there could be no question of any apprehension in respect\n\nof the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">73.   Learned counsel also sought to assail the maintainability of the\n\nwrit petition because Petitioner Nos. 2 &amp; 3 are not citizens of India and\n\nno shareholder had been impleaded as a petitioner. But then one must\n\nnote that the initial summons was sent to Petitioner No.1, who is a citizen\n\nof India, albeit holding an office in Petitioner No.2 organisation.\n\nSubsequently, the summons issued to him was withdrawn and re-worded\n\nsummons was issued. However, the parties had agreed to proceed on the\n\nbasis of existing pleadings and questions raised. We are thus, not inclined\n\nat the threshold itself to look into this contention with any seriousness.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">74.   Insofar as the submission about the summons issued to Petitioner\n\nNo.1 is concerned (even though summons was withdrawn), it was urged\n\nthat a witness could not claim his right to remain silent or to be let alone\n\nin response to a summon to depose before a lawful committee of an\n\nempowered legislature. Such a right was not a fundamental right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 20</a> of the Constitution unless a person is an accused; as was the\n\ncase in Selvi50 which involved rights of an accused in context of narco\n\n50 Supra note 41.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_203\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                                         [79]</span>\n\fanalysis and other tests. Petitioner No.1, and for that matter anyone who\n\ndeposes, is not an accused. There is no conflict between <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n\nof the Constitution and Rule 174 of the Rules. The right to remain silent\n\nis relevant only in criminal investigations. The proceedings before the\n\nCommittee are not criminal or judicial proceedings. There is no accused\n\nbefore the Committee. All persons who appear before it are witnesses\n\nand subject to examination by the members as per the Rules of the\n\nHouse. These Rules have been made in exercise of the powers conferred\n\nunder Section 33 of the GNCTD Act, which in turn draws its strength\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/55190645/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 239AA(7)</a> of the Constitution. Thus, it was submitted that\n\nthe mere summons to give expert deposition before the Committee on the\n\nissues falling within the remit of the Committee cannot be said to be a\n\nviolation of any fundamental rights so as to invoke <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 32</a> of the\n\nConstitution. We may note at this stage that the third issue we will deal\n\nwith is the perceived remit of the Committee and whether the remit has\n\nthe sanction of the Constitution in the context of division of subject\n\nmatter under the three Lists of the 7th Schedule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_205\">75.   The distinction between members and non-members carved out by\n\nMr. Salve was sought to be brushed aside by Dr. Singhvi by submitting\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                                    [80]</span>\n\fthat there was no such distinction as <a href=\"/doc/986670/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 105(4)</a> uses the expression\n\n“in relation to persons”. The apprehension about self-incrimination was\n\nalso urged to be misconceived in view of the constitutional protection\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1347342/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 105(2)</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_206\">76.   Dr. Singhvi then engaged with the arguments of the petitioners\n\nregarding encroachment of fundamental rights, the submissions originally\n\naddressed by both parties being in the context of Petitioner No.1. In this\n\nregard, it was submitted that not even a prima facie case was established\n\nfor the breach of any fundamental right. Petitioner No.1 had not been\n\nsummoned to speak as a private individual but to speak on behalf of\n\nPetitioner No.2. Only a shareholder could have asserted the right on\n\nbehalf of Petitioner Nos. 2 &amp; 3, as they were corporate entities, because\n\nindividuals’ rights are not to be subsumed in the company.51\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"248227\" id=\"span_103\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_104\">77.   We may note that surprisingly, Dr. Singhvi sought to urge that\n\nPetitioner No.1 has not been summoned to speak as a private individual\n\nbut to speak for Petitioner No.2. We are saying this is surprising because\n\nthe New Summons also permits any suitable officer to speak on behalf of\n\n\n51 Supra note 44; <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_93\">Bennett Coleman &amp; Ors. v.

The First\n\nand Second Impugned Summons were specifically addressed to\n\nPetitioner No.1 and only during the course of arguments, facing certain\n\ndifficulties (which somehow Dr. Dhavan did not consider relevant) the\n\ninitial summons was withdrawn and a new summons issued.</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">78.   The more relevant submission is that in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 21</a>, at\n\nthis stage, only a summons to appear was issued and there was no\n\nquestion of restriction of personal liberty. The proceedings were not for\n\nbreach of privilege. No coercive action was taken or was intended if\n\nPetitioner No.1 (or any other officer) merely appeared and assisted the\n\nCommittee as a witness. On the issue of right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21</a>,\n\nit was urged that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 21</a> itself would have to be read as confined to a\n\nperson while a corporation has no personhood.52\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_209\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8534067\" id=\"span_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4354\" id=\"span_107\">79.

In that context it was urged that the ratio of the\n\ndecisions in MSM Sharma53 and In Special Reference 1 of 196454 still\n\nhold good. On the right to remain silent, it was urged that this was not a\n\nright protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution as it was not a\n\ngeneral right; and if at all this right had to be pleaded, it was to be before\n\nthe legislature which had summoned Petitioner No. 1, and not before the\n\nSupreme Court. If silence is to be pleaded for a good reason in response\n\nto a specific question, that request should be dealt with by the Committee\n\nas per applicable rules.

Dr. Dhavan while advancing his case on behalf of the Committee\n\nsought to lift the corporate veil between Petitioner Nos. 1 &amp; 2, as the true\n\npetitioner is Facebook and not Ajit Mohan. The purpose of the summons\n\nwas to seek Facebook’s assistance regarding its role as a social media\n\nplatform/intermediary in a situation like the Delhi riot, where persons had\n\ndeposed before the Committee and pointed out the aggravation which had\n\ntaken place because of platforms like Facebook. The summons had been\n\nissued to Facebook’s senior representative who could be of assistance and\n\nthe summon itself had made it clear that this notice was issued to\n\nFacebook India, not to a specific individual: inasmuch as the notice was\n\nissued to Petitioner No.1 in his capacity as a representative of Facebook.\n\nThus, it was contended that neither <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 32</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\n\nConstitution were available to the petitioners as these rights do not\n\nextend to corporations.

Dr. Dhavan in sync with the arguments of Dr. Singhvi disputed Mr.\n\nSalve’s case that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_127\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_128\">, 19</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_129\">&amp; 21</a> of the Constitution were integrated\n\nby R. C. Cooper63 and Maneka Gandhi64 into one single right. He\n\nsubmitted that the effect of these cases was only to create India’s due\n\nprocess as far as constitutional limitations are concerned. Each of these\n\nrights have their own independent existence and correspondingly their\n\nown independent limitations. The golden triangle does not invalidate the\n\ncases ruling that <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 194(3)</a> of the Constitution, though subject to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 21</a>, was not subject to <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.        The\n\nargument of Mr. Salve was, thus, pleaded to be overstated and\n\ncontradictory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">63 Supra note 44.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">64 Supra note 43.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                      [86]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_230\">\f83.   In the end it was contended that no fundamental right was violated\n\nby issuance of summons to the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_232\">84.   Suffice to say that so far as learned Solicitor General is concerned\n\nno specific arguments were addressed in this behalf except that he drew\n\nattention of this Court to N. Ravi65.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">\nLegislative Competence\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_234\">85.   Elaborate submissions were addressed on the first three aspects by\n\nMr. Salve even though one of the primary issues was whether it was more\n\nspeculative in character and premature, as at this stage of the assailed\n\nproceedings only summons had been issued to the petitioners.           The\n\nbedrock of Mr. Salve’s submissions was based on the alleged lack of\n\nlegislative competence of the Assembly and consequently of the\n\nCommittee to look into the subject matter qua which the notice had been\n\nissued to the petitioners. The submission, thus, was that in the absence of\n\nany such legislative competence, the petitioners were entitled to approach\n\nthe Court at this stage itself rather than being compelled to wait for\n\nfurther progress in the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">\n65 Supra note 46.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                                      [87]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">\f86.   There were three limbs of this submission. The first limb was in\n\nrespect of the statutory enactments, i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_133\">IT Act</a>, enacted by the\n\nParliament under List I, governs and regulates Facebook. This could not\n\nbe an aspect with which the State Government was concerned. In fact,\n\nthis was stated to be the reason why the petitioners had willingly\n\ncooperated and appeared before the Parliamentary Committee in the past.\n\nThe second limb was based on the subject matter which the Committee\n\nwanted to go into, even though it had been specifically denuded of the\n\npower as those subject matters fall within the jurisdiction of the Central\n\nGovernment under Entry 31 (Communications) and under <a href=\"/doc/47094705/\" id=\"a_134\">Article\n\n239AA(3)(a)</a> of the Constitution read with Entries 1 and 2 in List II\n\n(Public Order and Police). The third limb flowed from these two issues\n\nand is based on the unique status of Delhi. He argued that the\n\nconstitutional scheme specifically took away certain subject matters\n\nwhich would normally fall in List II and would ordinarily be dealt with\n\nby a State Assembly. However, in Delhi’s case, these powers were\n\nconferred on the Central Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_238\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">87.   He then took us through the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_135\">IT Act</a> to contend\n\nthat it is undisputed that Facebook was an intermediary within the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                                                     [88]</span>\n\fdefinition of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_136\">IT Act</a>.         <a href=\"/doc/1154453/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of the IT Act defines\n\nintermediaries as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">             “2(1). In this Act, unless the context requires otherwise,\n\n\n             xxxx          xxxx         xxxx         xxxx         xxxx\n\n\n             [(w) &quot;intermediary&quot;, with respect to any particular electronic\n             records, means any person who on behalf of another person\n             receives, stores or transmits that record or provides any\n             service with respect to that record and includes telecom\n             service providers, network service providers, internet service\n             providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines,\n             online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market\n             places and cyber cafes;]”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">88.   In the context of the controversy sought to be raised as regards the\n\nrole of intermediaries during such law and order problems, Mr. Salve\n\ncontended that this aspect was covered by the power to issue directions to\n\nblock public access to any information and was thus, squarely covered by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 69A</a> of the IT Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">89.   The aforesaid provision and its role was not a grey area in view of\n\nthe judicial pronouncement of this Court in Shreya Singhal v. Union of\n\nIndia.66 Thus, a well-developed procedure to deal with such issues was\n\n\n66 (2015) 5 SCC 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                                          [89]</span>\n\falready in place and consequently, the matter was an occupied field by\n\nthe Central Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_244\">90.   Another issue raised by Mr. Salve was that the legislative domains\n\nof “public order” and “police” both stood explicitly outside the\n\ncompetence of the Assembly. It was contended that recommendations in\n\nmatters which fall within List I or which do not fall within List II cannot\n\nbe said to be legislative functions. It was stressed that the purpose for\n\nwhich the summons was issued, and the issue sought to be addressed by\n\nthe Committee were aspects of public order and therefore they were not\n\nprimary functions of the Assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_245\">91.   The utterances in the press conference were pointed out to contend\n\nthat it was amply clear that the purpose behind its exercise was to file a\n\nsupplementary chargesheet which was alien to the powers of the\n\nAssembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_247\">92.   The endeavour of Respondent No.1 had been confirmed in the\n\nreply filed by the respondents to compel Petitioner No.1 to testify as an\n\nexpert witness as part of its decision “to delve into the matter of concern\n\nraised in the complaints (about Facebook)”. The complaints, in turn,\n\ndealt with content allegedly posted on Facebook and how they\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                      [90]</span>\n\fcontributed to the Delhi riots.       By respondents’ own pleadings, the\n\nendeavour of compelling Petitioner No.1 to appear before it was in\n\nfurtherance of the following:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_248\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      a.   Examine testimonies relating to Facebook’s alleged role in the\n\n           Delhi riots;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">      b.   Examine instances of inaction/inability on the part of social\n\n           media platform (Facebook) to enforce its policies against\n\n           hateful content;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">      c.   Seek views of Petitioner No.1 as a representative of Facebook\n\n           to understand Facebook India’s internal policies and their\n\n           implementation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">      d. Ascertain (Petitioners’) views on the question whether the said\n\n           company’s platform has contributed to the Delhi riots and also\n\n           how these platforms could be used to strengthen unity among\n\n           the citizens of Delhi in the future.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">93.    Conscious of the line sought to be adopted by the respondents by\n\nreferring to “Cooperative Federalism”, Mr. Salve contended that the same\n\nwas misconceived as it arose in a factual matrix where the Union and the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                                    [91]</span>\n\fState exercise overlapping powers.        The exercise of power by the\n\nAssembly in question had no connection with any such area of overlap.\n\nHe argued that cooperative federalism cannot be converted into an\n\nindependent head of power in addition to the powers conferred by the\n\nstatute.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_122\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95239810\" id=\"span_123\">In this regard reference was made to two judicial\n\npronouncements in <a href=\"/doc/95239810/\" id=\"a_139\">K. Lakshminarayan v. Union of India &amp; Anr.</a> 67 and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_140\">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India68</a>.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">94.    In order to appreciate what is meant by “cooperative federalism” in\n\nthe context of what appears to be a continuous judicial battle between the\n\nCentral Government and the State Government has been enunciated in\n\nState (NCT of Delhi) (2018), where the Court encouraged walking hand-\n\nin-hand even if there are different political dispensations in power. We\n\ndo believe and may note at this stage that such hope has been repeatedly\n\nbelied! The enunciation of the principle is set out in para 119 as under:69\n\n\n           “119. Thus, the idea behind the concept of collaborative\n           federalism is negotiation and coordination so as to iron out the\n           differences which may arise between the Union and the State\n           Governments in their respective pursuits of development. The\n           Union Government and the State Governments should\n           endeavour to address the common problems with the intention to\n67 (2020) 14 SCC 664.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">68 Supra note 27.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">69 Supra note 27 at para 119.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                                                       [92]</span>\n\f        arrive at a solution by showing statesmanship, combined action\n        and sincere cooperation. In collaborative federalism, the Union\n        and the State Governments should express their readiness to\n        achieve the common objective and work together for achieving\n        it. In a functional Constitution, the authorities should exhibit\n        sincere concern to avoid any conflict. This concept has to be\n        borne in mind when both intend to rely on the constitutional\n        provision as the source of authority. We are absolutely\n        unequivocal that both the Centre and the States must work\n        within their spheres and not think of any encroachment. But in\n        the context of exercise of authority within their spheres, there\n        should be perception of mature statesmanship so that the\n        constitutionally bestowed responsibilities are shared by them.\n        Such an approach requires continuous and seamless interaction\n        between the Union and the State Governments. We may hasten\n        to add that this idea of collaborative federalism would be more\n        clear when we understand the very essence of the special status\n        of NCT of Delhi and the power conferred on the Chief Minister\n        and the Council of Ministers on the one hand and the Lieutenant\n        Governor on the other by the Constitution.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_255\">95.   Thus, Mr. Salve contended that while the Court has touched on the\n\nconcept of collaborative federalism, it has also simultaneously observed\n\nin “absolutely unequivocal” terms that both the Centre and the State have\n\nto work within their spheres and not think of any encroachment. It was,\n\nthus, contended that what was sought to be done was clearly an\n\nencroachment by relying on the larger principle of cooperative\n\nfederalism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                                    [93]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_257\">\f96.     An important aspect has, once again, been emphasized in K.\n\nLakshminarayan70, that the Assembly can seek to exercise power as\n\nconferred under the GNCTD Act, promulgated by the Parliament\n\nexercising its residuary powers under Entry 74 of List I. In that context it\n\nwas emphasised that there is a difference between <a href=\"/doc/39412218/\" id=\"a_141\">Articles 239A</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_142\">239AA</a> of the Constitution. The former is with respect to the Union\n\nTerritory of Puducherry, which simply provided purely enabling\n\nprovisions while the latter contained extensive provisions among which\n\nsub-clause (7) empowered the Parliament to legislate and give effect to\n\nall the provisions. Mr. Salve assailed the endeavour of the Assembly to\n\n“clutch at a jurisdiction that is not available”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_258\">97.   In response to the Court’s queries arising from the earlier summons\n\nbeing superseded by the New Summons, the respondents’ contention that\n\nthe aspect of privilege had not arisen, and whether the petitioners could\n\nclaim to be an unaccountable platform; Mr. Salve contended that the\n\npetitioners were ready to comply with any Indian law and had been doing\n\nso. What they were not desirous of doing was to be drawn into an aspect\n\nof political divide. To emphasise this point he referred to a letter dated\n\n\n70 Supra note 67.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                       [94]</span>\n\f01.09.2020 by the Union Communication Minister alleging inter alia that\n\nFacebook India was leading a concerted effort to shrink the space for\n\ndialogue for those with a right-of-centre ideology. It was, thus, submitted\n\nthat on the one hand the respondents seem to allege that there was a pro-\n\nGovernment or a pro-right bias of Facebook while the Central\n\nGovernment claimed the opposite – the common factor being that both\n\npositions were for their respective political reasons by alleging bias\n\nagainst the petitioners albeit from different sides. Mr. Salve’s contention\n\nwas that an Assembly must limit itself to its core function of legislation.\n\nEven if it were to summon a witness, this must be in relation to matters\n\nthat were within its ambit as demarcated by the Court in the judgment of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_143\">State (NCT of Delhi) v. Union of India</a> 71. This judgment made it clear\n\nthat in reference to the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_144\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973, the powers in\n\nrelation to the Entry of public order were conferred on the Parliament and\n\nconsequently denuded from the powers of the Assembly. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_127\">In that context,\n\neven if the widest amplitude was given to the Entries, that was with the\n\nobjective of not restricting the legislative competence of the Parliament\n\nor the Assembly in a field which they in principle were competent to\n\n\n71 Supra note 27 and <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_145\">Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India</a> 2020 12 SCC 259.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                                           [95]</span>\n\flegislate. In the present case, one was concerned with the powers of the\n\nCentral Government vis-à-vis the State Government and therefore the\n\nprinciple of widest meaning of entries could not result in overlapping\n\npowers as that can hardly be conducive to administrative exigencies.\n\nThat it was so was obvious from the submission of the learned Solicitor\n\nGeneral who contended that the doctrine of pith and substance would\n\nhave to be applied to the reading of the entries while dealing with them to\n\ndemarcate the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ for the Parliament and the State\n\nAssemblies. In the context of the controversy, it was urged, that allowing\n\nsuch wide reading of entries would lead to a slippery slope.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">98.   In the end, Mr. Salve also emphasised the ‘doublespeak’ between\n\nthe stand of the counsel for the Assembly and the Committee; which was\n\na telltale sign that the New Summons was only subterfuge to get over the\n\npossibility or anticipation of an adverse judicial consideration. The right\n\nto remain silent was a virtuous right and in today’s noisy times, should\n\nnot be curbed or abrogated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">99.    Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel for Petitioner No.3, once again,\n\nsupporting the stand of Mr. Salve sought to urge that any powers or\n\nprivileges were in turn circumscribed by the legislative competence of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                                      [96]</span>\n\fthe Assembly. Thus, any powers or privileges have to be exercised\n\nwithin the assigned legislative fields. He sought to draw strength from\n\nMay’s Commentary as also the Commentary of Kaul and Shakdher in\n\nthis context where it was observed in the former “Disobedience to the\n\norder of a committee made within its authority is a contempt of the\n\nHouse.” (emphasis supplied).72 In the latter it was observed\n\n“Disobedience to the orders of a Committee of the House is treated as a\n\ncontempt of the House itself, provided the order disobeyed is within the\n\nscope of the Committee’s authority…” (emphasis supplied).73 Learned\n\ncounsel thereafter turned to the judicial precedents in this regard.74\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_262\">100. He submitted that the powers and privileges are controlled by the\n\nbasic concepts of the written Constitution which could be exercised\n\nwithin the legislative fields allotted to their jurisdiction by the three lists\n\nunder the 7th Schedule; and the legislatures were not competent to travel\n\nbeyond the lists.75\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">101.

Thus, it was argued that the\n\nrespondents could not say that they had the power to go into a roving and\n\nfishing inquiry before the Committee relating to all perceived fields\n\nbased on a belief that the State Assembly deals with the core functions in\n\nDelhi. Its legislative competence by various entries should not be read in\n\nsuch an expansive manner as to not be restricted by specific exclusions,\n\nat least for the purposes of discussion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_268\">102. Mr. Datar then turned to judicial precedents from the United States\n\nto analyse the similar federal structure of governance in both India and\n\nUSA. The cases dealt with enquires by the Congress.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_269\">103. In Watkins v. United States76 it was observed that “no enquiry is\n\nan end in itself, it must be related to a legitimate task of Congress.”\n\nThus, academic enquiries cannot be undertaken – it is only what is within\n\nthe powers of the Congress that can be enquired into. “Broad is the\n\npower of inquiry, but not unlimited.”77 Such power of enquiry of the\n\nCongress is limited to its “legitimate tasks”, which would imply\n\nlegislative competence in the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">\n\n76 354 US 178 (1957) at pg. 187.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">77 Ibid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_272\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                      [98]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\">\f104. We may note at this stage that a plea was advanced by Dr. Dhavan\n\nthat this judgment stood overruled in Barenblatt v. United States78 and\n\nEastland v. United States Servicemen’s Fund79. Mr. Datar clarified that\n\nthe aspect he was seeking to rely upon the judgment for was not only not\n\noverruled, but there was confirmation on the limits on the power of\n\ninquiry of the Congress as laid down in Watkins80.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_274\">105. He next referred to the judgment in Howard Jarvis Taxpayers\n\nAssociation v. Padilla81 for the observation that the legislature may not\n\nuse its powers to “defeat or materially impair” the exercise of its fellow\n\nbranches’ constitutional functions, nor “intrude upon a core zone” of\n\nanother branch’s authority. The investigative powers may not be used to\n\ntrench upon matters falling outside the legislative purview and the\n\ninvestigative power permits inquiry only into those subjects in reference\n\nto which the legislature has power to act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_275\">106. In the context of the requirement of reading of entries widely, Mr.\n\nDatar contended that the power to legislate conferred by <a href=\"/doc/47094705/\" id=\"a_146\">Article\n\n239AA(3)(a)</a> was in respect of matters in List II except Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18.\n\n\n78   360 US 109 (1959) at pg. 111-112.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_276\">79   421 US 491 (1975) at pg. 504.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\">80   Supra note 76.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">81   62 Cali 486 (2016) at pg. 499.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_279\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                     [99]</span>\n\fIf the principle of reading entries widely is to be applied in this context,\n\neven the excluded entries have to be read widely as conferring the power\n\non the Parliament. It could not be said that entries conferring power on\n\nthe State Assembly were to be read widely while at the same time a\n\nrestrictive meaning was to be given to entries under which powers have\n\nbeen specifically excluded. The phraseology “with respect to” entails\n\nthat the entries encompass anything with a nexus to public order and/or\n\nthe police. The powers with respect to such activities, thus, squarely lie\n\nwith the Parliament. Once again, a judicial view already taken was clear\n\nand explicit, i.e., that the Assembly did not have any power – legislative\n\nor executive, over the police and its functions. 82 Thus, exempted entries\n\nwould have to be read in substance and not hyper-technically, and <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_147\">Article\n\n239AA</a> would have to be read contextually as also widely to include all\n\nancillary and subsidiary matters. This in turn denuded the Assembly and\n\nthe Committee of the powers to legislate or enquire into that aspect. As\n\nsuch, what has been specifically denied to the Assembly could not be\n\nachieved through Committees under the garb of “peace and harmony.”\n\nThe Assembly had no jurisdiction to address violence and communal\n\n\n82 <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_148\">Govt. of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India</a> 2020 12 SCC 259.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                      [100]</span>\n\friots, if Entries 1 &amp; 2 of List II are interpreted as submitted. In the end\n\nthere could be no power even to investigate these matters.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_280\">107.    The Committee, it was argued, was a creation of the Assembly\n\nand could not have a larger jurisdiction than the Assembly itself. The\n\nBulletin issued on 02.03.2020 suggested that the Committee was formed\n\nto deal with matters falling in Entries 1 &amp; 2 of List II while stating this to\n\nbe “in view of the recent communal riots and violence….”. This made it\n\namply clear that the Committee was meant to deal with the violence and\n\ndisturbance caused to public order during the riots.         The expression\n\n“public order” has to be interpreted broadly and would encompass\n\ncommunal peace and harmony. The summons issued by the Committee\n\nrelated to the law and order situation of Delhi for which the Assembly\n\nhad no power to investigate or formulate law.              If there was no\n\ncompetence with regard to such matters, the summons in that context\n\nwould be without jurisdiction and, thus, void ab initio.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_281\">108. Since cooperative federalism was propagated as the basis to justify\n\nthe constitutionality of the actions of the respondents, it was submitted\n\nthat the same would not amount to a license to place reliance on Entries 1\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                                                                        [101]</span>\n\f&amp; 2 of List III to sidestep the explicit exclusion in <a href=\"/doc/47094705/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 239AA(3)(a)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution.

The matters relating to criminal law would not include power to\n\nlegislate on issues pertaining to public order and communal peace and\n\nharmony as the same is traceable to “public order”, if the latter is to be\n\ninterpreted broadly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_283\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"144413017\" id=\"span_135\">110. Mr. Datar further argued that Entry 45 of List III, which relates to\n\ninquiries, cannot enable the Assembly to inquire into public order, police\n\nfunctions or communications. The power of inquiry has to be directly\n\nrelated to the legitimate subjects over which the Assembly has powers to\n\nlegislate.   To buttress his argument on the concept of collaborative\n\nfederalism, Mr. Datar relied upon the observations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/144413017/\" id=\"a_152\">State\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                                      [102]</span>\n\f(NCT of Delhi) v.

Mr. Datar argued that obviously the Central Government and the\n\nState Government had different perceptions as to what transpired in Delhi\n\nand it can hardly be disputed that it was a law and order issue arising\n\nfrom communal riots. This was not an aspect that either the Assembly or\n\nany of its committees could deal with. If the Assembly cannot legislate\n\non a subject, it cannot explore the same under an executive investigation.\n\nThe mere reluctance to participate could not be threatened with a breach\n\nof privilege and the subject matter being dealt with by the Committee\n\nwas outside the purview and power of the Assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_285\">112. Mr. Datar emphasised that the role of Facebook was of an\n\nintermediary and, thus, the relevant regulatory mechanism was under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_153\">IT Act</a>. He went as far as to contend that there was no jurisdiction to\n\nexamine Facebook, as its operations were covered by Entry 31, List I,\n\nunder “other forms of communication”.           Since the Parliament has\n\noverriding power to legislate with respect to entries in List I under <a href=\"/doc/1463849/\" id=\"a_154\">Article\n\n\n83</a> Supra note 27.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                                       [103]</span>\n\f246(1) of the Constitution, the Assembly could not intervene in matters\n\nrelating to intermediaries/other forms of communication. In addition, it\n\nwas urged that this special entry of “communication” overrides the\n\ngeneral entries of “inquiries” and “criminal law” (List III), which the\n\nDelhi Assembly had attempted to rely on.84\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_287\">113.

Mr. Datar finally urged that an intermediary like Facebook has no\n\ncontrol over the content hosted on it and is in fact, prohibited from\n\nknowing the substance of the content on their platform or exercising any\n\ncontrol over the same except as prescribed by law.              It was, thus,\n\nsubmitted that an intermediary cannot be held liable for any third party\n\ndata/information made available/hosted by them. Facebook was simply a\n\nplatform where messages are transferred from one person to the other.\n\nWhatsapp, Signal, Telegram are even end-to-end encrypted. These are\n\nintermediaries who are not liable for third party information hosted on\n\nthem. The only obligation which Section 79 of the IT Act imposes is that\n\nof due diligence on the part of intermediaries as Facebook did not initiate\n\n84 Kerala State Electricity Board v.

Hence, they cannot be held\n\nliable and any action taken against intermediary has to be in the manner\n\nprescribed by the Act.85 It was stated that the New Summons did not\n\nchange the position in any way as the content of the inquiry was the\n\nsame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_290\">115. Dr. Singhvi, seeking to rebut the arguments canvassed on behalf of\n\nthe petitioners sought to emphasise that it is not appropriate to equate the\n\nexpression “peace and harmony” with “law and order” as the former was\n\na much broader term. In any case, Legislative Assemblies have wide\n\ninquisitorial powers,86 i.e. areas which are otherwise not available to a\n\nlegislature for legislative interference are still available to a committee of\n\nthe legislature. The relevant para from Kalpana Mehta reads as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">   “335.

Dr. Singhvi contended that selective extracts of the press\n\nconference cannot be the basis for giving a different meaning to the\n\nproceedings than the Terms of Reference. He sought to clarify that the\n\nscope of the Committee was purely recommendatory, including making\n\npositive recommendations to ensure peace and harmony in the NCT of\n\nDelhi in the future which relates to various heads of competence of the\n\nAssembly in List II and List III of the 7th Schedule. No federal unit can\n\nfunction in the absence of peace and harmony amongst various groups of\n\npeople who reside, live and work in that federal unit. Thus, the domain of\n\npeace and harmony in the NCT of Delhi is something very broad and\n\ninherent to the legislature of the federal unit and encompasses within it\n\nmany areas of competence of the Assembly both in List II and List III. It\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                                                    [106]</span>\n\fwas further contended that “fraternity” is a preambular value which, like\n\nequality and liberty, imbues the functioning of the entire Constitution.\n\nHe referred to Entry 39 of List II relating to “Powers, privileges and\n\nimmunities of Legislative Assembly” to emphasise that enforcement of\n\nattendance of persons for giving evidence or producing documents before\n\ncommittees of the Legislature of the State was an intrinsic part of its\n\nfunctions. This coupled with Entry 45 of List III dealing with Inquiries\n\nand Statistics for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or\n\nList III would completely cover the aspects sought to be gone into by the\n\nCommittee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_294\">118. Dr. Singhvi, in support of the manner in which such committees\n\ncan function and their remit, referred to three judicial pronouncements\n\nfrom the United States: (i) Eastland v. The United States Servicemen’s\n\nFund87, (ii) Watkins v. United States88 and (iii) Barenblatt v. United\n\nStates89. The common thread which permeates these judgments is that\n\nthe power to investigate is inherent in the power to make law as a\n\nlegislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of\n\ninformation with respect to the conditions that the legislation is intended\n87 Supra note 79.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_295\">88 Supra note 76.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">89 Supra note 78.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_297\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                                       [107]</span>\n\fto affect or change. In that context, the issuance of subpoenas could be\n\nexercised by a committee acting on behalf of the House.

Such an inquiry was not in turn circumscribed by what the end\n\nresult would be: “Nor is the legitimacy of a congressional inquiry to be\n\ndefined by what it produces.” 91 Such investigative function was akin to\n\nany research with the possibility of researchers ending up in some “blind\n\nalleys” and into non-productive enterprises, as “to be a valid legislative\n\ninquiry there need be no predictable end result.” 92\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">120.

On an aspect of teaching which is pursued in educational\n\ninstitutions, it was observed that inquiries cannot be made into a\n\nconstitutional protection against the freedom to teach. But this would not\n\npreclude the Congress from interrogating a witness merely because he is\n\na teacher.    Thus, “an educational institution is not a constitutional\n\nsanctuary from inquiry into matters that may otherwise be within the\n\nconstitutional legislative domain merely for the reason that inquiry is\n\nmade of someone within its walls.”94\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_304\">122.

On the same lines were\n\nthe subsequent judgments of the Supreme Court which settled major\n\nissues of congressional authorisation and relevance of the first\n\namendment.97     The view taken thereafter by the US Supreme Court\n\nreinforces powers of the Committee rather than undermines them. 98 The\n\nessence of American Law, he contended, is that when you are summoned,\n\nyou must appear but can plead the fifth amendment in not answering\n\nquestions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_307\">124.

The emphasis of Dr.\n\nDhavan’s argument was that communal harmony is an important part of\n\nDelhi’s governance that goes beyond the limited remit of police functions\n\nand public order. The incident of February, 2020 in Delhi was stated to\n\nprove that in addition to affecting public order, communal disharmony\n\nhas a harmful effect on trade and commerce, transportation, education\n\nand governance generally. Considering the implication of these domains,\n\nit was contended that it would be deeply harmful if the police were the\n\nsole custodians of peace and harmony.        The initial course of action\n\nrequires people to be educated and that governing authorities liaise with\n\nthem in order to calm tensions. To agree to the submissions of the\n\npetitioners would be to permit the argument that there was none in the\n\nDelhi Government who could address the issue of peace and harmony.\n\nOn a larger canvas, the message that would permeate to non-members\n\nwould be that they could get away by not appearing before the\n\nLegislative Assemblies, as the latter had no power to compel their\n\nappearance. It was submitted that this would make the entire system of\n\nCommittee proceedings farcical. The need for harmonious construction\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                                                      [111]</span>\n\frequired that legislative entries must be given the widest amplitude and,\n\nthus, he submitted that it was the duty of the Court to reconcile entries\n\nthat may appear to overlap or may be in direct conflict.99\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_311\">125. Dr. Dhavan sought to introduce the concept of ragbag legislation,\n\nsubmitting that this was an expression used by the Indian Supreme Court\n\nin income tax jurisprudence.100        The ragbag approach suggested that\n\nlegislative and executive powers need not be traced to only one entry, but\n\nmay instead be traced to multiple entries in the relevant list in the 7 th\n\nSchedule. Thus, this perspective of multiple entries may empower the\n\nCommittee to consider peace and harmony – some that were directly\n\napplicable like education, and others that applied indirectly like trade and\n\ncommerce. Peace and harmony was a concept much beyond public order\n\nand police, and illustrations of the same were given from List II and List\n\nIII.

Dr. Dhavan further submitted that the constitutional obligation to\n\ntake preventive action to ensure non-discrimination provided for the\n\nGovernment’s duty to examine and recommend action in respect of peace\n\nand harmony as also to protect religion, cultural rights and dignity of\n\nindividuals as envisaged in various constitutional provisions, i.e., <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_160\">Articles\n\n14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_161\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_162\">, 16</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_163\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_164\">, 21</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_165\">, 25</a> to 30, 39A, 39(b), 40, 41, 46 and 47. These\n\nprovisions are really an amalgam of fundamental rights and directive\n\nprinciples of state policy. Considerable emphasis was placed by Dr.\n\nDhavan on Entry 45 in List III, which is a self-standing entry that has\n\nbeen given the widest amplitude by this Court. 101 This entry deals with\n\nthe executive power to make committees of inquiry. In that context it has\n\nbeen observed that these inquiries would encompass any matter\n\nenumerated in any of the Lists and would not be confined to those\n\nmatters as mere heads of legislative topics – extending the inquiries into\n\ncollateral matters. Further referring to <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_166\">Entry 39 of List II, Dr. Dhavan\n101 Sriram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar</a> 1959 SCR 279 at pgs. 289, 291.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                                                          [116]</span>\n\furged that this entry was wide enough from a bare reading to include the\n\npower to summon non-members having used the expression of\n\n“enforcement of attendance of persons”.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_354\">127. The thread which permeated Dr. Dhavan’s arguments was that the\n\ntask of governance is much wider than merely drafting legislation and\n\nexecuting it. Executive power would collapse if it were to be reduced to\n\nsimply executing the laws enacted by the Legislature and, thus, the\n\nSupreme Court had explained that executive power without law had to be\n\nconstrued widely.102\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_355\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318432\" id=\"span_155\">128. After having dealt with the four aspects referred to aforesaid, Dr.\n\nDhavan sought to respond to Mr. Salve’s argument of the legislative\n\ndomain being occupied by the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_167\">IT Act</a>. It was Dr. Dhavan’s submission\n\nthat the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_168\">IT Act</a> was an example of “cooperative federalism” as the Act\n\nempowered both the State and the Centre in terms of the definition of\n\n“appropriate government” in <a href=\"/doc/47235766/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 2(e)</a>. Thus, provisions such as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/191105/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/70101/\" id=\"a_171\">69</a> of the IT Act could refer to either the Centre or the State\n\nand the legislative domain could not be said to be exclusively occupied\n\nby the Centre. This is more so in the context of a mere summons that\n\n\n102 <a href=\"/doc/1318432/\" id=\"a_172\">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> (1955) 2 SCR 225.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                                                      [117]</span>\n\frequired the petitioner’s appearance without reaching the stage at which\n\npunitive action may be considered. The Committee was submitted not to\n\nbe engaged in any inquisitorial exercise but was only limited to aid in the\n\nspirit of cooperative federalism.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_356\">129. Cooperative federalism was contended not to be a source of power\n\nbut rather a part of the principles that underlie the Constitution. It was a\n\nmethod of communication that makes federalism more effective requiring\n\nboth Centre and State to work together to address common problems.\n\nThus, the State could not exist without collaborative or cooperative\n\nfederalism.103 This was stated to be of even greater significance in light\n\nof the tug of war between the Centre and the State in respect of the\n\nunique position of the Delhi Legislative Assembly. As such, peace and\n\nharmony issues ought to be resolved by a coordinated effort. He did, of\n\ncourse, concede that the history of two governments was testament to a\n\ntussle which was closer to being competitive rather than collaborative.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_357\">130. Dr. Dhavan, thus, concluded his arguments by submitting on this\n\naspect that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">103 Supra note 27.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                                                      [118]</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">\f      (a) it was not his contention that conventions and broad concepts\n\n      are sources of power;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">      (b) underlying principles, however, are fundamental to both\n\n      interpretation of the Constitution and powers exercised through the\n\n      Government or their legislatures;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">      (c) a recommendatory committee has a duty to inform the Central\n\n      Government of the problems it encounters so that organs of\n\n      Government can act in furtherance of this principle of cooperative\n\n      pragmatic federalism;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">      (d) the Committee by itself did not claim the power to punish the\n\n      breach though it does possess the power to summon without penal\n\n      consequences. It could at best make a recommendation which\n\n      would have to be examined by the House through the process of a\n\n      privileges committee. This was a routine part of every summon,\n\n      only indicative of the power of the Parliament/Assembly.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_359\">131. Mr.Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General sought to advance\n\nsubmissions substantially on this aspect as there was a conflict in the\n\nstands taken by the State and the Central Government on this issue. As\n\nnoticed earlier – while on the one hand he was with the State\n\nGovernment on the issue of the right to summon per se, a difference\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                                                   [119]</span>\n\farose on account of his argument that in the given factual situation, the\n\npower to summon vested solely with the Central Government. Mr. Mehta\n\nreferred to <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 212</a> of the Constitution, which reads as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">         “212. Courts not to inquire into proceedings of the\n         Legislature. –\n         (1) The validity of any proceedings in the Legislature of a State\n         shall not be called in question on the ground of any alleged\n         irregularity of procedure.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">         (2) No officer or member of the Legislature of a State in whom\n         powers are vested by or under this Constitution for regulating\n         procedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order,\n         in the Legislature shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any\n         court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_360\">132. It was his submission that proper effect should be given to the\n\nabove provision and the Court did not really have the power to deal with\n\nthe functioning/internal administration of the Parliament/Assemblies and\n\nthe committees thereof. There was, however, a narrow scope of judicial\n\nreview permitted in the present case as the person involved was not a\n\nmember of the House.        The enquiry being ultra vires the powers\n\nconferred on the Assembly, he contended that the subjects specifically\n\nexcluded by the Constitution could not be surreptitiously brought within\n\nthe purview of the Assembly by categorising the issue as “peace and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                                                     [120]</span>\n\fharmony.” It was intrinsically a law and order issue, which was an\n\noccupied field and also an excluded field so far as the Assembly was\n\nconcerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_361\">133. While accepting that privilege was necessarily connected with\n\nlegislative power, the same (if the aspect so arose) would have to be\n\nconsidered in the context of legislative competence. The plenary powers\n\nof the legislature were circumscribed by the written Constitution which\n\nset out the legislative fields allotted to each of their jurisdictions by the\n\nthree Lists in the 7th Schedule putting an embargo on the Legislatures to\n\ntravel beyond the entries in their respective lists.104\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_362\">134. Learned Solicitor General sought to emphasise on the unique case\n\nof Delhi with reference to its excluded entries. It was not at par with any\n\nother State Assembly. Delhi was the national capital and thus, the law\n\nmakers had consciously made a provision keeping this larger picture in\n\nmind and reserving to the Parliament three entries which would otherwise\n\nbe available in List II to the State Assemblies.          In the absence of\n\nlegislative competence, it would be a colourable exercise of power to\n\nengage in the subject matter. The formation of a “peace and harmony”\n\n\n104 Supra note 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_363\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                                                       [121]</span>\n\fcommittee was stated to be one such colourable exercise of power. This\n\nbecame apparent from the summons issued which explicitly provided\n\nthat, in effect, the Committee was dealing with law and order and the\n\npolice. The battle between the Centre and the State qua Delhi which\n\ngave rise to the previous judicial pronouncements, clarified which of the\n\ntwo had powers qua specific excluded entries. It would be a betrayal of\n\nthe mandate of these judgments which had upheld the rationale behind\n\nexclusion of entries drawing from the unique position of Delhi.105\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_364\">135. The pith and substance argument was sought to be advanced to\n\ncontend that reliance on entries in List II and List III was not justified if\n\nthe matter directedly related to excluded entries.106\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_365\">136. Learned Solicitor General, while accepting the proposition that\n\nentries have to be read widely, submitted that where there is a specific\n\nentry dealing with a particular subject, that specific entry would prevail\n\nto the exclusion of the general entry.107 The entries relied upon by the\n\nrespondents were general in nature, while the entries of “law and order”\n\nand “police” were specific and thus, must prevail.

We must begin our opinion by noticing at the inception itself, the\n\nvast and influential role of an intermediary like Facebook.        In this\n\nmodern technological age, it would be too simplistic for the petitioners to\n\ncontend that they are merely a platform for exchange of ideas without\n\nperforming any significant role themselves – especially given their\n\nmanner of functioning and business model. Debate in the free world has\n\nshown the concern expressed by Governments across the board and the\n\nnecessity of greater accountability by these intermediaries which have\n\nbecome big business corporations with influence across borders and over\n\nmillions of people. Facebook today has influence over 1/3 rd population\n\nof this planet! In India, Facebook claims to be the most popular social\n\nmedia with 270 million registered users. The width of such access cannot\n\nbe without responsibility as these platforms have become power centres\n\nthemselves, having the ability to influence vast sections of opinions.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_389\">Without undermining the role performed by Facebook in giving a voice\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                                                     [132]</span>\n\fto various sections of society across the world, it has to be noted that\n\ntheir platform has also hosted disruptive voices replete with\n\nmisinformation. These have had a direct impact on vast areas of subject\n\nmatter which ultimately affect the governance of States. It is this role\n\nwhich has been persuading independent democracies to ensure that these\n\nmediums do not become tools of manipulative power structures. These\n\nplatforms are by no means altruistic in character but rather employ\n\nbusiness models that can be highly privacy intrusive and have the\n\npotential to polarize public debates.     For them to say that they can\n\nsidestep this criticism is a fallacy as they are right in the centre of these\n\ndebates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_390\">150. Facebook as a platform is in the nature of a mass circulation media\n\nwhich raises concerns of editorial responsibility over the content\n\ncirculated through its medium. The width of the reach of published\n\nmaterial cannot be understated or minimized.                 Facebook has\n\nacknowledged in their reply that they removed 22.5 million pieces of hate\n\nspeech content in the second quarter of 2020 itself, which shows that they\n\nexercise a substantial degree of control over the content that is allowed to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                                                       [133]</span>\n\fbe disseminated on its platform. To that extent, a parallel may be drawn\n\nwith editorial responsibility cast on other mass circulation media.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_391\">151. The business modelof intermediaries like the petitioner being one\n\nacross countries, they cannot be permitted to take contradictory stands in\n\ndifferent jurisdictions.   Thus, for example in the United States of\n\nAmerica, Facebook projected itself in the category of a publisher 119,\n\ngiving them protection under the ambit of the First Amendment of its\n\ncontrol over the material which are disseminated in their platform. This\n\nidentity has allowed it to justify moderation and removal of content.\n\nConspicuously in India, however, it has chosen to identify itself purely as\n\na social media platform, despite its similar functions and services in the\n\ntwo countries. Thus, dependent on the nature of controversy, Facebook\n\nhaving almost identical reach to population of different countries seeks to\n\nmodify its stand depending upon its suitability and convenience.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_392\">152. We are afraid we are not inclined to accept the simplistic approach\n\nsought to be canvassed by Mr. Salve on the role of Facebook. Forceful as\n\nit may be, it does not convince us. Developments around the world, as\n\n\n119 Facebook’s Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Federal Rule Of Civil Procedure\n12(B)(6) and Incorporated Memorandum Of Law in Laura Loomer v.

The concern\n\nis whether the liberal debate which these platforms profess to encourage\n\nhas itself become a casualty. We have noticed in the beginning that\n\nalgorithms, which are sequences of instructions, have human\n\ninterventions to personalise content and influence opinions as part of the\n\nbusiness model. As such, their primary objective is to subserve their\n\nbusiness interests. It is first a business and then anything else. As per\n\ntheir own acknowledgement, they would only appear before any\n\ncommittee if it served their commercial and operational interests, as it did\n\nwhen they appeared before the parliamentary committee. But if their\n\nbusiness interests are not served, they seek a right to stay away. Such a\n\nstand is completely unacceptable to us. Facebook has the power of not\n\nsimply a hand but a fist, gloved as it may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_394\">153. We now turn to the incident at hand, that of an unfortunate violent\n\neruption. The need to go into this incident both from a legal and social\n\nperspective cannot be belittled. The capital of the country can ill-afford\n\nany repetition of the occurrence and thus, the role of Facebook in this\n\ncontext must be looked into by the powers that be.            It is in this\n\nbackground that the Assembly sought to constitute a peace and harmony\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                                                      [135]</span>\n\fcommittee – whether it has the legislative competence or not is an aspect\n\nwe will deal with it under the relevant head. The Assembly being a local\n\nlegislative and governance body, it cannot be said that their concerns\n\nwere misconceived or illegitimate. It is not only their concern but their\n\nduty to ensure that “peace and harmony” prevails. However, we may\n\nnote that the long and repeated battles between the State and the Centre\n\nappear to have cast a shadow even over the well-meaning intent of the\n\nCommittee to assess peace and harmony as reflected in the Terms of\n\nReference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_395\">154. We may record that the Central Government and the State\n\nGovernment have been unable to see eye to eye on governance issues in\n\nDelhi. This has been responsible for a spate of litigation and despite\n\nrepeated judicial counsel to work in tandem, this endeavour has not been\n\nsuccessful. There is little doubt that the constitution of the governance\n\nmodel in Delhi is somewhat unique. This itself flows from Delhi being\n\nthe capital of the country. Delhi has had a history of having an Assembly\n\nreplaced by a model of Union Territory governance by Executive\n\nCouncilors.   There were long years of tussle to have a Legislative\n\nAssembly with commonality of objectives across the primary political\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                                                   [136]</span>\n\fspace, but whoever was in governance found it difficult to let go. The\n\nmodel that came into being, thus, had somewhat of a hybrid character,\n\ngiving an expanded role to the Central Government as compared to any\n\nother Legislative Assembly. To that extent, there was a diminishing of\n\nthe federal structure but there appears to have been a consensus on this\n\naspect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_396\">155. The aforesaid arrangement worked well for many years even with\n\ndifferent political dispensations in power in the Centre and the State. But\n\nthe last few years have seen an unfortunate tussle on every aspect with\n\nthe State Government seeking to exercise powers as any other Assembly\n\nand the Central Government unwilling to let them do so. The bone of\n\ncontention has not only been the three subject matters of which the State\n\nwas denuded of its powers, i.e., Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18 from List II; but it is\n\nalmost a daily governance tussle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_397\">156. The political dispensation which is in power in the State has to\n\nrecognise the constitutional scheme of division of powers in Delhi which\n\ncircumscribes their ability to work only within those powers. When they\n\ngot elected, they knew what they were getting elected for – not what they\n\nthought should be the division of powers. On the other hand, the Central\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                                                                     [137]</span>\n\fGovernment is required to work in tandem, albeit with a different\n\npolitical dispensation.

To work well, the Central Government and the State Government\n\nhave to walk hand in hand or at least walk side by side for better\n\ngovernance. The failure to do so is really a breach of their respective\n\nelectoral mandate, the seven Lok Sabha seats are all held by the powers\n\nthat be in the Central Government but a very different result came in the\n\nAssembly Elections. This has seen a repeat. It is a reflection of the\n\nmaturity of the electorate which has chosen to put one dispensation in\n\npower in the Centre while seeking to choose another in the State as the\n\nroles are divergent.    The concerns are different.     The two powers\n\nunfortunately do not seek to recognise this aspect, and that is the bane of\n\nthis structure requiring collaboration and concurrence. Unfortunately, it\n\nhas become an endeavour to score points over the other. Some prior\n\ndiscussion and understanding could easily solve this problem instead of\n\nwasting large amounts of judicial time repeatedly arising from the failure\n\nof the two dispensations to have a broader outlook. In fact, the current\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                                                     [138]</span>\n\fround is, in our view, arising from the petitioners seeking to take\n\nadvantage of this divergence of view and their inability to see a common\n\npath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_399\">158. No governance model requiring such collaboration can work if\n\neither of the two sides take a ‘my way or the high way’ approach –which\n\nboth seem to have adopted. We have expressed our view on the contours\n\nof the dispute and the facts have already been set out hereinabove. We\n\nsee no purpose in repeating those facts.       We now turn to the four\n\npropositions which form the basis of the writ petition (dealt with under\n\nthree heads) to record our views qua them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_400\">On the Issue of Privilege:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_401\">159. The privilege issue arises out of the plea advanced by the\n\npetitioners that both, the First Impugned Summons dated 10.09.2020 and\n\nthe Second Impugned Summons dated 18.09.2020, were to summon\n\nPetitioner No.1 or a duly authorized representative of Petitioner No. 2\n\nrespectively with a threat of “privilege”. This argument was coupled\n\nwith a plea that such power of privilege cannot extend to compel an\n\nindividual, who is not a member of the House, into giving\n\nevidence/opinion that they are not inclined to state.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                                                  [139]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_402\">\f160. We may note the elaborate arguments addressed by Mr. Salve,\n\nbased on a premise that privilege power is really a special right enjoyed\n\nas a shield in order to facilitate the working of the Assembly. It is not a\n\nsword for assertion of power.      It was argued that the constitutional\n\nschemes of the UK and of India, a republic, are different and thus, the\n\nprivilege powers in the latter must be strictly confined to legislative\n\nfunctions. Only if the integrity of the legislative functions is impaired,\n\neither by a member or by non-members, would the occasion arise for\n\nexercise of such power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_403\">161. In fact, Mr. Salve sought to contend that it is time that exercise of\n\nprivilege power is codified, and to that extent an intent was expressed by\n\nthe Constitution makers in sub-clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/74909/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 194.</a> The relevant\n\nportion states that such privileges “shall be such as may from time to time\n\nbe defined by the Legislature by law.”, and thus, the submission was that\n\nthis clause operated for a period “until (privilege powers were) so\n\ndefined.” Mr. Salve sought to persuade us to either lay down the guiding\n\nprinciples or at least nudge the Parliament/Legislature to do so. We have\n\nalready noticed that this is an aspect seriously disputed by all the counsel\n\nfor the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_404\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                                                                      [140]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_405\">\f162. We may notice in the aforesaid context that the wordings of <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_185\">Article\n\n194(3)</a> are unambiguous and clear, and thus do not require us to give our\n\nown twist or interpretation to them. These are not wordings of a statute,\n\nbut that of the primary document – the Constitution.         The powers,\n\nprivileges and immunities of a House of the State Legislature as well as\n\nits committees have been clearly defined as those of the House and all\n\nmembers and committees thereof before the coming into force of <a href=\"/doc/1762415/\" id=\"a_186\">Section\n\n26</a> of the Constitution 44th <a href=\"/doc/113521647/\" id=\"a_187\">Amendment Act, 1978</a>. There was no timeline\n\nprovided for codification of powers, privileges and immunities of a\n\nHouse. The Constitution has given leeway to the Legislature to define\n\nthe same from time to time, but there was no compulsion qua the same.\n\nIf the Legislature in its wisdom is of the opinion that it needs to be so\n\ndone, they will do so. Is it for this constitutional court to nudge them in\n\nthat direction? Our answer would be in the negative.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_406\">163. We say so as this is itself a debatable issue. There is a divergence\n\nof views even amongst constitutional experts whether full play must be\n\ngiven to the powers, privileges, and immunities of legislative bodies, as\n\noriginally defined in the Constitution, or is it to be restricted. Such\n\nopinion would have to be debated before the Parliament/Legislature of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                                                     [141]</span>\n\fthe State to come to a conclusion, one way or the other. It is not even a\n\nsubject matter where it could be said that any one opinion must prevail,\n\nor a nudge must be given by this Court, or a recommendation must be\n\nmade for consideration by the legislative body. That Scotland and Wales\n\nhave considered it appropriate to have their own enactments in this\n\ncontext, is a deliberate legislative exercise by those bodies. There is no\n\nuniformity across the world in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_407\">164. The notion of individual constitutional rights and the right to\n\nprivacy is sought to be expanded by the petitioners to encompass the\n\nright of refusal even to appear in pursuance of the summons. The debates\n\nacross democratic policy including some of the developments recorded\n\nby us, would show that there is a turn towards recognising the importance\n\nof an element of compulsion (if so required) for deposition/opinions\n\nrelating to the present subject matter. This is more so in the context of\n\nmonolithic business models having vast financial and technical powers at\n\ntheir disposal. As a constitutional court, we are not inclined to step into\n\nit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_408\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                                                     [142]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_409\">\f165. It is not disputed that committee proceedings cannot be equated to\n\nproceedings before the court of law.120 No doubt these powers have to\n\nwork in the context of the business of each House, and no House can be a\n\nknight in shining armour to correct issues in respect of which it has no\n\nlegislative power. Yet, it would be a monumental tragedy to conclude\n\nthat the legislature is restricted to the function of enacting laws. The role\n\nof the legislature is sought to be diminished by such an argument. The\n\nlegislature debates many aspects, and at times records a sense of the\n\nHouse. This is not unusual or without precedent. The judgment in\n\nAmarinder Singh121 is of little assistance to the petitioner as that was a\n\ncase of an executive act of exemption of land, and in no way obstructed\n\nor threatened the integrity of the legislative proceedings. The facts of\n\neach case are important and propositions of law must apply in the context\n\nof the facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_410\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184521\" id=\"span_188\">166.

There is little quibble with the proposition recognized in the\n\nSpecial Reference No.1/1964123 that there is a distinction between\n\nexercise of legislative privileges and ordinary legislative functions. A\n\nsimilar line of reasoning has been expressed in Justice (Retd.)\n\n<a href=\"/doc/196586094/\" id=\"a_189\">Markandey Katju v. Lok Sabha and Anr.</a>, when the hackles of the\n\nParliamentarians were raised on account of some utterances by Justice\n\n(Retd.) Markandey Katju.124 We, however, fail to appreciate the line of\n\nargument that no non-member could be summoned if they had not\n\nintruded on the functioning of the Assembly; or that the non-participation\n\nof the petitioner would not have adverse consequences as it did not\n\ndisrupt the functioning of the Committee. The petitioners, more so with\n\ntheir expanded role as an intermediary, can hardly contend that they have\n\nsome exceptional privilege to abstain from appearing before a committee\n\nduly constituted by the Assembly.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_414\">168. We really do not have any quibble with the propositions advanced\n\nby Mr. Salve that there can be judicial scrutiny of an endeavour to\n122 Supra note 24.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_415\">123 Supra note 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_416\">124 Supra note 13.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_417\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                                                    [144]</span>\n\fexercise the power of privilege, which inherently suffers from lack of\n\njurisdiction, if illegal or unconstitutional.125   The issue, however, is\n\nwhether the situation has at all arisen meriting scrutiny by this Court-\n\nwhich in turn has to be preceded by initiation of the privilege\n\nproceedings, an aspect emphasised by learned counsel for the Assembly\n\nas well as the Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_418\">169. In the factual matrix, only a summons has been issued for\n\nappearance before the Committee. The question of any privilege power\n\nbeing exercised is yet far away. It has been rightly pointed out by the\n\nlearned counsels for the respondents, that even if there was any breach of\n\nprivilege recorded by the Committee, the Committee would in turn have\n\nto make a recommendation to the Assembly. The Assembly then would\n\nbe entitled to consider whether it is a fit case to exercise the power of\n\nbreach of privilege. In many cases, it may well be that the Assembly\n\nconsiders that it is not worthwhile to do so, even if the Committee was to\n\nprima facie opine so. The exercise by the Assembly is further dependent\n\non the opinion of the Privileges Committee. Thus, there are various tiers\n\nof scrutiny before there is culmination of the exercise of power of\n\n\n125 Supra notes 12, 15 and 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_419\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                                                    [145]</span>\n\fprivilege. None of those eventualities have at all arisen in the present\n\ncase. This case is a preventive endeavour by the petitioner to preclude\n\nthe respondents from even considering the aspect of privilege by seeking\n\nthis Court’s intervention at a pre-threshold stage, only on the premise of\n\nthe absence of legislative power. We will, of course, consider the aspect\n\nof absence of legislative power as the last aspect on the questions framed\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_420\">- but we cannot accept the fetters Mr. Salve seeks to place on the\n\nAssembly and the Committee at the threshold. We may notice the\n\narguments of the respondents that recording of the consequences of\n\nbreach of privilege in a notice to appear is apparently something which is\n\ndone in a routine manner in such notices. This is possibly to make the\n\nnoticee conscious of the consequences. That would not mean that an\n\naction for privilege has been triggered off at the outset.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_421\">170. We would like to turn to the aspect of the importance of the\n\nworking of committees; as, if there is no power to compel attendance, we\n\nhave little doubt that the working of these committees would be badly\n\nimpaired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_422\">171. The committees constituted by legislative bodies like the\n\nAssemblies for the States and Parliament for the Union, perform a key\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                                                    [146]</span>\n\frole in the functioning and the working of the Houses. In fact, it is often\n\nsaid that the real work is done in these committees - away from the din of\n\nthe Parliament. These committees witness more vociferous reflection of\n\nthe divergent view, slightly away from public gaze. It is said that there is\n\na more reasonable and applied discussion in these committees. This is an\n\naspect recognized all over the world qua the functioning of such\n\ncommittees. These committees are bodies which have the capability to\n\nundertake wide-scale consultative processes, engage in dialogue, and\n\nbuild consensus through intelligent deliberations.       In fact, such an\n\nexercise is intrinsic to the legislative process where public policies would\n\nrequire detailed studies and concentration. These committees undertake\n\ndeliberations and provide recommendations as precursors to legislative\n\nactivities, and the effective working of committees is a prelude to the\n\ncore working of the Assemblies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_423\">172. The committees are an extension of the legislature itself and do\n\ninformed work. Their significance has been exhaustively dealt with in\n\nKalpana Mehta126 which we have extracted hereinabove.                   US\n\nRepresentative James Shannon’s words were noted with approval in the\n\n\n126 Supra note 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_424\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                                                                      [147]</span>\n\fjudgment, recognising that “around the world there is a trend to move\n\ntoward reliance on committees to conduct the work of parliament, and\n\nthe greatest reason for this trend is a concern for efficiency.”127 It is not\n\npossible for us to accept the contention of the petitioners to create an\n\nartificial division between Assembly’s core/essential and non-essential\n\nfunctions, with any restrictive clauses being placed on the deliberations\n\nof the committees.       Such water-tight compartmentalisation is not\n\nadvisable. Unless the committee embarks on a course completely devoid\n\nof its functional mandate specified by the Assembly, or the Assembly\n\nitself lacks jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter, we are of the view\n\nthat the widest amplitude must be given to the functioning of these\n\ncommittees. It is the parliamentary committee system that has been\n\nrecognised as a creative way of parliaments to perform their basic\n\nfunctions. The same principle would apply, even if it is to some extent\n\nbeyond their legislative domain. This is because they will not be able to\n\nmake any valid legislative recommendations in the absence of\n\ncompetence over the subject matter. However, they may debate aspects\n\n\n\n127 Comment of US Representative James Shannon during the 1995 Conference\non the Role of Committees in Malawi’s Legislature as noted in Kalpana Mehta at\nnote 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_425\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                                                        [148]</span>\n\fwhich may be a reflection of their sense and consequently the sense of\n\nthe House, if so adopted by the House.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_426\">173. Walter Bagehot in his seminal work “The English Constitution” 128\n\nelucidated five significant functions of the House - elective, expressive,\n\nteaching, informing and finally, the legislative. The legislative function\n\nitself is a broad umbrella under which multiple responsibilities and tasks\n\nare carried out in synchronization.      The legislature is a “democratic\n\nnucleus”, whereby such title entails the law-making process itself as\n\nbeing multi-functional; involving receipt of informed opinions and\n\nbalancing interests of various stakeholders.129   Committees actually are\n\nin the nature of specialised forums as Mallory states:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">   “The flow of public business is now so great, and its nature so\n   complicated, that it can only be handled by bodies with the technical\n   competence and the rational organization to master it.

The inquisitorial role of the committee in the functioning of House\n\nis of great significance, and as recognized, the investigation of a\n\ncomplicated social problem prior to legislation often rests frequently on\n\nsuch legislative committees.130 This task involves the examination of\n\nwitnesses and is helpful in dealing with matters of special and technical\n\nnature, wisened by insight into affairs of the workings of different aspects\n\nand the views expressed by different stakeholders. It can hardly be said\n\nthat in the context of what has been debated, the petitioners have no role\n\nto play or are “outsiders”. Intelligent legislative action and deliberation\n\nthereon rests on the power to investigate into questions of public\n\nimportance and, thus, issuance of summons is key to this investigative\n\nexercise - a role clearly recognised in Kalpana Mehta131.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_428\">175. We have no hesitation in stating that the endeavour of the\n\npetitioners to sidestep their appearance before the Committee on a\n\nperceived notion of not being an official representative - is not acceptable\n\nto us – whether the exercise is for a legislative enactment, or for other\n\n\n\n\n130 Promila Suri, Growth of Committee System in Central Legislature of India\n1920-1947, (1979).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_429\">131 Supra note 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_430\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                                                      [150]</span>\n\fpurposes connected with its legislative domain.

The Committee is yet to start its work qua the assistance to be\n\nrendered by the petitioners. The petitioners cannot themselves frame and\n\npresume possible questions that they might face before the Committee,\n\nand then seek to encompass it under the argument of legislative\n\nincompetence. The work of The Committee could encompass several\n\nfields where organisations and individuals are expected to cooperate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">177. We are also not impressed by the argument that the privilege\n\npowers of the Assembly are not constitutional in character but flow only\n\nfrom the GNCTD Act.

They are not divorced from each other. Dr. Singhvi, thus,\n\nrightly referred to clauses 7(a) and 7(b) of <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 239AA</a> to contend that\n\nthe GNCTD Act was not deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution\n\nfor the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 368</a>, notwithstanding that it may contain any\n\nprovision which amends or has the effect of amending the Constitution.\n\nRights and privileges are the same as any other House and, thus, the\n132 Supra note 79.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_433\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                                                    [151]</span>\n\fcalling into question of the proceedings of a sub-committee amounts to\n\ncalling into question the proceedings of the Assembly. At the cost of\n\nrepetition, we say that there has been no exercise of privilege power.\n\nHowever, we have been called upon to deliberate, if one may say, to\n\nsome extent unnecessarily over this issue on account of insistence of the\n\npetitioners to advance this argument prematurely.       We do not know\n\nwhether on participation of the petitioners any question of privilege\n\nwould arise, whether the Committee would make a reference to the\n\nAssembly, whether the Assembly would consider it to be referred to the\n\nPrivileges Committee, what would be the opinion of the Privileges\n\nCommittee and finally whether the Assembly itself would embark on a\n\npath of a breach of privilege by the petitioners.

As to the issue of the extent of legislative power, we will deal\n\nwith it in the third part of our conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_439\">181. We have already noted with some disquiet the divergence of views\n\ntaken by Dr. Dhavan and Dr. Singhvi on the issue of the earlier notice\n\nbeing withdrawn, and a subsequent notice being sent. Dr. Dhavan\n\nexpressed that this was really of not much significance. We are of the\n\nview that the Committee is a creation of the Assembly. The notice was\n\nwithdrawn by the respondents themselves.          In the wisdom of the\n\nCommittee, they sent a fresh notice- that the same was possibly not under\n\n133 Supra note 30.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_440\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                                                                      [153]</span>\n\fthe advice of Dr. Dhavan or may have been on the advice of Dr. Singhvi\n\nis of little relevance to us. Such conflict of submissions was best avoided\n\nand unnecessarily gave rise to another set of arguments on behalf of the\n\npetitioners to read some intent into the same. Dr. Dhavan was, however,\n\nright in seeking to repel the challenge as based on anticipatory nature of\n\nproceedings – being presumptive and preemptive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_441\">182. The aspect of Dr. Dhavan’s submission that the Committee’s threat\n\nto recommend criminal action was “toothless” and the Committee\n\nChairman’s statements during the press conference in this regard are both\n\nbest dealt with under the third aspect. Suffice to say at this stage that, in\n\nour view, greater care would be required while framing the Terms of\n\nReference so as to not include something which would be termed by the\n\ncounsel as “otiose” before this constitutional court. The utterances of the\n\nChairman of the Committee, which would give rise to petitioner’s\n\napprehensions are best avoided. We are noticing these aspects because\n\nthese two factors can be the only reasons for the petitioners to have\n\napproached this Court at this stage. In our view, there would have been\n\nnothing to argue but for these two aspects – the first effectively\n\nwithdrawn during the course of argument, and the second sought to be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">                                                                       [154]</span>\n\fexplained away as views of the people who deposed before the\n\nCommittee. We find it very difficult to accept both these aspects, and we\n\ncan safely say that these gave the petitioners an ostensible cause for\n\napproaching this Court. This is an issue we cannot ignore - but for these\n\naspects, we would have possibly burdened the petitioners with exemplary\n\ncosts to have approached the court at this stage. A number of past\n\nillustrations have been rightly given by Dr. Dhavan to illustrate notices\n\nissued to non-members which we have already recorded in para 58 and\n\nthere is no need to repeat them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_442\">183. We may record, at the end, that there is actually no serious dispute\n\nabout the per se competence of the Committee to discuss matters outside\n\nthe legislative domain of the Assembly but it was with a caveat that it\n\ncould not give rise to exercise of power of breach of privilege and the\n\nright to summon a non-member.         That being the position, we have\n\nalready noticed that any plea raised on the exercise of privilege is a pre-\n\nemptive strike in the absence of underlying facts. Where that situation\n\narises in the given factual context, the petitioners could have and would\n\nbe entitled to assail the same, but this Court will not indulge in an\n\nadvance ruling on this aspect. We have already clarified that we are not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                                                     [155]</span>\n\finclined to accept the distinction between a member and non-member in\n\nthe aforesaid context; and the power of the Assembly to summon in the\n\nformat it sought to do is beyond exception and in accordance with law.\n\nSo much for the aspect of privilege.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_443\">On Privileges &amp; Fundamental Rights\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_444\">184. Mr. Salve sought to pit the expanded right of free speech and\n\nprivacy against privilege, emphasising that the petitioner had a right to\n\nremain silent. In the context of the plea of the petition being premature\n\n(which we have found against the petitioners as aforesaid), his\n\nsubmission was that the mere threat of “necessary action” i.e., the\n\npossibility of a breach of privilege, was enough to infringe both the right\n\nto free speech and privacy. Thus, “the threatened invasion of the right”\n\ncould be “removed by restraining the potential violator”.134\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_445\">185. The more restricted plea advanced by Mr. Salve was that even if\n\nthe right of privilege is recognised, it must be narrowly construed so as to\n\ngive maximum play to the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech,\n\nwhich includes the right to remain silent. We may note that in view of\n\nthe original notice being withdrawn, Facebook’s plea of not having the\n\n134 Supra note 38.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_446\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                                                                      [156]</span>\n\foption of choosing whom to send stands whittled away. The interesting\n\npart is that Petitioner No.1 did appear before the Parliament.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_447\">186. We find it rather difficult to countenance the plea that the judgment\n\nof this Court in MSM Sharma135 stands whittled down by subsequent\n\njudicial pronouncements or that powers, privileges and immunities under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1653644/\" id=\"a_193\">Articles 105(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1130308/\" id=\"a_194\">194(3)</a> of the Constitution must give way to the more\n\nfundamental right of free speech under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\n\nConstitution in view of the reference pending before the larger Bench in\n\nN.

We have discussed at some length the aspect of privilege and the\n\nrights which flow from it.

Ravi139. Suffice for us to add\n\nthat this reference has been pending since 2005. It may be stated that this\n\nreference needs to be given some priority to settle the legal principles\n\ninvolved, especially in the context of the expanding conflict on such\n\nsubject matters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_454\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_455\">189. Be that as it may, we also agree with what Dr. Singhvi contended\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_456\">-that this is another aspect which is premature. No coercive action has\n\nbeen taken against the petitioner, and none was intended if the authorised\n\nrepresentative of the petitioners simply participated in the proceedings as\n\na witness.    Emphasis was also laid on the transparency of these\n\nproceedings in view of them being broadcasted live. The summons\n\nhaving been lawfully issued by an empowered committee (subject, of\n\ncourse to the legislative competence discussed hereinafter), the same\n\nmust be answered. The proceedings are not criminal or judicial in nature\n\nas there is no accused before the Committee. Naturally, the Rules framed\n\nby the House under Section 33 of the GNCTD Act (which in turn draws\n\n\n137 Supra note 14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_457\">138 Supra note 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_458\">139 Supra note 46.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_459\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                                                                     [158]</span>\n\fstrength from <a href=\"/doc/55190645/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 239AA(7)</a> of the Constitution) would be followed.\n\nProtection of proceedings before the Assembly or the Committee under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74909/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 194</a> would include deposition of members or non-members.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_460\">190. We may add here that the option to not answer a question before\n\nthe Committee cannot seriously be disputed qua certain aspects if so\n\npleaded for good reasons, an aspect which would be examined by the\n\nCommittee as per Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_461\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_462\">191. We would not like to say anything more on this subject in view of\n\nthe reference pending in N. Ravi,140 and the fact that the complete plea of\n\nthe petitioners is premature as nothing has really happened other than\n\nthem having been asked to appear before the Committee.\n\n\n\nOn Legislative Competence:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_463\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_464\">192. Is the Assembly embarking on a path which is blocked for them?\n\nThis is the core question of legislative competence of the Assembly in the\n\ncontext of its powers and privileges not being akin to other State\n\nAssemblies. The endeavour of Mr. Salve was to persuade us that once the\n\nAssembly lacks competence, the petitioners have a right to stay away, as\n140 Supra note 46.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_465\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                                                     [159]</span>\n\fall proceedings before the Committee would be devoid of any\n\nconstitutional mandate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_466\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_467\">193. It is undisputed that the Assembly is different from the other State\n\nAssemblies to the extent that certain subject matters of List II have been\n\nspecifically excluded and conferred on the Central Government. It is,\n\nthus, nobody’s case that aspects covered by Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18 in List II\n\ncan be dealt with by the Assembly and consequently, the Committee. In\n\nfact, the submission of Mr. Salve can be summarised as advancing a plea\n\nthat the Assembly and the Committee cannot be permitted to do\n\nindirectly what they cannot do directly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_468\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_469\">194. While there is no dispute about the principle of reading the Entries\n\nas widely as possible, that proposition is in the context of challenging a\n\nlaw for lack of legislative competence. Here we are concerned with the\n\ninterplay of Entries.     The issue would be whether the Central\n\nGovernment has the legislative competence or the Assembly. The widest\n\namplitude has to be given even to the three Entries of which the\n\nlegislative competence has been denuded from the Assembly and\n\nconferred on the Parliament.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_470\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                                                                    [160]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_471\">\f195. It is in the aforesaid context that it was emphasised that apart from\n\nthe aforesaid three Entries, what is also to be appreciated is that the\n\nbusiness of Facebook is directly covered under a Parliamentary\n\nenactment, i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_198\">I.T. Act</a>. In this respect, petitioners have willingly\n\ncooperated with proceedings before the Parliamentary Committee in the\n\npast.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_472\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_473\">196. That Facebook is an intermediary was submitted to be apparent\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/1154453/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of the I.T. Act. The role of the intermediaries is\n\ncovered by this enactment including the right of the Central Government\n\nto issue directions to block public access to any information under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 69A</a> of the I.T. Act and this is no more res integra in view of the\n\njudgment in Shreya Singhal141 where a procedure for the same has been\n\nlaid down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_474\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_475\">197. The intent of the Committee (and for that matter the Assembly)\n\nwas argued by Mr. Salve to be quite clear, i.e., to encroach on the very\n\ndomain which was prohibited. This was stated to be apparent from the\n\nTerms of Reference. The Terms of Reference contained in paragraph 4 (i)\n\n(to consider the complaints from the members of the public, social\n\n141 Supra note 66.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_476\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                                                                    [161]</span>\n\forganisations, journalists, etc. on the situation prevailing in a particular\n\narea/areas which have the potential to disturb communal peace and\n\nharmony or where communal riots have occurred) have to be read in\n\ncontext of para 4(vii) which tasks the Committee with recommending\n\naction against such persons against whom incriminating evidence is\n\nfound. The respondents could not get away by simply saying that the\n\npower of recommending action against such persons against whom\n\nincriminating evidence is found is not capable of being enforced in view\n\nof the lack of legislative competence. These are the aspects which were\n\nsought to be given teeth by threatening privilege in the last paragraph of\n\nthe Terms of Reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_477\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_478\">198. Mr. Salve also sought to rely on the reply of the respondents to\n\njustify that these were not mere apprehensions. We have set out these\n\naspects as reflected in para 90.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_479\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_480\">199. It could not be seriously disputed before us that collaborative\n\nfederalism was an integral part of the working of the Indian Constitution\n\nas emphasised by the Court. However, it was simultaneously accepted\n\nthat such functioning had to be within respective spheres of legislative\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">                                                                      [162]</span>\n\fcompetence. Were the Assembly to encroach upon matters covered by\n\nList I (and similarly, if the Central Government were to encroach upon\n\nthe powers of the Assembly in List II), it would lead to a chaotic situation\n\nand a breakdown of the division of powers inter se the Centre and the\n\nState.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_481\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_482\">200. We are, however, not impressed with the argument of Mr. Salve\n\nthat the petitioners cannot be drawn into what is perceived to be a\n\npolitical divide. Facebook is a platform where such political differences\n\nare reflected. They cannot wash their hands off the issue as this is their\n\nvery business. As noticed earlier, their role is not as innocuous as they are\n\nseeking to contend.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_483\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_484\">201. Similarly, we cannot accept the plea that an Assembly must\n\nconfine itself to the core function of legislation.        This would be\n\nunreasonably restricting the role of an elected body.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_485\">202. Mr. Salve’s emphasis was that all that transpired was a subterfuge\n\nas the real intent of the Committee was to look into issues that were\n\nbeyond their scope, while expanding their powers on account of a\n\npolitical conflict between the Central and State Governments over the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                                                       [163]</span>\n\fissue of the riots in question. This was stated to be quite apparent from\n\nthe nature of depositions recorded before the Committee and the\n\nstatements made in the press conference by the Chairman of the\n\nCommittee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_486\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_487\">203. As already stated, we have little doubt over the proposition that the\n\ndivision of powers between the Centre and the State Assemblies must be\n\nmutually respected. The concept of a wide reading of Entries cannot be\n\nallowed to encroach upon a subject matter where there is a specific entry\n\nconferring power on the other body. It is this very principle which was in\n\nthe minds of the Constitution makers, considering the wide diversity and\n\nthe federal nature of the country. Thus, whether it is the argument of Mr.\n\nSalve or Mr. Datar in this context, we find them unexceptionable. The\n\nillustrations given by Mr. Datar for exercise of such powers and their\n\njudicial scrutiny in the US also support the proposition, i.e., that an\n\ninquiry could not be an end in itself and has to be related to a legitimate\n\ntask of the Congress (legislative body). 142 There could not be exercise of\n\npower which may “defeat or materially impair” the exercise of its fellow\n\n\n\n\n142 Supra note 76.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_488\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">                                                                     [164]</span>\n\fbranches’ constitutional functions, nor “intrude upon a core zone” of\n\nanother branch’s authority”.143\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_489\">204. We are also of the view that the recourse to Entries 1 &amp; 2 of List\n\nIII cannot be said to include what has been excluded from the powers of\n\nList II, i.e., Entries 1, 2 &amp; 18. Similarly, Entry 45 of List III relating to\n\ninquiries would again not permit the Assembly or the Committee to\n\ninquire into the aspects of public order or police functions. That a law\n\nand order situation arose is not disputed by anyone, and that this law and\n\norder issue related to communal riots also cannot be seriously disputed.\n\nThat the Assembly cannot deal with the issue of law and order and police\n\nis also quite clear. Thus, the moot points would be (a) what is the scope\n\nof inquiry of the Committee; (b) whether it could be said that there is any\n\naspect of the inquiry which falls within the legislative domain of the\n\nAssembly; and (c) whether the attendance of the petitioners could be\n\ncompelled legitimately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_490\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_491\">205. We may say that both Dr. Singhvi and Dr. Dhavan were quite\n\nconscious of the limitations which inherently exist on the powers of the\n\nAssembly. It is in that context that their argument was premised on a\n\n143 Supra note 81.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_492\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                                                       [165]</span>\n\fbroader understanding of the expression “peace and harmony”, as\n\nopposed to it being restricted to law and order. However, the difficulty\n\nthat they face relates to the part of the Terms of Reference that was\n\nclearly outside the purview of the powers vested with the Assembly. This\n\nproblem was compounded by what transpired in the press conference\n\nheld by the Chairman of the Committee. Speaking on behalf of the\n\nmembers of the Committee, the Chairman made certain statements that\n\nassume greater significance by virtue of being in the public domain.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">206. We also do not disagree with the in-principle submission of Dr.\n\nDhavan, drawing strength from judicial precedents in the US, that the\n\npower to investigate is inherent in the power to make laws by the\n\nlegislative body.144 But while recognising this, the issue in the present\n\ncase is whether the Assembly can at all legislate on the matter. The\n\ninvestigative function of committees carries with it the possibility of\n\nresearchers ending up in some “blind alleys”.145 This would have to\n\npresuppose that there is an alley. Thus, while we respect the right of the\n\nCommittee to the extent that there exists an obligation on the petitioners\n\nto respond to the summons, we cannot permit the proceedings to go on in\n144 Supra notes 76, 78, 79.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_494\">145 Supra note 79.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_495\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                                                       [166]</span>\n\fa manner that encroaches upon the prohibited entries. We hasten to add\n\nthat we are not seeking to control how the Committee proceeds. In fact,\n\nthe Committee is yet to proceed. But certain provisions of the Terms of\n\nReference coupled with the press conference is what has persuaded us to\n\nsay something more than simply leaving it to the wisdom of the\n\nCommittee to proceed in the manner they deem fit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_496\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_497\">207. Once again, we do appreciate the contention of Dr. Dhavan that the\n\npolice cannot be the sole custodian of peace and harmony and that the\n\nexpression itself has various connotations.           Despite the State\n\nGovernment being denuded of certain powers, it has to be noted that\n\ngovernance has many manifestations, and functions of the Government\n\ncan be realised in different ways. This is especially true in the present\n\ncase where the situation was admittedly created through an intrinsically\n\nlaw and order issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_498\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_499\">208. The moot point is whether the expression “peace and harmony”\n\ncan be read in as expanded a manner as Dr. Dhavan seeks to do by\n\nrelying a on a number of Entries in List II and List III. We have no doubt\n\nthat peace and harmony, whether in the National Capital or in a State\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">                                                                    [167]</span>\n\fcontext, is of great importance. But it would be too much to permit the\n\nargument that peace and harmony would impact practically everything\n\nand thus, gives power under different entries across the three lists. We,\n\ndo, however, recognise that the inquisitorial and recommendatory powers\n\ncan be utilised under the principle of better governance.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_500\">209. In the aforesaid conspectus, while keeping in mind <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 212</a>\n\nwhich restrains courts from inquiring into the proceedings of a\n\nlegislature, we must also note that a narrow scope of judicial review has\n\nalways been appreciated and understood. We are confronted with a\n\nsituation where the two legislative bodies are not on the same page as to\n\nwhat transpired and there is in a sense, a tug of war on the issue as to who\n\nwould look into what happened and what ought not to have happened. It\n\nis in this context that the learned Solicitor General emphasised the\n\ndoctrine of pith and substance to locate the power within the entries\n\nwhich have been taken out of List II and thus, seeks to block the inquiry\n\nby the Committee on aspects which are already covered under the three\n\nexcluded entries or under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_202\">I.T.

Facebook cannot excuse themselves from appearing pursuant to\n\nthe New Summons issued to them on 03.02.2021. Areas which are not\n\notherwise available to the legislature for its legislative exercise may,\n\nhowever, be legitimately available to a committee for its deliberations.\n\nThis is so in the context of a broad area of governmental functions.\n\nUltimately, it is the State Government and the State Assembly which has\n\nto deal with the ground reality even in the dual power structure in Delhi.\n\nIf we may say so, it is only the factum of Delhi being the capital and the\n\nsensitivities arising therefrom in respect of public order or police which\n\nhas possibly persuaded these powers to be retained by the Central\n\nGovernment. We cannot say that informed deliberation inter alia on the\n\nbest measures through which online mass hate and violence in their\n\ngeographical jurisdiction can be addressed would not be within the\n\nCommittee’s area of competence as it would undermine the very purpose\n\nof a vital democratic polity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_503\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                                                     [169]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_504\">\f211.

Appropriate\n\nrecommendations made by the State Government in this regard could be\n\nof significance in the collaborative effort between the Centre and the\n\nState to deal with governance issues.

We are of the view that because of the pervasive impact of the\n\nriots, the Committee could legitimately attend to such grievances\n\nencompassing varied elements of public life. Thus, it would be entitled\n\nto receive information and deliberate on the same to examine their\n\nbearing on peace and harmony without transgressing into any fields\n\nreserved for the Union Government in the Seventh Schedule.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_507\">213. Let us now turn to the Terms of Reference. In the larger context of\n\nwhat the Committee is supposed to do, reliance was placed on paragraph\n\n4(i), i.e., to consider the factors and situations which have the potential to\n\ndisturb communal harmony in the National Capital Territory of Delhi and\n\nsuggest measures to eliminate such factors and deal with such situations\n\nwith the object of establishing harmony among different religious or\n\nlinguistic communities or social groups. This is not purely a law and\n\norder or policing aspect and has several connotations.           It was not\n\nnecessary at that stage for the Terms of Reference to spell out as to what\n\naspects it would legislate upon (having legislative competence) and on\n\nwhat aspects it would like to consider making recommendations. That\n\nwould have been a pre-hearing of the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_508\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                                                        [171]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">\f214. If we turn to para 4(i) of the Terms of Reference, the object was to\n\nconsider petitions, complaints or reports from the members of the public,\n\nsocial organisationsand journalists on the matter in issue where\n\ncommunal riots have occurred. Once again this was intrinsically linked\n\nto the larger issue. However, the real troublesome aspect is para 4(vii),\n\nwhich we reproduce, once again, to appreciate the context:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">      “(vii) to recommend action against such persons against whom\n      incriminating evidence is found or prima facie case is made out for\n      incitement to violence”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_510\">215. Clearly it is not within the remit of the Assembly to recommend\n\naction against such persons against whom incriminating evidence is\n\nfound or prima facie case is made out for incitement of violence. This is\n\nan aspect purely governed by policing. It is the function of the police to\n\nlocate the wrong doer by investigation and charge them before a\n\ncompetent court and this is what has really given a handle to the\n\npetitioners to approach this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_511\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_512\">216. We have noticed the submissions of Dr. Singhvi and Dr. Dhavan,\n\nwhich really amount to saying that this paragraph is insignificant as no\n\naction can be taken. If that be so, then in that sense, this paragraph does\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                                                     [172]</span>\n\fnot stand even though the petitioners may not have directly assailed it. In\n\norder to justify the legislative competence and the remit of the\n\nCommittee, the respondents have practically given up this para 4(vii) and\n\nwe record the same and make it clear that this cannot be part of the remit\n\nof the Committee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_513\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_514\">217. We may say that wiser advice prevailed in issuing the New\n\nSummons dated 03.02.2021, which consciously specified the diluted area\n\nof inquiry, conscious of the aforesaid limitation and if we may say,\n\nrightly so. What it takes care of is that it is not addressed to Petitioner\n\nNo.1 directly but instead it calls for the views of an authorised\n\nrepresentative of Petitioner No. 2, Facebook India. It has rightly used the\n\nexpression “requested” and also used the expression “could” in the\n\ncontext of initiation of proceedings for breach of privilege and has\n\ncategorically withdrawn the previous notices and summons.          On the\n\nlighter side, possibly Dr. Singhvi’s advice was adhered to.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_515\">218. The result of the aforesaid is that fallacies in the notices stand\n\nremoved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_516\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                                     [173]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_517\">\f219. We have already noticed that the statements made by the Chairman\n\nof the Committee during the press conference cannot be diluted or\n\nbrushed aside in a manner as learned counsel for the respondents seek to\n\ndo. No doubt some part of the press conference refers to the complaints\n\nreceived and statements made by persons deposing before the\n\nCommittee. But, at the same time, it was stated by the Chairman that the\n\nmaterial placed before the Committee had resulted in a “preliminary\n\nconclusion”. Thereafter it was stated that “prima facie it seems that\n\nFacebook has colluded with vested interests during Delhi riots”. It does\n\nnot rest at this and he further states:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_518\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">       “Facebook should be treated as a co-accused and investigated as a\n\nco-accused in Delhi riots investigation.” and “As the issue of Delhi riots\n\nis still going in the court, a supplementary chargesheet should be filled\n\n(sic) considering Facebook as a co-accused.”\n\n\nThe aforesaid statements and conclusions are completely outside the\n\nremit of the Committee and should not have been made. That it may give\n\nrise to apprehension in the minds of the petitioners can also not be\n\ndoubted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                                                    [174]</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_519\">\f220. The further utterances also show that the findings have already\n\ngiven out of the proceedings including 3-4 significant important aspects\n\nincluding posting by Facebook of incriminating material on the platform\n\nin spite of continuous request to remove the same and that Facebook\n\ncolluded with such web news channels, which has a sole agenda to\n\nconfuse content and disturb social harmony. The Chairman also states\n\nthat material has come before them which shows that wherever there is\n\ncontent of harmonious nature, Facebook removes that content while\n\ndisharmonious content is promoted. A reference has also been made to\n\nthe race clashes in the US.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_520\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_521\">221.     Towards the end it is also sought to be conveyed that in view of\n\nthe “incriminating material”, the representatives of Facebook would be\n\ncalled upon to satisfy principles of natural justice before conviction. The\n\nprima facie view expressed is that Facebook is a co-accused and hence\n\ninvestigations regarding their role during the Delhi riots should be carried\n\nout and after such investigation, a supplementary chargesheet should be\n\nfiled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_522\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                                                      [175]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_523\">\f222. If it may be said, it is as if the Committee was convinced that\n\nFacebook must be prosecuted, and as if the Committee itself was the\n\nprosecutor with a right to direct the filing of a supplementary\n\nchargesheet. It was meeting as a formality to give a right of hearing\n\nbefore doing so, i.e. “before taking any action.” What more is to be said!\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_524\">223. We can only say that such statements are hardly conducive to fair\n\nproceedings before the Committee and should have been desisted from.\n\nThis is especially so as that was not even the legislative mandate, and the\n\nAssembly or the Committee had no power to do any of these things.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_525\">224. In view of the aforesaid, thus, while giving the widest amplitude in\n\nrespect of inquiry by a legislative committee, we are constrained to put\n\ncertain fetters in the given factual scenario otherwise tomorrow the\n\nproceedings itself can be claimed to be vitiated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_526\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_527\">225. The importance of Committees cannot be over emphasised. The\n\nKalpana Mehta148 case discusses this issue in some depth. Committees\n\nseek to perform the function of holding the Government accountable to\n\nimplement its policies, and its duties under legislation and the\n\nperformance of governmental agencies can be the subject matter of\n148 Supra note 20.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_528\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">                                                                     [176]</span>\n\freports formulated by these Committees. However, in the context of the\n\npresent case, we are dealing with a scenario where on a particular subject\n\nmatter there is no legislative mandate to enact a legislation even if, in a\n\nbroader sense, an inquiry is made. Thus, the aspect of holding the State\n\nGovernment accountable is not really envisaged as per the Terms of\n\nReference. Rather, it seems as if the Committee seeks to hold certain\n\nprivate players responsible for a law and order scenario, which is within\n\nthe domain of the Central Government. Therefore, the general principles\n\napplicable to Committees would apply with a little difference in the given\n\nscenario.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_529\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_530\">226. We are conscious of the rationale emphasised that the wide\n\njurisdictions of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 226</a> or of this Court under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution should not normally be exercised in a\n\nmanner oblivious to the enormous work carried out by the Parliamentary\n\nCommittees “in the field”. An Assembly, more so in the nature of Delhi\n\nAssembly with its own peculiarities (i.e., the exclusion of certain\n\npowers), even if given the widest amplitude and powers which a\n\nCommittee should have; cannot step on the toes or rather shoes of an\n\nentity having exclusive jurisdiction by reason of List I.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">                                                                     [177]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_531\">\f227. We cannot lose sight of the repeated brushes which have occurred\n\nbetween the current dispensation in the Central Government and the State\n\nGovernment and the Courts being called upon to define the contours of\n\ntheir powers. Sagacious advice to act in concert appears to have fallen on\n\ndeaf ears. We are, faced with a scenario which is a little different from\n\nthe normal and, thus, much as we would not like to, some fetters have to\n\nbe placed qua the exercise sought to be undertaken by the Committee in\n\nquestion. One set of fetters is not required because it has already been\n\nconceded that para 4(vii) of the Terms of Reference is otiose and that\n\nthere will be no endeavour to prosecute. However, another set of fetters\n\nbecome necessary because of the history recorded aforesaid and the\n\nsignificance of the press conference given by the Chairman of the\n\nCommittee. The subject matter went much further than it ought to have\n\nand as a result, we have analysed the press conference in detail to repel\n\nthe contention on behalf of the respondents that this aspect should not be\n\ntaken seriously or is more preemptory in nature. We are clearly of the\n\nview that it is not so. The Committee cannot have a misconception that it\n\nis some kind of a prosecuting agency which can embark on the path of\n\nholding people guilty and direct the filing of supplementary chargesheet\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                                                    [178]</span>\n\fagainst them. We, thus, opine that this aspect has to be kept in mind by\n\nthe Committee so as to not vitiate future proceedings and give rise to\n\nanother challenge.      We are of the view that in any eventuality, as\n\nspeculative as it may be, if the Committee seeks to traverse the path\n\nrelating to the excluded Entries, i.e. law and order and police, any\n\nrepresentative of Facebook who would appear before the Committee\n\nwould be well within their right to refuse to answer the query and such an\n\napproach cannot be taken amiss with possibility of inviting privilege\n\nproceedings. It is a delicate balance to follow and we do not seek to give\n\nan excuse to the representative of the petitioners to not answer questions\n\nand frustrate the proceedings before the Committee qua the petitioners.\n\nHowever, at the same time, we give this very limited protection were the\n\nCommittee to embark on these prohibited areas. We are quite confident\n\nthat such an eventuality will not arise, given the important role that the\n\nCommittee is performing and that it will accept the sagacious advice. So\n\nmuch and not further.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_532\">      Conclusion:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_533\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_534\">228. We have penned down our views on the issues raised by the\n\npetitioners, but in view of the elaborate arguments and length of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">                                                                    [179]</span>\n\fjudgment, we consider it appropriate to summarise the ratio/directions in\n\nthe following terms:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_535\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">   I.     There is no dispute about the right of the Assembly or the\n\n   Committee to proceed on grounds of breach of privilege per se.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">   II.    The power to compel attendance by initiating privilege\n\n   proceedings is an essential power.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">   III. Members and non-Members (like the petitioners) can equally\n\n   be directed to appear before the Committee and depose on oath.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">   IV.    In the given facts of the case, the issue of privileges is\n\n   premature. Having said that, the insertion of para 4(vii) of the Terms\n\n   of Reference taken along with the press conference of the Chairman\n\n   of the Committee could legitimately give rise to apprehensions in the\n\n   mind of the petitioners on account of which a caveat has been made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">   V.      Canvassing a clash between privilege powers and certain\n\n   fundamental rights is also preemptory in the present case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"301898\" id=\"span_227\">VI.    In any case, the larger issue of privileges vis-a-vis the right of\n\n   free speech, silence, and privacy in the context of Part III of the\n\n   Constitution is still at large in view of the reference to the larger\n\n   Bench in <a href=\"/doc/301898/\" id=\"a_205\">N.

The Assembly admittedly does not have any power to legislate\n\non aspects of law and order and police in view of Entries 1 and 2 of\n\nList II in the Seventh Schedule inter alia being excluded.

Para 4(vii) of the Terms of Reference does not survive for any\n\nopinion of the Committee. It will not be permissible for the\n\nCommittee to encroach upon any aspects strictly within the domain of\n\nEntries 1 and 2 of List II of the Seventh Schedule.

We have looked into this aspect to see if there are any international\n\nbest practices and would like to refer to some of them without a very\n\nexpansive discussion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_545\">5.    <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 6</a> of the European Convention on Human Rights, while\n\nrecognising the right of fair trial and public hearing, qualifies it inter alia to\n\nbe completed “within a reasonable time”. 150 This is intrinsically linked to\n\nadministering justice without delays. Delay in judicial proceedings has\n\nbeen the bane of our country and there cannot be a refusal to part ways from\n\nold practices especially when they have outlived their purpose. It is the\n\nlitigants who bear the costs of our complex and prolonged adjudicatory\n\nprocess. We are conscious of the equal responsibility of this side of the\n\nbench – it is the need of the hour to write clear and short judgments which\n\nthe litigant can understand. The Wren &amp; Martin principles of precis writing\n\nmust be adopted. But then how is this to be achieved if the submissions\n\nitself go on for hours on end with vast amounts of material being placed\n\nbefore the Court; with the expectation that each aspect would be dealt with\n\nin detail failing which review applications will be filed (not that they are not\n150 <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_208\">Article 6</a>, European Convention on Human Rights, 1953.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                                                           [184]</span>\n\ffiled otherwise!) We are weighed down by judicial precedent. Often a\n\nreference is made to the judgment of the Privy Council or the earlier years\n\nof the Supreme Court, which saw short and crisp judgments but then, the\n\nvolume of precedents we face today was not present then.                 In a\n\ntechnological age like ours, all that is required is to instruct the junior\n\ncounsel to take out all judgments on a particular point of view and submit it\n\nto the court in a nice spiral binding. On every aspect there may be multiple\n\njudgments. In our view if the proposition of law is not doubted by the\n\nCourt, it does not need a precedent unless asked for. If a question is raised\n\nabout a legal proposition, the judgment must be relatable to that proposition\n\n– and not multiple judgments. The other scenario is if the facts of the cited\n\njudgments are so apposite to the facts of the case that it could act as a\n\nguiding principle.    In R. v. Erskine; R. v. Williams 151 a well-known\n\naphorism of Viscount Falkland in 1641 was noticed “if it is not necessary to\n\nrefer to a previous decision of the court, it is necessary not to refer to it.\n\nSimilarly, if it is not necessary to include a previous decision in the bundle\n\nof authorities, it is necessary to exclude it. That approach will be rigidly\n\nenforced.” This forms the basis of the criminal practice directions in the UK\n\nwhich apply to all criminal matters before the Court of Appeals, Crown\n\n151 [2009] EWCA Crim 1425, [2010] 1 WLR 183.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_546\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                                                        [185]</span>\n\fCourt, and the Magistrate’s Court. Criminal practice directions (vii) clarifies\n\nthat if a judgment does not refer to a cited case, it is not that the court has\n\nnot referred to it but rather, that the court was not assisted by it. We adopt\n\nthe same as we can say no better.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_547\">6.    The contribution to the development of law can be nurtured by\n\ncomprehensible precedent. There may be times when the complexity of\n\nmatters gives rise to complex opinions. But we find that judgments are\n\nbecoming more complex and verbose only on account of large number of\n\nprecedents cited and the necessity to deal with them and not merely refer to\n\nthem as is done in other countries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_548\">7.    We have for long discussed case management but seldom is it\n\nfollowed in its true letter and spirit. This may possibly be because of the\n\nlarge volumes of cases but then this is all the more reason for better\n\nmanagement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_549\">8.    The US Supreme Court is more restrictive in its time frame – not that\n\nUK Courts are far behind. The norms and the traditions take care of the\n\nrequirement of restrictive time frames to address submissions; which are\n\npreceded by the contours of arguments given in the written synopsis and the\n\nmaterial sought to be relied upon. We do not doubt that lawyers think on\n\ntheir feet but then given the current milieu, there has to be clarity before the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                                                                          [186]</span>\n\flawyers get on their feet keeping a little leeway in mind for something\n\nwhich may evolve during the arguments.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_550\">9.    The Supreme Court of India as on 01.05.2021 had 67,898 pending\n\nmatters.152 The time spent on routine matters leaves little time to settle legal\n\nprinciples pending before larger Benches that may have an impact down the\n\nline on the judicial system. We have a straight example of this with a\n\nreference to a larger Bench pending in N. Ravi153.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_551\">10.   Another matter of concern is prolonged interim proceedings.            In\n\ncriminal matters, even bail matters are being argued for hours together and\n\nat multiple levels. The position is no different in civil proceedings where\n\nconsiderable time is spent at interim stage when the objective should be\n\nonly to safeguard the rights of the parties by a short order, and spend the\n\ntime on the substantive proceedings instead which could bring an end to the\n\nlis rather than on the interim arrangement. In fact, interim orders in civil\n\nproceedings are of no precedential value. This is the reason it is said that\n\nwe have become courts of interim proceedings where final proceedings\n\nconclude after ages- only for another round to start in civil proceedings of\n\nexecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_552\">152Statistics, Monthly Pending Cases, Types of matters pending in Supreme\nCourt of India as on 01.05.2021 , Supreme Court India,           accessible at:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">https://main.sci.gov.in/statistics.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">153 Supra note 46.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                                                                          [187]</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_553\">\f11.
