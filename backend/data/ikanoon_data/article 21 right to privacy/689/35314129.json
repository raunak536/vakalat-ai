Teggi, Joint Commissioner &amp; CPIO, appeared through video\nconference.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">The appellant inter alia submitted that Srinivasa Rao is his brother who got the\njob by submitting forged certificates/document. Therefore, he filed the instant\nRTI application and sought aforesaid information/documents which was\ndenied by the respondent arbitrarily. The appellant requested the Commission\nto inquire into the matter and give necessary directions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">The respondent while defending their case inter alia submitted that they had\nreplied to the RTI application, and the first appeal vide letters dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                       Page 2 of 6</span>\n 03.07.2023 and 24.07.2023 respectively. The respondent submitted that\ninformation sought pertained to third party, disclosure of which has no\nrelationship with any public activity or interest. Accordingly, the respondent\ndenied the information and claimed exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_4\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the\nRTI Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">The respondent informed that the appellant has filed a WP No. 23866 of 2024,\ndated 25.10.2024 in the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh for directions to\nthe Commission to dispose of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">Decision:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case,\nhearing both the parties and perusal of the records, noted that the appellant\nsought copies of job notifications; educational qualification certificates\nsubmitted at the time of joining; appointment letter, total service completed\nfrom joining and total amount of salary paid up to today from joining of Shri\nEdara Srinivasa Rao, an employee of the respondent.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">The respondent denied the information on the ground of it being third party\ninformation and claimed exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_5\">section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act. The\nFAA vide its order dated 24.07.2023 upheld the CPIO&#x27;s reply. The appellant\nsubmitted that his brother Shri Srinivasa Rao got the job in the respondent\noffice by submitting forged certificates/documents. Therefore, he pleaded for\ndisclosure of information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Perusal of the case records reveal that the appellant has not made any\ncomplaint in the respondent office regarding forged certificates/documents\nsubmitted by Shri Srinivasa Rao for getting job in the respondent department.\nHe directly filed the RTI application and sought aforesaid documents wherein\nhe did not allege about submission of forged documents by Shri Srinivasa Rao\nat the time of his appointment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">The appellant only at the stage of second appeal and during the hearing\nalleged that Shri E. Srinivasa Rao secured the job in the respondent\norganization by submitting fraudulent documents/qualifications and\npotentially without satisfying the proper employment criteria. The appellant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     Page 3 of 6</span>\n requested the Commission to inquire into this issue. It may not be out of place\nto mention that under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_6\">RTI Act</a>, the Commission cannot inquire into the\nallegations made by the appellant securing appointments in the respondents&#x27;\norganization by forging documents. The authority to verify the legality or\nillegality of appointments of any individual in the organization rests with the\ncompetent authority of the organization and not with the Commission. Thus,\nprayer of the appellant cannot be acceded to under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">RTI\nAct</a> by the Commission.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">The respondent during the hearing apprised the Commission that the appellant\nhas filed a writ petition (WP No. 23866 of 2024), dated 25.10.2024 in the\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh praying for directions to the\nCommission to dispose of the second appeal of the appellant filed in the\nCommission. However, as per the records available with the Commission no\ndirections have been received by the Registry of this Bench from the Hon&#x27;ble\nHigh Court till the date of passing this order in the said matter. Moreover, the\nappellant did not approach the Commission with clean hand as he did not\ndisclose above facts before the Commission.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">It is needless to mention that under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">Right to Information (RTI) Act</a>, an\nindividual&#x27;s educational qualification is generally considered &quot;personal\ninformation&quot; and is therefore exempt from disclosure unless there is a\ncompelling public interest justifying its release, as per <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\nThe appellant failed to establish any larger public interest warranting the\ndisclosure of information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68081013\" id=\"span_4\">The Commission would like to refer the extract in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/68081013/\" id=\"a_10\">Union of India\nv. R. Jayachandran WP (C</a>) 3406/2012 dated 19.02.2014 wherein the Hon&#x27;ble\nHigh Court of Delhi had held that passport details, copies of birth certificate\nand copies of records of educational qualification are personal information, the\ndisclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of individuals\nunless there was an overbearing public interest in favour of disclosure.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116590946\" id=\"span_5\">Furthermore, the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in the case of <a href=\"/doc/116590946/\" id=\"a_11\">Union Public\nService Commission v. Dr. Mahesh Mangalat (Date of Decision</a>: 17th March,\n2015) (W.P.

Prior to the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">RTI Act</a>, access to any information\npertaining to public authorities was correlated to the locus standi of the\nrequestor. In other words, it was necessary for the information-seeker to\nshow why he/she wanted the information before a decision could be\nmade to give or not to give the information sought by him. With the\nenactment of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act</a> this requirement has been changed drastically.\nThe present Act abolishes the concept of locus standi as under <a href=\"/doc/1505894/\" id=\"a_14\">section\n6(2)</a> of the RTI Act no reasons need to be given for seeking information.\nHowever, this restriction on disclosure of reasons cannot be\nmisconstrued to mean that any information pertaining to a public\nauthority or its employees is public information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">19. It is a settled law that for seeking personal information regarding any\nemployee of the public authority the applicant must disclose a\n&quot;sustainable public interest‟. Even <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act was\nenacted to ensure that all information furnished to public authorities\nincluding personal information is not given free access to. As per this\nSection unless the CPIO or the State PIO or the appellate authority, as the\ncase may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies, the\ndisclosure of any such information that invades the privacy of an\nindividual is not permissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_7\">Moreover, the Commission relied on the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_16\">Bihar Public Service Commission v. Saiyed Hussain Abbas\nRizwi</a>: (2012) 13 SCC 61 wherein in the context of exemption\nunder <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, the Court had held that\nexemption provided under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8</a> of the Act is the rule and only in\nexceptional circumstances of larger public interest the information would\nbe disclosed. The relevant observations are mentioned as under:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41868\" id=\"span_8\">&quot;22. The expression &quot;public interest&quot; has to be understood in its true\nconnotation so as to give complete meaning to the relevant provisions of\nthe Act. The expression &quot;public interest&quot; must be viewed in its strict sense\nwith all its exceptions so as to justify denial of a statutory exemption in\nterms of the Act. In its common parlance, the expression &quot;public\ninterest&quot;, like &quot;public purpose&quot;, is not capable of any precise definition. It\ndoes not have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its colour from the\nstatute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and state of\nsociety and its needs (<a href=\"/doc/41868/\" id=\"a_19\">State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh</a> [AIR 1952 SC\n252] ). It also means the general welfare of the public that warrants\nrecognition and protection; something in which the public as a whole has\na stake [Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (8th Edn.)].</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                    Page 5 of 6</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       23. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities objectively and\n      the consequences of such disclosure have to be weighed with regard to\n      the circumstances of a given case. The decision has to be based on\n      objective satisfaction recorded for ensuring that larger public interest\n      outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or other factors stated in the\n      provision.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_8\">In view of the above observations and in the absence of any larger public\ninterest, the Commission finds that reply given by the respondent is in\nconsonance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_20\">RTI Act</a> and intervention of the\nCommission is not warranted in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Let a copy of this order be served to the Legal Section of this Commission to\nfile compliance report in the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">                    The appeal is disposed of accordingly.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">                                     Vinod Kumar Tiwari (िवनोद कुमार ितवारी)\n                                    Information Commissioner (सूचना आयु )\nAuthenticated true copy\n(अिभ मािणत स!ािपत ित)\n\n(S.
