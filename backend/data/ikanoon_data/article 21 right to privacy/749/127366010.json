This batch of Writ Petitions filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India raises important and far-reaching questions\nrelatable primarily to the fundamental right of freedom of speech\nand expression guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The\nPetitioners specifically assail the constitutional validity of Rule 3(i)\n(II)(A) and (C) of the Information Technology (Intermediary\nGuidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules 2023\nwhich amend Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the IT Rules 2021 (&quot;the impugned\nRule&quot;) as being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_4\">, 19(1)(a)</a> and (g) and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India and Section 79 and Section 87(2)(z) and\n(zg) of the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_6\">Information Technology Act, 2000</a> (&quot;<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_7\">IT Act</a>&quot;). The\nthrust of the challenge is that the impugned Rule has a &#x27;chilling\neffect&#x27; upon the freedom of speech and expression of the\nPetitioners, guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution of India.\nThe Petitioners are aggrieved by the impugned Rule vesting\nauthority in a Fact Check Unit (&quot;FCU&quot;) to be notified by the\nGovernment to identify the veracity or otherwise of &#x27;information&#x27;,\nthereby alleging the Government to be the sole arbiter of truth in\nrespect of any business related to itself.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">ABOUT THE PARTIES\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_3\">2.

The said\nSection as it now stands offers internet intermediaries respite\nfrom liability not only under the Act and its Rules, but also under\nany other legislation as well. A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/2959282/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 79(1)</a> and\n(2) indicates that the protection from liability is in cases where\nservice providers may not know exactly what their\nsubscribers/users are doing, and they should not suffer penalties\nfor something that they are not aware. Thus, the provision\nessentially covers cases where the activity undertaken by the\nIntermediary is of a technical, automatic, and passive nature. For\nprotection under <a href=\"/doc/90266491/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 79(2)</a>, the intermediaries should neither\nhave knowledge nor control over information transmitted or\nstored on its computer resource. At the same time, <a href=\"/doc/117237824/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 79(3)</a>\nrevives the liability in cases where the intermediary plays a\nparticipatory and active role in hosting offensive content.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">      <a href=\"/doc/1769769/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 87</a> of the IT Act reads as under:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               Page 11 of 92</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_14\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_22\">January 2024\n                             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                      oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\n       &quot;87.

The\nCourt also read down <a href=\"/doc/183491832/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 79(3)(b)</a> to mean that an intermediary\nupon receiving actual knowledge from a Court or on being notified\nby the appropriate Government or its Agency that unlawful acts\nrelatable to <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution are going to be\ncommitted then fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to\nsuch material.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_18\">7.    The Supreme Court upheld <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 69A</a> of the Act noticing\nthat unlike Section 66A, it is a narrowly drawn provision with\nseveral safeguards. It was noticed that the 2009 Blocking Rules are\nframed under Sub-section (2) thereof.          Rule (3) of the 2009\nBlocking Rules provides for designation by the Central Government\nvide a notification in the official gazette, an officer of the Central\nGovernment not below the rank of a Joint Secretary as the\ndesignated officer for the purpose of issuing directions for blocking\nfor access by the public any information referable to <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 69A</a> of\nthe Act.

Rule    (7)     provides     for   examination   of   the\ncomplaint/request by a Committee of Government Personnel which\nunder Rule (8) are, at the outset, to make reasonable efforts for\nidentification of the originator or intermediary hosting the\ninformation and only after following the mandated procedure under\nthe Rules followed by the recommendation of the Committee, that\nthe Secretary, Department of Information Technology shall pass the\nfinal order.    Additionally, Rule (14) provides for a Review\nCommittee to meet at least once in two months and record its\nfindings as to whether the directions issued are in accordance with\n<a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 69A (1)</a> of the Act and if found contrary, the Review\nCommittee is empowered to set aside the direction and unblock the\nsaid information.

Reverting to the exemption provision of <a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 79</a> of the Act,\nit is pertinent to note that exemption from liability also applies if the\nintermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties\nunder the Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central\nGovernment may prescribe in that behalf. The term &#x27;Due Diligence&#x27;\nwas nowhere prescribed in the Act or Rules as it stood then. Thus,\nthe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules, 2011\nwere notified. Thereafter, in supersession thereof, the Information\nTechnology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics\nCode) Rules 2021 (&quot;the Ethics Code Rules&quot;) came to be notified.\nPart II of these Rules now prescribe the Due Diligence by\nIntermediaries and provides for a Grievance Redressal Mechanism.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                 Page 14 of 92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_21\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_42\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">9.

Alvarez (supra) relied upon by the\nPetitioners to contend that even a per se false speech cannot be\nrestrained, it is submitted that the Alvarez rule does not lay down a\nblanket proposition and in fact, the US Supreme Court has accepted\nthat the false information which results in harm could legitimately\nbe legislated against. Furthermore, justification for restricting false\nspeech in other arenas of Court and government functions, i.e.,\nperjury and impersonation being legally cognizable harm associated\nwith a false statement has been upheld by the US Supreme Court in\nAlvarez (supra). Juxtaposing the Alvarez ratio, the impugned Rule\naims to prevent the very same &#x27;legally cognizable harm&#x27; which the\nUS Supreme Court recognized as a legitimate restriction on free\nspeech. The learned Solicitor General hence draws a parallel, and\nsays that the harms in the Indian context of the Indian constitutional\nscheme is clearly defined under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 19(2)</a> and what the\nimpugned Rule targets is only that information which has a direct\ncausal link between harm to the public at large.

All\nactions taken by the FCU are based on evidence. Moreover, the\nimpugned Rule does not enter the domain of information which is\nnot related to the business of the government.

To test this and for better understanding, the\nunamended portion and the amended impugned portion of Rule 3(1)</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">(b)(v) is analysed separately. Due Diligence under the unamended\nRule obliged the intermediary to make &#x27;reasonable efforts&#x27; to cause\nthe user of its computer resource not to host any information that\nknowingly or intentionally communicates any misinformation or\ninformation patently false and untrue or misleading in nature. Thus,\nif an intermediary learns of any offensive information, suo-moto or\nupon a complaint, it is expected to make &#x27;reasonable effort&#x27; to cause\nthe user not to host the same. The Intermediary, as per its existing\npolicy is bound to put it through its various filters and act\naccordingly. This, the intermediary does in case of any of its user or\nsubscriber. Even a Government Department or a Ministry as its\n&#x27;user&#x27; or &#x27;subscriber&#x27; can report a complaint being aggrieved by any\noffensive content and the intermediary follows the same practice as\nin the case of any individual user or complainant. Upon failure to act\nand discharge due diligence even as per the unamended Rule, it\nstands to lose safe harbour.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">16.   Now, what the amendment adds is constitution of a FCU to\nidentify fake, false or misleading information, which is knowingly\n\n58 (2012) 10 SCC 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">59 (2017) 9 SCC 1.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                 Page 51 of 92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_150\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_180\">January 2024\n                          Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                   oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nand intentionally communicated in respect of Government\nbusiness.   Thus, instead of any department or ministry as an\nindividual user, reporting any offensive content, it is the FCU\nconstituted as such, representing various departments/ministries as\n&#x27;user&#x27; that will report a complaint. The Intermediary is then to act\nas per its existing policy and take appropriate action. The\n&#x27;reasonable effort&quot; it is expected to take is of the same degree as it\nwould in case of any individual user, including an individual\ngovernment department. No reasonable effort of a higher degree is\nexpected from the Intermediary. This interpretation of the amended\nRule stands to reason and aligns with the explanation proffered by\nMr. Mehta while answering our query regarding none of the\nintermediary having posed any challenge to the impugned Rule\nespecially since it is the intermediary which loses immunity. His\nanswer is that the amendment was at the behest of the\nintermediaries themselves, and for their convenience alone that\nconstitution of a &#x27;FCU&#x27; was envisioned with a view to coordinate\nwith various Government departments and collectively bring to the\nnotice of the intermediaries any fake, false or misleading content\nabout its policies etc. The intermediary otherwise will have no way\nof being made aware of the veracity of content on social media\npertaining to Government policies, considering the vastness of\ncontent on social media. The intermediaries will then act as per its\npolicies.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_224\">17.   Another submission of Mr. Mehta is that there is no &#x27;take\ndown&#x27; mandate issued to the Intermediary. An option available to it\nis to issue a disclaimer. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_151\">In my opinion, the Rule read in its entirety\nmerely obliges the intermediary to make &#x27;reasonable effort&#x27; by itself,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                             Page 52 of 92</span>\n                           31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_181\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nand cause the user to not host, share etc., any information\ncommunicating misinformation etc. Making &#x27;Reasonable effort&#x27;\nsaves an Intermediary from losing safe harbour. The option of a\n&#x27;disclaimer&#x27; to that of a &#x27;take down&#x27; falls within the meaning of\n&#x27;reasonable effort&#x27; as contemplated in the Rule. There is nothing in\nthe Rule that rules out options other than a take down. The Rule is\nclear and speaks for itself. Even in the absence of the amendment,\nthe intermediaries, pursuant to their existing practices and policies\ncontained in their Terms and Agreement, act in the form of issuing a\ndisclaimer, warning, caution to its user in respect of any offensive\ncontent. The user is then directed to their grievance redressal\nmechanism. From this interpretation of the Rule, the procedure for\ndeprivation of exemption is fair, just and reasonable. Thus, it cannot\nbe said that the provision suffers from manifest arbitrariness.\nNotably, the grievance of the Petitioners is based on second\nguessing the intent of the government, attributing to it an invidious\nmotive to ensure repression of criticism of its policies or as the\nPetitioners put it, the all-pervasive business of the Central\nGovernment. The insistence of the Petitioners to deny the\navailability of an option of a &#x27;disclaimer&#x27; inherent in the Rule is\nincomprehensible. With greatest respect, I am unable to subscribe\nto the interpretation that &#x27;to not host&#x27; only means a &#x27;take down&#x27;.\nThus, the Petitioners&#x27; challenge to the curtailment of their free\nspeech right by a direction of take down fails.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_225\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_154\">18.   More so ever, it is important to remember that along with\nSection 66A, <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 69A</a> was also a subject of challenge in the\n<a href=\"/doc/110813550/\" id=\"a_183\">Shreya Singhal</a> (supra) matter along with the 2009 Blocking Rules,\nalso framed as relating to matters under clause (z) of the Section\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                              Page 53 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_184\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\n87(2). The Supreme Court struck down Section 66A and upheld\n<a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 69A</a> by drawing a distinction between the two provisions\nand held the latter to be a narrowly drawn provision with several\nsafeguards. It further held that blocking of access by the public to\ninformation can only be resorted to where the Central Government\nis satisfied that it is necessary to do so. The blocking rules framed\nunder clause(z), provided for reasons to be recorded in writing to\nmake them assailable in a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_186\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution and these rules have already passed the scrutiny of the\nApex Court. Thus, even in the event that the intermediary chooses\nto block content, it can be done only by following the due\nprocedures prescribed in the 2009 Blocking Rules. This is so\nbecause the source of both, the 2009 Blocking Rules and the Ethics\nCode Rules containing the impugned Rule is <a href=\"/doc/1389379/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 69A</a>. Both\nthese Rules complement each other, one does not eclipse the other.</span></span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_156\">That being a settled position of law, I have no hesitation in holding\nthat the impugned Rule is neither ultra vires the provisions of the\nAct nor is it contrary to the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/110813550/\" id=\"a_188\">Shreya Singhal</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_157\">19.

This alone is not sufficient to\npresume the Government to be an arbiter in its own cause. The\nFCU is not yet constituted pursuant to the undertaking of the\nLearned Solicitor General to this Court. The charter of the FCU,\nthe extent of its authority, the manner of its functioning in\nascertaining fake, false or misleading information, etc, is yet\nunknown. In case of any actual bias exhibited by the FCU, recourse\nto the courts of law is always open to the aggrieved person. Thus, a\nchallenge to a potential violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 14</a> on the basis of an\napprehension is not maintainable and to that extent it is pre-mature.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1928935\" id=\"span_172\">26.

The Petitioners express their fear of the impugned Rule\nhaving a chilling effect on a citizen&#x27;s right to circulate information\nin the form of news, opinion, political satire, political parody,\npolitical sarcasm, political criticism, etc. The argument is that as\nsoon as the FCU of the Central Government flags any information\nto be offensive of the impugned Rule, the intermediary fearing a loss\nof its safe harbor or for any other reasons, commercial or otherwise,\nis compelled to take down the content. The user in turn, has no\nrecourse to a legal remedy which in turn is a blatant violation of his\nfreedom of speech and expression. The Petitioners finally say that,\nnot only is an intermediary directly implicated upon the\nidentification of content as fake, false or misleading by the FCU, but\na user is also directly affected, as the intermediary may terminate\naccess to the platform on the usage rights under the IT Rule.

Rule 3A even as it existed prior to the amendment, provides for\na Grievance Redressal Mechanism of the intermediary which\ninclude a Grievance Officer and an Appeal to a Grievance Redressal\nCommittee, which is mandated to resolve the complaint of any\naggrieved person, in a time-bound manner. The impugned Rule\ncontains sufficient procedural safeguards. Furthermore, Clause (n)\nof the same due diligence Rule mandates the intermediary to respect\nall the rights accorded to the citizens under the Constitution,\nincluding <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_233\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_234\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_235\">21.</a></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">30.   The specific grievance of the Petitioner in the first petition is\nthat the impugned Rule violates his fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_236\">Article\n19(g).</a> As a political satirist, he necessarily engages in commentary\nabout actions of the Central Government and its personnel. He says\nthat his ability to engage in political satire will be unreasonably and\nexcessively curtailed, if his content were subjected to a manifestly\narbitrary fact check. In the scheme of the Rule, this apprehension of\nthe Petitioner is sufficiently taken care of.         Mere flagging of\ninformation as offensive under the Rule does not necessarily prompt\naction. The immunity under <a href=\"/doc/814605/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 79</a> of the Act continues to\napply if the intermediary observes due diligence while discharging\nits duties under the Act and observes such other guidelines as the\nCentral Government may prescribe in this behalf.

It is relevant to note here that there is no intermediary before\nus complaining of a &#x27;chilling effect&#x27;. As mentioned supra, the\nLearned Solicitor General clarified that the Central Government\nhad engaged with the intermediaries in an exhaustive consultation\nprocess and in fact the intermediaries themselves had requested the\nCentral Government to notify an agency to identify and authenticate\ninformation relating to its own business to assist the intermediaries\nin the due diligence exercise. In these circumstances, none of the\nintermediaries have assailed the impugned Rule. Be that as it may,\nthe Rule plainly read merely targets misinformation, patently untrue\ninformation, which the user knows to be fake, or false or misleading\nand yet is communicated with a mala fide intent. The qualification to\nthe offensive information is knowledge and intent. Political satire,\npolitical parody, political criticism, opinions, views etc does not\nform part of the offensive information. Then too, if such content is\nwrongly flagged by the FCU, it is always open to the user/aggrieved\nperson to raise a complaint before the redressal mechanism of the\nintermediary and agitate his grievance before it and ultimately\nbefore a court of competent jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                             Page 62 of 92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_184\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_243\">January 2024\n                            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                     oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\">32.   In the discussion relating to the &#x27;chilling effect&#x27;, the\nPetitioners have referred to a marketplace of ideas, not being a\nforum only for agreement. Undoubtedly, it is a forum for exchange\nof ideas, views, opinions, perspectives, a place for disagreements.\nThe impugned Rule, however, is not about dissent or disagreement\non existing policies or of facts. It sets bounds only for &#x27;fake\ninformation&#x27;, a discussion on policies that do not exist. It seeks to\nimpede spread of information that communicates misinformation.\nThe impugned Rule in fact, is a forum for exchange of ideas,\ndebates, dissent, discussions as a marketplace, but based on real and\nexisting facts, which render discussions and debates productively\neffective, meaningful, and vibrant. Dissuading dissent/discussion\non something which does not exist, or which is only in the realm of\nimagination of some person, perhaps having a perfidious interest in\nspreading fake, false and misleading information, does not take away\nfrom the concept of a marketplace, as a platform to debate or dissent\nor criticise etc. In fact, the impugned Rule encourages debates and\ndiscussions on facts bereft of fakery. In this context, I agree with my\nbrother Judge&#x27;s reference to the remark of Dr D.Y Chandrachud J\n(as he then was) that a discourse of law is a discourse of civility is\napt, considering that civility is based on authenticity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_242\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_185\">33.   The deprivation of safe harbor only entails withdrawal of the\nexemption from liability of the intermediaries. The intermediary is\nentitled to defend itself by challenging the identification of content\nas fake, false or misleading by the FCU and the final arbiter is a\njurisdictionally competent Court. It is Rule 7 of the Ethics Code\nRules which provides that failure to observe these Rules will invite\nliability for punishment under any law for the time being in force\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                              Page 63 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_244\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nincluding the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_245\">Indian Penal Code</a>. Firstly, Rule 7 is not challenged\nand secondly, this Rule does not create a new offence other than the\nexisting offences in the IPC and the IT Act. Hence, apprehension of\nthe Petitioners that the intermediary being compelled to refuse to\ncontinue to post content of a user flagged by the FCU fearing loss of\nsafe harbor is unfounded and premature.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">34.       In the entire scheme of the Rule, there is neither any\nrestriction on the free speech of the user, such as the Petitioners nor\nany penal consequence to be faced by them.

It is clarified that at this juncture that it is not\nnecessary to engage in the exercise of balancing our\nconcern for the free flow of ideas and the democratic\nprocess, with our desire to further equality and human\ndignity. This is because no question would arise as to the\nconflict of two seemingly competing rights, being the right\nto freedom of speech and expression, vis-à-vis the right to\nhuman dignity and equality. The reason for the same is\nbecause, the restraint that is called for, is only in relation\nto unguided, derogatory, vitriolic speech, which in no way\ncan be considered as an essential part of exposition of\nideas, which has little social value. This discourse, in no\nway seeks to pose a potential danger to peaceful\ndissenters, who exercise their right to freedom of speech\nand expression in a critical, but measured fashion. The\npresent cases pertain specifically to derogatory,\ndisparaging speech, which closely resembles hate speech.\nSuch speech does not fall within the protective perimeter\nof <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and does not constitute the content of\nthe free speech right. Therefore, when such speech has\nthe effect of infringing the fundamental right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 21</a> of another individual, it would not constitute a\ncase which requires balancing of conflicting rights, but\none wherein abuse of the right to freedom of speech by a\nperson has attacked the fundamental rights of another.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                         Page 65 of 92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_191\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_254\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_248\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179868451\" id=\"span_192\">36.

Preamble to the Constitution consciously puts\n      together fraternity assuring dignity of the individual and\n      the unity and integrity of the nation. Dignity of individual\n      and unity and integrity of nation are linked, one in the\n      form of rights of individuals and other in the form of\n      individual&#x27;s obligation to others to ensure unity and\n      integrity of the nation. The unity and integrity of the\n      nation cannot be overlooked and slighted, as the acts that\n      &#x27;promote&#x27; or &#x27;likely&#x27; to &#x27;promote&#x27; divisiveness, alienation\n      and schematism do directly and indirectly impinge on the\n      diversity and pluralism, and when they are with the\n      objective and intent to cause public disorder or to demean\n      dignity of the targeted groups, they have to be dealt with\n      as per law. The purpose is not to curtail right of\n      expression and speech, albeit not to gloss over specific\n      egregious threats to public disorder and in particular to\n      the unity and integrity of the nation. Such threats not only\n      insidiously weaken virtue and superiority of diversity but\n      cut back and lead to demands depending on the context\n      and occasion, for suppression of freedom to express and\n      speak on the ground of reasonableness. Freedom and\n      rights cannot extend to create public disorder or\n      armour those who challenge integrity and unity of the\n      country or promote and incite violence. Without\n      acceptable public order, freedom to speak and express\n      is challenged and would get restricted for the common\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                              Page 66 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_256\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\n      masses and law-abiding citizens.

However, the minute the same falls within the\ncategory of offensive information as set out in the impugned Rule,\nqualified by knowledge and intent of the user, and where the\nintermediary fails to observe due diligence, the exemption from\nliability of the intermediary is lost.

The relevant portion of the Rule for the purposes of this\ninterpretation reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">      The intermediary shall make reasonable efforts to cause\n      the users to not host, display...., share any information\n      that -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_197\">i)    Knowingly and intentionally communicates any\n      misinformation\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                              Page 68 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_259\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">      ii)   Knowingly and intentionally communicates\n      information which is patently false and untrue or\n      misleading in nature or,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">      iii) Knowingly and intentionally communicates\n      information in respect of any business of the Central\n      Government, is identified as fake or false or misleading by\n      such FCU of the Central Government as the Ministry\n      may, by notification publish in the Official Gazette,\n      specify;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_254\">40.   The interpretation of the Rule cannot be but to qualify every\ninformation by the words &#x27;knowingly and intentionally&#x27; even\napplying to the amendment regarding government business. It may\nbe recalled that the exemption from liability to an intermediary is\nbased on the intermediary being a passive third party, and its\nfunctions being limited to providing access. But as soon as its\npassive role ceases and becomes participatory, safe harbor is lost but\nthat too, only if the Intermediary fails to observe due diligence.\nHence it is the knowledge and intent which results in the loss of safe\nharbor and reading the Rule dehors application of the words\n&#x27;knowledge&#x27; and &#x27;intent&#x27; is not a correct interpretation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_255\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_199\">41.   An important aspect of these proceedings cannot be lost sight\nof which is that it is the &#x27;users&#x27; who are Petitioners before us. It is\ntheir right of free speech that is in contest. The genesis of\napprehension of violation of the user&#x27;s right of free speech is based\non the intermediary taking down content fearing loss of their\nimmunity. There is no gainsaying that the intermediary has no way\nof determining the knowledge and intent of the user. It is not the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                              Page 69 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_260\">January 2024\n                            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                     oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nintermediary before us canvassing its loss of immunity. The right to\nshare fake, patently untrue, false information is not a part of the free\nspeech right and it is incongruous to seek protection in this\nperspective. Right of speech will not enjoy protection if the user\nknowingly and intentionally shares fake, false or misleading\ninformation, flagged albeit by a FCU of the Central Government,\nresulting in a disclaimer or take down or any other action. No user\ncan canvass a right to abuse the right of another. Whether any\ncontent is fake or otherwise; whether it was knowingly and\nintentionally shared etc., are all questions which will need to be\ndetermined by adducing evidence by following the procedure\nestablished by law in a jurisdictionally competent court. The user is\nfree to enforce the terms of the User agreement with its\nintermediary by recourse to law.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_256\">42.     In the light of the discussion above, I am of the view that the\nimpugned Rule does not bring a chilling effect on the right of the\nuser.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_257\">        QUESTION (d):\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_258\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_201\">43.     Another concern of the Petitioners is that the operative words\nof the impugned Rule, i.e., &#x27;fake, false or misleading&#x27; and &#x27;business\nof the Government&#x27; are over-broad and vague, and thus vulnerable\nto subjective determination and are predicated on a true-false binary.\nAn example was given of a person criticizing the Government&#x27;s\neconomic policy by quoting data from sources, which may be flagged\nby the FCU as fake information. The learned Solicitor General\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                              Page 70 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_261\">January 2024\n                            Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                     oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nallays this apprehension by saying that the Rule does not attack\n&#x27;false information&#x27; by itself. A closer look at the Rule reveals that\nfalse information per se is not branded &#x27;offensive&#x27;, but it is the failure\nto make reasonable efforts to cause the user to not share that false\ninformation which the user knows to be false and, knowingly and\nintentionally causes the same to be communicated through the\nintermediary which the Rule addresses. Truth is the opposite of\nfalse and truthfulness or falsity of information may be relative,\nhowever, a fact cannot be fake. Fake is something which is non-\nexistent. Here, a question of subjective interpretation of fact does\nnot arise, because the very fact itself is non-existent. Thus, an\ninformation based on fabricated or non-existent facts falls within the\nmischief which is sought to be addressed by the impugned Rule. At\nthe cost of repetition, it is once again reiterated that a person must\nhave knowledge that the information which is communicated is fake,\nfalse or misleading and yet intentionally shares it to make it\noffensive.   Intent is a sine qua non for bringing into play the\nimpugned Rule. The intermediary may forgo the exemption from\nliability of prosecution, but it is only the jurisdictionally competent\nCourt which will have the final say as it is the Courts which have the\njurisdiction to establish &#x27;knowledge&#x27;, &#x27;intent&#x27;, etc. of a person\nsharing and communicating information known to him as being fake,\nfalse or misleading.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_259\">44.   Thus, content comprising of a critical opinion or a satire or\nparody, howsoever critical of the Government or its business, based\non &#x27;existent&#x27; and not fake or known to be false or misleading, does\nnot fall within the mischief sought to be corrected by the impugned\nRule. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_203\">In this perspective, the challenge to the Rule on the argument\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                               Page 71 of 92</span>\n                             31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_262\">January 2024\n                             Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                      oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nthat truth is not a binary and hence, any opinion, satire, parody,\nsarcasm, criticism, etc. will fall within the realm of the impugned\nRule, is not justified.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_260\">45.      Another limb of question no. 4, is a challenge to the Rule on\nthe ground of vagueness of the term &#x27;business of the Government&#x27;.\nThe learned Solicitor General has taken pains to explain that the\nterm &#x27;business of the Government of India&#x27; is mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/990669/\" id=\"a_263\">Article\n77</a> of the Constitution and has pointed to <a href=\"/doc/1608494/\" id=\"a_264\">Article 77(3)</a> which\nprovides for the President to make rules for convenient transaction\nof the business of the Government and for allocation among\nministers of the said business. Mr. Mehta referring to the Press\nInformation Bureau (&quot;PIB&quot;) says that presently the PIB is the\nNodal Agency of the Government which disseminates information\nto the media on Government policies etc. The mission of the PIB is\nto maximize governance effectiveness through communication and\namongst other functions also acts as a FCU with a stated object of\nacting     as   a   deterrent     to   creators     and   disseminators   of\nmisinformation. The Charter of PIB has defined the word &#x27;fake,\nmisleading and true&#x27;. However, admittedly these words are not\ndefined in the impugned Rule. Whether these words will find their\ndefinition in the FCU notification remains to be seen.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_261\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_205\">46.      Be that as it may, the un-amended Rule already deals with\nmisinformation or information which is patently false and untrue or\nmisleading in nature which the user knows to be such and yet\nintentionally communicates the same. Out of this larger pool of\ninformation, a category of specific information relatable to &#x27;business\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                  Page 72 of 92</span>\n                                31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_265\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nof the Government&#x27; is culled out and is termed as &#x27;offensive&#x27; only if\nflagged as fake or false or misleading by the FCU. The Rule as it\nearlier existed accepted a government department or a ministry as\nan individual &#x27;user&#x27; alike any other &#x27;user&#x27; and dealt with them in\naccordance with the terms of the user agreement. The addition\nbrought out by the amendment is to bring the various government\ndepartments under one umbrella called the &#x27;FCU&#x27; which will be a\none-point interaction with the intermediaries. Since it is the\nGovernment which will be in the best position to provide correct\nfacts on any aspect related to the conduct of its own business, the\nvagueness of the term by itself is not sufficient to strike down the\nentire Rule as ultra vires. Moreover, the offensive information\nrelated to the business of the government is only that which is\nknown to be false, fake, or misleading and yet intentionally\ncommunicated.

A perusal\nof the definitions appearing in these universally accepted\ndictionaries indicate that the word &#x27;false&#x27; is understood in its\nordinary sense to mean &#x27;something which does not correspond to the\ntruth&#x27;, &#x27;fake&#x27; to mean &#x27;something which is non-existent&#x27;, and\n&#x27;misleading&#x27; to mean &#x27;to give an incorrect interpretation or delusive&#x27;.\nThese words are also to be understood in the context of their use in\na sentence or phrase. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_207\">It is settled law that it is not a sound principle\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                              Page 73 of 92</span>\n                            31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_266\">January 2024\n                           Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                    oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\nin interpretation of statutes to lay emphasis on one word disjuncted\nfrom its preceding and succeeding words.

The words are to be understood in the ordinary sense of\ntheir meaning. Furthermore, the content being false, fake, or\nmisleading per se is not hit by the impugned Rule. The qualification\nis that the content must be known to be false, fake, or misleading\nand yet shared with malicious intent to attract the applicability of\nthe Rule. Seen in that light, the words &#x27;fake&#x27;, &#x27;false&#x27;, or &#x27;misleading&#x27;\nare used specifically in the context of deceptive, deceitful and\npatently untrue information. The context of the statutes and the\nmischief it targets can in no way be understood to apply to satire,\nparody, commentaries, or opinions.

At the same time, we need to note that when it\n        comes to balancing national security with liberty, we need\n        to be cautious.

Balancing is presented as a\n                zero-sum game in which more of one necessarily\n                means less of the other ... Although beloved of\n                constitutional lawyers and political theorists, the\n                experience of criminal justice is that balancing is a\n                politically dangerous metaphor unless careful\n                regard is given to what is at stake.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">        57.

Indeed, the right to free expression is a crucial and\nindispensable component of a nation having adopted democracy.\nDemocracy is not simply about a vote-based election system, it\nentails far more than just voting. Citizens have a right to participate\nin the country&#x27;s functioning even after elections and after\nadministrations are created.70 Citizens are allowed to express their\nopinions about the democratic processes well after the elections. It\ndoes not only mean that a citizen can express his views only in an\neloquent, logical, or courteous manner but can very well include\ndiscourteous, insulting, illogical, and even puzzling expressions.\nHowever, this right does not permit freedom to share information\nwhich a person knows to be false yet intentionally communicates as\nauthentic. Decisions and actions taken by a citizen based on\ndeceptive information is likely to result in deleterious consequences\nin society and has capability of destroying a body quality and societal\nharmony thereby endangering national security.

In the decision in the matter of Facebook v.

It said that such platforms with\npotential to influence public opinion must be held accountable for\nspread of disruptive messages and hate speeches. Writing the\njudgment, Justice Kaul said, &quot;while Facebook has played a crucial\nrole in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and\nmeans to escape State censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact\nthat it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive\nmessages, voices and ideologies&quot;. The Court further said, &quot;the\nsignificance of this is all the more in democracy which itself rests on\ncertain core values. This unprecedented degree of influence\n(wielded by social media platforms) necessitates safeguards and\ncaution in consonance with democratic values. Platforms and\nintermediaries must subserve the principal objected as a valuable\ntool for public good upholding democratic values&quot;, thus cautioning\nabout the experience of Western democracies where social media\nplatforms were suspected to have been used for influencing core\ndemocratic processes.

A lot of blame\nwas sought to be placed at the door of social media, it being a source\nof this evolving contemporary phenomena where objective truth is\nbecoming a commodity with diminishing value.

After all, the chances are those lies or at any rate similar\nlies will pass into history&#x27;...... the words have proved to be\nprophetic.&quot; The Court noted the acknowledgment by Facebook\nthat they had removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content in\nthe second quarter of 2020, which showed that they exercised a\nsubstantial degree of control over the content that is allowed to be\ndisseminated on its platform. &quot;To that extent, a parallel may be\ndrawn with editorial responsibility cast on other mass circulation\nmedia&quot;, the Supreme Court said.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">57.

Presently, the threat of disinformation and hoaxes has evolved\nfrom mere annoyance to warfare that can create social discord,\nincrease polarisation and in some cases, even influence election\noutcome. State and non-state actors with geopolitical aspirations,\nideological     believers,   violent    extremists,    and    economically\nmotivated enterprise can manipulate social media narratives with\neasy and unprecedented reach and scale. This dis-information now\nalso has a new tool in the form of Deep fakes. The dangers of fake\nnews on social media intermediaries cannot be played down any\nlonger. It is in this scenario that the Government appears to have\nframed the impugned Rule to curb the menace of fake, false, and\nmisleading information related to business of the government. On an\nexacting understanding of the Rule, the information to be offensive\nmust be shared with the knowledge that it is not genuine and is\nshared with malicious intent. In such a vibrant and largest\ndemocracy in the world and the wide reach and merits of social\nmedia, there is bound to be a suspicion regarding the intent of the\ngovernment in introducing a provision such as the impugned Rule.\nThe apprehensions of the Petitioners are also justified and cannot be\nswept away as frivolous or motivated.

The requirement of a\nnuanced regulation underscores the cost of free speech absolutism\nin this &quot;infodemic&quot; era.

Fake is something which is non-existent. The\n      question of subjective interpretation of fact does not arise,\n      because the very fact itself is non-existent. The argument\n      that truth is not a binary and hence, any opinion, satire,\n      parody, sarcasm, criticism, etc. will fall within the realm of\n      the impugned Rule making the Rule unconstitutional is\n      rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_313\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_257\">v)    The un-amended Rule already deals with misinformation\n      or information which is patently false and untrue or\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">                          Page 90 of 92</span>\n                        31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_325\">January 2024\n                       Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc\n\n\n\n\n      misleading in nature which the user knows to be such and\n      yet intentionally communicates the same. Culled out of\n      this is a category of information relatable to &#x27;business of\n      the Government&#x27; which is available for scrutiny by the\n      FCU. Since it is the Government which is in the best\n      position to provide correct facts on any aspect related to\n      the conduct of its own business, the vagueness of the term\n      by itself is not sufficient to strike down the entire Rule as\n      ultra vires.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_314\">      The words &#x27;Fake&#x27;, &#x27;False&#x27;, or &#x27;Misleading&#x27; are to be\n      understood in the ordinary sense of their meaning. The\n      qualification to the said words is that the content must be\n      known to be false, fake, or misleading and yet shared with\n      malicious intent to attract the applicability of the Rule.\n      Thus, the impugned Rule does not suffer from the vice of\n      vagueness and cannot be struck down on that ground.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_315\">vi)   The impugned Rule meets the test of proportionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_316\">      Right of citizens to participate in the representative and\n      participative democracy of the county is meaningless\n      unless they have access to authentic information and are\n      not misled by misinformation, information which is\n      patently untrue, fake, false, or misleading, knowingly\n      communicated with malicious intent. The measures\n      adopted by the Government are consistent with the object\n      of the law and the impact of the encroachment on\n      fundamental right is not disproportionate to the benefit\n      which is likely to ensue.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">                          Page 91 of 92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_317\">                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7540743\" id=\"span_260\">31st <a href=\"/doc/7540743/\" id=\"a_326\">January 2024\n                                                          Kunal Kamra v Union of India &amp; Connected</a> matters\n                                                                   oswpl-9792-2023-J -NeelaGokhaleJ.doc</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_318\">                               62.
