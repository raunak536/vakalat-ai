The\n\nsuspicious circumstances in which he died, the role of the State Police agencies\n\nin investigating the cause of his death, the conduct of certain police officers of\n Kolkata Police both before and after his death, alleged involvement of his father-\n\nin-law Ashok Todi (respondent no.12) and his uncles-in-law Anil Saraogi\n\n(respondent no. 13) and Pradeep Todi (not a party to the petition) in connection\n\nwith his unnatural death, investigation conducted by the Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation (hereafter the CBI) being directed by this Court - all these and much\n\nmore, have exercised thoughtful consideration of this Court on the face of\n\neloquent arguments advanced by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, the\n\nState, the accused police officers and the respondent no.12 and learned Counsel\n\nfor the CBI and the respondent no.13, both on factual as well as legal points,\n\nbased on erudition and developed by great industry. The valuable assistance\n\nrendered to the Court needs to be appreciated at the outset.\n\n\n\n       It is discerned from the materials on record that Riz, a computer graphic\n\nengineer working at Arena Multi Media (a computer training centre) had a love\n\naffair with his student Priyanka Todi (hereafter Priyanka), daughter of respondent\n\nno.12, which matured in a marriage on 18.8.07 under the <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_1\">Special Marriage Act,\n\n1954</a>. Their marital relationship had the possibility of souring the relation\n\nbetween the father and the daughter and as such was not disclosed to the\n\nrespondent   no.12    immediately    thereafter.   The   couple   apprehended   that\n\nrespondent no.12 might interfere in their marital relationship and accordingly\n\nthey had jointly addressed a letter dated 30.8.07 to the Commissioner of Police,\n\nKolkata Police. The letter reads as follows:\n       &quot;Sub : Registry Marriage information.\n\n\n      We would like to inform you that we, Rizwanur Rahman s/o Late Rezaur\n      Rahman, resident of 7/B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-19 and Priyanka Todi, d/o\n      Ashok Kr. Todi, resident of CG 235, Salt Lake, Kolkata-91, got married under\n      the presence of Marriage Officer, Sipra Ghosh, on 18th August, 2007. The\n      copy of our Marriage Certificate is being enclosed for your kind perusal. This\n      marriage was performed with our own wish and not under the influence of\n      any external pressure. We are also enclosing copy of our birth certificates as\n      proof that we are both matured.\n      We are presuming that our Father in Law/Father, Mr. Ashok Kr. Todi may\n      threaten us with dire consequences or create pressure or can send antisocial\n      elements or goondas to kidnap us. In view of this we hope to get protection\n      from your end if required.&quot;\n\n\n      Letters with similar contents were also addressed to the Deputy\n\nCommissioner of Police (South Division), the Officers-in-Charge, Karaya Police\n\nStation, Entally Police Station and Bidhannagar Police Station, and others.\n\n\n\n     The Officer-in-Charge, Karaya Police Station upon receipt of the letter\n\njointly written by Riz and Priyanka dated 30.8.07 had endorsed the same to S.I.,\n\nPulak Dutta on 31.8.07. Acting on the basis of such endorsement, S.I. Pulak\n\nDutta had conducted an enquiry and his report submitted to the Officer-in-\n\nCharge, Karaya Police Station reads as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;Ref : the attached letter vide L/P(y)1226/07 dt. 31.8.07\n\n            An enquiry into the attached petition was made. During enquiry the\n      u/sd. had been to premises no.7B, Tiljala Lane, Kol-19 and contacted Mr.\n      Rizwanur Rahaman s/o lt. Rezaur Rahaman of 7B, Tiljala Lane Kol-19 and\n      Mrs. Priyanka Todi d/o Ashok Kr. Todi of CG-235, Salt Lake, Kol-91 and\n      they stated that they are both adult and married each other with their\n       mutual concent as per <a href=\"/doc/4234/\" id=\"a_2\">Special Marriage Act</a> and they have no complaine\n      against each other.\n      The u/sd. also found father of Priyanka Todi, Mr. Ashok Kr. Todi with other\n      relatives are also present inside the premises and talking with them. The\n      uncle of Rizwanur Rahaman was also present there.\n      Documents in support of their marriage was verified.\n      Since both are them are adult and made no complaine against each\n      other.\n      Hence we may keep watch.\n      This is for your kind information.&quot;\n\n\n\n     On 31.8.07 itself, Priyanka had been taken to Riz&#x27;s residence at Tiljala.\n\nRespondent no.12 was given such information whereupon he had been to the\n\nresidence of Riz to persuade Priyanka to return. The effort failed. Despite\n\nrespondent no.12 being aware of the fact that his daughter had started staying\n\nwith Riz, on the following day, Pradeep Todi (brother of respondent no.12) lodged\n\na complaint with the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detective Department),\n\nKolkata Police alleging that Riz had abducted Priyanka. The relevant part of the\n\ncomplaint reads as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;My niece Smt. Priyanka Todi daughter of Ashoke Todi having completed\n      Graduation from Ashok Hall joined a course in Arena Multimedia situated at\n      60A, J.L. Nehru Road, Kolkata 20.\n      On 31st August, 2007, she left her home as usual for her course at Arena\n      Multimedia and did not return home. Then we searched for her at our\n      relative&#x27;s house and other probable places, but did not find her.\n      Then we had been to her training center at 60A, J.L. Nehru Road and found\n      Rizewanoor Rahman - the teacher of the said institution absent. Meanwhile\n      on enquiry we came to know that the said teacher namely Rizewanoor\n      Rahman took her to his residence at 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-19 by deceitful\n      means with intent to marry her and detained her. We immediately reached\n      the residence of Rizewanoor Rahman at 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-19 and\n      found him there. Being asked Rizewanoor Rahman confirmed that Priyanka\n      Todi is within in his residence and he is going o marry her. But inspite of our\n       best efforts we failed to see Priyanka there which created a suspicion in our\n      mind that my niece may have been shifted to somewhere else.\n      Being scared and thinking safety and security of my niece and adverse\n      publicity we came back home. We searched in our house for any notes\n      written by my niece, if any, but in vain.&quot;\n\n\n      The complaint was marked to Sukanti Chakraborty, the respondent no.8\n\napparently by the Deputy Commissioner of Police on 1.9.07 itself, who in turn\n\nmarked it to Krishnendu Das, the respondent no.9. On 3.9.07, the respondent\n\nno.9 submitted the following report:\n\n\n\n      &quot;As ordered, a preliminary enquiry into the enclosed letter of complaint has\n      been done. Rizwanur Rahaman s/o Lt. Rezaur Rahaman of 7B, Tiljala Lane,\n      Kolkata-19 and Priyanka Todi d/o Ashok Todi of CG-235, Salt Lake City,\n      Kolkata-91 stated that they got married on 18/08/2007 as per <a href=\"/doc/1380380/\" id=\"a_3\">section 13</a> of\n      Special Marriage Act before the Marriage Officer Sipra Ghosh of 26,\n      Rameswar Shaw Road, Kolkata-14. It also appeared that both of them are\n      adults. However a Xerox copy of the concerned marriage certificate has been\n      produced by Rizwanur Rahaman, which appears to be genuine. As such, she\n      is staying with him at his place at 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-19.\n      This is for favour of your kind information.&quot;\n\n\n      Pradeep Todi followed up his complaint dated 1.9.07 with another\n\ncomplaint dated 8.9.07, also addressed to the Deputy Commissioner of Police,\n\nDetective Department. This complaint was also marked to the respondent no.9\n\nthrough the respondent no.8. The complaint reads as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;In continuation to my previous complaint of abduction dated 01/09/07,\n      further this is to inform you that after meeting with Priyanka on 04/09/07\n      Ashoke Todi, father of Priyanka tried to communicate with her several times\n      but denied free access to her daughter.\n      Ashok Todi who is having a background of heart disease fell ill as he could\n      not tolerate such mental pressure. As such he was admitted in Apollo\n      Hospital yesterday (07/09/07). Yesterday her aunt went to Rizwanur&#x27;s\n       residence at 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata and informed Priyanka to visit her\n      father who was admitted in Apollo Hospital being seriously ill. She agreed\n      but subsequently she told that she would not go with her aunt but with\n      others. Unfortunately she did not visit her father on 07/09/07. As such I\n      think that she has been detained under pressure of Rizwanur Rahman who\n      is not allowing her to visit her father with some ulterior motive. I suspect that\n      there is some foul play behind her confinement which might be under threat\n      or coercion by Rizwanur and his family members.&quot;\n\n\n      In the meantime, while referring to the letter dated 30.8.07 addressed,\n\ninter alia, to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Division) and the Officer-\n\nin-Charge, Karaya Police Station, Riz and Priyanka jointly addressed a letter\n\ndated 3.9.07 to them claiming protection in view of certain overt acts of\n\nrespondent no.12. The letter is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n      &quot;Sub : General Diary\n\n              Kindly refer to our earlier letter dated 30.08.07 regarding information\n      of our marriage which was done on 18.08.07. The copy of our marriage\n      certificate was also enclosed for your kind perusal. We are presuming that\n      our father-in-law/father may engage some anti-socials/criminals to kidnap\n      us or may try to forcefully abduct us. Some antisocials are coming to our\n      place and threatening us of dire consequences if we continue to stay together\n      at our place, i.e. 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-19. They are trying to threaten and\n      bribe our people so that somehow the girl is sent back to her parents. Please\n      be informed that if anything happens to us the person who will be\n      responsible is Mr. Ashok Kumar Todi. We are also requesting you to provide\n      us protection and should also see that no such incident should take place.\n      This is for your information and record. Your prompt action will be highly\n      appreciated by us.&quot;\n\n\n      The Officer-in-Charge, Karaya Police Station marked it to S.I. Pulak Dutta,\n\nonce again. He then submitted a report dated 5.9.07 to the following effect:\n       &quot;As ordered by you the u/sd. maintained watch in the vicinity of 7B Tiljala\n      Lane, Kol - 19. The Police person who are perform duty at &#x27;kiosk&#x27; was\n      informed to maintain watch on time to time in and around of 7B Tiljala Lane,\n      Kol - 19, they were briefed. Nothing untoward took place till date. Contacted\n      the relatives of Rizwanur Rahaman they stated that the situation is peaceful\n      and normal.\n      This is for your information.&quot;\n\n\n      While these facts surface from the records produced before this Court, it is\n\nalleged by the petitioners in paragraph 10 of the petition that Riz and Priyanka\n\nwere called upon by the then Deputy Commissioner of Police (Headquarters)\n\nGyanwant Singh, the respondent no. 7 to attend at Lalbazar on 4.9.07, where in\n\nthe presence of respondent no.12 and his wife, the petitioner no.2 and uncles of\n\nRiz, he created pressure on Priyanka to return to her parents but she did not\n\nsuccumb to such pressure. Respondent no.7 then directed Riz, Priyanka,\n\nrespondent no. 12, the petitioner no. 2 and his uncles to the respondent no.8\n\nwho again held out threats. Certain stamp papers containing statements were\n\nplaced before Riz by the respondent no.12 in the presence of respondent no.8\n\nand other officers of the Anti-Rowdy section for his signature. Neither Riz nor the\n\npetitioner no.2 and his uncles were allowed to peruse the contents of the stamp\n\npapers. However, Riz and Priyanka having protested, they failed to obtain Riz&#x27;s\n\nsignature thereon.\n\n\n\n      It is further alleged in paragraph 12 of the petition that on 8.9.07, the\n\nrespondent no.9 arrived at the petitioners&#x27; residence to convey that Riz and\n\nPriyanka were required to attend Lalbazar to meet the Deputy Commissioner of\n\nPolice, Detective Department and they should accompany him. Around 3.30 P.M.,\n Riz and Priyanka met Ajoy Kumar, the respondent no.5 at Lalbazar. The\n\npetitioner no.2 and his uncles also accompanied them and were present to find\n\nthe respondent no.5 become furious the moment Riz and Priyanka entered his\n\nchamber. While shouting, he threatened that if Priyanka did not return to her\n\nparents&#x27; house, Riz would be arrested and she sent back home. Riz having\n\nprotested, the respondent no.5 became more furious and gave Riz two options.\n\nWhile one option was that Priyanka must return to her parents for seven days\n\notherwise Riz would be arrested on charges of abduction and stealing of\n\nvaluables, the other option given to Riz was to approach the Court of law. Riz\n\naccepted the first option having become nervous being constantly pressurized by\n\nthe respondents 5, 8 and 9. Riz was then directed to the Anti-Rowdy section\n\nalongwith the respondents 8 and 9 and when he alongwith the petitioner no.2\n\nreached there, they found Anil Saraogi, the respondent no.13 (uncle of Priyanka)\n\npresent. The respondent no.13 wrote on a plain white paper that Priyanka was\n\nbeing taken by him to her parents for seven days. Contents thereof, signed by\n\nRiz, Priyanka and the respondent no.13, read as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;I Anil Saraogi uncle of Priyanka Todi aged about 23 years daughter of\n      Ashok Todi of CG 335, Salt lake City, Kolkata - 91 do hereby take charge of\n      my niece Priyanka todi since her father has been admitted in Apollo\n      Hospital, Bypass and his condition is precarious. I shall again produce her\n      after 7 days at 7/B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata - 19. During her stay in her house\n      her sustenance, safety and security will be looked into properly.\n\n      Thanking you,                      I agree (illegible) for 7 days\n      Yours faithfully,                   from today at my parent&#x27;s\n      Sd/-Anil Saraogi                    place.\n      8/1 Alipore,                       Sd/- Priyanka Todi 8/9/07\n      Kolkata -27.                        Received copy and I have no\n       8/9/07.                              objection.\n                                          Sd/- Rizwanur Rahman\n                                                 Illegible&quot;\n\n\n\n      Priyanka did not return. Requests of Riz to let her return fell on deaf years.\n\nA dead body was found on 21.9.07 on the rail tracks between Sealdah and\n\nBidhannagar stations, under Sealdah Division of Eastern Railway, believed to be\n\nthat of Riz.\n\n\n\n      A written complaint dated 21.9.07 was lodged by the petitioner no.2 before\n\nKaraya Police Station on 22.9.07 alleging that he suspected the hands of\n\nrespondent no.12 behind the death of his brother&#x27;s unnatural death. The\n\ncomplaint lodged by him reads as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;Re : unnatural death of Rizwanur Rahman of 7B, Tiljala Lane, Kolkata-17.\n\n               My younger brother Rizwanur Rahman has an unnatural death and\n               his body was found near Dum Dum Station by G.R.P.\n               My said brother was married with Priyanka Todi, daughter of Ashok\n               Todi of CG-235, Salt Lake City, Kolkata-91.\n               That several times said Ashoke Todi threatened my brother with dire\n               consequence.\n               That we suspect the hands of said Ashoke Kr. Todi behind the death\n               of my brother.&quot;\n\n\n      Riz&#x27;s death hurt the sentiments of the public at large and led to disruptions\n\nin public life. This prompted the then Commissioner of Kolkata Police Prasun\n\nMukherjee, respondent no.3 to hold a press conference. According to the\n\npetitioners (based on newspaper reports), he declared, inter alia, that Riz had\n committed suicide and this was transparent, although report on post mortem\n\nwas yet to be received.\n\n\n\n      Enquiry into the unnatural death of Riz was initially conducted by the\n\nDum Dum G.R.P.S. within whose jurisdiction his dead body was found.\n\nThereafter such      enquiry was handed      over to the Criminal Intelligence\n\nDepartment (hereafter the CID) by the State Government The police officers\n\narrayed as respondents 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 herein, however, were transferred soon\n\nafter the death of Riz.\n\n\n\n      Alleging that Riz was killed on 21.9.07 by anti-social elements hired by\n\nrespondent no.12, in concert with the concerned police officers being the\n\nrespondents 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 and apprehending that fair and proper investigation\n\ninto the unnatural death of Riz cannot be conducted in view of involvement of\n\npolice officers of Kolkata Police holding high ranks, the petitioners&#x27; invoked the\n\nwrit jurisdiction of this Court by preferring the instant petition praying for, inter\n\nalia, the following relief:\n\n\n\n      &quot;(a) A Writ in the nature of Mandamus directing that the investigation in\n      connection with the unnatural death of Rizwanur Rahman of 7B, Tiljala\n      Lane, P.S.

Parties were duly heard. By an interim\n\norder dated 16.10.07, it was held as follows:\n\n\n\n      &quot;***\n      At the preliminary stage two issues fall for consideration. Whether the\n      petitioners- the mother and the brother have Constitutional and legal right\n      the petitioners have made out a case for an interim order as prayed for. In\n      my view, prima facie, the deceased and his wife on 31st August, 2007 had\n      drawn the attention of the various police stations apprehending threats with\n      dire consequences. On 21st September, he was found dead under unnatural\n      circumstances. The deceased can no longer seek redressal for any personal\n       injury caused to him. In such circumstances, it is only his near relations who\n      can make a prayer by filing a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n      In this case the mother and the brother of the deceased have filed the\n      petition praying for an investigation by the CBI. The death of a son in the\n      prime of his youth has caused a void and a wound to the mother which time\n      can never heal. It is a shock and a loss grievous an irreparable of\n      unimaginable magnitude. The death has permanently deprived her of a right\n      to happy life with her son, since deceased, which is an inalienable part\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The shock bereavement and\n      grievance of the brother is also to be noted. Therefore, the petitioners have a\n      Constitutional right to move the instant petition and the petition is thus\n      maintainable. Let affidavit-in-opposition to the writ petition as well as to the\n      supplementary affidavit be filed by 30th November, 2007. Reply, if any, by\n      10th December, 2007. Thereafter, parties are at liberty to mention for hearing\n      upon notice. So far as the prayer for interim relief in the writ petition is\n      concerned, following facts need to be looked into. That on 18th August, 2007\n      the deceased and his wife drew the attention of the police stations that\n      respondent No.12 could threaten them with dire consequences. Prima facie it\n      appears despite the intimations the police gave the deceased no protection.\n      Instead the deceased and the petitioner No.2 were summoned to the\n      Lalbazar. Subsequently, the deceased on 21st September, 2007 was found\n      dead under unnatural circumstances and, thereafter, it appears the\n      Commissioner of Police, Kolkata had made some comments on the cause and\n      nature of death and that such comments, prima facie, have every likelihood\n      of prejudicing any enquiry into the cause of death. During argument it was\n      submitted on behalf of the State that the CID is conducting an inquiry.\n      Persons have been summoned. It appears from the summons dated 10th\n      October, 2007 that an investigation is being done in terms of section 175 of\n      the Code. Section 175 should be read in conjunction with section 174.\n      Enquiry under section 174 is permissible till inquest. Therefore, in my prima\n      facie view, the investigation carried out by the CID is not in accordance with\n      the provisions of the Code. Hence, considering the facts and circumstances of\n      the case, I am of the opinion, prima facie, a case has been made out for\n      passing an interim order. Therefore, let there be an interim order directing\n      the CBI to investigate into the cause of unnatural death of Rizwanur and the\n      CBI shall file a report in a sealed cover before this Court within two months\n      from the date of service of authenticated copy of this order.\n             ***&quot;.\n\n\n      The order was not appealed against. The CBI proceeded to register a case\n\nof   murder   [RC.   8(S)/2007-SCU.I/CBI/SCR.I/New         Delhi]   and,   thereafter,\n\ncommenced investigation.\n       Though the respondents had prayed for opportunity to file counter\n\naffidavits to the writ petition and such prayer had been granted, counter\n\naffidavits were not filed. Prayer for extension of time was made and granted. Even\n\nthen, the respondents chose not to file their counter affidavits.\n\n\n\n      In the meanwhile CBI concluded its investigation. Report of investigation\n\nwas filed before this Court in terms of direction passed by it earlier.\n\n\n\n      Concluding portion of the report was read out in open Court. It reads as\n\nunder:\n\n\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n      &quot; In view of the facts and circumstances narrated above, the CBI has\ndecided to take the following action :\n\n\n      a)        Prosecution of Ashok Todi, Pradip Todi, Anil Saraogi, S.M.\n                Mohiuddin @ Pappu, Ajoy Kumar, the then DC/DD, Sukanti\n                Chakraborty, the then AC/ARS and SI Krishnendu Das u/s 120-B\n                r/w 306/506 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>.

Such prayer was opposed by\n\nlearned Counsel for the CBI. The same was turned down by an order dated\n\n28.2.2008. Liberty was again given to them to file counter affidavits. However, it\n\nwas observed that the issue of furnishing copy of report would remain open and\n\nwould be considered again when the writ petition is heard finally.\n\n\n\n      The State, and the respondents 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 filed separate sets\n\nof counter affidavits and the petition was then taken up for final consideration.\n\n\n\n      Owing to the fact that the CBI had filed its report and had prayed therein\n\nfor leave of Court to file charge sheet before the competent court having\n\njurisdiction, learned Counsel for the respondents barring the CBI were called\n\nupon to address the Court making a departure from the usual rule of allowing\n\nthe petitioners to address the Court first. Mr. Pal, learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nrespondents 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9, however, was heard in two phases, once before and\n\nonce after the petitioners were heard.\n       Mr. Balai Chandra Ray, learned Advocate General representing the State\n\nand the other official respondents contended that there is no merit in the writ\n\npetition and as such the same merits dismissal. Arguments advanced by him on\n\nvarious points are noted below:\n\n\n\nOn the conduct of the CBI\n\n      (i) Vide order dated 16.10.07, this Court had directed the CBI to investigate\n\nthe cause of unnatural death of Riz. By the very nature of the order passed, it\n\nwas a fact finding enquiry which was directed to be conducted. However, the CBI\n\nby registering First Information Report (hereafter FIR) under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code (hereafter the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a>) had acted ultra vires the order of the Court\n\nin the sense that it had acted in excess of authority conferred. Having exercised\n\npowers which were not conferred on it, the report, being the consequence of such\n\ninvestigation, is ultra vires and a nullity in the eye of law. For the proposition\n\nthat any act done in good faith but contrary to provisions of law is ultra vires,\n\nreliance was placed on the decisions reported in 1905 Law Reports 426 : Mayor,\n\n&amp;c., of Westminister vs. London and North Western Railway Company, AIR 1967\n\nSCC 295 : Barium Chemicals Ltd. Vs. Company Law Board, (1989) 4 SCC 187 :\n\nSupreme Court Employees&#x27; Welfare Assn vs. Union of India, (2003) 2 SCC 111 :\n\nBhavnagar University vs. Palitana Sugar Mill (P) Ltd., (1990) 3 SCC 223 : Shri\n\nSitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. Vs. Union of India, (2002) 1 SCC 633 : Commissioner of\n Income Tax vs. Anjum M.H. Ghaswala, 1875 Law Reports 653 : Directors, &amp; C.,\n\nThe Ashbury Railway Carriage &amp; Iron Company Limited vs. Hector Riche.\n\n      (ii) The order of Court is also law. What is applicable in respect of statutes is\n\nalso applicable for orders of Court. Case of murder that was registered by the CBI\n\nis in disobedience of the order of the Court. The Court&#x27;s order being the source of\n\npower to investigate the cause of unnatural death, the CBI ought not to have\n\ntransgressed into a province not authorized by the order. It should have\n\nconducted investigation in the manner directed by the Court, or not at all. The\n\nCBI ought to have directed investigation to find out the cause of death. If it\n\ntranspired to be a case of unabetted suicide or accident, the same should have\n\nbeen reflected in its report; on the contrary, if it transpired to be a case of\n\nhomicide only then could the CBI have launched into further investigation upon\n\nobtaining orders from Court. It had no independent authority to act except within\n\nthe parameters of the order of this Court. Power having been exercised by the\n\nCBI in a manner contrary to the directions of Court, the entire investigation\n\nstands vitiated. For the proposition that if an act in terms of the statute is\n\nrequired to be performed in a particular manner, it has to be done in that\n\nmanner alone and that all other modes are strictly forbidden, the decisions\n\nreported in     AIR 1975 SC 915 : Ramchandra Keshav Adke vs. Govind Joti\n\nChavare and AIR 1936 PC 253(2) : Nazir Ahmed vs. The King Emperor were relied\n\non.\n\n      (iii) There has been colourable exercise of power by the CBI. Under the\n\npretext of the order which was the source of its power, the CBI camouflaged the\n real power conferred on it and exercised power without authority of law which\n\nappears on piercing the veil. To support the contention that any act in colourable\n\nexercise of power cannot sustain in law, reliance was placed on the decisions\n\nreported in (1991) 3 SCC 498: Ashok Kumar vs. Union of India, AIR 1953 SC\n\n375 : K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo vs. State of Orissa,         AIR 1959 SC 308 :\n\nGullapalli Nageswara Rao vs. A.P. State Road Transport Corpn.\n\n      (iv) The report filed by the CBI is a hybrid report. Its conclusion indicates\n\nthat it is not in conformity with the order of Court. The Court did not empower\n\nthe CBI to make recommendations in relation to drawing up major penalty\n\nproceedings against any police officer.\n\n      (v) While directing investigation into the cause of unnatural death of Riz,\n\nthe Court had not reached any conclusion that a cognizable offence had been\n\ncommitted. Information relating to death is not the same as information\n\ndisclosing murder. In such circumstances, there was no information relatable to\n\nSection 299 or 300 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> and hence no FIR could have been registered for\n\nhomicide or murder. Lodging of FIR by the CBI alleging murder is absolutely\n\nunauthorised in view of the fact that there were no materials before it at the\n\nmaterial point of time. Neither the post mortem report was before it nor did it\n\napproach the CID for making available the evidence that had been collected by it.\n\nRegistration of a case of murder by the CBI amounts to usurpation of power.\n\nWithout a formal FIR, investigation could have commenced since recording of an\n\nFIR is not a condition precedent for conducting investigation. The decision\n\nreported in AIR 1945 PC 18 : Emperor vs Khwaja Nazir Ahmad was relied on for\n the proposition that receipt and recording of an information report is not a\n\ncondition precedent to the setting in motion of a criminal investigation which is\n\nsupported by Section 157 of the Code. Reliance was also placed on the decisions\n\nreported in (1985) 1 SCC 317 : State of West Bengal vs. Sampat Lal, AIR 1992 SC\n\n604 : State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal and AIR 2008 SC 178 : Rajinder Singh\n\nKatoch vs. Chandigarh Administration in support of the contention.\n\n      (vi) FIR lodged by the CBI does not satisfy <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 154</a> of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (hereafter the Code) for, none had reported a case of murder\n\nbefore the writ petition was filed. Since commission of cognizable offence was not\n\nreported to the police at any point of time, the CBI suo motu could not have\n\nregistered an FIR in relation to commission of murder.\n\n      (vii) CBI had treated service copy of the writ petition as the basis for\n\nregistering FIR. It could not have done so. The writ petition does not disclose\n\ningredients of murder. The service copy was not signed by any of the petitioners\n\nand as such requirement of Section 154(1) of the Code had not been fulfilled. In\n\nthis connection reference was made to the meaning of the word &#x27;information&#x27; as\n\ngiven in the New Shorter English Dictionary which is &quot;knowledge or facts\n\ncommunicated about particular subject, event, etc.&quot;. Since the word &#x27;information&#x27;\n\nappearing in Section 154(1) of the Code has not been defined therein, stress was\n\nlaid on accepting the lexical meaning.\n\n      Even otherwise, information collected from copy of the writ petition could\n\nnot be the basis for registering an FIR, suo motu, because Chapter X of the CBI\n\nManual (hereafter the Manual) requires verification of information prior to\n registration of FIR and there was no verification of information by the CBI before\n\nregistration of FIR. Registration of FIR by the CBI is thus malafide.\n\n      (viii) Registration of FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> of the IPC is also bad because\n\nthe CBI having already formed the view that Riz was murdered, nothing remained\n\nto be done to comply with the order of the Court. The FIR reflects the cause of\n\ndeath and hence the direction of the investigation was to ascertain how Riz was\n\nmurdered and who murdered him. The investigation conducted by it is thus\n\nbeyond the periphery of the limits set by the Court by order dated 16.10.07 and,\n\ntherefore, is a blatant disobedience of the order of the Court.\n\n      (ix) The CBI had no implied power to register FIR and proceed to conduct\n\ninvestigation. The report is neither in accordance with the Code nor in\n\naccordance with the order of the Court. The FIR itself suffers from a number of\n\ninfirmities. Copy of information was neither sent to any police station, nor to the\n\njurisdictional Magistrate. The petition of complaint is not signed by the\n\npetitioners. Signing of FIR by the officer of CBI is without authority.\n\n\n\nOn the conduct of the petitioners\n\n      The complaint dated 21.9.07 lodged by the petitioner no.2, received by the\n\nKaraya Police Station on 22.9.07 at best amounts to criminal intimidation\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 506</a> of the IPC which is a non-cognizable offence.\n\nNeither any further complaint alleging commission of cognizable offence was\n\nlodged before the police nor was any Magistrate approached. Without availing of\n\nthe statutory remedies for redress, directly the Writ Court was approached\n seeking investigation by the CBI although the petitioners have no right in law to\n\nchoose an investigating agency.\n\n\n\n       The petitioners appear to be well-aware of the provisions of the Code which\n\nprovides specific remedies. It is not open to the petitioners who are conversant\n\nwith law not to take recourse to the statutory remedies available to them. Instead\n\nof availing the same, they have approached the Court of Writ. Efficacious\n\nalternative remedy provided by the Code was not exhausted and the writ petition\n\nis not maintainable in view of the decisions reported in (2007) 6 SCC 171 :\n\nAleque Padamsee vs. Union of India, (1996) 11 SCC 582 : All India Institute of\n\nMedical Sciences Employees&#x27;&#x27; Union(Regd.) vs. Union of India, (2006) 5 SCC 733 :\n\nHari Singh vs. State of U.P., 1991 Cr L J 2583 :   Surinder Singh Ahluwalia vs.\n\nDelhi Spl. Police Establishment, (2008) 2 SCC 409 : Sakiri Vasu vs. State of U.P.\n\n\n\nApproach of the Court in directing CBI investigation\n\n(i)    Having regard to the facts and circumstances presented before the Court\n\non 16.10.07, no order directing investigation by the CBI ought to have been made\n\nparticularly when the CID was in seisin of enquiry. If no cognizable offence is\n\nmade out, police is not bound to investigate, and for this proposition the\n\ndecisions in State of West Bengal vs. Swapan Kumar Guha : AIR 1982 SC 949\n\nand Bhajan Lal (supra) were relied on.\n\n(ii)   That apart, law and order problem being a State subject under List II of\n\nSchedule VII of the Constitution, the investigating agency of the State could not\n have been jettisoned. In terms of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_19\">Delhi Special Police Establishment Act</a>\n\n(hereafter the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_20\">DSPE Act</a>), consent of the State is a sine qua non for the CBI to\n\nconduct investigation within its territory. Ordering of CBI investigation by the\n\nCourt without the consent of the State, though not consciously, is a threat to its\n\nrepublican character and it ought to be undone at the final hearing.\n\n(iii)   At the stage the writ petition was moved, there was no scope to entrust the\n\nCBI with investigation. Prima facie view recorded by the Court is incorrect\n\nbecause police has the power to conduct preliminary enquiry. Section 174 of the\n\nCode read with Section 175 thereof gives wide powers and inquest is not\n\nterminated once the dead body is sent for post mortem. There is no provision of\n\nforeclosure in Sections 174 and 175; object thereof is to serve social performance\n\nand, therefore, has to be liberally construed. Power of investigation of unnatural\n\ndeath case subsisted until reason of death was ascertained or it was found to be\n\nunascertainable. Enquiry could not have come to an end upon sending the dead\n\nbody for post mortem. The Court&#x27;s attention was invited to Reg.299 of the Police\n\nRegulation of Bengal, 1943 (hereafter the said Regulation) to justify the action of\n\nthe State Police agency. It was submitted on the basis thereof that further\n\nenquiry during inquest is not prohibited and enquiry may continue for more than\n\na day. Therefore, no illegality was committed in the present case.\n\n\n\n        Submissions made by him in respect of other points are noted below:\n       Since a question had arisen as to whether the order dated 16.10.07 would\n\noperate as res judicata or not in respect of issues decided therein, learned\n\nAdvocate General submitted that only the point of maintainability of the writ\n\npetition had been decided by the learned Judge finally and such decision could\n\nonly be questioned in an appeal from the final decision on the writ petition, if\n\npreferred, and cannot be raised at subsequent stages of the same proceeding.\n\nAccording to him all other findings were prima facie and, therefore, had not\n\nattained finality and could be decided by this Court. Decisions cited by him in\n\nsupport of his contentions in this regard are reported in 7 Moore&#x27;s Indian Appeal\n\n282 (1857-60): Maharajah Moheshur Singh vs. The Bengal Government and AIR\n\n1960 SC 941 : Satyadhan Ghosal vs. Deorajin Debi.\n\n\n\n      On the sequence of steps taken by the State Police in respect of\n\ninvestigation of unnatural death of Riz, he submitted that initially the GRP, Dum\n\nDum caused an inquest into cause of death of an unknown person on 21.9.07,\n\nwhich later on was identified as the dead body of Riz. The complaint lodged by\n\nthe petitioner no.2 with Karaya Police Station of even date had been transmitted\n\nto the G.R.P.S. which had already started an unnatural death case. Having\n\nregard to the public interest which was generated consequent to death of Riz and\n\nthe media publicity over the issue, the State Government had considered it\n\nproper to hand over investigation to the CID. The CID started investigation from\n\nthe stage the GRP, Dum Dum reached. The only provision available to the CID to\n\ncompel attendance of witnesses was Section 175 of the Code and as such notices\n thereunder were issued whenever necessary. The CID had collected considerable\n\nmaterial and was on the verge of completing the investigation when this Court by\n\norder dated 16.10.07 ordered investigation by the CBI.\n\n\n\n      Regarding fate of the report of the CBI, he contended that the report of the\n\nCBI is a nullity and is practically useless. Tested with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 6</a> of\n\nthe DSPE Act, it is made in violation thereof. Even the CBI disregarded\n\nregulations 9.3 and 10.1 of Chapters 9 and10 of the Manual respectively. Since\n\nparties were not furnished with copies of the report, he expressed inability to\n\nmake submissions in respect of its contents but contended that in the event the\n\nState is required to take further action in terms of the report against some of the\n\ncity police officers, non-furnishing thereof would amount to principles of natural\n\njustice and reliance in this connection was placed on the decisions reported in\n\n(1993) 3 SCC 259 : D. K. Yadav vs. J.M.A. Industries Ltd., (1993) 4 SCC 10 :\n\nRatan Lal Sharma vs. Managing Committee, Dr. Hari Ram (Co-Education) Higher\n\nSecondary School and AIR 1970 SC 150 : A.K.Kraipak vs. Union of India. It was\n\nalso urged with utmost respect that apart from anything else, parties are entitled\n\nto have copy of the report on the principle that it might create an influence on the\n\nmind of the Court unknowingly.\n\n\n\n      In conclusion, it was submitted that the writ petition be dismissed.\n       Mr. Pradip Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.12\n\ncommenced his argument by submitting that his client had become the victim of\n\nthe writ petition, finding himself in an unenviable position. Till date, he has not\n\nbeen found guilty of any offence though as a result of publicity by the media over\n\nthe death of Riz, his right to life protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution has\n\nbeen thoroughly abrogated. The ordeal faced by respondent no.12 due to media\n\npublicity whereby he has already been found guilty though proof thereof by\n\nevidence is not yet established has had serious repercussions since the image\n\nand prestige of the respondent no.12 has been lowered in the eyes of everyone.\n\nWithout any finding of guilt recorded against him by a competent court and\n\ndespite being entitled to all safeguards provided in the Constitution as well as in\n\nthe other laws, the report of the CBI indicting the respondent no.12 has violated\n\nhis basic human rights. Relying on the decision reported in (2002) 5 SCC 521 :\n\nSecretary, Minor Irrigation and Rural Engineering Services, U.P. &amp; Ors. Vs.\n\nSahngoo Ram Arya, it was contended that for a direction to the CBI for\n\nconducting enquiry, the High Court must reach a conclusion on the basis of\n\npleadings and material on record that a prima facie case has been made out and\n\nthe right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution includes the right of a person\n\nto live without being hounded by the police or CBI to find out whether he has\n\ncommitted any offence or is living as a law abiding citizen.\n\n\n\n      According to him, situations for entrusting investigation with the CBI are\n\nwhen the Court directs it to act as its instrumentality and when directed by the\n Apex Court in exercise of power conferred by <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution. For\n\nentrusting the CBI with an investigation, there has to be overriding reason as\n\njustification for making a departure from the ordinary laws. A person who is\n\notherwise not guilty of blameworthy conduct must not be made vulnerable to\n\ninvestigation. He submitted that the writ petition does not make out any case for\n\ninvestigation by an extra-ordinary body such as the CBI, bypassing the ordinary\n\ninvestigating agency, since information given by the petitioner no.2 by letter\n\ndated 21.9.07 addressed to the Officer-in-Charge, Karaya Police Station in\n\nrelation to unnatural death of Riz does not by itself disclose commission of any\n\noffence (unnatural death not being an offence within the meaning of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a>).\n\nSince the letter dated 21.9.07 did not disclose any cognizable offence, the police\n\nwas not bound to register any FIR on the basis thereof and thus there was no\n\nreason for the petitioners to claim an order from this Court that the CBI ought to\n\nbe entrusted with investigation into cause of unnatural death of Riz. In fact, the\n\nCourt itself was not sure about any cognizable offence having been committed.\n\nNo direction in that behalf thus could be issued and it is for this reason that\n\ninstead of a direction to investigate a cognizable offence, the cause of unnatural\n\ndeath of Riz was directed to be investigated.\n\n\n\n      He then submitted that the CID was well within its right to conduct\n\npreliminary enquiry for ascertaining whether information given to the police had\n\nany substance or not. Conducting of preliminary enquiry by the CID, without\n\nregistering any FIR after post-mortem had been conducted was contended not to\n be contrary to the provisions of law. That the police before recording FIR and\n\nconducting investigation on the basis thereof is empowered to collect information\n\nwas supported by placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in Rajinder\n\nSingh Katoch (supra).\n\n\n\n      Mr. Ghosh next contended that involvement of some police officers in the\n\nalleged offence was sought to be made out a ground for asking the CBI to\n\ninvestigate without specific averments that all the police officers of the State\n\npolice including the officers of the CID would be biased and thus would not be\n\nable to conduct investigation properly. If the petitioners&#x27; plea is to be accepted,\n\nthen on every occasion when an offence is committed by a police officer, a special\n\ninvestigating agency has to be called on to investigate such offence. CID being an\n\nindependent body subordinate to the Director General, West Bengal Police and\n\nhaving no connection whatsoever with the Kolkata Police, he submitted that\n\nthere was hardly any cause for apprehension that investigation being carried out\n\nby the CID would be influenced by the then Commissioner of Police, Kolkata\n\nPolice and other senior officers. In this connection he referred to the decisions\n\nreported in AIR 1960 SC 1073 : H.N.Narayan vs. State of Mysore, (2005) 5 SCC\n\n363 : People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties vs. Union of India and (1993) 3 SCC 71 :\n\nState of Maharashtra vs. Budhikota Subbarao (Dr).\n\n\n      Assuming that at the initial stage presence of the respondent no.3 as\n\nCommissioner of Police could have influenced the investigation conducted by the\n\nofficers of the CID, he contended that the likelihood of bias affecting the\n investigation to be conducted by the State police agency which prompted the\n\nCourt to pass the interim order no longer survived with the transfer of the police\n\nofficers concerned to inconsequential posts and the petitioners could obtain relief\n\nunder ordinary law in the changed circumstances.\n\n\n\n      According to him, departure from the ordinary procedure of investigation\n\nresorted to by the Court was not warranted on facts and in the circumstances.\n\nRemedy under Section 156(3) of the Code could be invoked by the petitioners.\n\nThe interim order had spent its force and in the interest of justice, injustice\n\ncaused to a party by an interim order ought to be undone. The interim order is in\n\naid of a final order and it is settled law that once the Court takes up hearing of a\n\npetition finally, it has the power, at the time of passing final order, to take a view\n\ndifferent from the one taken at the stage interim order was passed and to undo\n\nany wrong that has occasioned by the interim order, as far as it lies within its\n\npower, in the interest of justice. He asserted that it would be within the\n\ncompetence of the Court to recall the order having regard to the changed factual\n\nposition as well as the present legal position. Reliance in this connection was\n\nplaced on the decisions reported in (2003) 9 SCC 671 : National Bal Bhawan vs.\n\nUnion of India and 1984 (4) SCC 251 : Probodh Verma vs. State of U.P. in this\n\nconnection.\n\n\n      Next, he adopted the submissions of the learned Advocate General in\n\nrelation to existence of efficacious speedy alternative remedy and while relying on\n the decisions cited by him additionally relied on the decision reported in AIR\n\n1970 SC 898 : Tilokchand Motichand vs. H.B. Munshi.\n\n\n      The respondents having disputed the allegations made in the writ petition,\n\nhe   next   contended   that   disputed   questions   of   fact   have   surfaced   for\n\ndetermination and the Writ Court should be loath to adjudicate on the basis of\n\nsuch disputed questions of fact. Reference in this connection was made to the\n\ndecision reported in 2000 SCC (Cri) 1248 : Pinki Basra vs. State of Punjab &amp; ors.\n\n\n      On the extent of Court&#x27;s power to direct CBI investigation, Mr. Ghosh\n\nsubmitted that undoubtedly the Writ Court has the power to entrust the CBI with\n\nan investigation of any particular case but such direction can be given only in the\n\nrarest of rare cases where there is sufficient material to come to a prima facie\n\nconclusion that there is a need for investigation by the CBI. There being a well-\n\ndefined hierarchical administrative set up of the police in the State which is the\n\nappropriate investigating agency, direction to the CBI to investigate is likely to\n\ncreate an impression that all is not well with the statutory agency which is likely\n\nto cause a stigma. He referred to the decisions in Sahngoo Ram Arya (supra),\n\nSampat Lal (supra), and Common Cause, A Registered Society vs. Union of India\n\n&amp; ors. reported in (1999) 6 SCC 667.\n\n\n      He referred to the interim order dated 16.10.07 passed by this Court on\n\nthis petition to emphasize the point that the Court had directed investigation of\n\nthe unnatural death of Riz by the CBI and nothing more. He criticised the action\n\nof the CBI in registering FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 302</a> of the IPC and causing\n investigation of alleged murder. In this connection he echoed the submissions of\n\nthe learned Advocate General that the actions of the CBI are ultra vires and its\n\nconclusions, as indicated in the report, are a nullity. Since the CBI acted in a\n\nmanner which is at variance with the direction of the Court and overreached the\n\norder of the Court, the entire investigation stands vitiated. In this connection, he\n\nrelied on the decisions reported in AIR 1962 SC 486 : Bidi Leaves &amp; Tobacco\n\nMerchants Association vs. State of Bombay, (1985) 4 SCC 337 : Savitri vs.\n\nGovind and AIR 1955 SC 25 : Edward Mills Co. Ltd. Vs. State of Ajmer.\n\n         He proceeded to argue that the CBI could, without registration of any FIR,\n\ninvestigate the case. In support of such submission reference was made to the\n\nManual which provides for a preliminary enquiry without registering any FIR as\n\nalso the decision reported in (2007) 1 SCC 630 : Sashikant vs. CBI wherein\n\nprovisions of the Manual were noted.\n\n         It was then contended by him that the Court having directed CBI to\n\nascertain the cause of death, it should have acted as an agency entrusted to find\n\nfacts like a Special Officer appointed by the Court. The order did not inhibit\n\nconducting of enquiry but registration of FIR amounts to usurpation of power by\n\noverreaching the limits and as a result, a fact finding enquiry has been sought to\n\nbe converted into a regular police case. Reference in this regard was made to the\n\ndecision reported in AIR 1984 SC 802 : Bandhua Mukti Morcha vs. Union of\n\nIndia.\n\n         Investigation by the CBI in the present case, according to him, has violated\n\nrespondent no.12&#x27;s fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">21</a> of the\n Constitution of India. What was meant to be a fact finding enquiry for the\n\npurpose of ascertaining the cause of death of Rizwanur was converted into an\n\ninvestigation under Section 157 of the Code without following the safeguards\n\nprovided in the statute thus exposing a person like the respondent no.12 to an\n\nextra-ordinary procedure which is harsher and more onerous than ordinary\n\nprocedure mandated in law which by itself amounts to violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 14</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">21</a> of the Constitution of India. Reference was also made to the decision in\n\nA.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak reported in (1988) 2 SCC 602 for the proposition that\n\nif a discrimination is brought about by judicial perception and not by executive\n\nwhim, if it is unauthorized by law it would be in derogation of the right of the\n\nrespondent no.12 and that when injustice is brought to the notice of the Court it\n\nshould not feel shackled and decline to rectify that injustice or otherwise the\n\ninjustice noticed will remain for ever a blot on justice.\n\n      The report of the CBI, he continued, is nothing but a culmination of illegal\n\nexercise of power and hence is vitiated. The Court had directed enquiry, limited\n\nin the sense that the cause of death has to be ascertained and the CBI having\n\ncome to a finding that Riz had committed suicide, the matter ought to have been\n\nallowed to rest awaiting further orders of Court. According to him, suicide in\n\nitself is not an offence but attempt to suicide is, and for every suicide it cannot be\n\nsaid that there must be an abettor of such suicide. The CBI, according to him,\n\nhad gone out of its way to record that it is a case of suicide abetted by some of\n\nthe respondents.\n       Next, he contended that every citizen has a right to obtain copy of FIR\n\nwhich is a public document and it is settled law that the FIR itself can be\n\nchallenged. Reliance in this connection was placed on the decision reported in\n\n1982 (1) SCC 561 : State of West Bengal vs. Swapan Kumar Guha. In terms of\n\nSection 157 of the Code, the Officer-in-Charge of the Police is obliged to send the\n\nreport to the jurisdictional Magistrate without any delay so that while the\n\nMagistrate is kept informed of registration of the case, the accused has a right to\n\nobtain necessary copy of the FIR for approaching the appropriate Court of law for\n\nremedy. But in the instant case though FIR was lodged surreptitiously, the same\n\nwas not sent to the learned Magistrate having jurisdiction thereby making it\n\nimpossible for the respondent no.12 to seek a legal remedy before the appropriate\n\nCourt in terms of provisions contained in the Code. Since fact of registering a\n\ncase on the basis of the FIR lodged by CBI was kept under wraps till such time it\n\nwas disclosed by the CBI in its affidavit, respondent no.12 was precluded from\n\nlaying his hands on it. Copy of the FIR not having been sent to the jurisdictional\n\nMagistrate, it was contended that there has been non-compliance with the\n\nprovisions of the Section 157 of the Code which is fatal. Reliance in this\n\nconnection was placed on the decision in Rajeevan vs. State of Kerala reported in\n\n(2003) 3 SCC 355. The misadventure of the CBI has caused serious prejudice to\n\nthe rights of the respondent no.12 who, though is shown as an accused, is also\n\nentitled to equal protection of the law. Decisions in Bhajan Lal (supra), Roy V.D.\n\nvs. State of Kerala reported in (2000) 8 SCC 590 and AIR 1962 SC 63 : Delhi\n\nAdministration vs. Ram Singh were relied on in support of the proposition that\n the investigation carried out by the CBI was not legally competent and Court has\n\nample power to invalidate such investigation by quashing the FIR.\n\n      He reiterated his claim that the CBI having filed a report before this Court,\n\nthe respondent no.12 is entitled to a copy thereof in consonance with principles\n\nof natural justice and fair play. Disclosure of report, according to him, is not\n\nimpermissible and he urged that the parties may be allowed to deal with it.\n\nReference was made to the decision reported in (1994) 1 SCC 536 : Maniyeri\n\nMadhavan vs. Sub-inspector of Police in this regard.\n\n      It was then argued that when the statutory investigation was not allowed\n\nby the Court and investigation was directed to be conducted by an incompetent\n\nauthority, the result cannot be relied on. Other than vague allegations, there are\n\nno other tangible materials to make out a case against him the respondent no.12.\n\n      He also contended that the action of the CBI is in violation of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 20(3)</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India. The respondent no.12 was never informed that he\n\nhad been named as an accused in the FIR till such time the Court had made an\n\nobservation in this behalf in course of hearing. Having been named as an\n\naccused, the respondent no.12 was entitled to the fundamental right against self-\n\nincrimination under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 20(3).</a> In this connection, the decisions reported in\n\nAIR 1954 SC 300 : M.P.Sharma &amp; ors. Vs. Satish Chandra DM Delhi, (1978) 2\n\nSCC 424 : Nandini Sapathy vs. P.L. Dani, and (1966) 384 US 436 : Miranda vs.\n\nState of Arizona were relied on.\n\n      According to him, the CBI had served upon respondent no.12 a notice\n\nunder Section 160 of the Code calling upon him to appear as a witness without\n stating that an FIR had already been registered and that the respondent no.12\n\nwas named as an accused therein. There was thus concealment of facts by the\n\nCBI. There was also violation on the part of the CBI not to extend protection\n\navailable under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 20(3)</a> and it amounts to fraud.\n\n      Before parting, he submitted that the role of the media in the present case\n\nhas definitely interfered with administration of justice. A pure and simple suicide,\n\nas a result of media glare was presented as murder. He questioned the propriety\n\nof the actions of the media and urged this Court, relying on the decision reported\n\nin (2005) 2 SCC 686 : M.P. Lohia vs. State of West Bengal to deprecate\n\ninterference by the media in respect of matters which are subjudice.\n\n      He concluded by submitting that registering an FIR and investigation\n\npursuant thereto were unwarranted and without any authority of law and\n\nconsequently the report submitted by the CBI is illegal, unauthorised, void and\n\ncannot be acted upon in law and liable to rejection. No case for grant of relief by\n\nthe Writ Court had been made out by the petitioners and the writ petition,\n\naccordingly, is liable to be dismissed.\n\n      Mr. Joymalya Bagchi, learned Counsel represented the respondent no.13.\n\nHe adopted the arguments of the learned Advocate General and Mr. Ghosh and\n\nargued a few other points. According to him, parameters for substituting ordinary\n\ninvestigating/law enforcement agency by another agency requires an exceptional\n\ncase. Since the writ petition was moved a week after unfortunate death of Riz, the\n\ncore question which arises for determination is as to whether such an\n\nexceptional case was made out or not which called for entrusting the CBI with\n investigation of the cause of his unnatural death. He urged that the Court must\n\nexamine as to whether the prayers, interim and final, made by the petitioners\n\ncould have and presently can be allowed.\n\n      While referring to the complaint lodged by the petitioner no.2 dated\n\n21.9.07, he submitted that on that date the petitioner no.2 was not aware of the\n\ncause of death of Riz. However, the petitioners had pleaded in the petition that\n\nRiz had been killed/murdered. What warranted the change in perception of the\n\npetitioners, according to him, has not been disclosed.\n\n      If there be change of mind emanating from additional information, that\n\nought to have been communicated to the Officer-in-Charge of the police station.\n\nAs on date of presentation of the petition, communication of a cognizable offence\n\nhaving been committed was not made. The transformation in the mind of the\n\npetitioner no.2 was not made clear by stating anything in the writ petition\n\nregarding alleged murder of Riz.\n\n      There being no exceptional case for investigation by the CBI, he contended\n\nthat the order dated 16.10.07 was not warranted on facts.\n\n      Next, it was contended that law and order being a subject included in List\n\n2 of the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution, separation of powers which is a basic\n\nfeature of the Constitution was sought to be interfered with or at least suspended\n\nby reason of the order dated 16.10.07. The facts were not such that a case for\n\ninvestigation by CBI had been made out. The Court, therefore, erred in passing\n\nsuch an order.\n       Even otherwise, he contended, by the order dated 16.10.07 the CBI was\n\nnot directed to investigate any crime.      The primary duty of a citizen to\n\ncommunicate commission of a cognizable offence was not fulfilled. Therefore, the\n\ncondition precedent for exercise of power under Section 154(1) of the Code was\n\nnon-existent. Therefore, registration of an FIR by the CBI is absolutely illegal.\n\n      Next, he referred to paragraph 26 of the writ petition where the petitioners\n\nhad assigned reason as to why a CBI probe was necessary. According to him,\n\nvery wide of proposition of law had been canvassed. Fact that one police officer\n\nmay be biased cannot end in a conclusion that the entire cadre would be biased\n\nand the entire police force in the State would act in concert. The Commissioner of\n\nPolice, Kolkata Police is neither the head of organisation like CID nor any case of\n\nbrotherhood of uniform has been made out. In this connection reliance was\n\nplaced on the decision reported in AIR 1988 SC 747 : Darshan Singh vs. State of\n\nPunjab. By reason of changed circumstances, he argued, likelihood of bias is\n\nrendered remote which is an important factor to be taken into consideration.\n\nReference was made to the decision reported in AIR 1997 SC 243 : State Bank of\n\nBikaner &amp; Jaipur vs. Srinath Gupta. Since the petitioners had not pleaded that\n\nthe CID investigation is contrary to the provision of the Code, likelihood of bias\n\nstood obliterated.\n\n      On the authority of the decision in Shasikant (supra) and Rajendra Singh\n\nKatoch (supra), he urged the Court to appreciate that the action of the CID in\n\nconducting preliminary enquiry cannot be branded as contrary to law.\n       By relying on the decisions in Sampat Lal (supra), Rubabbuddin Sk.(1) vs.\n\nState of Gujarat : (2007) 4 SCC 318 and Rubabbuddin Sk.(2) vs. State of Gujarat\n\n: (2007) 4 SCC 404, it was contended that direction to CBI to enquire and/or\n\ninvestigate must be preceded by a prima facie satisfaction that the statutory\n\ninvestigative agency has not been discharging its duties properly and that if it is\n\ndifficult to come to a conclusion that investigation is not proceeding towards the\n\ncorrect direction, CBI investigation should not be ordered.\n\n      It was then contended that unless there is a specific direction by the Court\n\nto register an FIR on disclosure of cognizable offence and to conduct investigation\n\nin respect thereof, the CBI is precluded from registering an FIR on its own\n\nwithout obtaining permission from any Court. He referred to the decision of the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court reported in 2007 (4) CHN 842 : Association For\n\nProtection of Democratic Rights vs. State of West Bengal and referred to\n\nparagraph 160 thereof to contend that a specific direction was given by the\n\nDivision Bench to register and/or initiate a criminal proceeding in accordance\n\nwith law which was conspicuously absent in the order dated 16.10.07. The CBI\n\nwithin six days of the order dated 16.10.07, without having any additional\n\nmaterial, had lodged a case/FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 302</a> of the IPC. By so doing, the\n\nCBI already reached a conclusion that it is a case of murder and as the cause of\n\ndeath is already known, the whole purpose of investigation as to the cause of\n\ndeath was rendered meaningless. The CBI could not have register a case for\n\nmurder even on the date of investigation since information given to Karaya Police\n Station was one of unnatural death and not of any cognizable offence. Therefore,\n\nregistration of the FIR by the CBI is contrary to law.\n\n      He continued by submitting that there being no authorisation by the\n\nCourt, the report of the CBI following investigation conducted on the basis of\n\nsuch an FIR is unauthorised and nonest. CBI not having the statutory authority\n\nto investigate a crime in the present case, prayer for filing police report travels\n\nbeyond the authority delegated to it and cannot form the basis of any\n\nprosecution. Report of cause of death was called for in aid of the present\n\nproceeding and the order was not meant to supplant the ordinary investigative\n\nprocess.\n\n      There being absence of a case of failure to discharge statutory duty by the\n\ninvestigative machinery of the State, the likelihood of any bias in conducting\n\ninvestigation not surviving with the transfer of the concerned police officers and\n\nthe petitioners having the liberty of approaching the appropriate forum, he\n\ncontended that the terms of the interim order do not warrant continuation. In the\n\nresult, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n     Mr. Pal, learned Senior Counsel representing the respondents 3, 5, 7, 8 and\n\n9 put forth the following submissions.\n\n      On the point of maintainability of the writ petition, he submitted that the\n\nwrit petition does not disclose a cause of action, it involves hotly disputed facts,\n\nand verification of the contents of the writ petition is defective since paragraphs 2\n\nand 23 thereof and contents of paragraphs 4, 6 and 15 of the supplementary\n\naffidavit have been affirmed as true to the knowledge of the deponent which is ex\n facie bad and incurable. Reliance in this connection was placed on the decisions\n\nof the Apex Court reported in AIR 1952 SC 317 : State of Bombay vs.\n\nPurushottam Jog Naik and 1988 (Supp) SCC 655 : Savithramma vs. Cecil\n\nNoronha. Based thereon, he urged that the writ petition not being maintainable\n\ndeserves to be dismissed.\n\n      Preliminary submissions made by him are noted below:\n\n      1) Since an interim order can only be in aid of the final relief and not\n\n         beyond it, the interim order dated 16.10.07 ought to be construed as\n\n         limiting the CBI investigation as prayed for in the writ petition and not\n\n         against either Prasun Mukherjee or Gyanwant Singh.\n\n      2) Having regard to the law laid down in Common Cause (supra), the\n\n         prayer in the writ petition for investigation by CBI into the acts and\n\n         conduct of these persons and to find out whether or not they have\n\n         committed any offence cannot be granted since it is not permissible in\n\n         law.\n\n      3) No criminal case was filed by the petitioners (i.e. complaint under\n\n         Section 200 of the Code or petition under Section 156(3) of the Code)\n\n         and no complaint was lodged with the police station disclosing\n\n         commission of cognizable offence by any of the police officers. The\n\n         complaint dated 21.09.07 lodged by the petitioner no.2 does not contain\n\n         any reference to these police officers and the entire grievance is against\n\n         respondent no.12. The impleadment of the police officers is only an\n\n         afterthought. The petitioners have therefore failed to make out any case\n          of inaction of the State to conduct any investigation into any offence\n\n         that might have been committed by these police officers.\n\n\n\n      On the Court&#x27;s order dated 16.10.07, he contended that the order directing\n\nCBI to investigate is ultra vires the Constitution which makes law and order an\n\nexclusive State subject in List II of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution. CBI has\n\nno power and jurisdiction to investigate in respect of offences of murder,\n\nhomicide, aiding and abetting suicide as it has done in the instant case. Detailed\n\nsubmissions were made in this connection by referring to the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_35\">DSPE Act</a> and particularly <a href=\"/doc/289116/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/152213/\" id=\"a_37\">5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_38\">6</a> thereof.\n\n      It was further submitted by him that the conclusion arrived at by the Apex\n\nCourt in Sampat Lal (supra) is not law declared under <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 41</a> of the\n\nConstitution : conclusion therein is virtually based on the consent given by the\n\nlearned lawyer for the State. No consent having been granted by the State of West\n\nBengal under <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 6</a> of the DSPE Act for exercise of power and jurisdiction by\n\nthe CBI in the State of West Bengal in respect of offences under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n\n306</a>/<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_42\">506</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_43\">120B</a> of the IPC, the observations in the report of the CBI regarding\n\nrecommendation of charges under the aforesaid sections against the respondents\n\n5, 8 and 9 is totally beyond its jurisdiction, illegal and ultra vires the\n\nConstitution.\n\n      He adopted the submissions of Learned Advocate General to contend that\n\nthe CBI has proceeded on a misreading of the order dated 16.10.07 and\n\nconsequently its action and report are ultra vires.\n       He next contended that the interim order dated 16.10.07 cannot in any\n\nway restrict the scope of the final order. According to him reasons disclosed in\n\nthe   interim   order   are   ex   facie   erroneous.   According   to   the   scope   of\n\nenquiry/investigation under Sections 174/175 of the Code, it could have been\n\ncarried on upto the date of receipt of post-mortem report finally. It is his\n\ncontention that only after obtaining such post mortem report can the final report\n\nof a reported case of unnatural death under Section 174 of the Code be filled in\n\nand submitted to the appropriate Magistrate. It is a matter of record that the\n\nState Investigating Agency (at that time CID) could not complete its investigation\n\nunder Section 174 since prior thereto interim order dated 16.10.07 was passed\n\nby this Court. As a result, the final report of the unnatural death case could not\n\nbe submitted. Reference in this connection was made to page 7 of the affidavit\n\ndated 5.3.08 and Annexure &quot;R-2&quot; thereto filed on behalf of the State wherefrom it\n\nwould appear that the portion of the form of final report has been kept blank\n\nwhich could only be filled up after receiving the post mortem report finally. These\n\ncould not have been known to the learned Judge at the time of passing interim\n\norder since these were not placed before the Court.\n\n      Regarding the CBI&#x27;s actions after order dated 16.10.07, it was submitted\n\nthat the Court by order dated 16.10.07 while directing CBI to investigate into the\n\ncause of unnatural death of Riz did not allow the petitioners&#x27; other prayer for\n\nhanding over investigation by CBI in relation to allegations made against\n\nrespondents 5, 8 and 9. Though the first part of prayer (e) of the petition was\n\nallowed by the Court, the other part was not allowed and, therefore, should be\n deemed to have been rejected by the Court. Thus CBI acted without jurisdiction\n\nin purporting to investigate into allegations made against the police officers.\n\n      Also, the CBI had no jurisdiction to investigate in view of the bar under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 6</a> of the DSPE Act. The scope of the order of the Court was restricted to\n\ninvestigation of unnatural death of Riz in relation to U.D. Case No.183/07, to be\n\ncarried out under Section 174 of the Code for finding out the cause of unnatural\n\ndeath and nothing more. Consequently, the order dated 16.10.07 lifted the bar of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 6</a> in relation to this limited investigation, and for any offence beyond\n\ninvestigating into the cause of death, the bar of <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 6</a> would apply and hence\n\nthe CBI had no jurisdiction to cause any investigation beyond this limited scope.\n\nCBI report is without jurisdiction in so far as it extends beyond investigation of\n\nunnatural death case. All findings and observations in the CBI report against the\n\npolice officers are thus ultra vires and illegal.\n\n      The action of the CBI in straightway registering an FIR without a\n\npreliminary enquiry was also subjected to criticism by Mr. Pal. According to him\n\nthe Manual in Chapter 9 (clause 9.3) contemplates preliminary enquiry in case of\n\nan unnatural death. Without any such enquiry, the CBI took the unusual step of\n\nregistering murder case under Section 302 which is contrary to the Manual. It\n\nwas also contended that the FIR allegedly drawn up by the CBI was made over to\n\nthe Court of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta on or about\n\n17.11.07 after an unexplained delay of 30 days of its registration and that the\n\nCBI did not approach the jurisdictional Magistrate at Sealdah. Since the writ\n petitioners did not allege that the accused police officers are guilty of abetment of\n\nsuicide, the CBI by arriving at such finding proceeded beyond the writ petition.\n\n      With regard to non-disclosure of report of the CBI to the parties, it was\n\ncontended that the scope of the writ petition cannot be expanded by virtue of\n\nsuch which was not made available to the respondents represented by him as a\n\nresult whereof they had no chance to indicate their stand in relation thereto. The\n\nCBI report being a subsequent event and the respondents not having had the\n\nopportunity to consider it or deal with it and in the absence of averments in the\n\nwrit petition or in the affidavits, the Court may not reach a conclusion that\n\nfurther steps are required to be taken on the basis thereof which may contain\n\nobservations/findings against the respective respondents. In this connection,\n\nreliance was placed on the decision reported in (1998) 7 SCC 469 :              Rani\n\nLaxmibai Kshetriya Gramin Bank vs. Chand Behari Kapoor.\n\n      Next, he contended that non-disclosure of the report of the CBI is violative\n\nof principles of fairness and would render this proceeding illegal and void. Such\n\nnon-disclosure is a fatal defect in that it is contrary to basic canons of justice.\n\nOnce the adjudicator of a proceeding looks into a document, irrespective of the\n\nresult that such look might produce, a litigant simultaneously must be allowed\n\naccess to such document and failure would constitute violation of principles of\n\nnatural justice. The authorities relied on in this connection are reported in (1975)\n\n1 SCC 155 : State of Punjab vs. Bhagat Ram; (1986) 3 SCC 229 : Kashinath\n\nDikshita vs. Union of India; (1994) 5 SCC 118 : Mohd. Quaramuddin vs. State of\n\nA.P.; (1993) 1 SCC 13 : State Bank of India vs. D.C. Aggarwal; (1974) 3 SCC 459\n : S. Parthasarathi vs. State of A.P.; (1976) 1 CLJ 571 : (2006) 11 SCC 356 :\n\nInderpreet Singh Kahlon vs. State of Punjab; (2007) 1 SCC 110       : M.C. Mehta\n\n(Taj Corridor scam) vs. Union of India; (1982) 2 SCC 376 : State of U.P. vs. Mohd.\n\nSharif; and (1991) 1 SCC 588 : Union of India vs. Mohd. Ramzan Khan\n\n      He contended that no privilege was claimed in respect of the report of the\n\nCBI and not allowing the parties access thereto would be contrary to law. The\n\ndecision in S.P.Gupta vs. Union of India : AIR 1982 SC 149 (paragraphs 55-69)\n\nwas referred to in this connection.\n\n      The recommendation of the CBI in relation to initiation of disciplinary\n\nproceedings against the respondents 5,7, 8 and 9 was also severely criticized by\n\nhim by submitting that the CBI transgressed its limit. Service conditions,\n\nincluding disciplinary proceedings and penalty that can be imposed against them\n\nare governed by statutory rules subject to <a href=\"/doc/1342309/\" id=\"a_47\">Articles 310</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47623/\" id=\"a_48\">311</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Whether or not a disciplinary proceeding should be initiated\n\nagainst a particular officer is the exclusive domain of the respective disciplinary\n\nauthorities of the officers. Reliance in this connection was placed on the decision\n\nreported in AIR 1991 SC 1507 : Nagaraj Shivarao Karjagi vs. Syndicate Bank.\n\nReferring to the Manual of the CBI, it was contended that it is fallacious to refer\n\nthereto as the source of power of CBI to recommend disciplinary action, since the\n\nManual cannot enlarge the scope of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_49\">DSPE Act</a> which does not empower CBI\n\nto recommend disciplinary action. In any event, it was contended that the\n\ninvestigation conducted by police agency under the provisions of the Code can\n\nonly end in a report in final form and not in recommendation of disciplinary\n proceedings. The recommendation being totally beyond the jurisdiction of the CBI\n\nand ultra vires the Constitution, he urged the Court to set it aside.\n\n      No case, it was submitted, had been made out against Prasun Mukherjee,\n\nrespondent no.3. The petitioners had not made any prayer for investigation by\n\nthe CBI in relation to any allegation against respondent no.3. That apart, neither\n\nany declaration was prayed for against him on the basis of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution nor Rule Nisi has been prayed for against him. Therefore, the writ\n\npetition is liable to be dismissed against respondent no.3 with compensatory\n\ncosts. In this connection he referred to the decision reported in (2008) 3 SCC 183\n\n: Ganapati Madhav Sawant vs. Dattur Madhav Sawant for the proposition that\n\nscope of the writ petition has to be restricted to what has been pleaded therein\n\nand its scope cannot be expanded without amendment.\n\n      By referring to the transcript of the press conference of Prasun Mukherjee\n\nas produced by Kolkata T.V. in compliance with the Court&#x27;s order, it was\n\ncontended that respondent no.3 had never stated that it was transparent that Riz\n\nhad committed suicide, as alleged in the writ petition; on the contrary, he had\n\ncommented in such press conference that Riz seemed to have committed suicide\n\napparently. Further, the word transparent was used by the respondent no.3 in\n\nthe press conference in a different context and not in respect of the cause of\n\ndeath. No conclusive opinion as to cause of death was given by the respondent\n\nno.3 at the press conference and it stands established from the transcript\n\nproduced in Court.\n       The observations made by the learned Judge in the interim order dated\n\n16.10.07 to the effect that the Commissioner of Police had made comments\n\nwhich, prima facie, have every likelihood of prejudicing any enquiry into cause of\n\ndeath is not based on records which have now been made available to the Court.\n\nTherefore, it was submitted with respect that the Court can and should hold that\n\nthere was no ground for displacing the State machinery of investigation and to\n\nhand over investigation to the CBI.\n\n      Countering the allegation of failure on the part of the respondent no.3 to\n\nact on the letter dated 30.8.07 written by Riz and Priyanka, it was contended that\n\nthe allegation is absolutely incorrect. The said letter was addressed to the\n\nCommissioner of Police and not personally to respondent no.3. It was received by\n\nthe receiving section of police headquarters at Lalbazar but was never placed\n\nbefore the respondent no.3 as it was routed out of police headquarters at\n\nLalbazar to another police station on the point of jurisdiction. It was ultimately\n\nrouted back to Kolkata Police headquarters on 25.9.07. By that time, Riz had\n\ndied. It was further submitted that respondent no.3 having been transferred from\n\nKolkata Police immediately after death of Riz is not in a position to substantiate\n\nthe course of the said letter dated 3.8.07.\n\n      Next, it was urged that the petitioners had also failed to make out any case\n\nagainst Gyanwant Singh, respondent no.7 for CBI investigation into his conduct\n\nand, therefore, the acts and conduct of respondent no.7 could not have been\n\nmade the subject matter of CBI investigation.\n       While defending respondent no.7, Mr. Pal contended that allegations made\n\nagainst him are to be found in paragraph 10 of the writ petition in relation to the\n\nincident that purportedly took place on 4.9.07 and paragraph 6 of the\n\nsupplementary affidavit. It was denied that the respondent no.7 had called Riz\n\nand Priyanka at Police Headquarters, Lalbazar and that he had ever met Riz or\n\nany of his family members. In respect of the allegation regarding T-shirts, the\n\nstand of the respondent no.3 as expressed in paragraph 12 of his affidavit-in-\n\nopposition was adopted. According to him, no act or conduct of respondent no.7\n\ncould be construed as violative of rights of Riz protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> and,\n\ntherefore, the Court ought not to make any order affecting respondent no.7.\n\n      On behalf of respondents 5, 8 and 9 it was submitted by him that since\n\nthey have been accused of a criminal offence, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution\n\ngives them immunity from being compelled to be a witness against themselves\n\nand as such they are entitled to exercise their right to remain silent with regard\n\nto the purported events of 1.8.07, 4.8.07 and 8.9.07. Any finding by this Court\n\nvis-à-vis prayer (c) of the petition would necessarily involve adjudication of\n\ndisputed questions of fact and prejudice their right as accused persons apart\n\nfrom being in violation of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 20(3).</a> In this connection, decisions in M.P.\n\nSharma (supra), Collector of Customs vs. Cal. M. &amp; Cycle Co. : AIR 1958 Cal 682,\n\nK. Joseph Augusthi vs. M.A. Narayanan : AIR 1964 SC 1552 and Nandini\n\nSatpathi (supra) were relied on.\n\n      While referring to the written complaints made by Pradip Todi, it was\n\ncontended on behalf of the respondents 5, 8 and 9 that they clearly acted in\n discharge of their official duties. In view of these complaints, neither of their acts\n\nand conduct could be construed as violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution nor\n\nhave the writ petitioners been able to show any. According to him, there is\n\ntherefore no scope of any action of these officers being declared to be violative of\n\nany right of anyone under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. In this connection, it\n\nwas contended that the police is not barred to give advice and to ensure that\n\nthere is no confrontation. The people at large with their own private problems\n\napproach the police authorities with the expectation that the very presence of the\n\npolice would act as a deterrent in the escalation of such problems which\n\notherwise have the potentiality of leading to undesirable consequences involving\n\ncommission of offence. This, he submitted, is statutorily recognised in Section\n\n149 of the Code and 23 of the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_56\">Police Act</a>. Reference was also made to the Indian\n\nStandards of Code of Conduct for the Police - Human Rights, International\n\nChallenges, by Dr. S. Subramanian (page 262).\n\n      He also contended that after 8.9.07, even according to the writ petitioners,\n\nRiz till his death on 21.9.07 had no contact with Kolkata Police. It is further\n\nrevealed from the writ petition that Riz was in touch with Priyanka during this\n\nperiod and, therefore, any nexus or link between the death of Riz on 21.9.07 and\n\nthe alleged action of respondents 5, 8 and 9 admittedly 13 days prior to that does\n\nnot arise and thereby the requirement of offences of abetment is not met. Even in\n\nthe letter to the Karaya Police Station dated 21.09.07, the petitioner no.2 did not\n\nair any grievance against the police despite he being present in each of the\n\ninteractions between Riz and Priyanka on the one hand, and the police officers\n and respondent no.12 on the other hand. He cannot thus claim to be unaware of\n\nthe alleged actions of the police and the allegations that have been made are\n\nclearly an afterthought in order to sensationalise the matter.\n\n      He concluded by submitting that the writ petition should be dismissed in\n\nlimine with penal costs and the report of the CBI prepared without due authority\n\nof law should also be set aside.\n\n       Answering the contentions raised on behalf of the State, the city police\n\nofficers and the private respondents, Mr. Bandopadhyay, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioners advanced elaborate arguments touching factual\n\nincidents vis-à-vis legal points preceding and following the death of Riz, and on\n\nother relevant issues.\n\n      According to him, after Riz married Priyanka on 18.8.07, a joint letter was\n\nwritten by them on 30.8.07 addressed to the Commissioner of Police informing\n\nhim of their marriage which was solemnised according to their wishes and not\n\nunder the influence of any pressure and an apprehension was expressed that\n\nrespondent no.12 might threaten them with dire consequences and anti-social\n\nelements/goondas might be hired to kidnap them. They sought for protection of\n\nthe police. Letters with the same contents were also sent to other police officers\n\nin the State, namely the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Division), the\n\nSuperintendent of Police, 24 Parganas (South), Officers-in-Charge of Entally,\n\nBidhannagar and Karaya Police Stations as well as to the Chairman of the West\n\nBengal Human Rights Commission.\n       Immediately thereafter Priyanka started residing in her matrimonial home\n\nand also informed the respondent no.12 of the same. On 31.8.07, the respondent\n\nno.12 visited the residence of Riz and persuaded him and the petitioners to send\n\nPriyanka back, to which she did not accede. On the same night, two police\n\nofficers attached to Karaya Police Station viz. Jayanta Mukherjee and Pulak\n\nDutta visited the residence of Riz and created mental pressure on Priyanka and\n\nRiz to persuade her to return to her parents&#x27; house which was again turned down\n\nby her.\n\n      Instead of providing assistance and protection to Riz and Priyanka, the\n\nauthorities of Kolkata Police summoned them on 1.9.07, 4.9.07 and 8.9.07 at\n\nLalbazar. No complaint disclosing commission of cognizable offence by Riz was\n\nlodged at any police station and even if lodged, no FIR was registered. In the\n\nabsence of registering an FIR for commission of cognizable offence and in the\n\nabsence of any order from a competent Magistrate directing investigation of a\n\ncognizable offence under Section 156(3) of the Code, the authorities of Kolkata\n\nPolice had no authority whatsoever to summon Riz at Lalbazar. Referring to the\n\ndecision reported in AIR 1955 SC 196 : H.N.Rishbud vs. State of Delhi which\n\nexplains what &quot;investigation&quot; under the Code would consist of, it was contended\n\nthat examination of persons should also fall within the ambit and scope of\n\ninvestigation but in the absence of an FIR, no investigation could have been\n\nconducted and calling Riz at Lalbazar was thoroughly illegal.\n\n      Respondents 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14 and 15 did not make their versions\n\navailable while countering statements made in the writ petition up to the\n incidents of 8.9.07 and therefore the averments made by the petitioners remain\n\nuncontroverted. Similar is the position with respondents 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 who\n\nchose not to controvert the material allegations levelled against them by the\n\npetitioners. Reliance was placed on the decision reported in AIR 1993 SC 2592 :\n\nSmt. Naseem Bano vs. State of U.P. for applying the doctrine of non-traverse.\n\n      In course of strenuously urging that the police officers as well as the\n\nprivate   respondents      had     violated    Riz&#x27;s   right    protected    under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, reliance was placed on the decisions reported in\n\n(2003) 6 SCC 1 : Kapila Hingarani vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1986 SC 180 : Olga\n\nTellis vs. Bombay Municipal Corporation, AIR 1978 SC 597 : Maneka Gandhi vs.\n\nUnion of India and AIR 1963 SC 1295: Kharak Singh vs. State of U.P. Reference\n\nwas also made to the decisions of the Allahabad High Court reported in 2002 Cr.\n\nL.J. 3588 : Samsher Alam alias Sheru vs. State of U.P. and AIR 2006 ALL 60 :\n\nSmt. Pooja Arya vs. State of U.P. for the proposition that the right to life under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution guarantees the right to privacy as also the right to\n\nadult citizens of this country the freedom to marry according to their own wishes\n\nand that such sacrosanct privilege should not be allowed to be rendered non-\n\nfunctional by the police authorities in their effort to dislodge or undo inter-\n\nreligious marriages. For the proposition that if one does not break a law, the right\n\nto life and liberty would include the right not to be disturbed and the right to be\n\nleft alone is recognised to be a right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the\n\ndecision reported in (2008) 2 SCC 370 : Directorate of Revenue vs. Mohammed\n\nNisar Holia was relied on. The aforesaid decisions clearly lay down the law that in\n case of inter-religious marriage if a police officer or any other person interferes\n\nwith the marital life of a couple, the same shall amount to violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution.\n\n      Reliance was also placed on the decision reported in AIR 2006 2522 : Lata\n\nSingh vs. State of U.P. to buttress the contention that the police officers had no\n\nbusiness to interfere in the conjugal life of an adult couple and that the Apex\n\nCourt had directed initiation of criminal proceedings against those who try to\n\nbreak up inter-caste or inter-religious marriages.\n\n      In this connection reliance was also placed on the decision in Dr. Dinesh\n\nKumar &amp; Ors. Vs. Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad reported in (1990) 4\n\nSCC 627 (paragraph 8) for the proposition that directions of the Apex Court are\n\nnot intended to be brushed aside or overlooked or ignored and meticulous\n\ncompliance is the only way to respond to such directions. Reference was also\n\nmade to <a href=\"/doc/1799967/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 144</a> of the Constitution of India which ordains that all\n\nauthorities, civil and judicial, shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. The police\n\nofficers and respondent no. 12 having harassed Riz and Priyanka and having\n\ncommitted acts of violence, order on the concerned authorities to institute\n\nappropriate criminal proceedings against them in view of the directions given by\n\nthe Apex Court in Lata Singh (supra) was prayed.\n\n      The police officers have interfered in the conjugal life of Riz and Priyanka\n\nwithout valid cause and, therefore, have exposed themselves to the risk of having\n\na declaration against them that they have acted against right to life and liberty.\n\nBy summoning Riz at Lalbazar without there being a cognizable case to be\n investigated on registration of FIR, the respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9 acted ultra vires\n\nthe provisions of the Code and invaded the rights of Riz as protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Articles\n\n21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_63\">14</a> of the Constitution and, therefore, their impugned actions are\n\nunconstitutional. The decision reported in 2001 Cr.L.J. 238 : Smt. Soubhagya vs.\n\nThe Chief Secretary, State of Karnataka was relied on while urging the Court to\n\ndirect the State to take appropriate disciplinary action against the erring police\n\nofficers.\n\n       Inspection of copy of documents seized by the CBI reveal awareness of the\n\nrespondent 12 as well as the police officers that Riz and Priyanka were living\n\ntogether as husband and wife and hence there was no scope to entertain any\n\ncomplaint that Riz by deceitful means had persuaded Priyanka to stay with him\n\nor for the police officers of Kolkata Police to summon Riz and Priyanka, unless of\n\ncourse they were forced upon to create a situation to break the marriage between\n\nRiz and Priyanka under the influence of the respondents 12 and 13.\n\n       It was further contended that soon after Riz had been reported to be dead,\n\nthe petitioner no.2 had lodged a written complaint with the Karaya Police Station\n\nexpressing in unequivocal terms that hands of the respondent no. 12 was\n\nsuspected behind such death. In spite thereof, no cognizable case was started\n\nagainst respondent no.12. Enquiry was undertaken by the CID into the\n\nunnatural death of Rizwanur, as submitted by the learned Advocate General\n\nbefore the learned Judge who passed the interim order on 16.10.07, which was\n\nthoroughly illegal. In terms of Section 154 of the Code, FIR relating to a\n cognizable case was required to be registered and investigation of the same ought\n\nto have been conducted.\n\n       He submitted that inquiry according to the Code means every inquiry\n\nconducted thereunder, other than a trial by a Magistrate or Court. There was no\n\norder of the Magistrate to conduct enquiry in the case of unnatural death of Riz\n\nand question of conducting enquiry did not arise. After Riz&#x27;s expiry, post-mortem\n\nof his dead body was conducted on the following date and the corpse was\n\ninterred on that day itself. In terms of Section 174 of the Code read with Section\n\n175 thereof, there was no scope to conduct any enquiry into the unnatural death\n\nof Riz after the inquest was over. Scope of investigation under Section 174 of the\n\nCode is restricted till inquest. Section 175 has to be read in conjunction with\n\nSection 174 and thus can be invoked only during inquest of the dead body. The\n\nCID had started enquiry, according to the State, on and from 27.9.07 after the\n\ncorpse of Riz had been interred and there was thus no scope for the CID to\n\nsummon any person for investigation under Section 175. The CID had in fact\n\nconducted investigation in connection with unnatural death of Riz without\n\nregistering a cognizable case on the basis of complaint dated 21.9.07 which is per\n\nse illegal.\n\n       Regarding the scope of Section 174 of the Code, the decisions reported in\n\n(1975) 2 SCC 570 : Kodali Purnachandra Rao vs. Public Prosecutor and (1975) 4\n\nSCC 153 : Pedda Narayana vs. State of A.P. were relied on.\n\n       It was next contended that in case of commission of a cognizable offence,\n\nthe provisions contained in the Code do not confer any power on the police\n officers to hold preliminary enquiry. According to him, the submissions of learned\n\nAdvocate General and other learned Senior Counsel for the parties that CBI\n\nought to have conducted preliminary enquiry before recording an FIR under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 302</a> of the IPC has no substance at all. Decisions relied on by him for the\n\nproposition that preliminary enquiry is unheard of in the scheme of the Code are\n\nreported in 1994 Cr. L.J. 2502 : Kuldip Singh vs. State; AIR 1967 Cal 47 :\n\nMannalal Khatic vs. The State; 2003 Cr. L.J. 1710 : Shiv Parshad Pandey vs.\n\nCBI; 2002 Cr. L.J.337: P.Raghuthaman vs. State of Kerala; 2001 Cr. L.J. 2587:\n\nMahindro vs. State of Punjab; 1994 Cr. L.J.1833 : Mrs. Vidya Stokes vs. State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh; 2002 Cr. L.J. 2113 : Giridharilal Kanak vs. State; 1999 Cr.\n\nL.J. 274: Udaybhan Shuki vs. State of U.P.; and AIR 1971 SC 520 : P.Sirajuddin\n\nvs. State of Madras.\n\n     The decision in Shashikant (supra) was relied on in support of the\n\nproposition that registration of a case is sine qua non for starting an\n\ninvestigation. The decision reported in (2001) 7 SCC 536 : Hemant Dhasmana vs.\n\nCBI was heavily relied on in support of the contention that police referred to in\n\nChapter XII of the Code, for the purpose of investigation, would apply to the\n\nofficer/officers of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_65\">DSPE Act</a> and that on completion of investigation, report\n\nhas to be filed by it in the manner provided in Section 173(2) of the Code.\n\nAccording to him conducting of preliminary enquiry into an offence has been\n\nintroduced by way of judicial verdict since the same is not recognised in the\n\nCode. On the basis of the aforesaid submissions, he contended that the CBI had\n not committed any illegality by registering a case under Section 302 of the Code\n\nwithout making any preliminary enquiry.\n\n      It was submitted that sequence of events would suggest a clear tendency\n\non the part of the State&#x27;s investigating agency of not disabusing its mind that\n\ndeath of Riz was suicidal based on comments made by respondent no.3. As a\n\nresult, no cognizable case on the basis of the complaint lodged by petitioner no.2\n\nwas recorded and there was no investigation at all in respect of such complaint.\n\nIn aid of the contention that the police authorities should have disabused their\n\nmind, reliance was placed on paragraph 29 of the decision in Sampat Lal (supra)\n\nas also the decision reported in 1989 Cr.L.J. 1898 : Patel Lilabhai Ambalal vs.\n\nPatel Kanubhai Mafatlal wherein the police was directed to register the written\n\ncomplaint as FIR for offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 302</a> of the IPC and other\n\nsections and to conduct investigation.\n\n      Reliance was also placed on the decision reported in AIR 1982 SC 826 :\n\nBhagwant Singh vs. Commissioner of Police to contend that there is similarity in\n\nconducting of lackadaisical investigation by the police authorities which was\n\nadmonished by the Apex Court. Paragraph 49 of the decision in Bhajanlal (supra)\n\nwas relied on for the proposition that &quot;reasons to suspect&quot; has to be governed\n\nand dictated in the facts and circumstances of each case and at that stage the\n\nquestion of adequate proof of facts alleged in the FIR does not arise. Based\n\nthereon it was submitted that this would demolish the submission of learned\n\nSenior Counsel for the respondents that the complaint lodged by the petitioner\n\nno.2 did not disclose any offence. It was contended that the police has no\n absolute and unfettered discretion whether to prosecute an accused or not and in\n\nthis connection reliance was placed on the decision reported in (1987) 1 SCC 288\n\n: Shivananda Paswan vs. State of Bihar.\n\n      In support of the contention that the High Court has the power to direct\n\nCBI to investigate, reference was made to the decisions in Sampatlal (supra),\n\nSakiri Vasu (supra), Central Bureau of Investigation vs. State of Rajasthan :\n\n(2001) 3 SCC 333, Gudalure M.J. Cherian vs. Union of India : (1992) 1SCC 397,\n\nR. S. Sodhi vs. State of U.P. : AIR 1994 SC 38 and Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation vs. State of Gujarat : AIR 2007 SC 2522. Committee for Protection\n\nof Democratic Rights vs. State of West Bengal reported in 2001 (2) CHN 98,\n\nAssociation for Protection of Democratic Rights (supra) and State of West Bengal\n\nvs. Jawahar Singh reported in 2008 (1) CHN 559 are the Division Bench\n\ndecisions of this Court which were relied upon for the same effect. Reliance was\n\nalso placed on the decisions in 1994 Supp (1) SCC 145 : Mohammed Anis vs.\n\nUnion of India and (1996) 3 SCC 682 : State of Bihar vs. Ranchi Zila Samta Party\n\nfor the proposition that pendency of reference before Constitution Bench of the\n\nApex Court does not bring everything to a grinding halt.\n\n      On the point that existence of alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to\n\nentertain a writ petition, reliance was placed on the decisions reported in AIR\n\n1971 SC 1021 : Century Spinning &amp; Manufacturing Co. Ltd. vs. The Ulhasnagar\n\nMunicipal Council, AIR 1966 SC 142 : Sales Tax Officer, Jodhpur vs. M/s. Shiv\n\nRatan G. Mohatta, (1998) 8 SCC 1 : Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade\n\nMarks, AIR 2005 SC 3454 :         Mrs. Sanjana M. Wig vs. Hindusthan Petro\n Corporation Ltd., (2004) 3 SCC 553 : ABL International Ltd. vs. Export Credit\n\nGuarantee Corporation, 2007 AIR SCW 2010 : M/S. Popcorn Entertainment vs.\n\nCity Industrial Development Corporation, 2007 AIR SCW 6879 : BCPP Majdoor\n\nSangh vs. N.T.P.C. and (2008) 1 SLR 5 : M.P. State Agro Industries Development\n\nCorporation Ltd. vs. Jahan Khan.\n\n      He also urged the Court to lay down the law that in a particular case where\n\nState action is challenged on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article\n\n226</a> petition is not entertained on the ground of availability of an efficacious\n\nalternative remedy, that would amount to exclusion of a person&#x27;s right to seek\n\nrelief from Court which would hit the basic structure of the Constitution. In this\n\nconnection he also referred to the decision of the Apex Court reported in (1997) 3\n\nSCC 261 : L. Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India for the proposition that no law\n\ncan take away the power exercisable by the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 226.</a> If that is so,\n\nthat would hit the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\n      The decisions of the Apex Court reported in AIR 66 SC 81 : Dwarkanath vs.\n\nIncome Tax Officer, (1986) 2 SCC 679 : Comptroller &amp; Auditor General of India\n\nvs. K.S. Jagannathan, (1999) 4 SCC 526 : K. Venkatachalam vs. A. Swamickan\n\nand AIR 1989 SC 1607 : Shri Anadi Mukta Sadguru S.M.V.S.J.M.S. Trust vs. V.\n\nR. Rudani were relied on for emphasizing the High Courts power to issue\n\nMandamus under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 226</a> and based thereon it was submitted that since no\n\ninvestigation was conducted by the State police and no FIR was lodged on the\n\ncomplaint of the petitioner no.2, this Court rightly directed the CBI to investigate\n\nand this was all the more necessary since highly ranked police officers of the\n State had been accused of indulging in illegal activities and also to instill\n\nconfidence in the mind of the public.\n\n      He then contended that the State did not place complete facts before the\n\nCourt and in fact has tried to hide and/or suppress facts. Decisions reported in\n\nAIR 1973 SC 207 : Mohd. Subrati alias Mohd. Karim vs. State of West Bengal\n\nand (2008) 2 SCC 479 : Nehru Yuba Kendra Sangathan vs. Mehbub Alam Laskar\n\nwere relied on in support of the contention that it is obligatory on the part of the\n\nState to place before the Court all the relevant facts relating to the impugned\n\naction truly, clearly and with utmost fairness.\n\n      Regarding the interim order passed on 16.10.07 it was contended that the\n\ncause of death of Riz was directed to be investigated and that there was no\n\nambiguity in the order. Relying on the decision reported in (2004) 7 SCC 219 :\n\nBPL Limited vs. R. Sudhakar it was contended that to understand an interim\n\norder one has to look to the prayer made to the interim relief, facts of a given\n\ncase and the terms of such order.\n\n      It was next contended that although the Manual makes a provision for\n\npreliminary enquiry but it is not obligatory on the part of the CBI to initiate\n\npreliminary enquiry in each and every case inasmuch as the Manual cannot\n\noverride the provisions of the Code. The decision reported in AIR 2008 SC 441 :\n\nParamjit Singh @ Mithu Singh vs. State of Punjab was relied on wherein it has\n\nbeen held that investigation procedure prescribed in the Code is required to be\n\nscrupulously followed by the concerned Officer-in-Charge of a Police Station and\n\nthat the local Police rules do not in any manner override the provision of the\n Code. The selfsame decision was also relied on for the proposition that a defect of\n\nprocedural irregularity in investigation, if any, cannot vitiate and nullify the trial\n\nbased on such defective investigation.\n\n      Countering arguments of learned Senior Counsel in relation to enjoyment\n\nof immunity under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution, it was contended that the\n\nsaid provision has no application in the present case at all. According to him,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 20(3)</a> is available to an accused person either before the police officer or\n\nbefore the Criminal Court where the trial is conducted. Decisions in Nandini\n\nSatpathy (supra) and Tukaram G. Gowkar vs. R.N. Shukla reported in AIR 1968\n\nSC 1050 were referred to for the category of cases where protection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_73\">Article\n\n20(3)</a> would be available. It was also contended that if the respondents had made\n\nstatements in an affidavit countering allegations contained in the writ petition,\n\nthe same cannot be treated as evidence in a criminal case having regard to the\n\ndecision reported in AIR 1977 Del 73 : Parkash Rai vs. J.N. Dhar.\n\n      Based on the aforesaid submissions it was ultimately contended that the\n\nCourt may be pleased to declare the acts of all the police officers involved\n\nincluding respondent no.3 unconstitutional.\n\n      Referring to the document being Annexure R-2 of the counter affidavit of\n\nthe State, he contended that the incident was first reported by the guard of a\n\nlocal train that one male trespasser had been knocked down and killed (aged\n\nabout 55 years). The case proceeded on the basis on recording of such age. Later\n\non, in another affidavit affirmed on behalf of the State on 31.3.08, the age of the\n\ndeceased was recorded as 40. Since the petitioners had not been furnished copy\n of the CBI&#x27;s report it is uncertain as to whether the CBI took note of such\n\ndifference of age and whether the dead body of Riz which was handed over to the\n\nfamily of the petitioners was the body which was found on the Railway tracks or\n\nnot. Accordingly, it was urged that the CBI ought to be directed to make further\n\ninvestigation on the point.\n\n      In view thereof, he prayed that the CBI ought to be directed to proceed\n\nfurther in accordance with law including making a further investigation regarding\n\nthe discrepancy in recording of age of Riz which has surfaced from the various\n\ndocuments on record.\n\n      It was also claimed that a direction be issued for institution of criminal\n\ncase against all the erring police officers and Ashok Todi and his relatives for\n\nacting in a heinous manner to break the marital tie of Riz and Priyanka, in terms\n\nof the decision in Lata Singh (supra).\n\n      Mr. Ranjan Roy, learned Counsel representing the CBI sought to justify its\n\nactions by drawing reference to the order passed by this Court on 16.10.07.\n\nAccording to him, the Court by the said order having recorded a prima facie\n\nconclusion that the investigation being carried on by the CID under Sections\n\n174/175 of the Code was not in accordance with law and having directed the CBI\n\nto investigate the cause of death of Riz, investigation was taken up by it after\n\nregistering an FIR on the basis of the contents of the writ petition wherein the\n\npetitioners had alleged that Riz had been killed by respondent no.12 with the aid\n\nand assistance of the other respondents. In paragraph 2 of the petition the\n\npetitioners had alleged that Riz had been killed and this constituted prima facie\n material for the CBI to suspect murder. Since investigation under Section 174 of\n\nthe Code was declared not to be in accordance with law and if provision of\n\nSection 174 is taken away, the only course open to the CBI was to record FIR\n\nunder Section 154 and to proceed with the investigation. According to him,\n\nhaving regard to the totality of the circumstances including the series of\n\nincidents which were taken into account, it cannot reasonably be contended that\n\nthere were no ingredients of the offence of murder. It is not the law that\n\ninformation full and complete must be laid for registering an FIR since it need not\n\nbe encyclopaedic. On the basis of the gist of the facts stated in the petition the\n\nFIR was drawn up and registered and immediately thereafter it was transmitted\n\nto the Metropolitan Magistrate&#x27;s Court at Calcutta. The ultimate object of\n\ninvestigation being to link the offence with the offender, the investigation does\n\nnot stand vitiated by any procedural irregularity not having the effect of causing\n\nmiscarriage of justice. He continued by submitting that the Court&#x27;s intention\n\ncould not have been to entrust the CBI with a fact finding enquiry but the spirit\n\nof the order was to empower the CBI to register an FIR and conduct investigation\n\non the basis thereof.\n\n      He further contended that the direction to investigate included a direction\n\nto register an FIR and in this connection attention of the Court was invited to the\n\ndecisions reported in AIR 1997 SC 3104 : Madhu Bala vs Suresh Kumar, AIR\n\n2001 SC 571: Suresh Chand Jain vs State of M.P. and AIR 2006 705 : Mohd.\n\nYousuf vs Smt. Afaq Jahan. By relying on the said decisions, he contended that\n\nwhen a Magistrate is approached under Section 156(3) of the Code and the\n Magistrate directs the Police to conduct investigation without a formal direction\n\nfor registering an FIR, the provisions of Section 156(1) of the Code empowering\n\nthe police to investigate a cognizable case is to be invoked and, therefore, the\n\npolice is duty bound to formally register a case and then conduct investigation\n\nthereof. According to him, the ratio of the aforesaid decisions is that even if a\n\nMagistrate does not say in so many words while directing investigation under\n\nSection 156(3) of the Code that an FIR should be registered, it is the duty of the\n\nOfficer-in-Charge of the Police Station to register FIR regarding cognizable offence\n\ndisclosed by the complaint because the police officer could take further steps\n\ncontemplated in Chapter XII of the Code only thereafter.\n\n      He next advanced arguments on the effect of the investigation carried out\n\nby the CBI. For the proposition that any manner of illegality or irregularity in\n\ninvestigation does not vitiate either the enquiry or the trial following it unless it\n\ncan be established that it has resulted in flagrant miscarriage of justice, he\n\nplaced reliance on the decisions in Rishbud (supra), A.C. Sharma vs. Delhi\n\nAdmn. reported in AIR 1973 SC 913, Leela Ram vs. State of Haryana reported in\n\nAIR 1999 SC 3717, State of U.P. vs. Hari Mohan reported in AIR 2001 SC 142\n\nand Union of India vs. Prakash P. Hinduja reported in AIR 2003 SC 2612.\n\n      By relying on the decision in Bhagwant Kishore Joshi (supra), he\n\ncontended that since receipt of information of the police is not a condition\n\nprecedent for embarking on an investigation in terms of Section 157 of the Code\n\nand the police can investigate on the orders of the Court having regard to the\n word &quot;otherwise&quot; occurring in Section 157, the investigation by the CBI cannot be\n\nurged to be defective or to have the effect of vitiating the investigation.\n\n      He contended that no rights are decided on the basis of an FIR for it only\n\nsets the investigation into motion. Having regard to the allegation in the petition\n\nthat the respondent no.12 was responsible for the death of Riz there were\n\ningredients constituting an offence and, therefore, the CBI could not have started\n\ninvestigation on the premise that Riz had died a suicidal death.\n\n      He vehemently objected to the prayer of the parties to have a copy of the\n\nreport of the CBI. By referring to the decision reported in 2005 SCC Cri 415 :\n\nState of Orissa vs. Debendra Nath Padhi, he contended that the right of the\n\naccused to have document(s) for defence is only at the stage of the trial and not\n\nprior thereto. That the accused are only entitled to copy of the report under\n\nSection 173 of the Code after the same is submitted before the appropriate\n\nCriminal Court was sought to be contended by placing reliance on the decision in\n\nAnukul Chandra Pradhan vs Union of India reported in 1996 SCC (Cri) 1338.\n\n     He concluded by submitting that the report which has been filed by the CBI\n\nbefore this Court is not to be construed as one under Section 173(2) of the Code\n\nbut to assist the Court and to satisfy its conscience that a proper investigation\n\nhas been conducted on the basis of the materials collected and that if the Court\n\ndirects the CBI to conduct further investigation on any particular point, the CBI\n\nwould be duty bound to give effect to such order. He accordingly prayed for\n\nliberty to the CBI to proceed further according to law.\n       Parties were granted liberty to file written notes on arguments which have\n\nsince been filed and considered.\n\n      Having heard arguments advanced on behalf of the respective parties and\n\non scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of the case, the following issues arise\n\nfor determination by this Court:\n\n      (i)      Should the writ petition fail owing to the petitioners not taking\n\n               recourse to efficacious alternative remedy provided by the Code?\n\n      (ii)     Should the writ petition fail because it does not disclose any cause\n\n               of action, because adjudication of the issues would involve\n\n               resolving hotly disputed facts and because of defective verification\n\n               of pleadings, as contended by Mr. Pal?\n\n      (iii)    Whether &#x27;Kolkata Police&#x27;s inaction&#x27; vis-a-vis the complaint lodged\n\n               by the couple and &#x27;Kolkata Police in action&#x27; vis-a-vis complaints of\n\n               Pradeep Todi impugned herein justified? Is respondent no.3\n\n               responsible in any manner?\n\n      (iv)     Did any of the city police officers (respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9) act\n\n               ultra vires in discharge of official duties?\n\n      (v)      Whether investigation conducted by the State police agencies was\n\n               in accordance with law?\n\n      (vi)     Whether the facts and circumstances presented before the Court\n\n               called for entrusting the CBI with investigation of cause of death\n\n               of Riz?\n       (vii)    Whether the CBI acted ultra vires in registering an FIR for alleged\n\n               offence of murder and conducted investigation on the basis\n\n               thereof in a manner not authorised by law?\n\n      (viii)   Are the parties entitled to have a copy of the report of the CBI filed\n\n               in Court?\n\n      (ix)     Is   the    CBI   justified   in   expressing   views   in   relation   to\n\n               recommending to the State initiation of disciplinary proceedings\n\n               for major penalty against some of the respondents?\n\n      (x)      Whether the CBI should be allowed to proceed further on the\n\n               basis of materials collected by it in course of investigation?\n\n      (xi)     To what relief, if any, are the petitioners entitled?\n\n\n\nIssue No.1\n\n      Whether a writ petition shall be entertained or not having regard to\n\nexistence of an efficacious alternative remedy is entirely the discretion of the\n\nCourt of Writ. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution does not impose any such limitation\n\nor restraint. It is one imposed by the Court of Writ in its own wisdom and is part\n\nof its various &#x27;self-imposed restrictions&#x27;. Requiring a party to exhaust the\n\nalternative remedy prior to approaching the Court of Writ is not a rule of law but\n\na rule of convenience which does not and cannot oust the jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt. On a given set of facts a Court of Writ may refuse to entertain a writ\n\npetition in view of availability of an efficacious alternative remedy while exercising\n\ndiscretion judiciously but to hold that a writ petition owing to such fact is not\n maintainable in law, to the mind of this Court, is not the correct exposition of\n\nlaw.\n\n       The law relating to exercise of Writ powers by High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article\n\n226</a> has been authoritatively expounded by the Apex Court in L. Chandra Kumar\n\n(supra).\n\n       It is also significant to note that the Apex Court in its decision in Surya\n\nDev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai reported in AIR 2003 SC 3044 has approved the\n\nprinciple of law laid down by the Delhi High Court in Govind vs State (Govt. of\n\nNCT of Delhi) reported in (2003) 6 ILD 468 wherein the High Court ruled as\n\nfollows:\n\n       &quot;The power of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 226</a> cannot be whittled\n       down, nullified, curtailed, abrogated, diluted or even taken away by\n       judicial pronouncement or by legislative enactment or even by\n       amendment of the Constitution. The power of judicial review is an inherent\n       part of the basic structure and it cannot be abrogated without affecting the\n       basic structure of the Constitution.&quot;\n\n\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n       In the decisions of the Apex Court relied on by the learned Advocate\n\nGeneral starting from All India Institute (supra) to Sakiri Vasu (supra), no law\n\ncould be or has been laid down that a writ petition would not be maintainable in\n\nlaw if an alternative remedy provided by law, which is efficacious, is not pursued;\n\nwhat has been laid down is that in view of the remedy available to a person\n\naggrieved (by non-registration of a complaint disclosing commission of cognizable\n\noffence by the police and conducting investigation in pursuance thereof) under\n Sections 154(3), or under 156(3) or under 200 read with 190 of the Code, a writ\n\npetition ought not to be entertained.\n\n      In the present case the petitioners have claimed that investigation of cause\n\nof unnatural death of Riz be entrusted with the CBI and that actions of the\n\nrespondents 4 to 9 be declared as unconstitutional.\n\n      No Magistrate discharging duties under the Code has the power to direct\n\ninvestigation of any particular offence by the CBI. It is only the Court of Writ\n\nexercising powers under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_78\">226</a> of the Constitution or the Apex Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 142</a> thereof that can direct investigation by the CBI if the\n\ncircumstances of the case so warrant. In view thereof, the contention that the\n\npetitioners have an efficacious alternative remedy under the Code is untenable.\n\n       Also, the issue as to whether respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9 acted ultra vires\n\nor not by invading Riz&#x27;s precious right to life is one which can only be determined\n\nby the Court of Writ, and not by any magisterial adjudication.\n\n       It is true, one of the reasons for which the petitioners felt aggrieved was\n\nthat the Karaya Police Station had not registered an FIR on receipt of the\n\ncomplaint of the petitioner no.2 dated 21.9.07. However, fragmentation of causes\n\nof action for moving different Courts would have only given rise to multiplicity of\n\nproceedings. The frame of the petition is in conformity with Order II, Civil\n\nProcedure Code principles and all the issues raised therein can be dealt with by\n\nthe Writ Court.\n\n       The contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the respondents that the\n\nwrit petition is not maintainable, for, the petitioners have not approached the\n Magistrate thus cannot be accepted. Therefore, this Court finds no reason to\n\ndismiss the writ petition on the ground of availability of alternative remedy.\n\n       There is another reason why this Court is disinclined to accept the\n\ncontention raised by the learned Advocate General. The plea of non-availing of\n\nalternative remedy by the petitioners was raised by him at the time of admission\n\nhearing of the writ petition. The learned Judge while admitting the writ petition,\n\nalthough did not specifically deal with such objection did not also keep the point\n\nof maintainability of the petition open. An objection having been raised but not\n\npronounced upon must be treated as overruled and this Court thus finds no\n\nreason to dismiss the writ petition on the point of existence of efficacious\n\nalternative remedy.\n\n      To lay down a proposition of law, as urged by Mr. Bandopadhyay, that\n\nwhenever a writ petition is filed praying for enforcement of right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution the same ought to be entertained without relegating the\n\napplicant to an available alternative forum, for the same would hit the basic\n\nstructure of the Constitution, in the considered opinion of the Court would not be\n\nprudent. By a number of outstanding decisions, the Supreme Court has infused\n\nLIFE in the letters of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 21.</a> The various facets of right to life and personal\n\nliberty have been noticed by the Apex Court in paragraph 57 of the decision in\n\nKapila Hingarani (supra). It is not possible for the Court to precisely demarcate\n\nthe nature of cases where the Writ Court would be justified in its interference\n\ndespite availability of alternative remedy and the cases where not to interfere.\n\nEach case has to be decided on its merit. However, when an individual perceives\n a threat to his life and limb and seeks enforcement of his right to life, interference\n\nof the Writ Court may be more intrusive but to lay down as a matter of rule that\n\na writ petition must be entertained whenever right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a> is\n\nsought to be enforced despite availability of an alternative remedy would itself\n\nresult in impinging on exercise of judicial discretion by the Writ Court.\n\n       The issue is thus answered in favour of the petitioners.\n\n\n\nIssue No.2\n\n      It has been submitted by Mr. Bandopadhyay that the writ petition having\n\nbeen held to be maintainable by this Court by its order dated 16.10.07, the issue\n\ncannot be reopened. On reading the said order, this Court is convinced that the\n\nlearned Judge held the writ petition to be maintainable in the context of locus\n\nstandi of the petitioners to present it. Unless a cause of action had been\n\ndisclosed in the writ petition, the Court could not have decided the issue of locus\n\nstandi in vacuum.\n\n      While being in complete agreement with the learned Judge, this Court\n\nwould venture to give certain additional reasons in support of recording its\n\nsatisfaction that the objection of Mr. Pal (that the writ petition does not disclose\n\nany cause of action) has not impressed this Court. A man is born free and has\n\nthe right to stay free unless he indulges in unlawful activities which, if proved,\n\nmay result in penal consequences depriving him of such right. The Constitution\n\nguaranteed this right to Riz. By marrying Priyanka, he did not commit any crime.\n\nEvidence on record is considered sufficient to demolish the allegation leveled\n against him by Pradeep Todi. He had, therefore, the absolute right to live a life\n\nwhich is decent, complete, fulfilling and worth living. According to the petition\n\ncase, Riz was done to death at the instance of respondent no.12 and that there\n\nhas been no free, fair and impartial investigation of the cause of his death in\n\naccordance with law. The right of the petitioners to live in the company of the\n\nnewly married couple was thus rendered infructuous. The petitioners in law have\n\na right to claim that whoever the offender is, is brought to book. This is the right\n\nwhich is sought to be enforced by presenting the writ petition. The objection\n\nbeing thoroughly misconceived is overruled.\n\n      The objection that hotly disputed facts are involved which necessarily\n\ncannot be adjudicated by the Writ Court is equally unmeritorious. Merely\n\nbecause a question of fact is raised would not justify the Court not to entertain\n\nthe petition and to require the party approaching it to seek relief by taking\n\nrecourse to the ordinary remedies instead of the extra-ordinary remedy of Writs.\n\nThe Apex Court in ABL International (supra) after noticing several previous\n\ndecisions of the Apex Court held that in an appropriate case the Writ Court\n\nwould have the jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving disputed\n\nquestion of fact since there is no absolute bar to entertain a writ petition in this\n\nbehalf and that such a ground cannot be called in aid to refuse its entertainment\n\nin all cases as a matter of rule. On the authority of the said decision, the Court\n\nwould not be justified in dismissing the writ petition without looking into its\n\nmerits and ascertaining which of the facts are disputed that cannot be resolved\n\nby writ remedy. The objection, accordingly, fails.\n       Exception has been taken by Mr. Pal in relation to verification of pleadings\n\nas contained in paragraphs 2 and 23 of the petition and those contained in\n\nparagraphs 4, 6 and 15 of the supplementary affidavit. In paragraphs 2 and 23 of\n\nthe petition the petitioners have pleaded that Riz was killed by hired killers\n\nengaged by the city police officers named therein at the instance of the\n\nrespondent no.12. The only defect appears to be that contents of paragraphs 2\n\nand 23 of the petition, with like substance, have been differently verified. While\n\nparagraph 2 has been verified as true to the knowledge of the deponent,\n\nparagraph 23 has been verified as his submission. The petitioners while\n\ndisclosing cause of action had pleaded that Riz had been killed. Whether or not\n\nRiz had been killed is an issue which may fall for a decision before the competent\n\nCourt according to law. However, defect in verification of the pleadings contained\n\nin the petition, in the considered view of the Court, is not so fatal that it would\n\nwarrant dismissal of the writ petition on this ground. Contents of paragraphs 4,\n\n6 and 15 of the supplementary affidavit relate to allegations of fact which have\n\nbeen verified as true to knowledge of the deponent. No defect is found in\n\nverification of pleadings of the supplementary affidavit. The contention, therefore,\n\nstands overruled.\n\n       This issue is also answered in favour of the petitioners.\n\n\n\nIssue No.3\n\n      Mr. Bandopadhyay has contended with sufficient force that despite seeking\n\nprotection from high ranking police officers, Riz was not given any protection at\n all; on the contrary, he was treated in such a manner by the Kolkata Police as if\n\nhe had committed an offence punishable under law.\n\n      Mr. Pal sought to counter the submission by inviting the Court&#x27;s attention\n\nto the fact that the complaint of Riz and Priyanka dated 30.8.07 addressed to the\n\nCommissioner of Kolkata Police never reached the table of the respondent no.3\n\nsince it was routed out of Lalbazar on the ground of jurisdiction and by the time\n\nit reached Lalbazar again, Riz had unfortunately breathed his last.\n\n      The situation tells a very sorry tale indeed. The cry of Riz was not heard by\n\nthe Kolkata Police. Instead, its officers were busy elsewhere. A young married\n\ncouple had sought for police protection apprehending interference in their marital\n\nlife by the father of the bride. Letters were served not only on the Commissioner\n\nof Police but to other responsible police officers. Apart from the Officer-in-Charge,\n\nKaraya Police Station who deputed Jayanta Dutta, S.I. to conduct an enquiry,\n\nothers chose to look the other way. Although a report was filed by him\n\nacknowledging the fact of a valid marriage between Riz and Priyanka, respondent\n\nno.12 was not summoned by any of the police officers to elicit information\n\nregarding the apprehension expressed by them. On the contrary, despite\n\nrespondent no.12 being aware that his daughter had voluntarily started living\n\nwith Riz in his residence, false and frivolous complaints were lodged by Pradeep\n\nTodi one after the other. The alacrity and speed with which these false\n\ncomplaints were attended to raises eye-brows when juxtaposed with the\n\ncomplaint filed by the couple. Repeatedly, Riz and Priyanka were summoned to\n\nLalbazar as and when the Todis wished that they be summoned. One wonders\n whether the city police officers would be so agile and on their toes if a complaint\n\nis sought to be lodged before them by a common man without having the\n\nnecessary contacts. That the officers of Kolkata Police care little about such\n\ncomplaints is amply proved when one looks to the complaint of the couple. As is\n\nevident from Mr. Pal&#x27;s submission, the complaint was never placed before the\n\nrespondent no.3 since it was addressed to the Commissioner of Police whereas\n\ncomplaints of Pradeep Todi, addressed not to an officer in his personal name but\n\nto the Deputy Commissioner, Detective Department were attended to within a\n\nvery short time of their receipt. The system is such that one cannot but look at\n\nthe entire facts with despair. The respondent no.3 was not allowed to look into\n\ncomplaints of citizens. His subordinates took their own sweet time to enquire into\n\nthe complaint, the result of which did not see the light of the day. No one was\n\ntaken to task. The entire incidents which occurred between 31.8.07 and 8.9.07\n\nare suggestive of the inescapable conclusion that there exist two police stations,\n\nLalbazar for the influential who have easy access to its corridors, and the local\n\none supposedly for the aam aadmi. It is also not an uncommon sight nowadays\n\nthat a common man has to even knock the doors of the Writ Court with a writ\n\npetition for a direction on the police to register an FIR which the High Court, in\n\nview of the decision in Aleque Padamsee (supra) and other decisions referred to\n\ntherein, would not be justified in entertaining having regard to the alternative\n\nremedies available under the Code.\n\n      Be that as it may, Kolkata Police unnecessarily involved itself in the\n\nincident and continued such involvement for oblique reasons instead of\n distancing it once it was ascertained on enquiry that the marriage between Riz\n\nand Priyanka was legal and valid and Priyanka had expressed her desire, in no\n\nuncertain terms, to live with her husband in his house. No matter how agonised\n\nthe Todis were and apparently seeming to be justified in their reaction in asking\n\nthe police to resolve the issue, once the police officers found that Priyanka was\n\nnot missing, that she had not been detained against her wish and that she had\n\nmarried Riz legally, they had no business to interfere in the personal lives of the\n\ncouple and summon Riz repeatedly to Lalbazar. Statute does not permit them to\n\nact in such manner. The writing placed by Mr. Pal delineating duties and\n\nfunctions of the police cannot come to the rescue of the officers since apart from\n\nlacking in statutory force, the dialogue that the officers of Kolkata Police initiated\n\nto solve the issue was not bonafide. They were aware of the falsified claim of\n\nPradeep Todi, yet they ventured into unchartered territory. None of the\n\nrespondents have really been able to justify as to why Riz and Priyanka were\n\ncalled to Lalbazar. From the version of the respondent no.3 in the press\n\nconference it is clear that Riz was summoned to Lalbazar not because the police\n\nwas convinced that his presence is required but because of the Todis insistence.\n\nRiz had been hounded by the police in clear breach of his right to life under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, significantly though he had not committed any\n\noffence and was living as a law abiding citizen. This Court records its utter\n\ndispleasure in relation to functioning of the Kolkata Police force in this regard.\n\n      At this stage, one cannot but deprecate the stand of the State Government.\n\nIt failed to file counter affidavit to the writ petition within the time fixed by the\n order dated 16.10.07. It then applied for extension of time. The ground for\n\nextension of time was that incumbents in the posts of Commissioner of Police\n\n(Prasun Mukherjee), Deputy Commissioner of Police, Headquarters (Gyanwant\n\nSingh) and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Detective Department (Ajoy Kumar)\n\nhad been transferred and, therefore, no proper counter could be offered. At the\n\nsame time, prayer was made for supply of copy of the report of the CBI to enable\n\nit to file its counter. Why would the State require the report of the CBI to file a\n\ncounter to the writ petition had not been spelt out. Time to file counter affidavit\n\nwas extended without directing copy of the report of CBI to be furnished. Then\n\ncame a cryptic counter affidavit containing particulars of little use. The order of\n\nthe Court dated 28.2.08 had been misconstrued was the excuse put forward\n\ntherefor. That order did not restrict filing of counter affidavit on the point\n\nmentioned therein and the expression &#x27;inter alia&#x27; appears not to have been taken\n\nnote of by the State. This Court is unable to accept the explanation, for the\n\naffidavit proceeds to question the CBI&#x27;s actions taken in purported compliance\n\nwith the order dated 16.10.07 which the Court by its order dated 28.2.08 did not\n\nask the State to deal with. There was no dearth of wise counsel. Since the learned\n\nAdvocate General was representing the State, his advice could have been\n\nobtained for understanding the said order. However, it was not obtained. Even\n\nthereafter, two separate affidavits were filed by the State on 31.3.08 (in terms of\n\norder dated 26.3.08) and on 2.4.08. The opportunity was not availed of by the\n\nState to deal with the contents of the entire writ petition by seeking further leave\n\nof Court. Based on records, it should have laid bare the entire facts before the\n Court. The conduct of the State in not disclosing facts, clear and complete, when\n\nlife of one of its subjects had been taken away in suspicious circumstances which\n\nhave since surfaced is appalling.\n\n      Now the case made out against the respondent no.3 in the petition, his\n\nresponse and statements made by him in course of the press conference seeking\n\nto justify the police action may be noticed.\n\n      Though it has been alleged in paragraph 2 of the petition that       hired men\n\nof respondent no.3 along with others at the instance of respondent no.12 had\n\nbeen instrumental in killing Riz, this Court has noted that absolutely no relief\n\nhas been claimed against respondent no.3. However, whether any relief can\n\nlegally be or should at all be granted in view of the prayer clauses of the petition\n\nwould come up for discussion while a decision is given on the last issue, provided\n\nthe Court is satisfied on the basis of the materials on record that there is\n\nsomething against respondent no.3.\n\n      The purported negative role of the respondent no.3 is sought to be\n\namplified by the petitioners by referring to a newspaper report annexed to the\n\npetition reporting the press conference convened by him as also with reference to\n\nhis introduction to respondent no.12 by Snehasish Ganguly, the added\n\nrespondent, for solving the problem of respondent no.12 which resulted in\n\npressure and influence being created on Riz by the city police officers.\n\n      Thrust of the allegations of the petitioners against respondent no.3 is that\n\nin the press conference he had stated that Riz had committed suicide and it is\n\nvery transparent. It had also been alleged that respondent no.3 in no uncertain\n terms called the reaction of the Todi family (on finding that their daughter\n\nPriyanka who has been brought up with care for 23 years would leave them one\n\nfine morning and start a new life with an unknown youth) natural. It is the\n\nfurther allegation that when asked by a reporter as to why the Kolkata Police\n\nintervened in a case between two adults, he replied &quot;Who would intervene, the\n\nP.W.D.?&quot;\n\n        By filing an affidavit, respondent no.3 made his version available. It\n\nappears therefrom that the press interview was given by him to diffuse the\n\ntension that had built up in the area where Riz resided and that the actions\n\ntaken    by   Kolkata   Police   needed   clarification,   to   avoid   confusion   and\n\nmisconception in public mind. While he was emphatic in his statement that no\n\nconclusive opinion was given by him as to cause of death of Riz at the press\n\nconference, he asserted in paragraph 6 that his statements have been distorted\n\nand quoted out of context by the print media. He used the word &#x27;apparent&#x27; while\n\nconveying that Riz had committed suicide because he thought it could be a\n\npossibility. The veracity and correctness of the newspaper report annexed to the\n\npetition was denied. In course of submission, Mr. Pal contended that the word\n\n&#x27;transparent&#x27; had been used by him in a different context and he had been\n\nmisunderstood.\n\n        He also denied that he was introduced to respondent no.12 by the added\n\nrespondent or that he had instructed respondent no.12 to meet the respondent\n\nno.5. However, it was admitted by him that the added respondent had introduced\n\nPradeep Todi to him as a family friend in course of a brief meeting on 7.9.07 and\n he had been told about a complaint which Pradeep Todi had lodged with the\n\nDetective Department regarding Riz and Priyanka. But, he had neither instructed\n\nPradeep Todi to meet the respondent no.5 nor did he give any indication that he\n\nwould use his personal influence for the benefit of Pradeep Todi.\n\n      This Court had called for the unedited video recordings of the press\n\nconference convened by respondent no.3 together with transcripts from various\n\nTV channels including Doordarshan. While a number of channels responded with\n\nedited recordings, only Kolkata T.V. could produce a compact disc containing\n\nvideo recording of the press conference in its entirety. The compact disc together\n\nwith transcript was filed in Court alongwith an affidavit. The Court records its\n\nappreciation for the assistance rendered by Kolkata T.V.\n\n      Reliance was placed on portions of this transcript by Mr. Pal to\n\ndemonstrate that the allegations made against the respondent no.3 are\n\nabsolutely baseless.\n\n      The transcript annexed to the affidavit of Kolkata T.V. is only of the\n\nstatements made by the respondent no.3 on his own immediately on taking his\n\nseat. Transcript of the answers given by the respondent no.3 to the questions of\n\nthe reporters present thereat, however, has not been provided.\n\n      The video recording of the press conference has assisted the Court to a\n\ngreat extent to assess the role of the Kolkata Police in relation to the incidents\n\nright from 31.8.07 and to arrive at its findings.\n\n      It would, therefore, be necessary to reproduce from the transcript\n\nstatements made by the respondent no.3 in course of the press conference to\n ascertain whether the Kolkata Police was unbiased in its approach, whether the\n\nrespondent no.3 was at all posted with all relevant information or whether\n\ndespite being aware of all relevant facts he feigned ignorance, and whether there\n\nwas any attempt on his part to twist facts to suit the convenience of the force to\n\nwhich he belongs, especially because diffusing of tension was the reason for\n\nconvening the press conference. Relevant extracts read thus:\n\n            &quot; ******\n\n            In this case it has been learnt that on 18 August these people had\n            gone and registered their marriage. Which happens in several cases.\n            On 31 August they left their home. And the girl left her home.\n            However, the members of the Girls family didn&#x27;t find any clue about\n            the girl and thought that the girl went missing. In the night the girl\n            wrang (sic rang) up at her home and said that she has come to such\n            and such place, I won&#x27;t come back home. From now she will stay with\n            Rizwanur Rahman whom she had married. After hearing the tale from\n            their daughter the family members couldn&#x27;t believe her. Later on they\n            contacted with the boy and rushed to their home at Tiljala.\n\n\n            *******\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\">            In the next morning the girls relative came to Lalbazaar and lodged a\n            complaint of missing. But verbally they requested police not to make\n            the matter public as it will hamper the reputation of the family and the\n            girl. For that the police did not do anything formally. But both of them\n            were called to Lalbazaar and were asked that is the girl a major. In\n            such cases the majority of the girl is seen. Once a girl is a major, it is\n            totally upto her choice what she will do. It is very clear. Usually what\n            we do is when a girl is called missing by her relatives usually they\n            think the girl has been abducted against her will, being influenced it\n            seems to be true. Because the family which has nurtured the girl for\n            18 or 25 to 26 years fails to think that in a night time the girl would\n            become a member of another family. So they wanted to make us\n            convinced. In this case our duty is to find out the whereabouts of the\n            persons linked. Though in this case the boy and the girl were located\n            as they had an address in Kolkata. And we always try to do this, once\n            we trace the girl or the boy particularly if a girl is missing our\n            responsibility is found (sic to find) them out. Even a major girl can be\n            abducted, against her will, or blackmailing, every thing can happen\n  variedly. In that case we call both the parties and try to understand in\n what background she had left. Once it is understood then it is made\n clear to the family that your girl has not been harmed. Your girl is safe.\n She has not been taken against her will or anything and if she is a\n major then it is upto her what she would do. We cannot interfere in the\n matter. That is what happened in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\">*******\n\n Number one is in the first day the boy and the girl had same point of\n view. So they were released according to their will. According to us as\n she was a major her choice was respected. She was allowed to go\n back. She went back.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_3\"> *******\n\n On 4th September, the family members of the girl asked us to give them\n a scope to talk to the girl and the boy. Accordingly we called both of\n them and they came to us voluntarily.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">\n *******\n\n However, on 8th the girl&#x27;s family members said that they want to lodge\n a formal complaint of abduction. They said that the girl can&#x27;t stay like\n this. She has been influenced. And they lodged a complaint that that\n their daughter had been kept forcefully without her intention. In this\n background of which they were again called.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">\n*******\n\n It is very unfortunate that he had decided to commit suicide. Suicide in\n the sense that he had sent SMS to his friends which we come to know\n through several newspapers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\n*******\n\n However, in the morning at around 10.30 am it is impossible that one\n person is being killed and put to the tracks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\n*******&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      Having perused the records produced in Court, particularly the complaints\n\nlodged by Pradeep Todi, this Court cannot but observe that the respondent no.3\n\ndid not address the press with correct and complete facts. He seemed to be\n\ntotally oblivious of the facts that Riz and Priyanka had addressed a\n\nrepresentation to him seeking protection; that respondent no.12 had been to the\n\nresidence of Riz on 31.8.07 and had persuaded Priyanka to return; that on a\n\nwritten complaint lodged by Pradeep Todi on 1.9.07, an enquiry was conducted\n\non the order of the Deputy Commissioner, Detective Department by the\n\nrespondent no.9 who found the couple eligible to marry and the marriage\n\ncertificate was found to be genuine; and that on false and frivoulous complaints\n\nand without registering an FIR, Riz was being summoned to Lal Bazar. His\n\nversion of the Todis&#x27; reaction and the repeated sermons sent to Riz to be present\n\nat Lalbazar at their beck and call are clearly suggestive of a partisan attitude\n\ntaken by the Kolkata Police without even realizing that by marrying Priyanka, Riz\n\nhad neither committed any offence nor was Priyanka missing, as alleged by\n\nPradeep Todi, which was the real cause for the police being pro-active.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">      It is naïve to assume that Riz had been to Lalbazar voluntarily as suggested\n\nby the respondent no.3. Immediately after his marriage, Riz found himself in\n\ntroubled waters. As and when the Deputy Commissioners (respondents 5 and 7)\n\nrequired his presence, respondent no.9 was deputed to bring him to Lalbazar. In\n\nsuch circumstances, there is good reason to believe, as pleaded, that he wilted\n\nunder pressure and succumbed to the directives given to him by the police. To\n suggest that Riz attended at Lalbazar voluntarily was clearly aimed at shifting the\n\nfocus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">         The respondent no.3, being the Commissioner of Police at the relevant\n\ntime, also ought not to have defended the reaction of the Todis in public as well\n\nas his subordinates particularly when the police machinery was activated not on\n\nthe basis of what is true but absolutely on reckless allegations. Also, the\n\nrespondent no.3 being the police supremo having years of experience behind his\n\nback should have refrained from making any observation of the nature that at\n\n10.30 A.M. it is impossible that a person is killed and put on the tracks. It was\n\ntoo early in the day to come to any conclusion and such observations coming\n\nfrom no other than the Police Commissioner was bound to have an effect on the\n\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">         This Court is of the further view that the answer reportedly given by the\n\nrespondent no.3 to the question as to why the police intervened in a marital\n\ndispute (who would intervene, the P.W.D.?) has not been countered specifically\n\nby asserting that no such answer was given. It probably could not have been\n\ndisputed by the respondent no.3 for, it appears from the video recording, that he\n\ndid answer the question in the manner reflected in paragraph 25 of the petition\n\nand the newspaper report annexed thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">         Now, the question arises as to whether the respondent no.3, in any\n\nmanner, is responsible or not?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">         The press conference of respondent no.3 brings to the fore a veiled attempt\n\non his part to shield his force and subordinates. On the facts the respondent\n no.3 knew or ought to have known, he failed to take into account all the relevant\n\nfactors, took into account irrelevant factors and reached a conclusion which no\n\nCommissioner of Police, properly directing himself as to his duties, could have\n\nreached. Respondent no.3&#x27;s perception of police powers is also undoubtedly\n\nflawed which is amply reflected from the materials on record. Justification of the\n\nactions/inaction of Kolkata Police furnished by him has to be rejected as not\n\nvalid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">         It also appears that the respondent no.3 withheld facts. In his affidavit,\n\nwhat advice he had given to Pradeep Todi when he met him on 7.9.07 is\n\nconspicuous by its absence. The fact that Pradeep Todi had met him was not\n\ndisclosed in course of the press conference. Probably there could hardly be any\n\njustification for keeping these incidents in wraps and as such was not sought to\n\nbe justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">         The respondent no.3 in the press conference betrayed his serious concern\n\nfor the family of the Todis without even permitting a peep in his mind that after\n\nall the petitioner no.1 had lost her grown up son who had been brought up with\n\ncare by her for 30 years. There were no signs of sympathy and no words of\n\ncondolence for her. It is, however, a question of moral values and this Court\n\nwould not find fault if a public servant lacks it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">         Whether or not there was any personal involvement of the respondent no.3\n\nin the incidents of 1.9.07, 4.9.07 and 8.9.07 has got to be established in duly\n\nconstituted proceedings and this Court would be loath to return any finding on\n\nthis aspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">        For reasons discussed above, this Court is constrained to hold that the\n\nrespondent no.3 acted irresponsibly and instead of diffusing tension, he added\n\nfuel to fire.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">       The issue is answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n\nIssue No.4\n\n       Allegation against respondent no.7 is primarily contained in paragraph 10\n\nof the petition. According to the petitioners, he had summoned Riz and Priyanka\n\nat Lal Bazar on 4.9.07 and created mental pressure on both. He has generally\n\ndenied the allegations made against him in the writ petition while expressing his\n\ninability to specifically deny the same in the absence of copy of the report of the\n\nCBI wherein recommendation for initiation of disciplinary proceeding for major\n\npenalty against him has been made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">       Prayer for supply of copy of the CBI&#x27;s report made by respondent no.7 to\n\nenable him file his counter affidavit was rejected by the order dated 28.2.08 and\n\nhe was given liberty to file it by 6.3.08. By refraining to deal with the allegations\n\nspecifically for want of report of the CBI, a ground not tenable in law after the\n\norder dated 28.2.08 was passed, respondent no.7 has himself to blame for failing\n\nto traverse the allegations of summoning Riz at Lalbazar without a cognizable\n\ncase registered against him and torturing him, and the Court has no other option\n\nbut to treat the allegations as uncontroverted. That Riz was indeed called upon to\n\nattend at Lalbazar on three occasions including 4.9.07 has been admitted by the\n respondent no.3 in the press conference. Presence of Riz and Priyanka at Lal\n\nBazar on 4.9.07 is also proved from the contents of the complaint lodged by\n\nPradeep Todi, which has been extracted above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">      Having regard to the turn of events, this Court has no hesitation to record\n\nthat respondent no.7 in the absence of a cognizable case registered against Riz,\n\nhaving summoned him and created pressure on him invaded his right to privacy\n\nand thereby acted ultra vires.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      Allegations against respondents 5, 8 and 9 are traceable in various\n\nportions of the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">      Mr. Pal, learned Counsel for the respondents 5, 8 and 9 contended that\n\nthese respondents remained silent, in exercise of the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_84\">Article\n\n20(3)</a>, with regard to the purported events of 1.9.07, 4.9.07 and 8.9.07 and their\n\nsilence cannot be treated as admissions on the authority of the decision of the\n\nApex Court in Naseem Bano (supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">      Per contra, it is contended that <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 20(3)</a> has no manner of application\n\nin the present case for it is not available to one who seeks opportunity to counter\n\nallegations in the writ petition and thereafter chooses not to counter it. Whatever\n\nthe respondents would disclose in the affidavit cannot be treated as evidence in a\n\ncriminal case and hence <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 20(3)</a> cannot be invoked.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      The decisions cited by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners and the\n\nconcerned respondents on the point have been looked into. In the considered\n\nopinion of this Court, ratio of those decisions are useful for understanding the\n\nintendment of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 20(3)</a> and the Court would be guided in returning a finding\n one way or the other on the basis of the principles of law laid down therein.\n\nHowever, this Court may note that the preamble of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_88\">Evidence Act, 1872</a> has\n\nsince been amended together with the definition of &#x27;evidence&#x27; and hence the\n\ndecision in Parkash Rai (supra) would have no application.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 20</a> of the Constitution provides for protection in respect of\n\nconviction of offences. Clause (3) thereof embodies the doctrine against self-\n\nincrimination. It guarantees the right to a person not to be forced to incriminate\n\nhimself. It is intended to give protection to a person accused of offence in\n\ncriminal proceedings. In other words, it secures the freedom of a person not to be\n\ncompelled to give evidence that might amount to an admission or confession of a\n\ncrime, wherefor his person may be put under restraint by being imprisoned.\n\nThough the word freedom is not mentioned in any of the clauses of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 20</a>, by\n\nproviding that certain things shall not be done to a person his freedom is\n\nsecured.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      For invoking <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 20(3)</a> and to have protection guaranteed thereby, three\n\npre-conditions must exist, viz. (i) a person must be accused of any offence; (ii)\n\nthere must be a compulsion on him &#x27;to be a witness&#x27;; and (iii) it must be &#x27;against\n\nhimself&#x27;. If any of these is non-existent, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 20(3)</a> cannot be invoked.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">      Court&#x27;s calling upon a party to counter allegations contained in a petition\n\nby filing an affidavit, in the considered view of this Court, cannot amount to a\n\ncompulsion aimed at procurement of self-incriminatory statements by pressure\n\nor force. If a party accused of an offence chooses to make any statement, he is\n\nwelcome to do so. But by remaining silent, he cannot legitimately expect the\n Court to remain silent. The Court would be justified, in such event, to proceed on\n\nthe basis of the available materials and to return such finding on appreciation\n\nthereof as is warranted in the facts and circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"370752\" id=\"span_1\">In this connection one may take note of the decision of the Apex Court in\n\nCapt. <a href=\"/doc/370752/\" id=\"a_93\">Dushyant Somal vs. Smt. Sushma Somal</a> &amp; ors., reported in AIR 1981 SC\n\n1026. The facts therein were that the appellant and the respondent were parents\n\nof two minor children, one a daughter and the other a son; they started living\n\nseparately as a result of estrangement between them; while the son was in the\n\ncustody of the respondent pursuant to an order passed under the <a href=\"/doc/1874830/\" id=\"a_94\">Guardians and\n\nWards Act</a>, the son escorted by his grandmother was waiting at a bus stop when\n\nthe appellant accompanied by three or four persons forcibly took him away; on\n\nthe respondent&#x27;s complaint police registered a case under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 363</a> of the IPC\n\nbut the search for tracing the son proved abortive; this led the respondent to\n\napply before the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 226</a> for a writ of habeas corpus\n\ndirecting the appellant to produce her son; the appellant in answer to the rule\n\ndenied having kidnapped his son whereupon the High Court then decided to\n\nexamine witnesses; pursuant thereto the respondent and her mother deposed in\n\nCourt but the appellant chose not to cross-examine the witnesses produced by\n\nthe respondent or to examine himself or anyone else as a witness; the Court\n\nhaving been satisfied that the son had been unauthorisedly taken away by the\n\nappellant from the lawful custody of the respondent and was being illegally\n\ndetained by him, a writ of habeas corpus was issued directing the appellant to\n\nproduce his son before the Court so that custody of the child could be given to\n the respondent; the appellant having failed to do so, he was found guilty of\n\ncontempt and was directed to be detained in civil prison.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">      The Apex Court had the occasion to hear the appeal against the order\n\ncommitting the appellant to prison for contempt and the petition for special leave\n\nto appeal which was directed against the order of the High Court on the <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_97\">Article\n\n226</a> petition. The order of the High Court issuing the writ was upheld. While\n\ndealing with the submission of the appellant that he did not give evidence or\n\nexamine any witnesses on his behalf nor did he cross-examine the respondent or\n\nhis mother because in such case he would be disclosing his defence in the\n\ncriminal case registered under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 363</a>, IPC and that compulsion to disclose\n\nhis defence would be contrary to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution, the Apex Court\n\nrejected his contention as misconceived and observed as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;Protection against testimonial compulsion did not convert the\n      position of a person accused of an offence into a position of\n      privilege, with immunity from any other action contemplated by law.\n      A criminal prosecution was not a fortress against all other actions in\n      law. To accept the position that the pendency of a prosecution was a\n      valid answer to a rule for Habeas Corpus would be to subvert the\n      judicial process and to mock at the Criminal Justice system. All that\n      <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_100\">Art.20(3)</a> guaranteed was that a person accused of an offence shall not be\n      compelled to be a witness against himself, nothing less and, certainly,\n      nothing more. Immunity against testimonial compulsion did not extend to\n      refusal to examine and cross-examine witnesses and it was not open to a\n      party proceeding (sic) (proceeded against) to refuse to examine himself or\n      anyone else as a witness on his side and to cross-examine the witnesses for\n      the opposite party on the ground of testimonial compulsion and then to\n      contend that no relief should be given to the opposite party on the basis of\n      the evidence adduced by the other party. We are unable to see how <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_101\">Art.\n      20 (3)</a> comes into the picture at all.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n       This ruling gives a clear answer to the issue. The respondents 5, 8 and 9\n\nwere given liberty to file their counter affidavits by the order dated 28.2.08\n\ninstead of any direction being passed (read: any compulsion) in this regard. There\n\nwas no question at all of compelling them to be witnesses against themselves.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">While choosing to remain silent, they could have either denied having summoned\n\nRiz to Lalbazar or even if had called him to Lalbazar, they could have justified\n\ntheir action. Silence of these respondents cannot debar the Court from\n\npronouncing its decision on the basis of the available evidence. On the authority\n\nof the aforesaid ruling this Court is constrained to hold that by not choosing to\n\ncounter the allegations contained in the writ petition to the extent that Riz had\n\nbeen summoned without the authority of law, the concerned respondents\n\nremained silent at their own risk and peril for <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 20(3)</a> could not have been\n\ninvoked in the present case and in view of the uncontroverted allegations, this\n\nCourt would proceed treating the allegations made in the petition against these\n\nrespondents as correct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      On the basis of the materials on record this Court holds that by\n\nsummoning Riz without registering any cognizable case against him on the basis\n\nof the complaints of Pradeep Todi and/or by invading Riz&#x27;s precious right to life\n\ndespite being well and truly aware that Priyanka had married him on her own\n\nwithout pressure exerted from any quarter, respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9 jointly and\n\nseverally are guilty of exceeding police powers conferred on them and thereby\n\nhave acted ultra vires the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      This issue is answered in favour of the petitioners.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Issue No.s 5 and 6</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       These issues being related are examined together.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       Arguments in detail were advanced by the learned Advocate General, Mr.\n\nPal and Mr. Bandopadhyay on the scope and ambit of Sections 174 and 175 of\n\nthe Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      While the learned Advocate General contended, by placing reliance on\n\nSections 174 and 175 read with Reg. 299 of the said Regulations, that\n\ninvestigation into cause of unnatural death may continue even after inquest and\n\ntill such time report of chemical examination is received, Mr. Bandopadhyay\n\nopposed such contention by submitting that summoning of witnesses for\n\nexamination under Section 175 of the Code is permissible till inquest report is\n\nprepared by the Magistrate concerned under Section 174 thereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      It appears from the order dated 16.10.07 that the contention of Mr.\n\nBandopadhyay was upheld by the learned Judge.

The question regarding the details as to\n      how the deceased was assaulted or who assaulted him or under what\n      circumstances he was assaulted appears to us to be foreign to the ambit and\n      scope of the proceedings under Section 174. In these circumstances,\n      therefore, neither in practice nor in law was it necessary for the police to\n      have mentioned these details in the inquest report.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">      In Kodala Purnachandra Rao (supra), the Court ruled as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      &quot;<a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 174</a>, Cr.P.C. peremptorily requires that the officer holding an inquest\n      on a deadbody should do so at the spot. This mandate is conveyed by the\n      word &#x27;there&#x27; occurring in Section 174(1). Sub-section (3) of the section further\n      requires the officer holding the inquest to forward the body with a view to its\n      being examined, by the medical man appointed by the State Government in\n      this behalf, if the state of the weather and the distance admit of its being so\n      forwarded without risk of such putrefaction on the road as would renders\n      such examination useless. The sub-section give a discretion to the police\n       officer not to send the body for post-mortem examination by the medical\n      officer only in one case, namely, where there can be no doubt as to the cause\n      of the death. This discretion however is to be exercised prudently and\n      honestly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1120373\" id=\"span_3\">The view in Pedda Narayana (supra) has been approved by a larger bench\n\nof the Apex Court in Khujji alias <a href=\"/doc/1120373/\" id=\"a_104\">Surendra Tiwari vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>\n\nreported in AIR 1991 SC 1853.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"557175\" id=\"span_4\">A couple of months prior to the decision in Khujji (supra), a quorum of the\n\nApex Court consisting of the selfsame learned Judges had the occasion to deal\n\nwith Section 174 of the Code in <a href=\"/doc/557175/\" id=\"a_105\">Malkiat Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> reported in\n\n(1991) 4 SCC 341.

The investigating officer is enjoined to forward the inquest\n      report to the Magistrate along with the statement recorded at the inquest,\n      so that the court would see the record, at the earliest of the\n      circumstances leading to the cause of the death of the deceased and\n      the witnesses examined during the inquest..........&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n      The word &#x27;there&#x27; in Section 174 is most important. An inquest is therefore\n\nto be conducted at the citus where a dead body is found (the death having\n\noccurred in unnatural circumstances) for ascertaining the apparent cause of\n\ndeath. Cause of death has to be ascertained on the basis of ocular impression of\n the officer conducting inquest and from information collected from persons (at\n\nleast two) present at the spot.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">      However, in terms of Reg. 299 of the said Regulations, a report has to be\n\nforwarded to the nearest Magistrate prior to the police officer proceeds for inquest\n\nand the final report has to be forwarded after the inquest is complete. Although\n\nReg. 299 enables further enquiry, this Court has been unable to find any\n\nstatutory provision which entitles the police officer to keep in abeyance\n\nsubmission of final report to the Magistrate awaiting report of post-mortem or\n\nchemical examination. Those reports might suggest the exact cause of death. But\n\nin terms of Section 174 of the Code the first impression of the police officer\n\nconducting the inquest with regard to the apparent cause of death is important,\n\nwhich has to be reproduced in the form of a report containing information in\n\nrespect of matters mentioned in B.P. Form No.48 <a href=\"/doc/557175/\" id=\"a_107\">referred to above</a>. If such report\n\nis to be delayed pending receipt of post-mortem or chemical examination report,\n\nthe object of the statutory provision to bring to the notice of the Magistrate at the\n\nearliest the circumstances leading to the death would be frustrated. Merely\n\nbecause a dead body is required to be sent for post mortem when the officer\n\nconducting inquest entertains any doubt regarding the cause of death, there can\n\nbe no warrant for the proposition that the final report in terms of Reg. 299 must\n\nawait the expert&#x27;s report. Reading the provisions of Section 174 as it is one after\n\nthe other and in between lines, this Court is inclined to hold that the final report\n\nmust be filed at the earliest possible opportunity and without any delay and must\n\nnot be held up for want of report throwing light on the exact cause of death or\n else the very purpose of Section 174 would be defeated. Reg. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"557175\" id=\"span_5\">299 cannot\n\nsupplant Section 174 of the Code or override it and on the authority of the\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/557175/\" id=\"a_108\">Paramjit Singh</a> (supra), it is held that Reg. 299 cannot be read or\n\nconstrued in a manner to mean that it enables a police officer to file his final\n\nreport after obtaining expert opinion.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">      For reasons aforesaid, the contention raised on behalf of the State and the\n\npolice officer respondents that a final report under Section 174 must await expert\n\nopinion on post mortem and other examinations which might be necessary has\n\nagain not impressed this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">      This Court therefore shares the view expressed by the learned Judge that\n\nafter inquest, there is no scope for further enquiry/investigation under Section\n\n174 of the Code and prima facie finding that investigation being carried on by the\n\nCID is not in accordance with law is hereby confirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1364215\" id=\"span_6\">Before proceeding further, this Court may notice that in <a href=\"/doc/1364215/\" id=\"a_109\">Lata Singh vs.\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh</a> reported in AIR 2006 SC 2522, the Apex Court felt the\n\nnecessity of making comments touching a matter of grave public concern (inter-\n\ncaste and inter religious marriages between majors) and held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;17. The caste system is a curse on the nation and the sooner it is destroyed\n      the better. In fact, it is dividing the nation at a time when we have to be\n      united to face the challenge before the nation unitedly. Hence, inter-caste\n      marriage are in fact in the national interest as they will result in destroying\n      the caste system. However, disturbing news are coming from several parts of\n      the country that young men and women who undergo inter-caste marriage,\n      are threatened with violence, or violence is actually committed on them. In\n      our opinion, such acts of violence or threats or harassment are wholly illegal\n      and those who commit them must be severely punished. This is a free and\n      democratic country, and once a person becomes a major he or she can marry\n      whosoever he/she likes. If the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of\n      such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage the maximum they can do is that\n       they can cut off social relations with the son or the daughter, but they cannot\n      give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the\n      person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage. We,\n      therefore, direct that the administration/police authorities\n      throughout the country will see to it that if any boy or girl who is a\n      major undergoes inter-caste or inter-religious marriage with a\n      woman or man who is a major, the couple are not harassed by any\n      one nor subjected to threats or acts of violence, and any one who\n      gives such threats or harasses or commits acts of violence either\n      himself or at his instigation, is taken to task by instituting criminal\n      proceedings by the police against such persons and further stern\n      action is taken against such persons as provided by law&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n      Howsoever sincerely the judiciary at the highest level of the country may\n\nthink of bringing about union of people belonging to different communities and\n\nreligions through inter-caste and inter-religious marriages, in reality the situation\n\nis a far cry. The case presented before this Court bears ample testimony thereof.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">      Facts and circumstances which have surfaced in course of hearing the\n\npresent writ petition depict exactly the undesirable, unwarranted and deplorable\n\nsituation which the learned Judges anticipated and endeavoured to abort while\n\npassing directions (supra) for taking suitable actions against the perpetrators of\n\nharassment, threats and violence who fail to take inter-caste and inter-religious\n\nmarriages by near relatives in their stride. Unfortunately, the directions remain\n\non black and white without being cared for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">      The question that arises now is what was the nature of investigation that\n\nwas being conducted by the CID? Law is well settled that in terms of provisions\n\ncontained in the Code when a Magistrate makes an enquiry it is an enquiry,\n\notherwise it becomes an investigation. In the interim order dated 16.10.2007, the\n learned Judge considered a summons issued by the CID to a witness issued\n\nunder Section 175 of the Code dated 10.10.07. As noticed earlier, once the\n\ninquest was complete further enquiry/investigation under Sections 174/175 of\n\nthe Code is not contemplated. The learned Judge thus observed that\n\ninvestigation conducted by the CID was not in accordance with law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"557175\" id=\"span_7\">Though learned Advocate General and Mr. Pal have been critical of the\n\nobservations made by the Court in its order dated 16.10.2007, stand of the State\n\nGovernment in this respect is nebulous to say the least. Despite repeated\n\nopportunities extended to the State to file counter affidavit to the petition as\n\nnoted above, affidavits which have been filed do not clear the position. According\n\nto the learned Advocate General, the order dated 28.2.2008 passed by this Court\n\nwas misconstrued and as such an affidavit touching only the point on which\n\naffidavit was invited thereby was filed. Be that as it may, he contended that the\n\nCID was conducting a preliminary enquiry before launching into an investigation\n\nand that such enquiry is permissible having regard to the decisions of the Apex\n\nCourt in Sirajuddin (supra), Bhagwant Kishore Joshi (supra), Bhajan Lal (supra)\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/557175/\" id=\"a_110\">Rajinder Singh Katoch</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">       True it is that the complaint lodged by the petitioner no.2 with the Karaya\n\nPolice Station on 22.9.2007 did not in so many words disclose the commission of\n\na cognizable offence resulting in the unnatural death of Riz. Viewed in isolation,\n\nnon-registration of a cognizable case on the basis thereof may not be faulted.\n\nBut, at the same time, there was clear indication therein of the suspicion that\n\nrespondent no.12 might have a hand in such unnatural death. What the\n petitioner no.2 intended to convey was that respondent no.12 had been\n\nthreatening Riz with dire consequences for having married his daughter and,\n\ntherefore, could be held responsible for his death. The chain of circumstances\n\npreceding and following this complaint (some could very well have been\n\nsuspected) being of some significance deserves to be noted. The chain viz. (i) inter\n\nreligious marriage between Riz and Priyanka; (ii) Riz and Priyanka being aware\n\nthat such marriage would not be accepted by her family; (iii) letters to various\n\npolice officers, jointly written by Riz and Priyanka, in anticipation of unlawful\n\ninterference in their marital life by respondent no. 12; (iv) apathy of the Kolkata\n\nPolice to provide any protection to the married couple; (v) futile attempt of\n\nrespondent no.12 to persuade Priyanka to return home; (vi) complaints lodged by\n\nPradeep Todi alleging abduction of Priyanka by Riz; (vii) enquiries made by Pulak\n\nDutta, S.I. attached to Karaya Police Station reporting that the couple are majors\n\nand the certificate of marriage is genuine; (viii) enquiry made by the respondent\n\nno.9 on being directed by respondents 5 and 8 and reporting to the same effect;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">(ix) summoning of Riz and Priyanka at Lal Bazar through the respondents 8 and\n\n9 without a formal FIR and discussions in the chambers of respondents 5 and 7;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1364215\" id=\"span_8\">(x) agreement between the parties - Priyanka to return within 7 days; (xi) breach\n\nof agreement - Priyanka fails to return; (xii) abortive requests of Riz to allow\n\nPriyanka to return; (xiii) mysterious death of Riz; (xiv) the Police Commissioner\n\nof Kolkata without being impartial, declaring in a press conference that Riz had\n\ncommitted suicide; and (xv) the CID conducting preliminary enquiry for days\n\ntogether without registering FIR, - did afford reasonable ground to suspect foul\n play behind the unnatural death of Riz. On the basis of the surrounding\n\ncircumstances one could reasonably reach either of two conclusions, i.e. that\n\ndeath of Riz had occurred as a result of commission of crime or that suffocating\n\ncircumstances, brought about by the respondent no.12 with his aides and allies,\n\nfor Riz tying the nuptial knot with Priyanka had resulted in such mental torture\n\nthat he decided to give up his life. To embark on an investigation of a cognizable\n\ncase, a police officer must have &#x27;reason to suspect&#x27;. In the considered view of this\n\nCourt, the investigative machinery of the State police agency ought to have\n\nactivated itself by recording an FIR, if not for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_111\">Section\n\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_112\">506</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_113\">120B</a> of the IPC, but certainly under Section 306/506/120B thereof,\n\nthe ingredients wherefor were available. Reasons for suspecting commission of a\n\ncrime ought to have been governed and dictated by the circumstances without\n\nlooking for adequate proof of facts at that stage. Even if the unnatural death of\n\nRiz did not reveal any foul play or even if the chain of circumstances did not\n\nwarrant   recording   of   FIR   under   <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_114\">Sections   306</a>/<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_115\">506</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_116\">120B</a>     of   the   IPC,\n\ncircumstances which surfaced did provide reasonable grounds for the CID to at\n\nleast initiate criminal proceedings in terms of the directions of the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1364215/\" id=\"a_117\">Lata Singh</a> (supra) against respondents 12 and 13, as well as Pradeep Todi, and\n\nthe city police officers who were instrumental in ensuring that the inter-religious\n\nmarriage between the two breaks up and Priyanka returns to her parental home.\n\nInstead, the CID had been continuing investigation under Section 174 of the\n\nCode more than 14 (fourteen) days after post mortem report was obtained.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">        The State in its counter affidavit, as noted earlier, has not disclosed the\n\nnature of enquiry undertaken by the CID and as such the extent to which such\n\nenquiry progressed also could not be ascertained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      In the present case, right from the press conference of the respondent no.3\n\nan impression was sought to be given that Riz had committed suicide without\n\nthere being any provocation. The circumstances pointed out above were sufficient\n\nto justify investigation into either the suspicion of murder or suspicion of\n\nabetment of suicide. As has been held in Patel Lilabhai Ambalal (supra), it is\n\nelementary for the police to suspect everything and everyone and thereafter by\n\nprocess of elimination and inclusion come to the conclusion, - the conclusion\n\nbeing the last thing on the completion of investigation and not the first thing at\n\nthe beginning of the investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">        It was entirely for the CID to decide upon its next course of action, but to\n\ncontend that a preliminary enquiry was resorted to and result thereof was\n\nawaited has failed to impress this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">        While the need for preliminary enquiry in particular cases before\n\nconducting an investigation of a cognizable offence cannot be obliterated, in the\n\nguise of a preliminary enquiry and by unduly prolonging it a legitimate\n\ninvestigation which may be had cannot be stifled. Conducting preliminary\n\nenquiry before recording FIR is not mandatory in all cases. In some of the\n\ndecisions cited by Mr. Bandopadhyay, preliminary enquiry in respect of a\n\ncomplaint disclosing commission of cognizable offence has been held to be\n\nunknown in the scheme of the Code. However, on careful consideration of the\n decisions cited by learned Senior Counsel for the respondents on the point of\n\npreliminary enquiry, this Court would hold preliminary enquiry of a limited\n\nnature to be permissible even in respect of cognizable cases. Persons of &#x27;high\n\nprofile&#x27;, dignitaries, persons in authority, celebrities, etc. are sometimes at the\n\nreceiving end due to reckless allegations, mostly made anonymously, which\n\nmight mar their respective careers and to obliterate the possibility of their\n\nunnecessary involvement in such cases that a preliminary enquiry may be had to\n\nascertain facts. Such enquiry would also be advisable if a pure civil dispute is\n\nsought to be brought within the arena of criminal law by the complainant to\n\nwreak vengeance against an adversary. There can, however, be no exhaustive\n\nenumeration of cases warranting preliminary enquiry but each case has to be\n\nconsidered on the basis of its own peculiar facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"557175\" id=\"span_9\">Considering the facts of the present case, this Court is unable to hold\n\nthat the prevailing circumstances did not warrant lodging of an FIR by the CID\n\nfor conducting a full-fledged investigation. The possibility of killing time in the\n\nguise of ascertaining facts in course of preliminary enquiry to shield offenders\n\nincluding high ranking police officers cannot be ruled out. To this extent, this\n\nCourt holds the CID to be grossly negligent. Borrowing the words of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nPathak, J. (as His Lordship then was) in <a href=\"/doc/557175/\" id=\"a_118\">Bhagwant Singh</a> (supra), this Court\n\nholds that the &quot;investigation by the police following the occurrence was desultory\n\nand lackadaisical, and showed want of appreciation of the emergent need to get at\n\nthe truth of the case.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">       Submission of Mr. Pal that the decision in Sampat Lal (supra) does not lay\n\ndown a law having the force of a binding precedent and the conclusion reached\n\nregarding power of the High Court to direct investigation by the CBI where the\n\nState Government does not grant consent for such investigation, is misconceived.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">      In paragraph 13, the Apex Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;In our considered opinion, <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_119\">S. 6</a> of the Act does not apply when the\n      Court gives a direction to the CBI to conduct an investigation and\n      counsel for the parties rightly did not dispute this position.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n       Reflection of the opinion of the Apex Court was based on its independent\n\nconsideration of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_120\">DSPE Act</a>, apart from the fact that counsel\n\nappearing for the parties before it did not dispute the position that when a\n\ndirection is given by the Court in an appropriate case, consent envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 6</a> thereof would not be a condition precedent. The submission of Mr. Pal\n\nis therefore unacceptable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">       On very many occasions, Courts have ordered CBI investigation in the\n\ninterest of fair and impartial investigation as well as in the interest of the State\n\nPolice agencies, to avoid any doubt on credibility of the investigation. Reference\n\nin this connection may be made to the decision in Md. Anis (supra).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1544143\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/1544143/\" id=\"a_122\">Central Bureau of Investigation vs. State of Gujarat</a> (supra), it was held\n\nthat where the investigating agency is not doing proper investigation and/or\n\nthere is reason to believe that there is laxity in the investigation, a direction may\n\nbe given to the CBI to investigate the matter in appropriate cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">       In Gudalure M.J.

Unless and until the question referred to a Larger\n      Bench is considered and answered by the Supreme Court, the law as earlier\n      laid down is binding on this Court. We find support for this view from a\n      number of judgments of the different High Courts&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">        While noticing the decision in Shashikant (supra) wherein it was held that\n\nwhen a reference of a vital question of law is made to a Larger Bench all other\n\nproceedings pending in other Courts do not come to a grinding halt, the Division\n\nBench satisfied itself on facts and in the circumstances before it that it would be\n\nnecessary to have the entire fact situation investigated by the CBI and directed\n\naccordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">       In Sahngoo Ram Arya (supra) relied on by Mr. Ghosh the Apex Court has\n\nreminded the High Courts not to direct CBI investigation as a matter of course\n\nand that there is a need for the High Court on consideration of the pleadings with\n\nreference to the reply filed to come to the conclusion and to record a prima facie\n\nsatisfaction that the material before it is sufficient to direct an enquiry by the\n\nCBI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">       What <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 6</a> ordains is that the Central Govt. may not direct\n\ninvestigation by CBI without consent of that State in any area within the State\n\nother than a Union Territory or a railway area but such fetter in <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 6</a> of the\n\nDSPE Act does not in any manner affect or restrict the power, authority and\n\ncompetence of the Court exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 226</a> to direct\n\ninvestigation by the CBI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">        It is too obvious that for directing investigation by CBI, the Court has to\n\nsatisfy itself that investigation by the State agency has faltered to such extent\n\nthat continuation thereof would be farcical and manifestly result in injustice. And\n\nit is trite that Mandamus is issued wherever injustice is traced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">        Though while passing the interim order dated 16.10.07 the Court did not\n\nhave the benefit of considering the version of the respondents on affidavits, the\n\nmaterials presented were duly considered and on the basis of appreciation\n\nthereof prima facie satisfaction was recorded by the Court that investigation was\n\nnot proper and therefore the CBI was directed to investigate the cause of death of\n\nRiz.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">        Regard being had to the facts and circumstances which fell for\n\nconsideration on 16.10.07, this Court is of the considered view that entrusting\n\nthe CBI with investigation of cause of death of Riz cannot be said to be improper\n\nor unwarranted. This Court therefore holds that the Court was perfectly justified\n\nin directing CBI investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">       These issues are answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">\n\n\nIssue No.7\n\n        This has been a hotly debated issue at the Bar as would appear from the\n\nsubmissions of learned Counsel for the parties recorded above.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">        Learned Counsel for the respondents except the CBI have contended that\n\nthe CBI acted ultra vires in registering an FIR for alleged offence of murder and,\n\ntherefore, all steps taken on the basis thereof are null and void and hence\n\ninoperative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">       To decide this issue it would be worthwhile to take a further look to the\n\ndirection of the Court dated 16.10.07 which reads a follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       &quot;Therefore, let there be an interim order directing the CBI to investigate into\n      the cause of unnatural death of Rizwanur and the CBI shall a file a report in\n      a sealed cover&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">      In this connection, this Court also considers it necessary to extract a\n\npassage from the decision of the Apex Court in H.N. Rishbud (supra) dealing with\n\n&#x27;investigation&#x27; under the Code. It reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      &quot;Investigation usually starts on information relating to the commission of an\n      offence under Section 154 of the Code. If from information so received or\n      otherwise, the officer in charge of a police station has reason to suspect the\n      commission of an offence, he or some other officers deputed by him, has to\n      proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case\n      and if necessary to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the\n      offenders.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      Thus, investigation primarily consists in the ascertainment of the facts and\n      circumstances of the case. By definition, it includes &#x27;all the proceedings\n      under the Code for the collection of evidence conducted by a police officer&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">      In Bhagwant Kishore Joshi (supra), the position emerging from Section 157\n\nof the Code was reiterated that an officer in charge of a police station can start\n\ninvestigation either on information or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">      In the present case it is an admitted position on facts that when the order\n\ndated 16.10.07 was passed by the Court, there was no FIR disclosing commission\n\nof cognizable offence. On 22.9.07, the petitioner no.2 had by his complaint\n\ninformed Karaya Police Station about the unnatural death of Rizwanur and that\n\nhe suspected the hands of respondent no.12 behind his death. Immediately\n\nthereafter, the CID had taken over investigation and had conducted investigation\n\nwhich ultimately was declared to be &#x27;not in accordance with law&#x27;. The Court\n\ndirected CBI to investigate the cause of unnatural death of Riz on 16.10.07 on\n\nthis petition in which the CBI was a respondent. In the petition it had been\n\nalleged that Riz had been killed/murdered. As has been held in H.N. Rishbud\n (supra) and Bhagwant Kishore Joshi (supra), the CBI was empowered to conduct\n\ninvestigation on the basis of information received otherwise than information\n\nrecorded under Section 154 of the Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_84\">       It has been contended on behalf of the CBI that it had proceeded to\n\nregister an FIR taking into consideration the contents of the writ petition.\n\nLearned Advocate General has contended that such a course of action was\n\nimpermissible without seizing copy of the writ petition. This Court is afraid, it\n\ncannot agree with him. CBI being a respondent in the writ petition and having\n\nbeen served with a copy thereof in accordance with the rules framed by this\n\nCourt which requires (subject to exceptions) service of copy of petition on the\n\nrespondents in each case where interim relief is prayed for which might affect\n\nthem, the CBI was well within its jurisdiction to note the contents of copy of the\n\nwrit petition supplied to it and to act on the basis thereof. It has not been shown\n\nbefore this Court that contents of copy of the writ petition supplied to the CBI by\n\nthe petitioners was on any score different from the petition filed in Court or copy\n\nof the same supplied to the State. The need to seize the original, therefore, would\n\nnot arise. Information disclosed to the CBI through the writ petition would\n\nconstitute information received from sources other than a complaint registered as\n\nan FIR under Section 154 of the Code which the CBI was empowered to\n\ninvestigate under section 157 thereof and thus this Court finds no illegality on\n\nthe part of the CBI in proceeding to register an FIR on the basis of the writ\n\npetition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">        There are two other reasons for which this Court is inclined to hold that\n\nthe CBI&#x27;s action in registering an FIR is defensible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">       The Court in its order dated 16.10.07 had ruled, albeit on prima facie\n\nsatisfaction, that investigation under Sections 174/175 of the Code after inquest\n\nwas complete could not be conducted in law. It has been correctly contended by\n\nMr. Roy that once the Court held that investigation under Sections 174/175\n\ncould not be conducted after inquest was complete, argument of the respondents\n\nthat investigation should have been confined only to unnatural death and to\n\nascertain its cause within the limits of Section 174, is fallacious. It is\n\npreposterous to suggest, even on the face of recording of such a finding, that by\n\ndirecting investigation to be made by the CBI to find the cause of &#x27;unnatural\n\ndeath&#x27; of Riz the Court intended to have an investigation conducted limited to the\n\nnature permissible under Section 174 of the Code. The Court&#x27;s order cannot be\n\nread as a statute divorced from the facts of the case and terms of the order.\n\nUnderstandably, the direction for conducting investigation implied registration of\n\nan FIR preceding investigation and, therefore, had to be treated as one casting an\n\nobligation on the CBI to first register a case and thereafter proceed to find out the\n\ncause of death, whether suicidal or homicidal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">        Having regard to the facts and circumstances which were on record,\n\naccidental death of Riz was ruled out. Therefore, in order to find out whether the\n\ndeath was suicidal or homicidal, the CBI being empowered to exercise powers\n\nconferred on the police to investigate under Chapter XII of the Code could have\n\ndone so only on recording an FIR. Action taken by the CBI in this behalf does not\n appear to this Court to be offending either the power conferred on it by the Code\n\nor the order dated 16.10.07. It has been contended on behalf of the respondents\n\nthat the CBI has interpreted the order dated 16.10.07 by reading words therein,\n\notherwise absent, without seeking any clarification. If the CBI had proceeded on\n\nthe basis of its own interpretation of the order which does not appear to be\n\nabsurd or unreasonable, the Court would not invalidate the impugned action on\n\nthe ground that the CBI ought to have approached the Court for further\n\nclarification instead of taking recourse to a particular action. It would have been\n\na discreet action on the part of the CBI but mere indiscretion, without anything\n\nmore, cannot be equated with malafides.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">       That apart, in the decisions in Madhu Bala (supra), Suresh Chand Jain\n\n(supra) and Md. Yusuf (supra), the Apex Court has held that when a Magistrate\n\norders the police to conduct investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code, that\n\nwould include a direction to the police to register an FIR in the absence of any\n\nsuch direction given by such Magistrate and the police would have to take\n\nfurther steps contemplated in Chapter XII of the Code only thereafter. Viewed in\n\nthis perspective and on the authority of what have been laid down therein, the\n\nCBI was justified in recording an FIR before it proceeded to conduct investigation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">      The numerous decisions cited by the learned Senior Counsel for the State,\n\nthe respondent police officers, the respondent no.12 and learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondent no.13 in support of their contention to the contrary have been\n\ncarefully looked into. The CBI exercised power for an authorised purpose and in\n\naccordance with law. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present\n case, the cited decisions are not apposite since the situation for applying the\n\nratio thereof is non-existent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">      This Court thus holds that in registering an FIR and in conducting\n\ninvestigation on the basis thereof, the CBI did not act ultra vires.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">      This issue is answered in favour of the CBI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n\nIssue No.8\n\n      In its order dated 28.2.08, this Court for reasons recorded did not accede\n\nto the request of the parties for supply of copy of the CBI&#x27;s report but the issue\n\nwas left upon for being considered at the time of final hearing. Parties have again\n\naddressed the Court on the point of supply of copy of the report. Several\n\ndecisions have been cited by Mr. Pal in support of his submission that looking\n\ninto the report by the Court without extending opportunity to the parties to look\n\ninto the same would be against judicial principles as well as natural justice. The\n\ndecisions cited by Mr. Pal mostly relate to disciplinary proceedings initiated\n\nagainst delinquent employees. The rules regarding disciplinary proceedings are\n\nnot quite identical as rules that are required to be followed in conducting\n\ninvestigation of a criminal case or in criminal proceedings. As part of compliance\n\nwith natural justice principles, a delinquent employee who has been proceeded\n\nagainst by initiation of a disciplinary proceeding is entitled to have a copy or to\n\nlook into any document which the prosecution seeks to rely on against him in the\n\nenquiry or which the Enquiry Officer may consider relevant for the purpose of\n\nenquiry. Such an employee is also entitled to have copy of any document or to\n have inspection thereof which is in the custody of the employer and is considered\n\nby him to be relevant for his defence, the question of relevancy being an issue\n\nrequired to be decided by the Enquiry Officer. Depriving the delinquent employee\n\nof such opportunity having regard to the fact situation of each case may result in\n\nviolation of principles of natural justice. So far as criminal proceedings are\n\nconcerned, the stages at which documents may be made available to parties\n\ninterested are laid down in the Code itself. It would thus be open to the parties to\n\napply for the same in accordance with provisions contained in the Code. Not a\n\nsingle decision has been cited before this Court which lays down the law that\n\nwhile a Court looks into information and/or documents collected in course of\n\ncriminal investigation at the pre-charge sheet stage, the Court is obliged to\n\nsupply such document to an aggrieved party who intends to look into the same\n\nbefore the Court renders a decision in respect thereof. In the present case,\n\ncriminal proceedings against some of the respondents are in an embryonic stage.\n\nEvidence has been collected and it has been reported to this Court by the CBI\n\nthat a prima facie case for proceeding further against them before the appropriate\n\nCourt for alleged involvement in commission of offences punishable under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_131\">IPC</a> exists and leave has been prayed for to enable it to file charge sheet before\n\nthe appropriate Court of law. Till such time the Magistrate takes cognizance of\n\nthe alleged offences committed by the accused, it cannot be said that criminal\n\nproceedings are pending against anyone. There is no determination of guilt by\n\nthis Court on the basis of the report of the CBI. If a charge sheet is filed before\n\nthe competent Court and it takes cognizance and asks the charge-sheeted\n accused persons to stand trial, the accused persons would be within their right\n\nto seek documents in accordance with the provisions of the Code as also in the\n\nlight of the decision in Debendra Nath Padhi (supra). In such circumstances, the\n\ncontention that since the report of the CBI has been placed before this Court and\n\nthe Court has looked into it, hence the parties are also entitled to look into the\n\nsame is obviously untenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_93\">      Learned Advocate General very humbly has submitted that contents of the\n\nreport might unknowingly influence the mind of the Court. Also, Mr. Pal has\n\ncontended that non-supply of the report of the CBI would give rise to a lurking\n\nsuspicion in the minds of the police officers that the Court had formed a view\n\nagainst them without disclosing its contents to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">      In the considered view of this Court, requirement to comply with natural\n\njustice principles can be invoked where the Court or an adjudicator proceeds to\n\nform an opinion against an individual on the basis of a document behind his\n\nback. Whatever conclusion this Court has reached is based on its appreciation of\n\nthe pleadings of the parties and the records produced, which have been duly\n\ninspected by the parties. The report of the CBI has been considered only for the\n\nlimited extent of ascertaining whether the CBI should be permitted to proceed\n\nfurther in accordance with law. If the argument of Mr. Pal is to be accepted, then\n\nin every case where a competent Court, empowered to deal with applications\n\nunder Sections 438 or 439 of the Code, looks into case diaries placed before it by\n\nthe Public Prosecutor, it would have to permit access to Advocates for the\n\naccused to the case diaries. This would be a course of action dehors the Code\n and contrary to principles settled in Debendra Nath Padhi (supra). So long the\n\ninvestigation is not closed by way of filing of a formal report under Section 173(2)\n\nof the Code, persons who might be shown as accused in the FIR have no right to\n\nclaim copy of the report containing materials which have been collected against\n\nthem and particularly in view of the fact that report filed before this Court is not\n\na final report but is one in aid of the final report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">      This Court therefore has no reason to take a view different from the one\n\ntaken on 28.2.08 when the prayer of the parties was rejected for the time being.\n\nIt is accordingly held that the respondents have no right to look into the report of\n\nthe CBI and to have copy thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">      This issue is answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\">\n\nIssue No.9\n\n      Mr. Pal, as noted above, subjected the recommendations contained in the\n\nreport of the CBI for initiation of departmental proceedings (major penalty\n\nproceedings) against the respondent nos. 5, 7, 8 and 9 to severe criticism.\n\nAccording to him, the CBI had no business to make such recommendation. Mr.\n\nRoy sought to counter the contention by referring to Chapter 20 of the Manual.\n\nAccording to him provisions contained in Manual have statutory force and in\n\nterms of provisions contained in the said chapter, recommendations made by the\n\nCBI for initiation of departmental action cannot be faulted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">      Clause 20.4 of Chapter 20 being relevant is set out hereunder:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">             &quot; In the cases investigated by the CBI in which the same facts\n             constitute the ground for both Departmental Action as well as\n             Prosecution, the charge-sheet under Section 173 Cr. P.C. should be\n            filed immediately on completion of investigation along with the original\n            relied upon records, after obtaining sanction for prosecution wherever\n            necessary. For Departmental Action, simultaneous request should be\n            sent to the competent disciplinary authority. This request should be\n            sent along with authenticated copies of the relevant documents\n            immediately to the Competent Authority/Head of Department with\n            copies to the C.V.C. and the CVO of the organization. In other cases\n            involving less serious offences or involving malpractices of a\n            Departmental nature, RDA only should be taken and the question of\n            prosecution should generally not arise. Any difference of opinion\n            regarding the question whether Departmental Action or Prosecution in\n            a Court of Law should be initiated in the first instance, will be resolved\n            on the basis of the advice of CVC.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">      It has been conceded by Mr. Roy that the report filed before this Court is\n\nnot under Section 173(2) of the Code but to enable the Court to satisfy itself that\n\nan appropriate investigation has been conducted in terms of its order.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">      Having regard to the facts that the report was one to assist the Court to\n\nrecord a satisfaction that the cause of death of Riz has been ascertained with\n\nadditional information relating to complicity of persons in connection therewith\n\nand that chargesheet under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure has\n\nnot been filed, it was beyond the jurisdiction of the CBI to include in its report\n\nfiled before this Court the recommendation for initiation of major penalty\n\nproceedings against some of the police officers. As clause 20.4 provides, request\n\nfor initiation of disciplinary proceeding should be sent to the competent\n\ndisciplinary authority simultaneously with filing of chargesheet under Section\n\n173 of the Code. The stage therefore has not yet arrived and at this stage it was\n\ninappropriate for the CBI to state in unequivocal terms that grounds for initiating\n departmental action against the erring police officers did exist and that action\n\nshould be taken in that direction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">      Additionally, the CBI ought to have appreciate that the petitioners had\n\nprayed for a declaration from this Court that the actions of the police officers\n\n(respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9) are ultra vires. The issue being sub judice, it was\n\nabsolutely inappropriate for the CBI to make a recommendation in this direction\n\nwithout obtaining leave from Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">      This issue is accordingly answered in favour of the respondents 5, 7, 8 and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">9.\n\n\n\nIssue No.10\n\n      Exercise of power of investigation by the CBI is governed by statutory\n\nprovisions under the general law applicable to such investigations. The dominant\n\npurpose of registering a case is to ensure conducting of investigation in respect of\n\nthe allegations contained in the FIR and in the event sufficient materials exist in\n\nsupport of the allegations, to present charge sheet before the Court for securing\n\nthe ultimate end of linking the offence with the offender.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">      It is on record that while issuing notice under Section 160 of the Code the\n\nCBI had clearly indicated the case number which was under investigation. The\n\nFIR was despatched to the Court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta\n\nand to other Magistrates at Bankshall Court. Contention that the CBI faltered in\n\ncomplying with Section 157 of the Code is without basis for the Court has\n ascertained in course of hearing that the Magistrates&#x27; Court referred to above\n\nhave duly received copy of the FIR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">      Submission of Mr. Ghosh that in the absence of any knowledge of an FIR\n\nhaving been registered respondent no.12 could not challenge it is unmeritorious.\n\nThere was no embargo on the respondent no.12 to apply for the certified copy of\n\nthe FIR for the purpose of challenging it. That a defect or irregularity in\n\nconducting investigation cannot vitiate the trial unless of course gross\n\nmiscarriage of justice has occasioned is settled law. Even otherwise, if there be\n\nany irregularity in conducting investigation the same cannot vitiate the trial\n\nwhich might ensue for it has not been demonstrated before this Court that there\n\nhas been such gross miscarriage of justice which would require interdiction by\n\nthis Court. Even if there be any irregularity or defect in investigation, those\n\naggrieved thereby would not be without remedy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1574164\" id=\"span_12\">It is settled law that decision to investigate or the decision on the agency\n\nwhich would investigate does not attract principles of natural justice. The\n\naccused cannot have a say in who should investigate the offences he is charged\n\nwith (see AIR 1997 SC 93 : <a href=\"/doc/1574164/\" id=\"a_133\">Central Bureau of Investigation vs. Rajesh Gandhi</a>).\n\nThis Court in the earlier part of this judgment has expressed its concurrence\n\nwith the order of the Court dated 16.10.07 that the case at hand called for\n\ninvestigation by the CBI. For reasons discussed above, this Court is unable to\n\nconcur with the learned Counsel for the respondents barring the CBI that the\n actions of the CBI are tainted. On the basis of materials collected, a prima facie\n\ncase exists for proceeding against persons named in the concluding portion of the\n\nreport extracted above. There is no reason as to why course of law should be\n\nobstructed merely because it might not be to the liking of some of the\n\nrespondents.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">      In view of the aforesaid discussion there appears to be no reason as to why\n\nthe CBI should not be allowed to proceed further.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">      The issue is answered accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">\n\nIssue No.11\n\n      Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, this Court grants liberty to the\n\nCBI to proceed in accordance with law for filing charge sheet before the\n\ncompetent court under Section 173(2) of the Code. There shall, however, be no\n\ndirection for further investigation as prayed for by Mr. Bandopadhyay regarding\n\ndiscrepancy in age of the deceased as recorded in the official records but absolute\n\nliberty is reserved to the CBI to conduct further investigation before it actually\n\nfiles the charge sheet on any point it may consider necessary in the interest of\n\njustice. However, it shall not act upon the proposal to recommend to the State\n\ninitiation of disciplinary proceedings for major penalty against respondents 5, 7,\n\n8 and 9 or any other police officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">       Since this Court has returned a finding that the city police officers\n\n(respondents 5, 7, 8 and 9) invaded Riz&#x27;s right to life without authority of law\n\nwhile discharging duty as public servants, it is declared that they have acted\n\nultra vires and their acts impugned herein are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">      However, on the question as to what is the effective relief that ought to be\n\ngranted on facts and in the circumstances of the case vis-à-vis the prayers made\n\nhas presented its own difficulties. In view of the law <a href=\"/doc/1574164/\" id=\"a_134\">laid down in</a> Rani Laxmibai\n\n(supra), an allegation of fact has to be pleaded in the petition for enabling the\n\nadversary to meet it based on the principle that a party should not be caught\n\nunawares at the hearing. But, rules regarding pleadings at least in respect of writ\n\npetitions have been diluted to good extent by subsequent decisions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1539259\" id=\"span_13\">One may\n\nprofitably refer to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1539259/\" id=\"a_135\">State Bank of India vs S.N. Goyal</a> reported in\n\n2008 AIR SCW 4355 wherein it has been held that in writ proceedings, the High\n\nCourt can call for the record of the case, examine the same and pass appropriate\n\norders after giving an opportunity to the State/the statutory authority to explain\n\nany particular act or omission, and that it is quite different from a civil suit\n\nwhere the parties are governed by rules of pleadings and there can be no\n\nadjudication of an issue in the absence of necessary pleadings.</span> The decision in\n\nGanapati Madhav Sawant (supra) cited by Mr. Pal is therefore clearly\n\ndistinguishable. In the present case, the factual foundation for seeking effective\n\nrelief has been laid though a prayer in that behalf is absent. Parties have been\n\nheard at length on the claim of Mr. Bandopadhyay that the State should be\n directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the erring police officers. The\n\ndecision in Rani Laxmibai would, therefore, have no application on facts.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80351\" id=\"span_14\">This Court at the same time is not oblivious of the observations of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSethi, J.
