Messages were posted on the group to the\n\n                effect that the students may get vaccinated and produce proof of the same as a\n\n                pre-condition to attend the college physically.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          7. The SOP permitted the conduct of online and in-person classes in\n\n                rotation. It is the grievance of the petitioners that P2 had been prevented from\n\n                attending the in-person classes, as he had objected to the collection of data\n\n                relating to the vaccination status.

On 28.10.2021, P2 is stated to\n\n                have been ‘expelled from the classroom’. P2 avers that he had attempted even\n\n                thereafter to attend classes on campus but had not been permitted entry till\n\n                22.12.2021. Neither were his specific concerns relating to the conduct of the\n\n                college in insisting on divulgence of vaccination status, addressed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">                          9. In the counter filed by the college, there is an allegation that on\n\n                22.12.2021, P2 had forcibly entered the rooms of the Principal and the\n\n                Correspondent without a mask and perhaps without vaccination, (as he refused\n\n                to confirm his vaccination status) and that he threatened to spread the virus in\n\n                that area. At this distance in time, these allegations are not verifiable. Suffice it\n\n                to say that the petitioner has not attended the college after 28.10.2021, as he\n\n                had not been permitted to enter the campus thereafter for want of vaccination\n\n                status or adherence to Covid 19 norms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                          10. The mainstay of the arguments of the petitioners are that vaccination\n\n                status constitutes Sensitive Personal Data and Information (SPDI), in terms of\n\n                the <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_6\">Information Technology Act, 2005</a>. P2 is thus protected from the need to\n\n                disclose such sensitive data or placing such data in public domain.

The object of the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_16\">Disaster Management Act, 2005</a> is to provide for\n\n             requisite       institutional      mechanisms           for    drawing       up,    monitoring        and\n\n             implementing disaster management plans.                          It is intended to facilitate the\n\n             integration of measures by various wings of the Government for prevention and\n\n             mitigation of the ill-effects of disasters and for ‘undertaking a holistic,\n\n             coordinated and prompt response to any disaster situation’ 7.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">                      30. The impugned Government Order has been issued by the Revenue\n\n             and Disaster Management Department, which was the Nodal Agency, so to say,\n\n             engaged in the co-ordination of preventive and relief measures during the time\n\n             of the pandemic.             The response to such an agency has to be real-time,\n\n             addressing each emergency as it arose, fire fighting with various issues as and\n\n             when they cropped up and thinking ahead in order to ensure that the\n\n             Department anticipates issues so as to prevent or to contain them.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">                      31. It is the duty of this Department to address the situation as it unfolds\n\n             and the impugned Government Order has been issued as one of such measures.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">             7</span>\n                 Statement of objects and reasons for the <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_17\">Disaster Management Act, 2005</a>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">             16</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                                                                       WP.No.27868 of 2023</span>\n                                                                      and WMP Nos.27366 and 27367 of 2023\n                                                                           and 15970, 15973 and 9746 of 2024\n\n\n\n                Correspondingly, it is the duty of a citizen at that point in time to either comply\n\n                with those measures or to succumb to the consequences.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                          32. Thus, I find nothing untoward in the least, in the issuance of the\n\n                impugned Government Order. In fact, that Government Order is not of any\n\n                relevance today, since the period for which it was in operation, and the need for\n\n                it, has long elapsed. The measures set out under the SOP were directives to\n\n                Universities and educational institutions, to guide them on the manner by which\n\n                the entirety of the student population can be handled safely to optimize that\n\n                academic year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">                          33. On account of the trials and tribulations caused by the pandemic, it\n\n                would be impossible for a population as large as ours to have followed the\n\n                rigour of an academic schedule through it all but for a certain amount of\n\n                regulation. Hence the need for a balance that has been sought to be achieved by\n\n                the impugned Government Order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                          34. It is easy for one to state in hindsight, that things could have been\n\n                done better or differently. However, the legality or otherwise of the impugned\n\n                Government Order and the requirement of proportionality must be tested\n\n                concurrent with the times when it was issued and not two years later. The\n\n                relevant question to be posed is as to whether the impugned G.O. had a\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                                                                      WP.No.27868 of 2023</span>\n                                                                     and WMP Nos.27366 and 27367 of 2023\n                                                                          and 15970, 15973 and 9746 of 2024\n\n\n\n                legitimate purpose and whether it has achieved such purpose and my answer is\n\n                in the affirmative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">                          35. It is undeniable that vaccination status constitutes SPDI.             The\n\n                petitioner has referred to responses received under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">Right to Information Act,\n\n                2005</a>, where the Public Information Officer confirms that Government stores all\n\n                vaccination data in a safe and secure digital environment and the data is not\n\n                shared with any entity outside the environment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">                          36. However, while testing the Government Order, this Court would be\n\n                guided by the ground realities of those times. Hence, the measures taken under\n\n                the impugned Government Order are not found to be irrational or\n\n                disproportionate to the demands of the pandemic. Challenge to Government\n\n                Order No.164 dated 27.08.2021 is rejected.           Consequently, the plea for\n\n                compensation is also rejected. However, since the petitioners have been\n\n                pursuing their plea doggedly and diligently, they are entitled to some relief.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                          37.
