In the first place, it must be noted that\n                                  the power to order search and seizure is vested in the highest officers of\n                                  the department.

Even with\n                                  regard to the books of account and documents seized, their return is\n                                  guaranteed after a reasonable time. In the meantime the person from\n                                  whose custody they are seized is permitted to make copies and take\n                                  extracts. Sixthly, where money, bullion, etc. is seized, it can also be\n                                  immediately returned to the person concerned after he makes appropriate\n                                  provision for the payment of the estimated tax dues under sub-section (5)\n                                  and lastly, and this is most important, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_117\">Criminal\n                                  Procedure Code</a> relating to search and seizure apply, as far as they may\n                                  be, to all searches and seizures under Section 132. Rule 112 provides for\n                                  the actual search and seizure being made after observing normal\n                                  decencies of behaviour. The person in charge of the premises searched is\n                                  immediately given a copy of the list of articles seized. One copy is\n                                  forwarded to the authorizing officer. Provision for the safe custody of the\n                                  articles after seizure is also made in Rule 112. In our opinion, the\n                                  safeguards are adequate to render the provisions of search and seizure as\n                                  less onerous and restrictive as is possible under the circumstances. The\n                                  provisions, therefore, relating to search and seizure in Section 132 and\n                                  Rule 112 cannot be regarded as violative of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 19(f)</a> and (g).”\n                                                                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n                                  4.21.

It is here the concept of “proportionality”\n\n                     becomes relevant. To put it pithily, when a law limits a constitutional right,\n\n                     such a limitation is constitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing\n\n                     restrictions will be treated as proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\n\n                     purpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\n\n                     connected to the purpose, and such measures are necessary. This essence of\n\n                     doctrine of proportionality is beautifully captured by Dickson, C.J. of\n\n                     Canada in R. v.

A letter written by the person\n\n                     suspected of bribery to his agent was produced by the agent.

When a person is compelled to\n                                  testify on his/her own behalf, there is a higher likelihood of such testimony\n                                  being false. False testimony is undesirable since it impedes the integrity of\n                                  the trial and the subsequent verdict. Therefore, the purpose of the “rule\n                                  against involuntary confessions” is to ensure that the testimony\n                                  considered during trial is reliable. The premise is that involuntary\n                                  statements are more likely to mislead the Judge and the prosecutor,\n                                  thereby resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even during the investigative\n                                  stage, false statements are likely to cause delays and obstructions in the\n                                  investigation efforts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">                                          103. The concerns about the “voluntariness” of statements allow a\n                                  more comprehensive account of this right. If involuntary statements were\n                                  readily given weightage during trial, the investigators would have a\n                                  strong incentive to compel such statements—often through methods\n                                  involving coercion, threats, inducement or deception. Even if such\n                                  involuntary statements are proved to be true, the law should not\n                                  incentivise the use of interrogation tactics that violate the dignity and\n                                  bodily integrity of the person being examined. In this sense, “the right\n                                  against self-incrimination” is a vital safeguard against torture and other\n                                  “third-degree methods” that could be used to elicit information. It serves\n                                  as a check on police behaviour during the course of investigation. The\n                                  exclusion of compelled testimony is important otherwise the investigators\n                                  will be more inclined to extract information through such compulsion as a\n                                  matter of course.
