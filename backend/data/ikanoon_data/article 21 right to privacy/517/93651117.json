Both the sentences shall run concurrently.\n\n      The prosecution case, as alleged, against the appellant is to the effect that\n\non the basis of secret information the appellant was apprehended on 10th\n\nFebruary, 2012 at NSCBI Airport departure area while he was about to leave for\n\nHongkong via Dhaka availing flight no BG-092. He was intercepted while he was\n\nproceeding towards the immigration counter after obtaining his boarding pass.\n\nAs the movement of the appellant was suspicious he was detained by the Air\n\nIntelligence Unit (in short A.I.U) officials and was taken to A.I.U room for\n\ninterrogation. He voluntarily cancelled his journey. On interrogation, the\n\nappellant denied he was carrying any contraband. As the A.I.U officials were\n\nsuspicious due to the movements and/or behaviour of the appellant they did not\n\nrely on his version and made prayer before the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nBarasat to permit them to conduct X-ray of his abdomen.            After obtaining\n\npermission, he was taken to X-ray centre for conducting X-ray of his abdomen.\n\nOn receiving X-ray plate and report of the Radiologist, A.I.U officials found a\n suspicious white shadow in the abdomen of the appellant. The appellant was\n\nkept detained under surveillance at the A.I.U office. On 11.02.2012 in the\n\nmorning when he expressed desire to go to the toilet he was taken to the toilet at\n\nthe arrival area of the airport. From his stool allegedly 49 pieces of bullet shaped\n\ncapsules were recovered.     On examination of the said capsules some brown\n\ncolour sticky substance was found.      The substance was wrapped in insoluble\n\nplastic.   Contents of the capsules were tested with the detection kit and the\n\nmaterial tested positive for Hashish.    On 12.02.2012 the appellant was again\n\ntaken to X-ray centre and X-ray was done of his abdomen but nothing was\n\nfound. Total weight of the capsules including the contraband was 400 gms. The\n\nsaid contraband articles were seized and samples were drawn from the bulk.\n\nAfter serving of notice under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act, the statement of the\n\nappellant was recorded and on the basis of his statement he was arrested on\n\n13.02.2012</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">.

Charges were framed under the aforesaid\n\nsections against the appellant. He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">      In the course of trial, prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses and\n\nexhibited a number of documents including the purported voluntary statements\n\nof the appellant. The defence of the appellant was one of innocence and false\n\nimplication in the course of trial. The appellant retracted his statements during\n\ntrial claiming that he had been made to sign various blank papers during his\n\ndetention at the airport. In conclusion of trial, the trial judge by order dated 17th\n\nApril, 2017 convicted and sentenced the appellant, as aforesaid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"157584223\" id=\"span_1\">Mr. Singh, learned Counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the\n\nprocedure contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 103</a> of the Customs Act to recover\n\ncontraband articles secreted inside the body from a suspect has not been\n\nfollowed in the instant case. He submitted that no order was obtained from the\n\nMagistrate to recover the contraband secreted inside the body of the appellant in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 103 (6)</a> of the Act. No consent had also been taken from the\n\nappellant for such action to bring out the goods. Alleged recovery of contraband\n\nfrom the body of the appellant was not done in presence of a registered medical\n\npractitioner. It is further submitted that the mandatory provision of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 50</a> of\n\nthe N.D.P.S. Act had also not been followed. He further submitted that the\n\nstatements of the appellant while in the custody of the A.I.U officers were not\n\nvoluntary and the appellant had been made to sign in blank papers during his\n\ndetention at the airport. The appellant had retracted the statements during trial.\n\nHe also submitted that the said statements had not been proved in the facts of\n\nthe case. He relied on <a href=\"/doc/157584223/\" id=\"a_13\">Customs vs. Juarah &amp; Anr.</a>, 246 (2018) DLT 635. He\n\naccordingly prayed for acquittal.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      Mr. Banerjee, learned Counsel appearing for Union of India submitted that\n\nit would be evident from Ext.11 (statement of the appellant recorded on\n\n10.2.2012) that the appellant had agreed to have X-ray of his abdomen and due\n\npermission was also obtained from the Magistrate in that regard. X-ray report\n\nshowed that there was suspicious substance inside the stomach of the appellant\n\nand even before the authorities could obtain permission from the learned\n\nMagistrate, the appellant passed stool resulting in recovery of the capsules\n containing hashish. In the factual matrix of the case, the question of obtaining\n\npermission under <a href=\"/doc/179913/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 103 (6)</a> of the Customs Act did not arise. The appellant\n\nhad repeatedly admitted his guilt in his voluntary statements recorded on\n\n11.2.2012, Ext.18, on 12.2.2012, Ext.6 and on 13.2.2012, Ext.10. Hence, the\n\nappeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      P.W.1, Sisir Kr. Ghosh is the Superintendent of Customs (Preventive). He\n\ndeposed that on 10.2.2012 he was posted at A.I.U as Superintendent. On that\n\nday, he received a secret information and accordingly special watch was done in\n\nthe departure hall for passengers who were going to Hongkong by availing flight\n\nof Bangladesh Airlines. On the basis of source information the appellant was\n\nintercepted. He had already checked in and had obtained boarding pass. He was\n\nasked whether he was carrying any contraband either in his bag or in his person.\n\nHe replied in the negative. As his physical appearance and behaviour were\n\nsuspicious and they had specific information that he was carrying contraband,\n\nhe was detained in the room of A. I. U. He voluntarily cancelled his trip and\n\nexpressed willingness to remain with A.I.U officers. In the presence of two\n\nwitnesses, his body and baggage was searched but no incriminating article was\n\nfound. He did not accept that he was carrying contraband. He was produced\n\nbefore the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate and prayer was made to conduct X-\n\nray of his body. Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate granted permission.      The\n\nappellant was taken to X-ray Unit near Airport where X-ray of his whole abdomen\n\nwas done. From the X-ray report, it became clear that some suspicious article\n\nwas in his stomach. He was taken to the office of A.I.U. and was kept under\n surveillance. Next morning at 6.30 a.m. he wanted to relieve himself and he was\n\ntaken to the toilet. At that time two independent persons were called and in their\n\npresence and also in presence of officers, he passed stool on the floor of the toilet\n\nin the arrival hall. Along with the stool he ejected 49 bullet shaped capsules. The\n\ngross weight of the said capsules was 400 gms. Inside each capsule deep brown\n\ncolour sticky substance was found covered in insoluble plastic. The said sticky\n\nbrown substance was tested with drug detection kit and tested positive for\n\nHashish. The recovered articles were seized under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_15\">N. D. P.\n\nS. Act</a> as well as the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_16\">Customs Act</a>. The exact weight of the contraband capsules\n\nwas 375 gms. A search list was prepared and a Panchnama was also prepared.\n\nOn 12.2.2012 in the evening he was again taken to the same clinic for X-ray of\n\nhis abdomen. From the X-ray report, they came to know that there was no more\n\nforeign body in his abdomen. On 13.2.2012 in presence of the independent\n\nwitnesses two sets of samples containing four capsules each were prepared. Two\n\nsample packets and the packet containing the main bulk were sealed and\n\nlabelled and was duly signed by the witnesses, the accused and the officers of\n\nCustoms. The appellant was arrested under <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 43</a> of N. D. P. S. Act. On\n\n13.2.2012, he was produced before the Court and remanded to custody. He\n\nproved the petition which was filed before the Court, Ext.1 and his signature\n\nthereon. He proved the copy of the order of the Magistrate permitting X-ray on\n\nthe body of the appellant, Ext.2. X-ray was done on 10.2.2012 at the Airport X-\n\nray Clinic. As per report of X-ray, there was a suspicious white shadow in his\n\nabdomen. The report and the X-ray plate were marked Ext.3 collectively (with\n objection). On 11.2.2012, the appellant passed stool and ejected 49 bullet shape\n\ncapsules and thereafter another X-ray was done which showed no abnormality.\n\nX-ray report and the plate were marked as Ext.4 collectively (with objection).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      P.W.2, Subimal Dhara deposed that on 10.2.2012 he was posted at NSCBI\n\nAirport as Superintendent of Customs, A.I.U. He has corroborated the evidence of\n\nP.W.1 with regard to the apprehension of the appellant, conducting X-ray of his\n\nabdomen pursuant to the order of the learned Magistrate and the recovery of the\n\n49 pieces of bullet shaped capsules containing hashish from his excreta. On\n\n11.2.2012, he issued summons on the appellant for interrogation. He proved the\n\nsummons, Ext.5. In response to the summons, the accused made voluntary\n\nstatement which was typed by B. Bhattacharjee in his presence.

He proved the\n\nreport, Ext.14.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">        P.W.8 Amit Kumar Mishra was posted at NSCBI Airport as Customs\n\nOfficer. He lodged the complaint as per official records. The said complaint was\n\nmarked as Ext.15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">       P.W.9, Amitava Lahiri was posted at N.C.B.I. Airport at Air Intelligence Unit as Preventive\n\nOfficer. He has corroborated the evidence of interception of the appellant, the permission of\n\nlearned Magistrate making X-ray of the abdomen of the appellant and the recovery of 49 capsules\n\nfrom his stool on 11.02.2012. He also deposed that subsequent X-ray was conducted over the\n\nbody of the appellant. On 13.2.2012, he arrested the appellant. He further deposed that he was\n\npresent at the time of recording of statement of the appellant and he was directed to\n\ncommunicate the statement to the appellant in Hindi. He was not present at the time of recording\n\nof other statements. He proved the statement of the accused which was typed by him and read\n\nover to the appellant in Hindi (Ext18).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">       These are the evidences on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">       It is contended that 49 capsules containing charas were obtained from the stool of the\n\nappellant on 11.2.2012 at 6.30 A.M. while he was in the custody of A.I.U officials. I find that the\n\nappellant had been intercepted at N.C.B.I. Air Port by A.I.U Officials on 10.2.2012. It appears\n\nfrom their evidence that the appellant was interrogated but he denied that he was carrying any\n\ncontraband. His person as well as baggage and parcel were searched but no recovery could be\n\neffected. Owing to his suspicious conduct, A.I.U officers apprehended that the appellant was\n\ncarrying contraband. The A.I.U Officials wanted to subject the appellant to X-ray examination. It\n\nis contended on the selfsame day, a statement of the appellant was recorded (Ext.11) by P.W.4. In\n\nthe said statement, while denying that he was carrying contraband, the appellant agreed to\n\nsubject himself to an X-ray examination. Subsequently, prayer was made before the Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate for holding X-ray of the abdomen of the appellant. Application before the\n\nMagistrate and the order passed thereon have been duly exhibited. Pursuant to such permission\n\nX-ray was conducted of his abdomen at a nearby X-ray Centre and the X-ray report has sought to\n\nbe exhibited with objection in the instant case. It is pertinent to note that neither the Radiologist\n nor any person in charge of the aforesaid X-ray unit has been examined to prove the X-ray report\n\nor the X-ray plate. On the next morning, it is claimed that the appellant wanted to relieve himself\n\nand in the course of passing stool 49 capsules were ejected from his abdomen which contained\n\nblack sticky substance which tested positive for hashish. Capsules were seized and upon\n\nchemical examination tested positive to charas. It is relevant to note that no subsequent\n\npermission of the Magistrate was obtained to undertake suitable action under <a href=\"/doc/179913/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 103(6)</a> of\n\nthe Customs Act to recover contraband secreted inside the body of the accused. Furthermore,\n\nrecovery of the contraband was not before a registered medical practitioner. It has been\n\nstrenuously argued by the learned counsel for the Department that the capsules were ejected\n\nwhile the appellant was passing stool in normal course on the next morning. There was no scope\n\nfor obtaining permission of the learned Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 103(6)</a> of the Act. It has also\n\nbeen argued that the appellant had consented to holding X-ray of his abdomen in Ext.11. Not\n\nonly that in the voluntary statements namely Ext.6, 13 &amp; 18 he clearly admitted his guilt before\n\nthe A.I.U officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">        Let me examine the aforesaid issues raised in the instant case in the factual matrix of the\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">        Customs officers including the officers of the Air Intelligence Unit are empowered to\n\ninvestigate offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_20\">NDPS Act</a> and are vested with all the powers of an officer-in-charge\n\nof a police station for the purpose of such investigation in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1276310/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 53</a> of the NDPS Act.\n\nWhen a customs officer undertakes investigation of offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_22\">NDPS Act</a> he is not only\n\ngoverned by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_23\">Customs Act</a> but also by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_24\">NDPS Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">        Search of a person under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_25\">NDPS Act</a> is governed by <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 50</a> of the said Act.\n\n        However, the aforesaid provision relates to search of the physical body of a suspect and\n\ndoes not advert to the procedure which is to be adopted for an intrusive search inside the body of\n\nthe suspect like X-ray etc. Provision in that regard is delineated in <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 103</a> of the Customs\n\nAct which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;Power to screen or X-ray bodies of suspected persons for detecting secreted goods.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> (1)     Where the proper officer has reason to believe that any person referred to in\nsub-section (2) of section 100 has any goods liable to confiscation secreted inside\nhis body, he may detain such person and produce him without unnecessary delay\nbefore the nearest magistrate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(2)     A magistrate before whom any person is brought under sub-section (1) shall,\nif he sees no reasonable ground for believing that such person has any such goods\nsecreted inside his body, forthwith discharge such person.\n(3)     Where any such magistrate has reasonable ground for believing that such\nperson has any such goods secreted inside his body and the magistrate is satisfied\nthat for the purpose of discovering such goods it is necessary to have the body of\nsuch person screened or X-rayed, he may make an order to that effect.\n(4)     Where a magistrate has made any order under sub-section (3), in relation to\nany person, the proper officer shall, as soon as practicable, take such person before\na radiologist possessing qualifications recognized by the Central Government for the\npurpose of this section, and such person shall allow the radiologist to screen or X-\nray his body.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(5)     A radiologist before whom any person is brought under sub-section (4) shall,\nafter screening or X-raying the body of such person, forward his report, together\nwith any X-ray pictures taken by him, to the magistrate without unnecessary delay.\n(6)     Where on receipt of a report from a radiologist under sub-section (5) or\notherwise the magistrate is satisfied that any person has any goods liable to\nconfiscation secreted inside his body, he may direct that suitable action for bringing\nout such goods be taken on the advice and under the supervision of a registered\nmedical practitioner and such person shall be bound to comply with such direction:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      Provided that in the case of a female no such action shall be taken except on\nthe advice and under the supervision of a female registered medical practitioner.\n(7)     Where any person is brought before a magistrate under this section, such\nmagistrate may for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this section under\nsuch person to be kept in such custody and for such period as he may direct.\n(8)     Nothing in this section shall apply to any person referred to in such section\n(1), who admits that goods liable to confiscation are secreted inside his body, and\nwho voluntarily submits himself for suitable action being taken for bringing out\nsuch goods.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">         The aforesaid provision lays down the procedure that a customs officer is required to\n\nfollow to conduct X-ray of the body of the suspect for detecting and/or recovering contrabands\n\nsecreted inside his body.

The radiologist after conducting screening or\n\n                X-ray of the body shall forward the report along with X-ray plates to the Magistrate\n\n                without delay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">        (d)     On receipt of such report of the radiologist, the Magistrate upon recording\n\n                satisfaction that the suspect has goods secreted in his body which is liable to be\n\n                confiscated, shall direct suitable action for bringing out such goods on the advice\n\n                and under supervision of a registered medical practitioner. The suspect may be\n\n                kept in the custody pursuant to the order of the Magistrate for affecting such\n\n                recovery.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">        (e)     Such procedure may be waived when the suspect admits that he has secreted\n\n                contraband in his body and voluntarily submits himself to suitable action for\n\n                bringing out such contraband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">        The procedure described above calls for magisterial intervention not only for the purpose\n\nof holding X-ray of the body of the suspect but also requires magisterial permission for\n\nundertaking suitable action for recovery of the contraband secreted inside the body upon receipt\n\nof report of the radiologist.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"> Initial magisterial permission for conducting X-ray of the suspect is not a substitute of the\n\nsubsequent magisterial sanction for undertaking suitable action to bring out the contraband in\n\nthe presence of a registered medical practitioner upon receipt of the X-ray report. Accordingly,\n\nconsent of the suspect for conducting X-ray of his body cannot be treated to be a valid consent\n\nunder sub-Section (8) of Section 103 to waive the necessity of magisterial permission for\n\nundertaking suitable action for bringing out the contraband in presence of a doctor upon receipt\n\nof the X-ray report. Thus, consent of the appellant in Ext.11. to conduct X-ray in the instant case\n\ndoes not absolve the authorities to follow the procedure adumbrated in sub-sections (5) &amp; (6) of\n\nthe said section for bringing out the goods secreted inside the body of the suspect.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">       In the facts of the instant case, I find that the radiologist who purportedly conducted X-\n\nray of the abdomen of the suspect has neither been examined nor had he sent his report along\n\nwith X-ray plates to the Magistrate for suitable action as contemplated under the said provision of\n\nlaw. On the other hand, X-ray plates along with report of the radiologist were produced by P.W.1.\n\nRadiologist was not examined in the instant case and in my considered opinion it cannot be said\n\nthat the report of the radiologist along with X-ray plates was duly proved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">       It is trite law that mere production of a document is not proof of its contents. The\n\nradiologist who conducted the X-ray and prepared the report ought to have been examined to\n\nprove the same, more particularly when such report had not been admitted in the course of trial\n\nby the defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">       The opinion of the radiologist and the X-ray plates are the live-links between the\n\nreasonable belief of the officers and the discovery of contraband inside the body of the appellant\n\nwhich was subsequently alleged to be recovered. Failure to prove the said link, that is, discovery\n\nof contraband inside the body of the suspect beyond reasonable doubt snaps the chain\n\nculminating in the recovery of the said contraband from the excreta of the suspect and destroys\n\nthe very substratum of the prosecution case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">       In this backdrop, I hold that the prosecution has failed to prove that it had followed the\n\nprocedure laid down under <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 103</a> of the Customs Act for recovery of contraband secreted\n\ninside the body of the appellant. I have already discussed why the purported consent recorded in\n Ext. 11 is not a valid consent under <a href=\"/doc/1969615/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 103(8)</a> of the Customs Act. Such consent was for the\n\npurpose of holding X-ray of the body of appellant and would not absolve the responsibility of the\n\nauthorities under <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 103</a> of the Customs Act from forwarding the report of the radiologist to\n\nthe Magistrate and proving the same in accordance with law before undertaking suitable action in\n\nterms of magisterial permission for recovery of contraband secreted inside the body of the\n\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">       Finally, it has been argued that as the recovery of the narcotic substance secreted inside\n\nthe body of the appellant was in ordinary course of passing stool and that too in the morning of\n\nthe very next day after radiological examination was conducted, there was no scope for obtaining\n\nof order under <a href=\"/doc/179913/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 103(6)</a> of the Customs Act. Procedure entailing recovery of Narcotics/\n\ncontraband from the body of the suspect requires invasion into the physical body of the suspect\n\nand an encroachment into his privacy. Such exercise being invasive in nature must not only be in\n\nstrict compliance of statutory safeguards as contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 103</a> of the Customs Act but\n\nalso must be in consonance to the dignity of the suspect and ought not involve any cruel,\n\ndegrading or inhuman treatment lest such procedure runs fowl of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_34\">Selvi v. State of Karnataka</a>, (2010) 7 SCC 263, the Apex Court held that invasive\n\ninvestigational techniques like lie detection tests, brain mapping etc. are not only violative of right\n\nagainst self-incrimination under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 20(3)</a> but also an infringement of mental privacy and\n\ndignity as they amount to cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_3\">It is also no longer res integra that privacy of an individual is a fundamental right\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution [see <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_38\">Justice K.S Puttaswamy (Retd) and Anr. vs. Union Of\n\nIndia</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1]. Hence, &quot;suitable action&quot; contemplated in sub section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_39\">section 103</a>\n\nof the Customs Act for recovery of contraband inside the body of a suspect must not only be in\n\naccordance with the procedure established by law but also be compatible to the dignity of the\n\nindividual and ought not subject him to cruel, inhuman treatment. Admittedly in the instant\n\ncase, radiologist&#x27;s report was not forwarded to the magistrate nor the latter&#x27;s permission obtained\n\nfor undertaking suitable action for bringing out the contraband from the body of the appellant.\n\nOn the other hand, appellant was kept detained in the A.I.U office under surveillance till it is\n claimed that he defecated resulting in ejection of the contraband. It is contended as the ejection\n\nof the contraband was through normal metabolic process compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1617500/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 103</a> of the\n\nCustoms Act was neither applicable nor feasible. It appears from the evidence of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses that on receipt of X-ray report, the appellant was kept under surveillance at the A.I.U\n\noffice till he defecated on the next morning allegedly ejecting the contraband from his body.\n\nPerusal of the order dated 10.02.12 of the Magistrate permitting X-ray of the abdomen of the\n\nappellant shows that the A.I.U officers were directed to produce the appellant with X-ray report\n\nimmediately after screening and the officers were directed to extend medical aid to the appellant\n\nwhile in detention. Although X-ray was done on that day, no explanation is forthcoming why the\n\nappellant with the said report was not produced before the Magistrate on that day itself. Further,\n\nthe appellant was not under medical supervision where he was under surveillance at the A.I.U\n\noffice in spite of direction for medical aid given by the Magistrate. Hence the procedure followed\n\nby the A.I.U officials in keeping the appellant under surveillance in their office without producing\n\nhim before the Magistrate immediately upon screening on the selfsame day and/or failing to\n\nextend medical supervision to him during his detention and alleged recovery while in their\n\ncustody is not only violative of the statutory scheme but also an infringement of his fundamental\n\nright to just, fair and humane procedure contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n\nApart from the aforesaid infractions of law, the alleged recovery of contraband in the instant case\n\nappears to have been made shrouded in secrecy and is sought to be proved only on the basis of\n\nthe uncorroborated version of the A.I.U officials. Although P.W. 1 claimed that such recovery was\n\nmade in the presence of two independent witnesses, no independent witness was examined to\n\nprove such fact. Entire process of alleged recovery took place within the closed confines of the\n\nA.I.U office while the appellant was in the custody of the said officials. No medical aid or\n\nsupervision was extended to him during his detention or at the time of alleged recovery. Hence, I\n\nam of the opinion that it is most unsafe to rely on the mere ipse dixit of the A.I.U officials to come\n\nto a finding that narcotic substance was recovered from the excreta of the appellant particularly\n\nwhen such exercise was done without magisterial permission, bereft of medical supervision and\n\nwas not supported by independent witnesses.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">        Lastly, coming to the purported statements of the appellant recorded on 11.2.2012\n\n(Ext.18), 12.2.2012 (Ext.6) and 13.2.2012 (Ext.10), I find that none of the said statements relied\n\nby the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Ext. 18 was purportedly recorded\n\non 11.2.2012 in the presence of P.W.9 (Amitava Lahiri) and P.W.5 (S. Bhattacharya). Although\n\nP.W.9 claims that he recorded and read over the said statement to the appellant in Hindi, his\n\nversion is not corroborated by P.W.5 (S. Bhattacharya). With regard to the purported statement\n\nrecorded on 12.2.2012 (Ext.6) I note that there are number of discrepancies. P.W.2, who claimed\n\nto be present at the time of recording of the statement, stated that it is not mentioned in the\n\nstatement in which language the appellant made such statement. It is also not recorded in the\n\nstatement that the appellant had made such statement voluntarily. P.W.5, the recording officer,\n\ndid not state in his deposition that he had read over and explained the statement to the accused,\n\nwho did not know to read or write English (the language in which the statement was written). It is\n\nalso important to note that an independent witness, who is claimed to have been present at the\n\ntime of recording of the said statement and had allegedly read over and explained the same to the\n\nappellant, has not been examined in the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">       Finally, with regard to Ext. 13 I find that the said statement has not been proved at all.\n\nOnly the signature of one of the A.I.U officials namely, P.W.3 (Debasish Chowdhury) endorsed\n\nthereon had been proved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">It has been argued that the aforesaid statements had not been retracted promptly by the\n\nappellant. I find that during his examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_42\">section 313</a> CrPC, the appellant had stated\n\nthat he was made to sign blank papers while in custody. It is contended that he was unaware\n\nthat such signed papers had been converted into statements purportedly made by him. However,\n\nit is evident from the trend of cross-examination as well as his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 313</a>\n\nCr.P.C. that he had disowned making the said statements and had retracted them during trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">       Be that as it may, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the purported voluntary\n\nstatements of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt in order to enable the court to come to a\n\nfinding of guilt on the sole basis of such statements. The aforesaid discussion of the evidence of\n the prosecution witnesses with regard to the said statements leaves no doubt in one&#x27;s mind that\n\nthe evidence in that regard is too flimsy and contradictory to inspire confidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">           Hence, I hold that the aforesaid statements claimed to be made by the appellant have not\n\nbeen proved beyond reasonable doubt and I do not consider it prudent to rely on such statements\n\nto come to a finding of guilt against the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">Conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant is, accordingly, set aside.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">           The appeal is allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">           Application being CRAN 5540 of 2017 is also disposed of.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">           Appellant shall be released from custody forthwith upon execution of a\n\nbond to the satisfaction of the trial court which shall continue for six months in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 437A</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">           Copy of the judgment along with LCR be sent down to the trial court at once for necessary\n\ncompliance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">           Urgent Photostat Certified copy of this order, if applied for, be supplied\nexpeditiously after complying with all necessary legal formalities.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">                                                                         (Joymalya Bagchi, J.)\n\nI agree.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n(Ravi Krishan Kapur, J.)\n </p>","numcites":18,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Calcutta High Court (Appellete Side)","citetid":93651117,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"ndps act","formInput":"ndps%20act"},{"value":"customs act 103","formInput":"customs%20act%20103"},{"value":"section 103 customs act","formInput":"section%20103%20customs%20act"},{"value":"NDPS","formInput":"NDPS"},{"value":"joymalya bagchi","formInput":"joymalya%20bagchi"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"air intelligence unit","formInput":"air%20intelligence%20unit"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"registered medical practitioner","formInput":"registered%20medical%20practitioner"},{"value":" charas","formInput":"%20charas"},{"value":"retraction","formInput":"retraction"},{"value":"narcotic drug","formInput":"narcotic%20drug"},{"value":"dignity","formInput":"dignity"},{"value":"ejectment ","formInput":"ejectment%20"},{"value":"Hindi","formInput":"Hindi"},{"value":"Airport","formInput":"Airport"},{"value":"customs act","formInput":"customs%20act"},{"value":"Ndps  filter:  judgement of high court","formInput":"Ndps%20%20filter%3A%20%20judgement%20of%20high%20court"},{"value":"How to prove Statement ","formInput":"How%20to%20prove%20Statement%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"law-governing-narcotics","formInput":"tag:law-governing-narcotics"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"conditions-for-search-of-persons","formInput":"tag:conditions-for-search-of-persons"},{"value":"examine-accused","formInput":"tag:examine-accused"},{"value":"law-governing-customs","formInput":"tag:law-governing-customs"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
