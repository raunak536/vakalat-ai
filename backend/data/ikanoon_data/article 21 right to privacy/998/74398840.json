Let it be recorded at the outset that in this batch of six\n\n       writ applications, earlier five of them were tagged and heard on\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n                                           4/53\n\n\n\n\n       different dates by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench as per the then\n\n       Roster. In the light of the change of Roster, these writ applications\n\n       were listed before this Court. Vide order dated 18.04.2023 passed\n\n       by the learned predecessor Court, CWJC No. 2808 of 2023\n\n       (Shivram Singh Vs. The State of Bihar and Others) has also been\n\n       tagged with the lead case being C.W.J.C. No. 3456 of 2020. In this\n\n       case no counter affidavit on behalf of the State Bank of India has\n\n       been filed, hence, this Court thinks it just and proper to de-tag\n\n       this case from the batch of cases in which the Bank and Finance\n\n       Companies have taken a stand by filing a counter affidavit. It is\n\n       once again placed on record that in C.W.J.C. No.3456 of 2021 and\n\n       C.W.J.C. No. 8056 of 2022 the same and one Finance Company is\n\n       the contesting respondent. Counter affidavit has been filed in\n\n       C.W.J.C. No. 3456 of 2021 and the same stand has been taken in\n\n       both the cases.\n\n                  3. On the request of learned counsel for the parties, all\n\n       these writ applications have been taken up together and are being\n\n       disposed of by this common judgment.\n\n                  Brief facts of the case\n\n                  4. In all these writ applications, the petitioners are\n\n       aggrieved by the action of the contesting respondents, namely, Tata\n\n       Motor Finance Limited, IndusInd Bank Limited, Shri Ram Finance\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n                                           5/53\n\n\n\n\n       Company, ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India. Their common\n\n       grievance is that their respective vehicles which they had\n\n       purchased with the financial assistance from these institutions have\n\n       been forcibly seized with the help of goons and musclemen of the\n\n       contesting respondents during odd hours.\n\n                   5. In CWJC No. 3456 of 2021, the allegations is that the\n\n       vehicle was forcibly seized in the month of February, 2020 but the\n\n       petitioner got the same released after payment of Rs.3,80,000/-. It\n\n       is stated that soon thereafter the unprecedented pandemic Covid-\n\n       19 came because of which the entire country went under a\n\n       lockdown as a result of which the vehicle could not be run during\n\n       the period 23.03.2020 to 03.06.2020 so no installment was paid for\n\n       this period. It is stated that this was the exempted period declared\n\n       by the Government of India but the Financer (respondent no. 4)\n\n       seized the truck near village Rahnam through two persons, namely,\n\n       L.H. Pandit and Kavindra Tiwary along with some goons who\n\n       were armed. The truck was taken away. It is stated that a sum of\n\n       Rs.40,000/- was lying in the upper box of the vehicle as the\n\n       vehicle was returning after sale of sand of Rs.50,000/-. The driver\n\n       reported the matter to the petitioner whereafter the petitioner\n\n       contacted L.H. Pandit and Kavindra Tiwary but they did not take\n\n       any care.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n                                           6/53\n\n\n\n\n                   6. It is the case of the petitioner that he had invested\n\n       Rs.3,00,000/- as down payment against the price of the chasis plus\n\n       Rs.3,00,000/- in construction of truck body and had also paid a\n\n       sum of Rs.9,31,000/- as installment. The dues during the Covid\n\n       period against the petitioner was only Rs.2,15,500/- for which the\n\n       vehicle in which the petitioner had invested Rs.17,31,000/- was\n\n       seized with the use of arms.\n\n                   7. Petitioners have relied upon a judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n       Supreme Court in the case of ICICI Bank Vs. Shanti Devi\n\n       Sharma &amp; Ors arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 4935 of 2006\n\n       reported in (2008) 7 SCC 532 in which the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n       Court has held such action of the Bank illegal. The petitioner has\n\n       also relied upon the judgment of this Court in case of Sujay\n\n       Kumar Vs. Uco Bank reported in 2020(1) PLJR 583 wherein this\n\n       Court has declared the seizure of this nature illegal and ordered the\n\n       financial institution to return the vehicle to the owner with liberty\n\n       to claim damage by the owner. This Court also held that the\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_1\">Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\n\n       Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002</a> (hereinafter referred to\n\n       as the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_2\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a>&#x27; or &#x27;Act of 2002&#x27;). and the Rules\n\n       framed thereunder are to be followed in the matter of seizure of the\n\n       vehicles.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n                                           7/53\n\n\n\n\n                  8. In CWJC No. 16155 of 2021, the case of the petitioner\n\n       is that he had got a financial assistance of Rs.10,00,000/- from the\n\n       Bank. He was paying the Equal Monthly Installment (EMI) of the\n\n       said vehicle properly, it was lastly deposited on 29.06.2021. The\n\n       Bank had taken post-dated cheques from the petitioner to secure\n\n       the loan of Rs.10,00,000/- but even as the petitioner was\n\n       depositing EMI, the Bank got bounced the cheque without any\n\n       notice to the petitioner. It is his case that during pandemic period,\n\n       four installments of EMI became due. For this reason, it is stated\n\n       that the vehicle in question has been pulled down/seized while it\n\n       was on way. The respondent bank neither followed the procedure\n\n       prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_3\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a> and rules framed\n\n       thereunder nor gave any notice to the petitioner seeking to re-\n\n       possess the vehicle. The petitioner tried to approach the authorities\n\n       of the bank but they did not hear the grievance of the petitioner.\n\n                  9. In CWJC No. 19461 of 2021, the grievance of the\n\n       petitioner is that his truck bearing no. BR 53G-1698 was seized\n\n       forcibly and illegally by the goons of the respondent bank during\n\n       the pandemic period on 02.09.2021. The petitioner has paid the\n\n       installments during the period 21.11.2018 to 31.01.2021 which\n\n       comes to a sum of Rs.20,51,400/-, out of which the petitioner had\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n                                           8/53\n\n\n\n\n       already paid Rs.20,11,200/-, thus, only a sum of Rs.40,200/- was\n\n       due in January, 2021.\n\n                  10. It is stated that during the pandemic period, the\n\n       Government of India as well as the Reserve Bank of India had\n\n       given instruction not to take any coercive measure besides giving a\n\n       moratorium period of six months. It is stated that in this case, the\n\n       Bank issued a notice dated 20.09.2021 under <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 13(2)</a> of the\n\n       SARFAESI Act, 2002 to declare the property as Non-Performing\n\n       Asset (NPA) but the notice reached five days after the posting. The\n\n       vehicle had already been re-possessed on 02.09.2021. The\n\n       petitioner, in response to the notice wrote to the Bank on\n\n       27.09.2021</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\"> vide Annexures &#x27;2&#x27;, &#x27;2A&#x27; and &#x27;3&#x27; to the writ application\n\n       and informed that he was ready to pay the real dues.

Once we have arrived at this understanding of\n                      the nature of fundamental rights, we can dismantle a\n                      core assumption of the Union&#x27;s argument : that a\n                      right must either be a common law right or a\n                      fundamental right. The only material distinctions\n                      between the two classes of right--of which the\n                      nature and content may be the same--lie in the\n                      incidence of the duty to respect the right and in the\n                      forum in which a failure to do so can be redressed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                      Common law rights are horizontal in their operation\n                      when they are violated by one&#x27;s fellow man, he can\n                      be named and proceeded against in an ordinary\n                      court of law.

In the light of the aforementioned discussion, lwhen\n\n       this Court considers the facts of these cases, it is noticed that these\n\n       petitioners are essentially complaining of violation of their\n\n       fundamental rights to earn their livelihood with dignity. They are\n\n       complaining         of &#x27;deprivation&#x27;           in the hands of the contesting\n\n       respondents without following the law and by use of force which\n\n       cannot be permitted in a State governed by rule of law. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a>\n\n       of the Constitution of India guarantees every person that he shall\n\n       not be deprived of his life and liberty except according to the\n\n       procedure established by law.

In these cases, it is alleged that the contesting\n\n       respondents have forcibly seized the vehicles while they are on\n\n       way. Admittedly the petitioners are the owners of the vehicle, they\n\n       have borrowed loan. In one of the cases, the bus passengers were\n\n       compelled to de-board the bus on way and then the vehicle was\n\n       repossessed.       While      doing     so,    admittedly,   the   contesting\n\n       respondents have not taken recourse to the provisions of the\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_50\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a> and the Rules framed thereunder. The\n\n       deprivation, in the present case, is not only by way of violation of\n\n       the established procedure of law but is also against the human\n\n       dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                    36. To this Court, there is no iota of doubt that the action\n\n       of the contesting respondents is in contravention of the\n\n       fundamental policy of the Indian Law and it is in conflict with the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                          27/53</span>\n\n\n\n\n       most basic notions of justice.

Corollary to this is as to\n\n       whether the contesting respondents have any Constitutional\n\n       obligation not to act in violation of law or in other words not to act\n\n       in conflict with the fundamental principles and policy of India in\n\n       the matter of seizure of movable or immovable properties by a\n\n       finance company which are contained in a legislative enactment\n\n       such as <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_56\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a> and the rules framed thereunder.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                    39. To this Court, it appears that the contesting\n\n       respondents while seeking their private power to recover the loan\n\n       by repossessing the vehicle can exercise their rights only within\n\n       the constitutional limitations. A law such as <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_57\">SARFAESI Act, 2002</a>\n\n       is a complete code unto itself and even the RBI guidelines have\n\n       given much emphasis that where Banks have incorporated a\n\n       repossessions clause in the contract with the borrower and rely on\n\n       such repossession clause for enforcing their rights, they should\n\n       ensure that the repossessions clause is legally valid, comply with\n\n       the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_58\">Indian Contract Act</a> in letters and spirit and\n\n       ensure that such repossession clause is clearly brought to the\n\n       notice of the borrower at the time of execution of the contract.\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                          29/53</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                    40.

Again only after an year in the case Shanti Devi\n\n       Sharma (supra) which was a case against the ICICI Bank, the\n\n       Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court noticed the facts of the case wherein the\n\n       motorcycle of the husband of the respondent was repossessed by\n\n       the Bank through it&#x27;s recovery agent by use of force whereafter he\n\n       was carrying the vegetables on his back and the members of the\n\n       neighbourhood allegedly made snide comments. This led to the\n\n       husband of the respondent committing suicide as he could not face\n\n       such a humiliation and discourage in his life.               The Hon&#x27;ble\n\n       Supreme Court observed in paragraph 12 as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                       &quot;12. <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_66\">The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial\n                       Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002</a>\n                       (SARFAESI) and the Security Interest (Enforcement)\n                       Rules, 2002 (SIER) framed thereunder provide some of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.3456 of 2021 dt.19-05-2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                          37/53</span>\n\n\n\n\n                       the procedures by which security interests may be\n                       recovered.
