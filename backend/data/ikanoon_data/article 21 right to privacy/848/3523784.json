In view of the above, the aforesaid matters were thus adjourned and listed\ntoday for further hearing.Since, the cause of action has arisen from the same\nRTI application and orders of CPIO and FAA, therefore all the above matters\nare clubbed together in the interest of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">Hearing:\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.

The written submissions of the parties are taken on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_2\">6.     The Counsels for the IDBI Bank &amp;ICICI Bank has referred the reply\nprovided by CPIO and order passed by the FAA and submitted that the CPIO,\nRBI and FAA had violated the principles of natural justice, as they had not\ngiven any personal hearing to the Appellant Bank before passing their decisions\nin the matter. No reasons were given for not offering personal hearing in the\nfirst appeal. The counsel for the appellant prayed before the Commission that\nthe FAA order should be set-aside for want of reasons. The FAA in its order has\nmentioned that the interim order passed in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_3\">Reserve Bank of India vs. Jayantilal\nMistry &amp; Ors.</a> would apply only to those banks which are parties to the petition,\nnamely, HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank Limited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank\nLimited and State Bank of India. As the appellant bank i.e. IDBI Bank was not a\nparty <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_4\">in that case</a>, it would not be possible for the appellant to take benefit of\nthat order.He further submitted that the information sought by the RTI applicant\nwas completely exempted as the information sought includes commercial\ninformation received in fiduciary capacity, disclosure of information sought is\nspecifically prohibited under various legislations and is specifically exempted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/26532/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8 (1)(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8 (l) (d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(h)</a> of the RTI Act. The\ndisclosure of personal/ commercial information of the banks and its customers\nviolated the right to privacy as guaranteed under the Right to life as enshrined\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Such disclosure would cause\nserious prejudice to the market value and reputation of the Appellant Bank and\nits customers. The Counsel has further referred the Full Bench judgment of this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       Page 3 of 10</span>\n Hon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors.\nvide order dated 05.05.2022 wherein an identical issue of disclosure of\nInspection Report, has remanded the matters to the CPIO for fresh adjudication\nby keeping in mind principles of natural justice. Moreover, considering the fact\nthat several banks have filed inter alia Writ Petition No. 1159 of 2019&amp; Ors\ntagged with it before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court inter-alia impugning the\ndisclosure of their Inspection Reports or parts thereof by the RBI under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI\nAct</a>, this Hon&#x27;ble Commission has also held that any decision by the CPIO in\nrespect of disclosure of Inspection Report would amount to pre-judging the\nissues pending the admitted Writ Petition (s) before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.     The representative of the Reserve Bank of India while presenting their\ncase inter alia submitted that the applicants vide above RTI applications inter\nalia, sought, copy of Inspection Reports from year 2011-2018. They further\nsubmitted that the then CPIO issued the notice under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11(1)</a> read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_12\">(RTI Act</a>) to the third party\ni.e. appellant banks informing that RBI was required to disclose the information\nsought by the above applicants, enabling appellant banks to make written\nsubmission as to whether the information sought by the applicants might be\ndisclosed or not along with reasons for the same. After considering the response\nfrom Appellant Banks, the CPIO decided to disclose the detail of Inspection\nReports from year 2011-2018 to the applicants. He further submitted that the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in RBI vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry &amp; Ors (2016) 3 SCC\n525 observed that :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;RBI is clearly not in any fiduciary relationship with any bank. RBI\n      ought to act with transparency and not hide information that might\n      embarrass individual banks. It is duty bound to comply with the\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_13\">RTI Act</a> and disclose the information sought by the\n      applicant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">The FAA observed that the interim order would apply only to those banks\nwhich are parties to the Petition, namely HDFC Bank Limited, Axis Bank\nLimited, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank Limited and State Bank of India. The appellant\nbank i.e. IDBI Bank was not a party in the aforementioned matters.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                      Page 4 of 10</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> Accordingly, it would not be possible for them to take advantage of the interim\norder dated 18.12.2019 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_5\">8.     The RTI applicant i.e. Shri Girish Mittal submitted that the respondent\nReserve Bank of India was duty bound to disclose the information sought by the\napplicant in his RTI application as per <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_14\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case. He stated that the\nReserve Bank of India was creator of reports and it acted as a guardian of public\ninterest. Banks worked in the interest of public and it was the public money that\nhad been invested in banks, therefore, there was a larger public interest in\ndisclosing the information. Therefore, as per the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India dated 16.12.2015 and as per order dated 28.04.2021 complete\ninformation should be disclosed to the RTI applicant.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_6\">He stated that there was\nno ambiguity in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_15\">Jayantilal Mistry</a>&#x27;s case and there was a larger public interest\nin disclosing the information.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"47938967\" id=\"span_7\">He further referred to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court bearing Review Petition (C) No. 2309/2012 in W. P (C) No.\n210/2012 <a href=\"/doc/47938967/\" id=\"a_16\">Union of India vs. Namit Sharma</a>, he relied on para nos. 20 to 23 of\n<a href=\"/doc/47938967/\" id=\"a_17\">the said judgment</a> and submitted that Central Information Commission, is\ndischarging only administrative function and it cannot bring any judicial colour\nto the matters before it. He also submitted that reliance on the decision of the\nCentral Information Commission in the case CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 or\nany such matter would be &quot;per incuriam.&quot; The law <a href=\"/doc/47938967/\" id=\"a_18\">laid down by</a> Supreme\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 141</a> of Constitution is binding on all authorities. That a bare\nreading of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court&#x27;s judgments in Jayantilal Mistry &amp;\nGirish Mittal make it amply clear that it is the legal duty of the RBI to disclose\nthe inspection reports of the banks as and when asked for under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_20\">RTI Act</a>.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Decision:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">9.     The Commission, after hearing the submissions of both the parties and\nafter perusal of records, observes that the original applicants has sought detail of\nInspection Reports made by Reserve Bank post completing the inspection, inter\nalia, pertaining to IDBI Bank i.e. appellant herein and 6 other banks (as\nmentioned in RTI Application) from the year 2011-2018. The CPIO, Reserve\nBank of India issued notices under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1782452/\" id=\"a_22\">11(3)</a> to the respecting\nbanks mentioned above intending to disclose the information. Aggrieved by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                         Page 5 of 10</span>\n decision of the CPIO, the said banks had filed first appeals with the First\nAppellate Authority. The FAA had also dismissed the first appeals of the banks\nsummarily. Being aggrieved with the order of the FAA, banks had filed second\nappeals before this Commission.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">10. The Commission observes that the RTI applicants had insisted for\ndisclosure of information as per Jayantilal N. Mistry&#x27;s case. The Appellant\nBanks contested that the information sought as a whole is exempted from\ndisclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(1)(d)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_24\">8(1)(e)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_25\">8 (1)(h)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_26\">8(1)(j)</a>of the RTI Act and\nthat the CPIO/FAA has not passed any reasoned order settling their objections\nnor gave any opportunity of hearing to them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"47938967\" id=\"span_9\">11. As far as the judgment relied on by the original applicant Mr. Girish\nMittal in his submissions in the case of <a href=\"/doc/47938967/\" id=\"a_27\">Union of India vs. Namit Sharma</a>\nbearing Review Petition (C) No. 2309/2012 in W. P (C) No. 210/2012 is\nconcerned, the Commission has gone through the contents of the said case\ncarefully and observed that the said case has no relevance in these matters as\nCentral Information Commission is primarily an Appellate Quasi-Judicial Court\nand not the original authority to decide the RTI Application. The Commission\nonly adjudicates the matter on the decision of the CPIO and FAA, only on the\nissue as to whether the information as sought should be disclosed to the\napplicant or not in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">RTI Act</a> and guidance from the\norders of higher judicial courts on such issues.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">12. The Commission further observes that the CPIO while issuing notice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act has given the opportunity to the Banks to file\ntheir objections, if any, against disclosure of Inspection Reports/Audit Reports,\netc. but has not found it necessary to give them an opportunity of hearing. While\nnot doing so, the CPIO has not passed any reasoned order covering his\ndeliberations on their objections, his understanding of law or jurisprudence in\ndeciding specific objections, in favor of disclosure or redaction etc. Orders\npassed by the CPIO in all the cases are cryptic, almost identical without any\nreference to objections raised by the Banks which are definitely not identical.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">Similarly, the FAA instead of passing a speaking order has also given cryptic,\nalmost identical orders to the appellant banks. The CPIO and the FAA are\nexpected to apply their mind before issuing the order of intent of disclosing the\ninformation. Further, no opportunity of personal hearing was given to the\nappellant nor speaking order have been passed by FAA for not giving\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                       Page 6 of 10</span>\n opportunity of hearing or elaborating reasons for accepting /not accepting their\nobjections in his decisions in these appeals. The Commission is of the view that\nevery objection should be dealt and rejected/accepted with a reason and reasons\nfor not giving opportunity of personal hearing should be well reasoned too in\nview of wider implications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">13. The Commission observes that rightful claims of the RTI applicants has\nto be adjudicated in the light of specific objections filed by the Institution,\nvarious judicial pronouncements of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and High Courts\nproviding guidance on such matters. Opportunity of hearing should generally be\nprovided and orders passed by the CPIO and the FAA otherwise if denied or not\ngiven be reasoned, speaking and clear. In the present case, order by CPIO\nshould enumerate the principles for disclosure or non-disclosure of inspection\nreports or part thereof which may include personal information, commercially\nsensitive information of clients or institution and hence specifically excluded\ndisclosures under various Acts, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">14. In light of the above observations and considering all the facts and\ncircumstances of the above mentioned cases, the Commission is of the view that\ncontour of the arguments are identical as held in the Full Bench judgment of this\nHon&#x27;ble Commission passed in file no. CIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460&amp; Ors. vide\norder dated 05.05.2022. It has been observed that there are minor variations in\nthe matters in hand when compared with the matters already decided by the\nCommission as above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_11\">15. It has already been stated supra that detailed view in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022 wherein issues of\nredaction, ratio of <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_30\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case and other related issues are discussed\nin detail. Perusal of the relevant paragraphs in Jayantilal Mistry judgment make\nit clear that the fundamental rights enshrined upon the citizens in form of right\nto information are not absolute and that the right to information may not draw\nprecedence over right to privacy. Therefore, the Courts need to strike a balance\nbetween the rights as well as protections guaranteed to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19</a>\nof the Constitution. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has held that the disclosure\nof information relating to banks may be allowed taking into account the\ncircumstances and nature of information sought for and not in a blanket manner.\nThe Commission advised the CPIO to consider taking the relevant references\nfrom the said order while deciding the above mentioned cases.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                       Page 7 of 10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_13\">16. Further, the Commission has already outlined the deficiency in the\nconduct of the CPIO/FAA while hearing such matters and hence is of the\nopinion that due care has to be taken by according opportunity of personal\nhearing and making reasoned order with reference to the objections in the hands\nof the CPIO and later in the hands of FAA, if any appeal is preferred. Hence, the\nCPIO will be required to adjudicate such RTI applications in the light of the\nobservations of the Commission afresh. The Commission also expects that the\nCPIO will take view on various objections filed by the Appellant and\nsubmissions made by applicant to reach the decision in favor or against on case\nto case basis. He has to factor the observation of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_32\">Jayantilal Mistry</a> case, Commission&#x27;s judgment dated 05.05.2022 and other\nrelevant judgments, some of which have been referred in this order as well.\nHence, with these observations the order passed by the CPIO and FAA in these\nmatters is set aside and the case is being remanded to the CPIO for adjudication\nafresh in line with the Commission full bench decision passed in file nos.\nCIC/RBIND/A/2021/152460 &amp; Ors. dated 05.05.2022. In case, the\nappellant/applicant is aggrieved with the order of the CPIO, they are at the\nliberty to file first appeal before the First Appellate Authority and afterwards\nsecond appeal before the Commission.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">17. Furthermore, since the original applicants has sought the requested\ninformation regarding various banks, however few of them have approached the\nCommission through present second appeals and second appeals, if filed, by the\nother banks are not known to the Commission.
