Act No.17 of 1986 has amended the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Stamp Act, \n1899</a> in its application to the State of Andhra Pradesh.  <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_12\">The Act</a> was \nreserved by the Government of A.P. on 24th April, 1986 for the \nconsideration and assent of the President and received such assent on \n17th July, 1986 which was published in the Andhra Pradesh gazette for \ngeneral information on 22nd July, 1986. Out of the several \namendments made by the A.P. Act 17 of 1986, the relevant one for \nour purpose is <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 73</a> as substituted in place of the original <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_14\">Section \n73</a> of the Indian Stamp Act by Section 6 of A.P.

The State of \nAndhra Pradesh in doing so was inspired by the amendments made in \nthe State of Karnataka.  As to <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 73</a> the SOR states &quot;As per \n<a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 73</a> of the said Act, the Collector or any person authorized by \nhim shall inspect any public office and the public officer having in his \ncustody any registers, books, records etc., shall permit him to take \ncopies of extracts of those records.  However, the inspecting officer \ncannot seize the deficitly stamped documents and impound the same \nduring inspection.  On account of this loophole, the inspecting officers \nare not able to seize and impound the deficitly stamped documents \nand collect the deficit stamp revenue.  It has therefore been decided to \nempower the Inspecting Officers to enter any premises and seize the \ndocuments and impound them.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">[For a detailed Statement of Objects and Reasons see The Andhra \nPradesh Gazette Extraordinary Part IV-A dated March 20, 1986 pp. 9 \u0016\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">11.]\n\nThe  A.P.

Out of \nthese, 11 were by different banks.  A few writ petitions were filed by \ninstitutions, corporate or incorporate bodies and a few were filed by \nsugar companies.  The grievances arose because the documents \nexecuted between private parties and received and retained in the \ncustody of the bank in ordinary course of their loan advancing \ntransactions were inspected and then the banks were served with a \nrequest to remit the amount of deficit duty on the documents \ninspected and to recover the same from the parties concerned.  The \ngrievance of the sugar companies is that in the course of their \nbusiness they were entering into agreements with the sugarcane \ngrowers selling sugarcane to the sugar companies in compliance with \nthe provisions of A.P. Sugarcane Control Order, 1965 in the proforma \nprescribed by Control Order.  Several agreements entered into in the \nprescribed proforma were treated as unstamped (though they were \nnot liable to be stamped, in the submission of sugar companies) and \ntherefore were sought to be impounded.  The grievance of private \npersons is that the documents in their possession are sought to be \ninspected, impounded and levied with duty though they were not \ntendered in evidence nor produced before any public office.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">A perusal of the judgment of the High Court shows that in \nholding the impugned <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 73</a> of the Act ultra vires of the \nConstitution and other provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_35\">Indian Stamp Act</a>, the High \nCourt has arrived at four findings: firstly, that the amended <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 73</a> \nis inconsistent with the other provisions of the Act; secondly, that the \nprovision is violative of the principles of natural justice; thirdly, the \nprovision is arbitrary and unreasonable and hence violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Article \n14</a> of the Constitution; and fourthly, there are no guidelines provided \nfor the exercise of power by the authorized persons under the \namended <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 73</a> which is either arbitrary and unreasonable or \nvitiated on account of excessive delegation of statutory powers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\"> \tDuring the course of hearing Mrs. K. Amareswari, the learned \nsenior counsel for the appellants has vehemently attacked the \ncorrectness of the impugned judgment submitting that the A.P. \nAmendments are directed towards safeguarding the revenue of the \nState and striking at the evil of stamp duty evasion, and therefore the \nvalidity of such reasonable legislation was not liable to be questioned \nas unconstitutional. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing \nfor the respondents have defended the judgment of the High Court by \nreiterating the same grounds of attack on the constitutional validity of \nthe impugned amendment as were urged in the High Court; of course \nenlarging the reach of submissions by developing the dimensions \nthereof.  We will deal with the submissions so made before us. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">Nature of stamp legislation\n\t<a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_39\">Stamp Act</a> is a piece of fiscal legislation.  Remedial statutes and \nstatutes which have come to be enacted on demand of the permanent \npublic policy generally receive a liberal interpretation.  However, fiscal \nstatutes cannot be classed as such, operating as they do to impose \nburdens upon the public and are, therefore, construed strictly.  A few \nprinciples are well settled while interpreting a fiscal law.  There is no \nscope for equity or judiciousness if the letter of law is clear and \nunambiguous.  The benefit of any ambiguity or conflict in different \nprovisions of statute shall go for the subject.   In Dowlatram Harji &amp; \nAnr. Vs. Vitho Radhoti &amp; Anr., (1881) 5 ILR (Bom) 188, the Full \nBench indicated the need for balancing the harshness which would be \ninflicted on the subjects by implementation of the Stamp Law as \nagainst the advantage which would result in the form of revenue to the \nState; the latter may not be able to compensate the discontent which \nwould be occasioned amongst the subjects.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">\tThe legislative competence of the State of Andhra Pradesh to \namend and modify the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_40\">Indian Stamp Act</a>, a Central legislation, in its \napplicability to the State of Andhra Pradesh, has not been questioned \nand rightly so in view of the State enactment having been reserved for \nthe consideration of the President and having received his assent \nunder <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution.  The attack is on the ground \nof unreasonableness, inconsistency and excessive delegation of powers \nand also on account of drastic powers having been conferred on \nexecutive authorities without laying down guidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\tThe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/148810362/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 29</a> providing for the persons by whom \nduties are payable have been left untouched.  So is with <a href=\"/doc/51264169/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 31</a> \ndealing with &#x27;adjudication as to proper stamp&#x27; which confers power on \nthe Collector to adjudicate upon the duty with which a document shall \nbe chargeable, though such document may or may not have been \nexecuted.  The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/51264169/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 31</a> involves an element of \nvoluntariness.   The person seeking adjudication must have brought \nthe document to Collector and also applied for such adjudication.   The \ndocument cannot be compelled to be brought before him by the \nCollector.  <a href=\"/doc/61287904/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 33</a> confers power of impounding a document not \nduly stamped subject to the document being produced before an \nauthority competent to receive evidence or a person incharge of a \npublic office.   It is necessary that the document must have been \nproduced or come before such authority or person incharge in \nperformance of its functions.  The document should have been \nvoluntarily produced. At the same time, <a href=\"/doc/129366978/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 36</a> imposes an \nembargo on the power to impound, vesting in the authority competent \nto receive evidence, by providing that it cannot question the admission \nof document in evidence once it has been admitted. None of these \nprovisions have been amended by the State of Andhra Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"599506\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/599506/\" id=\"a_47\">Surajmull Nagoremull Vs Triton Insurance Co. Ltd.</a>, AIR \n1925 PC 83, their Lordships of the Privy Council made it clear that the \nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_48\">Stamp Act</a> cannot be held to have been framed solely \nfor the protection of revenue and for the purpose of being enforced \nsolely at the instance of the revenue officials.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\tPower to impound a document and to recover duty with or \nwithout penalty thereon has to be construed strictly and would be \nsustained only when falling within the four corners and letter of the \nlaw. This has been the consistent view of the Courts.  Illustratively, \nthree decisions may be referred.  In Mussammat Jai Devi Vs. Gokal \nChand, 1906 (7) PLR 428, a document not duly stamped was \nproduced in the Court by the plaintiff alongwith the plaint but the suit \ncame to be dismissed for non-prosecution.  It was held by the Full \nBench that the document annexed with the plaint cannot be said to \nhave been produced in the Court in evidence and the court had no \njurisdiction to call for the same and impound it.  In Munshi Ram Vs. \nHarnam Singh, AIR 1934 Lahore 637(1), the suit was compromised \non the date of first hearing and decree was passed based on the \ncompromise.  The original entry in a bahi was not put in evidence and, \ntherefore, the Special Bench held it was not liable to be impounded.  \nIn L. Puran Chand, Proprietor, Dalhousie Dairy Farm Vs. \nEmperor, AIR 1942 Lahore 257, the power to impound was sought to \nbe exercised after the decision in the suit and when the document \nalleged to be not duly stamped had already been directed to be \nreturned as not proved though it was not physically returned.  The \nSpecial Bench held that the document was not available for being \nimpounded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\tThough an instrument not duly stamped may attract criminal \nprosecution under <a href=\"/doc/117475092/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 62</a> of the Act but the Parliament and the \nLegislature have both treated it to be a minor offence punishable with  \nfine only and not cognizable.  Here again it is well settled that such \noffence is liable to be condoned by payment of duty and penalty on the \ndocument and no prosecution can be launched except in the case of a \ncriminal intention to evade the Stamp Law or in case of a fraud and \nthat too after giving the person liable to be proceeded against, an \nopportunity of being heard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 73</a> as substituted by A.P. Act No.17 of \n1986 indicates the infirmities with which the provision suffers. The \nprovision empowers any person authorized in writing by the Collector \nto have access to documents in private custody or custody of a public \nofficer without regard to the fact whether the documents are sought to \nbe used before any authority competent to receive evidence and \nwithout regard to the fact whether such document would ever be \nvoluntarily produced or brought before a public officer during the \nperformance of any of his specified functions in his capacity as such.  \nThe power is capable of being exercised by such persons at all \nreasonable times and it is not preceded by any requirement of the  \nreasons being recorded by the Collector or the person authorized for \nhis belief necessitating search.  The person authorized has been vested \nwith authority to impound the document.

One of the most forceful expressions of the above maxim \nwas that of William Pitt in the British Parliament in 1763.  He said:  \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">&quot;The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of \nthe Crown.

In a landmark judgment in Entick  v. Carrington: (1765) \n(19 Howells&#x27; State Trials 1029) (95 Eng Rep 807), Lord Camden \ndeclared the warrant and the behaviour as subversive &#x27;of all the \ncomforts of society&#x27; and the issuance of a warrant for the seizure of all  \nof a person&#x27;s papers and not those only alleged to be criminal in \nnature was &#x27;contrary to the genius of the law of England&#x27;.  Besides its \ngeneral character, the warrant was, according to the Court, bad \ninasmuch as it was not issued on a showing of probable cause and no \nrecord was required to be made of what had been seized.  In USA, in \nBoyd  v.

In that case, Douglas, J. observed that \nthe right to freedom of speech and press included not only the right to \nutter or to print, but also the right to distribute, the right to receive, \nand the right to read and that without these peripheral rights,  the \nspecific right would be less secure and that likewise, the other specific \nguarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, forced by emanations \nfrom those guarantees which help give them life and substance.  It \nwas held that the various guarantees created zones of privacy and that \nprotection against all government invasions &quot;of the sanctity of man&#x27;s \nhouse and the privacies of life&quot; was fundamental.

Although the phrase \ncame from Justice Harlan&#x27;s separate opinion, it is treated today as the \nessence of the majority opinion (Terry v.

The same learned Judge had said earlier in \nWhalen  v. Roe (1977) 429 US 589 that the right embraces both a \ngeneral &#x27;individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters&#x27; \nand a similarly general, -  but nonetheless distinct -  &#x27;interest in \nindependence in making certain kinds of important decisions&#x27;.  Fried \nsays in &#x27;Privacy&#x27; (1968) Yale Law Journal 475 (at 477) that physical \nprivacy is as necessary to &#x27;relations of the most fundamental \nsort\u0005.respect, love, friendship and trust&#x27; as &#x27;oxygen is for \ncombustion&#x27;.  A commentator in (1976) 64 Cal L Rev 1447 says that \nprivacy centres round values of repose, sanctuary and intimate \ndecision.  Repose refers to freedom from unwanted stimuli; sanctuary \nto protection against intrusive observation; and intimate decision, to \nautonomy with respect to the most personal of life&#x27;s choices.  (Prof. \nLawrence H. Tribe&#x27;s treatise, &#x27;American Constitutional Law&#x27;, (1988), \n2nd Ed, ch.15)\n\n\tProf. Tribe says (ibid, p 1306) that to make sense for \nconstitutional law out of the smorgasbord of philosophy, sociology, \nreligion and history upon which our understanding of humanity \nsubsists, we must turn from absolute propositions and dichotomies so \nas to place each allegedly protected act and each illegitimate \nintrusion, in a social context related to the Constitution&#x27;s test and \nstructure.  He  says (p 1307) that &#x27;exclusion of illegitimate intrusions \ninto privacy depends on the nature of the right being asserted and the \nway in which it is brought into play; it is at this point that context \nbecomes crucial -  to inform substantive judgment&#x27;. If these factors \nare relevant for defining the right to privacy, they are quite relevant -  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">whenever there is invasion of that right by way of searches and \nseizures at the instance of the State.  In New Zealand, in the \nwatershed case of R v. Jeffries (1994) (1) NZLR 290 (CA), \nRobertson, J. stated that the reasonableness of a search and seizure \nwould depend upon the subject \u0016 matter and the unique combination \nof &#x27;time, place and circumstances&#x27;.  The Court made a distinction \nbetween illegality and reasonableness of the search or seizure, in the \ncontext of <a href=\"/doc/35509880/\" id=\"a_59\">sec. 21</a> of the N.Z. Bill of Rights, 1990.  It said &#x27;a search \nmay be legal but unreasonable; it may be illegal but reasonable&#x27;.  \nProbably, what was meant was that a search under a Court warrant \nmay be lawful but the manner in which it is executed may be \nunreasonable.  Likewise, there may be very rare exceptions where a \nsearch and seizure operation is conducted without a warrant on \naccount of a sense of grave urgency for preventing danger to life or \nproperty or where delay in procuring a warrant may indeed result in \nthe evidence vanishing but still the search or seizure might have been \nconducted in a reasonable manner. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\tAs to privacy of the home, the same has been elaborated.  \nChief Justice Burger stated in United States   v. Orito: (1973) 413 \nUS 139 that the Constitution extends special safeguards to the privacy \nof the home, just as it protects other special privacy rights such as \nthose of marriage, procreation, motherhood, childbearing and \neducation.   Prof. Tribe states (p. 1412) that indeed, privacy of the \nhome has the longest constitutional pedigree of the lot, &quot;for the \nsanctity of the home\u0005 has been embedded in our traditions since the \norigins of the Republic&quot;; when we retreat across the threshold of the \nhome, inside, the government must provide escalating justification if it \nwishes to follow, monitor or control us there.  In Stanley  v. Georgia: \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(1969)394 US 557 it was declared that however free the State may be \nto ban the public dissemination of constitutionally unprotected \nobscene materials, the State cannot criminalize the purely private \npossession of such material at home -  &quot;The state has no business \ntelling a man sitting alone in his own house, what books he may read \nor what films he may watch&quot;.    \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">\tThe above discussion shows that in the United States principles \nregarding protection of privacy of the home have been put on strong \nbasis and the right is treated as a personal right distinct from a right \nto property.  The right is, however, not absolute though any intrusion \ninto the right must be based upon probable cause as stated in the \nFourth Amendment. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">\tIntrusion into privacy may be by -  (1) legislative provisions, \n(2) administrative/executive orders and (3) judicial orders.  The \nlegislative intrusions must be tested on the touchstone of \nreasonableness as guaranteed by the Constitution and for that \npurpose the Court can go into the proportionality of the intrusion vis-\n`-vis the purpose sought to be achieved.  (2)  So far as administrative \nor  executive action is concerned, it has again to be reasonable having \nregard to the facts and circumstances of the case.  (3) As to Judicial \nwarrants, the Court must have sufficient reason to believe that the \nsearch or seizure is warranted and it must keep in mind the extent of \nsearch or seizure necessary for the protection of the particular state \ninterest.  In addition, as stated earlier, common law recognized rare \nexceptions such as where warrantless searches could be conducted \nbut these must be in good faith, intended to preserve evidence or \nintended to prevent sudden danger to person or property. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">Development of law in India:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_2\">The earliest case in India to deal with &#x27;privacy&#x27; and &#x27;search and \nseizure&#x27; was <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_60\">M.P.

The \nquestion whether search warrants for the seizure of documents from \nthe accused were unconstitutional was not gone into.  The Court, after \nreferring to American authorities, observed that in US, because of the \nlanguage in the Fourth Amendment, there was a distinction between \nlegal and illegal searches and seizures and that such a distinction need \nnot be imported into our Constitution. The Court opined that a search \nwarrant was addressed to an officer and not to the accused and did \nnot violate <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_64\">Art. 20(3).</a>  In the present discussion the case is of limited \nhelp.  In fact, the law as to privacy was developed in latter cases by \nspelling it out from the right to freedom of speech and expression in \nArt 19(1)(a) and the right to &#x27;life&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Art. 21.</a>\n\tTwo latter cases decided by the Supreme Court of India where \nthe foundations for the right were laid, concerned the intrusion into \nthe home by the police under State regulations, by way of &#x27;domiciliary \nvisits&#x27;.

State of MP</a>  \n[1975] 2 SCC 148, in which Mathew, J. developed the law as to \nprivacy from where it was left in Kharak Singh.</span>  The learned Judge \nreferred to Griswold v. Connecticut  (1965) 381 US 479 where \nDouglas, J. referred to the theory of penumbras and peripheral rights \nand had stated that the right to privacy was implied in the right to \nfree speech and could be gathered from the entirety of fundamental \nrights in the constitutional scheme, for, without it, these rights could \nnot be enjoyed meaningfully.  Mathew, J. also referred to Jane Roe v. \nHenry Wade (1973) 410 US 113 where it was pointed out that \nthough the right to privacy was not specifically referred to in the US \nConstitution, the right did exist and &quot;roots of that right may be found \nin the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments, in the penumbras of the \nBill of rights, in the Ninth Amendment, and in the  concept of liberty \nguaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;.  \nMathew, J. stated that, however, the &#x27;right to privacy was not \nabsolute&#x27; and that the makers of our Constitution wanted to ensure \nconditions favourable to the pursuit of happiness as explained in \nOlmstead v. United States (1927) 277 US 438 (471); the privacy \nright can be denied only when an &#x27;important countervailing interest is \nshown to be superior&#x27;, or where a compelling State interest was \nshown.  (Mathew, J. left open the issue whether moral interests could \nbe relied upon by the State as compelling interests).  Any right to \nprivacy, the learned Judge said, (see para 24) must encompass and \nprotect the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, \nmotherhood, procreation and child bearing.  This list was however not \nexhaustive.  He explained (see para 25) that, if there was State \nintrusion there must be &#x27;a reasonable basis for intrusion&#x27;.  The right to \nprivacy, in any event, (see para 28) would necessarily have to go \nthrough a process of case-by-case development. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">\tComing to the particular UP Regulations 855 and 856, in \nquestion in Govind, Mathew, J. examined their validity (see para 30).  \nThese, according to him, gave large powers to the police and needed, \ntherefore, to be read down, so as to be in harmony with the \nConstitution, if they had to be saved at all.  &#x27;Our founding fathers \nwere thoroughly opposed to a Police Raj!&#x27;  he said.  Therefore, the \nCourt must draw boundaries upon these police powers so as to avoid \nbreach of constitutional freedoms. While it could not be said that all \ndomiciliary visits were unreasonable (see para 31), still while \ninterpreting them, one had to keep the character and antecedents of \nthe person who was under watch as also the objects and limitations \nunder which the surveillance could be made.  The right to privacy \ncould be restricted on the basis of compelling public interest.  The \nlearned Judge noticed that unlike non-statutory regulations in Kharak \nSingh, here Regulation 856 was &#x27;law&#x27; (being a piece of subordinate \nlegislation) and hence it could not be said in this case that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Art.21</a> was \nviolated for lack of legislative sanction.  The law was very much there \nin the form of these Regulations.  Regulations 853(1) and 857 \nprescribed a procedure that was &#x27;reasonable&#x27;.  So far as Regulation \n856 was concerned, it only imposed reasonable restrictions within Art. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">19(5) and there was, even otherwise, a compelling State interest.  \nRegulations 853(1) and 857 referred to a class of persons who were \nsuspected as being habitual criminals, while Regulation 857 classified \npersons who could reasonably be held to have criminal tendencies.  \nFurther Regulation 855, empowered surveillance only  of persons \nagainst whom reasonable materials existed for the purpose of inducing \nan opinion that they show a determination to lead a life of crime.

In \nUnited States Vs. Miller, (1976) 425 US 435, the majority of the \nCourt laid down that once a person passes on cheques etc. to a Bank, \nwhich indeed is in a position of a third party, the right to privacy of the \ndocument is no longer protected.  In that case, the respondent, who \nhad been charged with various federal offences, made a pre-trial \nmotion to suppress microfilms of cheques, deposit slips and other \nrecords relating to his accounts with two Banks, which maintained \nrecords relating to (US) Bank Secrecy Act, 1970.  He contended that \nthe subpoenas duces tecum pursuant to which the material had been \nproduced by the Banks, were defective and that the records had thus \nbeen illegally seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The \nrequest was denied by the trial Court, the Respondent was tried and \nconvicted.  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the subpoened \ndocuments fell within the constitutionally protected zone of privacy.  \nOn further appeal, the US Supreme Court restored the conviction \nholding that, once the documents reached the hands of a third party, \nnamely, the Bank, the Respondent ceased to possess any Fourth \nAmendment interest in the Bank records that could be vindicated by a \nchallenge to the subpoenas, that the materials were business records \nof the banks and not the respondents&#x27; private papers; that, there was \nno legitimate &#x27;expectation of privacy&#x27; (as stated in Katz) in the \ncontents of the original cheques and deposit slips, since the cheques \nwere &quot;not confidential communications&quot; but negotiable instruments to \nbe used in commercial transactions and the documents contained only \ninformation voluntarily conveyed to the Banks which was exposed to \nthe employees in the ordinary course of business.  The Court laid down \na new principle of &quot;assumption of risk&quot;.  It said the &quot;depositor takes \nthe risk, in revealing his affairs to another&quot;.  The Court declared that \nthe Fourth Amendment did not prohibit the obtaining of information \nrevealed to a third party and conveyed by that party to government \nauthorities.  Once the person who had the privacy right &quot;assumed the \nrisk&quot; of the information being conveyed to the outside world by the \nBank, he could make no kind of complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">\tThe above decision led to a serious criticism by jurists (See &#x27;A&#x27; \nbelow) that the broad proposition, namely, that once a person \nconveyed confidential documents to a third party, he would lose his \nprivacy rights, was wrong and was based on the old concept of \ntreating the right of privacy as one attached to property whereas the \nCourt had, in Katz accepted that the privacy right protected \n&#x27;individuals and not places&#x27;; Congress came forward with the Right to \nFinancial Privacy Act, 1978 (Pub L No.95-630) which provided several \nsafeguards to secure privacy, __ namely __  requiring reasonable cause \nand also enabling the customer to challenge the summons or warrant \nin a Court of law before it could be executed; (See (B) below)  (We do \nnot mean to say that any law which is not on those lines is invalid. \nIndian laws such as s.132 etc. of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_88\">Indian Income Tax Act, 1961</a>; or \nsecs. 91, 165 and 166 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_89\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>, 1973 as to \nsearch and seizure have, as stated below, been extensively considered \nby the Courts in India and have been held to be valid).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">(A)\tCriticism of Miller:  (i) The majority in Miller laid down that a \ncustomer who has conveyed his affairs to another had thereby lost his \nprivacy rights.  (i) Prof. Tribe states in his treatise (see p.1391) that \nthis theory reveals &#x27;alarming tendencies&#x27; because the Court has gone \nback to the old theory that privacy is in relation to property while it \nhas laid down that the right is one attached to the person rather than \nto property.  If the right is to be held to be not attached to the person, \nthen &#x27;we would not shield our account balances, income figures and \npersonal telephone and address books from the public eye, but might \ninstead go about with the information written on our &#x27;foreheads or our \nbumper stickers&#x27;.  He observes that the majority in Miller  confused \n&#x27;privacy&#x27; with &#x27;secrecy&#x27; and that &quot;even their notion of secrecy is a \nstrange one, for a secret remains a secret even when shared with \nthose whom one selects for one&#x27;s confidence&quot;. Our cheques are not \nmerely negotiable instruments but yet the world can learn a vast \namount about us by knowing how and with whom we have spent our \nmoney.  Same is the position when we use the telephone or post a \nletter.  To say that one assumes great risks by opening a bank account \nappeared to be a wrong conclusion.  Prof. Tribe asks a very pertinent \nquestion (p. 1392):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">&quot;Yet one can hardly be said to have assumed a risk  \nof surveillance in a context where, as a practical \nmatter, one had no choice.  Only the most \ncommitted -  and perhaps civilly committable \u0016 \nhermit can live without a telephone, without a bank \naccount, without mail.

(As \nstated earlier, we should not be understood as necessarily \nrecommending this law as a model for India).  Soon after Miller, \nCongress enacted the &#x27;Right to Financial Privacy Act, 1978 (Public Law \nNo.95-630) 12 USC with ss.3401 to 3422).  The statute accords \ncustomers of Banks or similar financial institutions, certain rights to be \nnotified of and a right to challenge the actions of government in Court \nat an anterior stage before disclosure is made.  <a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_90\">Sec.3401</a> of the Act \ncontains &#x27;definitions&#x27;.

If the customer decides \nto challenge the Government&#x27;s access to the records, he may file a \nmotion in the appropriate US District Court, to prevent such access.  \n<a href=\"/doc/74910796/\" id=\"a_91\">The Act</a> also provides for certain specific exceptions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\tWhile we are on (B), it is necessary to make a brief reference to \n<a href=\"/doc/205448/\" id=\"a_92\">sec. 93(1)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 which deals with \npower of the Court to issue &#x27;search warrants&#x27; (a) where the Court has \n&#x27;reason to believe&#x27; that a person to whom a summons or order under \nsec.91 or a requisition under sec. 92(1) has been, or might be, \naddressed, - will not or would not produce the document or thing as \nrequired by summons or requisition, or (b) where such document or \nthing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of any person, \nor (c) where the Court considers that the purposes of any inquiry, trial \nor other proceeding under the Code, will be served by a general search \nor inspection, it may issue a search-warrant; and the person to whom \nsuch warrant is directed, may search or inspect in accordance \ntherewith and the provisions contained in the Code.  Under sec.93(2), \nthe Court may, if it thinks fit, specify in the warrant, the place or part \nthereof to which only the search or inspection shall extend; and the \nperson charged with the execution of such warrant shall then search or \ninspect only the place or part so specified.

He \nhas to record the grounds of his belief in writing and specify, so far as \npossible, the thing for which search is made.  Sec.166 refers to the \nquestion as to when an officer-in-charge of a police station may \nrequire another to issue search warrant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\t<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_93\">In the Income-tax Act, 1961</a> elaborate provisions are made in \nregard to &#x27;search and seizure in sec.132; power to requisition books of \naccount etc. in sec. 132A; power to call for information as stated in \nsec. 133.  Sec. 133(6) deals with power of officers to require any Bank \nto furnish any information as specified there.  There are safeguards.  \nSec.132 uses the words &quot;in consequence of information in his \npossession, has reason to believe&quot;.  Sec. 132(1A) uses the words &quot;in \nconsequence of information in his possession, has reason to suspect&quot;.  \nSec. 132(13) says that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_94\">Code of Criminal \nProcedure</a>, relating to searches and seizure shall apply, so far as may \nbe, to searches and seizures under sec. 132(1) and 132(1A).

There are other Central and State statutes dealing with \nprocedure for &#x27;search and seizure&#x27; for the purposes of the respective \nstatutes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">\tUnder all these enactments, there are several judgments of this \nCourt explaining the scope of the provisions, and the safeguards \nprovided by those provisions while upholding their constitutional \nvalidity and pointing out their limitations.  It is not necessary in this \ncase to refer to those judgments.  Suffice it to say that, in the present \ncase we are concerned mainly with the validity of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_95\">sec. 73</a> of the Stamp \nAct, as amended in its application in 1986 in A.P.\n\n\tOnce we have accepted in Govind and in latter cases that the \nright to privacy deals with &#x27;persons and not places&#x27;, the documents or \ncopies of documents of the customer which are in Bank, must continue \nto remain confidential vis-`-vis the person, even if they are no longer \nat the customer&#x27;s house and have been voluntarily sent to a Bank.  If \nthat be the correct view of the law, we cannot accept the line of Miller \nin which the Court proceeded on the basis that the right to privacy is \nreferable to the right of &#x27;property&#x27; theory.  Once that is so, then unless \nthere is some probable or reasonable cause or reasonable basis or \nmaterial before the Collector for reaching an opinion that the \ndocuments in the possession of the Bank tend, to secure any duty or \nto prove or to lead to the discovery of any fraud or omission in relation \nto any duty, the search or taking notes or extracts therefore, cannot \nbe valid.  The above safeguards must necessarily be read into the \nprovision relating to search and inspection and seizure so as to save it \nfrom any unconstitutionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">\tSecondly, the impugned provision in <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_96\">sec. 73</a> enabling the \nCollector to authorize &#x27;any person&#x27; whatsoever to inspect, to take \nnotes or extracts from the papers in the public office suffers from the \nvice of excessive delegation as there are no guidelines in the Act and \nmore importantly, the section allows the facts relating to the \ncustomer&#x27;s privacy to reach non-governmental persons and would, on \nthat basis, be an unreasonable encroachment into the customer&#x27;s \nrights.  This part of the <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 73</a> permitting delegation to &#x27;any \nperson&#x27; suffers from the above serious defects and for that reason is, \nin our view, unenforceable.  The State must clearly define the officers \nby designation or state that the power can be delegated to officers not \nbelow a particular rank in the official hierarchy, as may be designated \nby the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_9\">The A.P. amendment permits inspection being carried out by the \nCollector by having access to the documents which are in private \ncustody i.e. custody other than that of a public officer.

Unbridled power available to be exercised by any \nperson whom the Collector may think proper to authorize without \nlaying down any guidelines as to the persons who may be authorized \nand without recording the availability of grounds which would give rise \nto the belief, on the existence where of only, the power may be \nexercised deprives the provision of the quality of reasonableness.  \nPossessing a document not duly stamped is not by itself any offence.  \nUnder the garb of the power conferred by <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 73</a> the person \nauthorized may go on rampage searching house after house i.e. \nresidences of the persons or the places used for the custody of \ndocuments.  The possibility of any wild exercise of such power may be \nremote but then on the framing of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 73</a>, the provision impugned \nherein, the possibility cannot be ruled out.  Any number of documents \nmay be inspected, may be seized and may be removed and at the end \nthe whole exercise may turn out to be an  exercise in futility.  The \nexercise may prove to be absolutely  disproportionate with the purpose \nsought to be achieved and, therefore,  a reasonable nexus between \nstringency of the provision and the purpose sought to be achieved \nceases to exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">\tThe abovesaid deficiency pointed out by the High Court and \nhighlighted by the learned counsel for the respondents in this Court \nhas not been removed even by the rules.  The learned counsel for the \nrespondents has pointed out that under the Rules the obligation is cast \non the bank or any other person having custody of the documents \nthough it may not be a party to the document, to pay the duty payable \non the documents in order to secure release of the documents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\tFor the foregoing reasons we agree with the view taken by the \nHigh Court that <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 73</a> of the Indian Stamp Act as amended in its \napplication to the State of Andhra Pradesh by Andhra Pradesh Act No. \n17 of 1986 is ultra vires the Constitution.  As we do not find any \ninfirmity in the judgment of the High Court all the appeals are \ndismissed.\n</p>\n","numcites":43,"numcitedby":130,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1068532,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"andhra pradesh stamp act","formInput":"andhra%20pradesh%20stamp%20act"},{"value":"public documents","formInput":"public%20documents"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"private documents ","formInput":"private%20documents%20"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"subpoena   on IT","formInput":"subpoena%20%20%20on%20IT"},{"value":"impounding of document","formInput":"impounding%20of%20document"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"how art.19(1)(a)","formInput":"how%20art.19%281%29%28a%29"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"personal right","formInput":"personal%20right"},{"value":"constitutional validity","formInput":"constitutional%20validity"},{"value":"excessive delegation","formInput":"excessive%20delegation"},{"value":"search warrant","formInput":"search%20warrant"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"indian stamp act","formInput":"indian%20stamp%20act"},{"value":"search and seizure","formInput":"search%20and%20seizure"},{"value":"inspection of documents","formInput":"inspection%20of%20documents"},{"value":"stamp duty","formInput":"stamp%20duty"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"indian-stamp, use-of-stamps","formInput":"tag:indian-stamp, use-of-stamps"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
