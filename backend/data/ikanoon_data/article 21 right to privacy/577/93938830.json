In such a\n\n         situation, the Judge has to be not only sensitive to the\n\n         inequalities of parties involved but also positively inclined to\n\n         the weaker party if the imbalance were not to result in\n\n         miscarriage of justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                     9.

The law regulates relationships between\n                         people. It prescribes patterns of behaviour. It reflects the values\n                         of society. The role of the court is to understand the purpose of\n                         law in society and to help the law achieve its purpose. But the\n                         law of a society is a living organism. It is based on a given\n                         factual and social reality that is constantly changing. Sometimes\n Patna High Court CWJC No.7713 of 2024 dt.12-12-2024\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                            7/10</span>\n\n\n\n\n                         change in law precedes societal change and is even intended to\n                         stimulate it. In most cases, however, a change in law is the result\n                         of a change in social reality. Indeed, when social reality changes,\n                         the law must change too. Just as change in social reality is the\n                         law of life, responsiveness to change in social reality is the life of\n                         the law. It can be said that the history of law is the history of\n                         adapting the law to society&#x27;s changing needs. In both\n                         constitutional and statutory interpretation, the court is supposed\n                         to exercise discretion in determining the proper relationship\n                         between the subjective and objective purposes of the law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                     10.

To conclude the object of the provision of 1972\n Patna High Court CWJC No.7713 of 2024 dt.12-12-2024\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                           9/10</span>\n\n\n\n\n         Rules, the Apex Court held that &quot;unless a purposive\n\n         interpretation were to be adopted in the said case, the object and\n\n         intent of the grant of maternity leave would simply be defeated.\n\n         The grant of maternity leave under Rules of 1972 is intended to\n\n         facilitate the continuance of women in the workplace. It is a\n\n         harsh reality that but for such provisions, many women would\n\n         be compelled by social circumstances to give up work on the\n\n         birth of a child, if they are not granted leave and other\n\n         facilitative measures. No employer can perceive child birth as\n\n         detracting from the purpose of employment. Child birth has to\n\n         be construed in the context of employment as a natural incident\n\n         of life and hence, the provisions for maternity leave must be\n\n         construed in that perspective.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_10\">12.
