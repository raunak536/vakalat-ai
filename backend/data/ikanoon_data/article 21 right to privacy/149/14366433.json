To understand this aspect, it is necessary to examine the ratio of balance\n\n                        between efficient investigation and individual rights. Accordingly, Law,\n\n                        Science and Technology have a great relevance in our lives. Law and\n\n                        Science encounter each other in many ways. When technology intrudes\n\n                        in the ambit of legal rights, it is checked by law, for example, cyber\n\n                        crimes, in the same manner to protect legal rights and strengthening the\n\n                        evidence with the help of science, cannot be denied.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">                    9. At present days, when the legal system has so much advanced,\n\n                        criminals/litigants/individuals take care to erase all the evidences of\n\n                        their involvement, then in such case, scientific and highly sophisticated\n\n                        methods are required to trace the involvement of criminals/litigants/\n\n                        individuals. Narcoanalysis, Polygraphy and Brain Mapping tests\n\n                        collectively called deception detection tests (DDT) are new kinds of\n\n                        interrogation techniques including the DNA Test (Deoxyribonuclie\n\n                        Acid), which are simple and civilized way of conducting investigation.\n\n                        But, at the same time, one has to be conscious of its limitations also.

Such an expansive\n                              interpretation is not feasible in light of the rule of `ejusdem\n                              generis&#x27; and the considerations which govern the interpretation\n                              of statutes in relation to scientific advancements.
