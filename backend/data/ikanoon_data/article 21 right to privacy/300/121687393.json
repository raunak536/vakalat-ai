Similarly, we have heard Ms P.H.\n Kantharia, learned Government Pleader along with Ms Deepali\n Patankar, Assistant to G.P. for the State in original side Writ\n Petition (L) No.3172 of 2018.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\"> 4]       We have also heard Mr. Rajiv Chavan, learned Senior\n Advocate along with Ms Priyanka Chavan, Ms Anupama Pawar\n for the respondent - MCGM.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\"> 5]       In all these petitions, the petitioners had basically applied\n for appropriate orders to permit them to medically terminate\n pregnancies, even though the length of their respective\n pregnancies had exceeded 20 weeks. In two of the petitions, i.e.,\n Writ Petition No. 10835 of 2018 and Writ Petition No. 9748 of\n 2018, declaration was sought to declare <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_1\">section 3(2)(b)</a> of the\n Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_2\">(MTP Act</a>) to the\n limited extent that it stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks for an\n abortion to be done under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_3\">section 3</a> of the MTP Act is ultra vires\n <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">21</a> of the Constitution of India. However, this\n relief was not ultimately pressed, because the petitioners in the\n said petitions had also applied for a declaration that their case\n was fit for exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_6\">section 5</a> of the MTP\n Act, which, under certain circumstances, permits the medical\n termination of pregnancy, regardless of the ceiling of 20 weeks\n as prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_7\">section 3</a> of the MTP Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"> 6]       Since, the consideration of reliefs sought for by the\n petitioners could not brook any delay, by various orders, we\n\n                                                                          3 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:31 :::</span>\n   dss                                  4       Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n directed the constitution of Medical Boards comprising experts\n in various fields such as Gynecology, Medicine, Radiodiagnosis,\n Pediatric, Psychiatry etc. on emergent basis, in order to\n examine the petitioners and submit reports to this Court. In all\n these petitions, relying upon the reports and upon decisions of\n the Supreme Court in similar cases, we permitted the\n Petitioners          to       undertake      medical      termination           of     their\n pregnancies even though the length of the pregnancies had\n exceeded twenty weeks.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\"> 7]       However, these Petitions were kept pending since certain\n important issues were raised, which in our opinion required\n detailed consideration. This is because several such petitions\n are being filed in this Court seeking urgent reliefs. In matters of\n this nature, every passing day produces irretrievable changes in\n the status of the petitioners and fetus which they carry. These\n changes invariably have a direct impact upon the reliefs applied\n for       in       such         petitions.      We        therefore,           appointed\n Mr.D.J.Khambatta, learned Senior Advocate of this Court to\n assist us as an Amicus Curiae in the matters and heard all the\n learned counsel representing various stake holders in the\n context of some important issues which arise in such matters.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\"> 8]       According to us, the following issues arise in these\n petitions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">          (A)      Whether and in what circumstances can this Court,\n          in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 226</a> of the\n          Constitution of India, permit the Petitioners to medically\n          terminate pregnancies, the length of which exceed 20\n\n                                                                                      4 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                            ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:31 :::</span>\n   dss                               5     Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n          weeks, which is the ceiling prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_9\">section 3 (2)</a> of\n          the MTP Act ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">          (B)      If permission as aforesaid, can and is to be granted,\n          then what should be procedure and safeguards that will\n          have to be adopted in such matters, particularly, with\n          regard to:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                   (i)     Constitution of medical boards to expeditiously\n                   examine such petitioners;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   (ii)    The hospitals/ clinics where such procedures\n                   may be permitted to be safely undertaken.\n          (C)      What is the legal status of a child born alive, despite\n          attempts at medical termination of pregnancy - the\n          procedure to be followed in such cases - and the\n          responsibility of the State in such matters?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\"> 9]       The statutory regime in such matters is governed by the\n <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_10\">MTP Act</a> which entered in force on 1 st April, 1972. This is an Act\n to provide for the termination of certain pregnancies by\n registered medical practitioners and for matters connected\n therewith or incidental thereto.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"> 10]      The Statement of Objects and Reasons (S.O.R.) refers to\n the provisions regarding termination of pregnancy under the\n <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">IPC</a>) enacted about a century prior to\n <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_13\">MTP Act</a> entering into force. In keeping with the British Law on\n the subject, the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a> had criminalized the medical termination of\n pregnancy (abortion). The mother as well as abortionist could\n be punished, except where abortion had to be induced in order\n to save the life of the mother.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n                                                                               5 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                      ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:31 :::</span>\n   dss                                 6       Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n 11]      The S.O.R. notes that the strict provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> were\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"> observed in breach in very large number of cases all over the\n country. Furthermore, most of these mothers were married\n women and there was no particular necessity to conceal their\n pregnancies. The S.O.R. then takes note of the fact that in\n recent years, health services had expanded and hospitals were\n availed of to the fullest extent by all classes of society and yet,\n Doctors were often been confronted by gravely ill or dying\n pregnant women whose pregnant uterus had been tampered\n with, in order to cause abortion. The S.O.R notes that this was\n avoidable wastage of the mother&#x27;s health, strength and\n sometimes even life.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\"> 12]      The S.O.R. then proceeds to state that the proposed\n measures in the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_16\">MTP Act</a>, seeking to liberalize certain existing\n provisions relating to termination of pregnancy have been\n conceived, primarily, for the following three purposes:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          (i)    As a health measure - when there is danger to the\n          life or risk to physical or mental health of the woman;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          (ii)   On humanitarian grounds - such as when pregnancy\n          arises from a sex crime like rape or intercourse with a\n          lunatic woman, etc.; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          (iii) Eugenic grounds - where there is substantial risk\n          that the child, if born, would suffer from deformities and\n          diseases.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"> 13]      <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_17\">The MTP Act</a> was amended in 2002 by Amendment Act\n No. 64 of 2002. Again, the Statement of Objects and Reasons to\n this     Amendment            Act   refers    to    how     <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_18\">MTP        Act</a>     legalised\n termination of pregnancy on various social socio-medical\n grounds and how the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_19\">MTP Act</a> was aimed at eliminating\n abortion by untrained persons and in unhygienic conditions,\n\n                                                                                   6 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                          ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:31 :::</span>\n   dss                          7   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n thus reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. The Statement\n of Objects and Reasons to the Amendment Act then refers to\n the expert group which was constituted to review the provisions\n of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act</a> with a view to making it more relevant to the\n present environment. There is reference to suggestions from the\n National Commission for Women, in order to remove provisions\n discriminatory to women.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\"> 14]      Since, the S.O.R. to the MTP Act makes reference to the\n provisions regarding termination of pregnancy in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a>, brief\n reference, to such provisions becomes necessary particularly to\n the appreciation of background in which the provisions of MTP\n came to be enacted and entered into force. These provisions are\n mainly contained in <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 312</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1173112/\" id=\"a_23\">318</a> of the IPC, which, as\n noted earlier, was a law enacted in the year 1860.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\"> 15]      <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 312</a> of the IPC, punishes those who cause\n miscarriage in a pregnant woman. Even if the pregnant woman\n causes herself to miscarry, the same is punishable. Enhanced\n punishment is prescribed if miscarriage is caused after\n quickening (perception by the mother that movement of the\n fetus has started). Enhanced punishment is also prescribed\n where the offence is committed without consent of the woman.\n <a href=\"/doc/1317800/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 314</a> of IPC deals with the offence of causing death while\n causing miscarriage.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\"> 16]      <a href=\"/doc/1637773/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 315</a> of the IPC punishes those who intentionally\n prevent the child being born alive or causing it to die after its\n birth. <a href=\"/doc/1184459/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 316</a> of the IPC provides that if a quick unborn\n\n                                                                        7 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:31 :::</span>\n   dss                          8     Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n child dies as a result of an act amounting to culpable homicide,\n the offender can be punished under this section.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\"> 17]         <a href=\"/doc/9383/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 317</a> of the IPC punishes father or mother of a\n child under the age of twelve years, or persons having the care\n of such child if they abandon such child. <a href=\"/doc/1173112/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 318</a> of the IPC\n punishes those who secretly bury or otherwise dispose of the\n dead body of a child whether such child dies before or after or\n during its birth or who intentionally conceal or endeavour to\n conceal the birth of such child.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\"> 18]      However, <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_30\">sections 312</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1637773/\" id=\"a_31\">315</a> of the IPC exempt and\n decriminalize miscarriage, if undertaken in good faith for the\n purpose of saving the life of the mother.

An abortion is a carefully considered decision taken\n by a woman who fears that the welfare of the child she already\n has, and of other members of the household that she is obliged\n to care for with limited financial and other resources, may be\n compromised by the birth of another child. These are decisions\n taken by responsible women who have few other options. They\n are women who would ideally have preferred to prevent an\n unwanted pregnancy, but were unable to do so. If a woman\n does not want to continue with the pregnancy, then forcing her\n to do so represents a violation of the woman&#x27;s bodily integrity\n and aggravates her mental trauma which would be deleterious\n to her mental health.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\"> 99]      The Division Bench has referred to certain provisions in\n international treaties concerning human rights. In that context,\n the Division Bench has observed that a person is vested with\n human rights only at birth, an unborn fetus is not an entity\n with human rights. The pregnancy takes place within the body\n of a woman and has profound effects on her health, mental well\n being and life. Thus, how she wants to deal with this pregnancy\n must be a decision she and she alone can make. The right to\n control her own body and fertility and motherhood choices\n should be left to the women alone. The basic right of a woman\n is the right to autonomy, which includes the right to decide\n whether or not to get pregnant and stay pregnant.</p><pre id=\"pre_13\">\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       54 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                     55   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\"> 100] The Division Bench then noted that the right of woman to\n say no to motherhood, emerges from her human right to live\n with dignity as a human being and is protected as a\n fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, no\n doubt, subject to the reasonable restrictions as contemplated\n under MTP. The Division Bench has observed that human\n rights are natural right and thus a woman has a natural right\n in relation to her body which includes her willingness to be a\n mother or her unwillingness to be a mother. The Division\n Bench has observed that <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_235\">section 3 (2)</a>                     of the MTP Act is an\n extension of the human right of a woman and this needs to be\n protected. Woman owns her body and has right over it.\n Abortion is always a difficult and careful decision and woman\n alone should be the choice maker. A child when born and takes\n first breath, is a human entity and thus, unborn fetus cannot\n be put on a higher pedestal than the right of living woman.\n Thus, the right of reproductive choice though restricted by <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_236\">MTP\n Act</a>, recognises and protects her right to say no to the\n pregnancy if her mental or physical health is at stake.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\"> 101] <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_237\">The MTP Act</a> lays great emphasis on grave injury to not\n just the physical but also the mental health of the pregnant\n woman. <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 3 (2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act provides that if the\n continuance of pregnancy would involve grave injury to the\n mental        health          of   the   pregnant   woman,         then,      she      can\n legitimately seek to terminate the same.

Further, <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_244\">section 3 (3)</a> of the MTP\n Act, in terms provides that in determining whether continuance\n of pregnancy would involve such risk of injury to the health as\n is mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_245\">section 3 (2)</a>,         account may be taken of the\n pregnant woman&#x27;s actual or reasonable foreseeable environment.\n <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 3 (3)</a> of the MTP Act, makes reference not merely to\n physical injury but also to mental injury. In fact, the aspect of a\n pregnant           woman&#x27;s    actual   or     reasonable            foreseeable\n environment has greater nexus to aspect of mental health as\n compared to physical health, particularly in the present\n context.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\"> 105] This legislative liberality when it comes to expanding the\n concept of the grave injury to mental health cannot evaporate\n no sooner the ceiling of 20 weeks prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_247\">section 3 (2)(b)</a>\n of the MTP Act is crossed. If the expression &quot;life&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1294807/\" id=\"a_248\">section 5(1)</a>\n of the MTP Act is not to be confined to mere physical existence\n or survival, then, permission will have to be granted under\n <a href=\"/doc/1294807/\" id=\"a_249\">section 5 (1)</a> of the MTP Act for medical termination of\n pregnancy which may have exceeded 20 weeks, if the\n continuance of such pregnancy would involve grave injury to\n the mental health of the pregnant woman.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\"> 106] It is not as if all contingencies express themselves only\n within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

In many cases,\n complications can develop as the pregnancy advances. In many\n cases, complications may be detected at some advanced stage.\n In such cases, as long as the medical opinion does not suggest\n that medical termination of pregnancy at the advance stage is\n itself a serious risk to the physical life of the pregnant mother,\n the      law      cannot        plead        helplessness      particularly          where\n circumstances set in clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_250\">section 3 (2)(b)</a> of the\n MTP Act manifestly exist.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\"> 107] The aforesaid myriad factors and circumstances assume\n importance and in fact, are required to be taken into account\n by the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_251\">MTP Act</a> legislature. This is evident from the provision in\n <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_252\">section 3(3)</a> of the MTP Act which requires account to be taken\n of the pregnant woman&#x27;s actual or reasonable foreseeable\n environment             in     determining       whether       continuance            of      a\n pregnancy would involve such risk of injury to health as is\n mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_253\">section 3(2)</a> of the MTP Act. The expression\n &quot;pregnant           woman&#x27;s          actual      or    reasonable            foreseeable\n environment&quot; is also particularly relevant when it comes to\n dealing with cases of women from rural areas or rural\n backgrounds. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_254\">MTP Act</a> have to be so\n construed          so     as    to   not      impose     any      unreasonable             or\n disproportionate burden on pregnant women, who on account\n of circumstances set out in clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_255\">section 3(2)(b)</a>\n of the MTP Act seek medical termination of pregnancy, even\n\n\n\n                                                                                    58 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                            ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                  59    Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n though, the ceiling prescribed in the said provisions may have\n crossed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\"> 108] Incidentally,             reference   may       be    made        to    the      MTP\n (Amendment) Bill 2014 which also takes conscious cognizance\n of this aspect - in that the ceiling prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_256\">section 3(2)</a> of\n the MTP Act is proposed to be raised to 24 weeks. This\n amendment had even proposed to do away entirely with the\n ceiling of 20 weeks, where termination of pregnancy was\n necessitated           by     the   diagnosis   of    any      substantial          foetal\n abnormalities as may be prescribed. Similarly, reference may\n also be made to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy\n (Amendment) Bill, 2017, the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n of which reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                &quot;This sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_257\">section 3</a> of the Medical\n          Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, allows the abortion of\n          terminally ill fetuses upto twenty weeks pregnancy.\n          During the intervening period after the Act was\n          enforced, several genuine cases have come up where\n          the fact of fetuses with serious risk of abnormalities\n          with grave risk to physical and mental risk to\n          mother had been noticed after twenty weeks. As a\n          result, many women were forced to move the\n          Supreme Court for permission to end pregnancy\n          beyond twenty weeks, leading to lot of mental and\n          financial hardship to such pregnant women.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                The Bill intends to extend the permissible period for\n          abortion from twenty weeks to twenty four weeks if doctors\n          believe the pregnancy involves a substantial risk to the\n          mother or the child or if there are substantial fetal\n          abnormalities.

Thus, if a\n registered medical practitioner is of the opinion that if the\n pregnancy          is    not   medically   terminated        immediately,            the\n pregnant woman might die, then, it is the duty of such\n registered medical practitioner to undertake the termination\n and the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_260\">MTP Act</a> will afford such registered\n medical practitioner immunity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\"> 111] However, permission from this Court or the Supreme\n Court will be necessary where the pregnant mother seeks to\n medically terminate her pregnancy, not on the ground that\n such termination is immediately necessary to save her life, but\n on grounds like the continuance of pregnancy would involve a\n grave injury to her physical or mental health and/or that there\n is substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer\n from physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously\n handicapped.</p><pre id=\"pre_14\">\n\n                                                                               60 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                       ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                  61      Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\"> 112] The reason for treating the two sets of cases differently, is\n quite obvious. In the former, there is threat to the physical\n existence of the pregnant mother, if termination of pregnancy is\n not      undertaken           by   the     registered     medical        practitioner,\n immediately. The inevitable delay involved in the legal process\n might even lead to the demise of the pregnant mother. In the\n later cases however, there may not be any immediate threat to\n the      physical         existence      of   the   pregnant          mother,         but,\n nevertheless the continuance of pregnancy, particularly under\n circumstances set out in clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_261\">section 3(2)(b)</a> of\n the MTP Act, may deprive the Petitioner of her right to life,\n which as noted earlier, includes not merely the right to\n physically exist or to survive, but also, the right to live with\n human dignity, the right to comprehend one&#x27;s being in its\n fullest sense.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168133848\" id=\"span_96\">113] Besides, in the later cases, permission from the Courts is\n necessary in order to prevent abuse and exploitation, which\n might result, taking into account the inevitable subjectivity\n involved in such matters. This Court cannot be oblivious to the\n observations made by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/168133848/\" id=\"a_262\">Voluntary Health\n Association of Punjab vs. Union of India</a> - 2016(10) SCC\n 265 on the aspect of abuse of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_263\">MTP Act</a> to eliminate female\n fetuses as well as the reasons for enacting the PCPNDT Act.\n Further, if a case is indeed made out for grant of permission,\n appropriate orders can be made on several aspects, including,\n inter alia on the aspect of immunity to registered medical\n practitioner, maintenance of proper documentation etc. No\n\n\n                                                                                  61 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                          ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                  62    Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n doubt, the requirement of obtaining such permissions from the\n Court, will, increase the burden on the pregnant mother.\n However, in situations where the pregnancy has exceeded\n twenty        weeks           and   where   the   pregnant         mother         seeks\n termination under circumstances set out in clauses (i) and (ii)\n of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_264\">section 3 (2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act even though, there may be no\n necessity of immediate termination in order to save the\n mother&#x27;s life, the requirement of permission from the Court is\n considered necessary safeguard in such matters.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\"> 114] The aforesaid distinction between the two sets of cases is\n necessary lest we be misunderstood of holding that registered\n medical practitioner is at liberty, in every case, to medically\n terminate pregnancy which exceeds 20 weeks on the basis of\n liberal interpretation of the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_265\">section 5</a> of the MTP\n Act, by reference to the contingencies in clauses (i) and (ii) of\n <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_266\">section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act. We therefore make it clear that a\n registered medical practitioner, in a case where he is of opinion,\n formed in good faith, that termination of such pregnancy is\n immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman,\n can medically terminate such pregnancy which may have\n exceeded 20 weeks, even without the permission from the\n Court. This is in a situation where the pregnant woman might\n actually die if the pregnancy is not immediately terminated.\n However, we also make it extremely clear that in cases where\n pregnancy had exceeded 20 weeks and where the pregnant\n woman will not die if the pregnancy is not immediately\n terminated, but the pregnant woman seeks to terminate\n pregnancy on the ground that its continuance would involve\n\n                                                                                62 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                        ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                   63      Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n grave risk to her physical or mental health or where there is\n substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from\n physical         or     mental    abnormalities          as      to     be     seriously\n handicapped, then, there will be no liberty to the registered\n medical practitioner, on his own, to terminate such pregnancy.\n In the later situation, permission will necessarily have to be\n obtained from the High Court, before a registered medical\n practitioner undertakes such medical termination of pregnancy.\n The grant or refusal of such permission will then be governed\n by varied factors, including but not restricted to the opinion of\n the medical board and the binding precedents of the Supreme\n Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\"> 115] The next question which arises in these Petitions relates\n to the procedure to be followed and the safeguards that will\n have to be adopted in such matters, particularly with regard to\n the constitution of medical boards to examine the pregnant\n mothers         and      the   hospitals       and    clinics      at    which        such\n termination of pregnancy may be permitted to be safely\n undertaken.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\"> 116] As noticed earlier, the Supreme Court, in                                    Sonali\n\n Gaikwad (supra) has already clarified that such cases can be\n filed     in     the      respective        High   Courts       having         territorial\n jurisdiction.

Therefore, taking into\n consideration the provisions of Part III and Part IV of the\n Constitution, we make it clear, that under no circumstances,\n\n                                                                                     68 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                             ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                   69    Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n such a child must be neglected or left to perish, particularly\n where the pregnant or her family members may not be in a\n position to or may not be willing to assume responsibility in\n such matters.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"498126\" id=\"span_106\">127] In the aforesaid regard, we refer to the decision of the\n Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/498126/\" id=\"a_278\">Parmanand Katara vs. Union of India</a>\n (1989) 4 SCC 286 where it was held that there can be no\n second opinion that preservation of human life is of paramount\n importance. That is so on account of the fact that once life is\n lost, the status quo ante cannot be restored as resurrection is\n beyond the capacity of man. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution casts\n the obligation on the State to preserve life. The provision as\n explained by this Court in scores of decisions has emphasised\n and      reiterated           with   gradually   increasing       emphasis,          that\n position.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\"> 128] The Supreme Court has further observed that a Doctor at\n the government hospital positioned to meet this State obligation\n is, therefore, duty bound to extend medical assistance for\n preserving life. Every doctor whether at a government hospital\n or otherwise has the professional obligation to extend his\n services with due expertise for protecting life. No law or State\n action can intervene to avoid/delay the discharge of the\n paramount obligation cast upon members of the medical\n profession. The obligation being total, absolute and paramount,\n laws of procedure whether in statutes or otherwise which would\n interfere with the discharge of this obligation cannot be\n sustained and must, therefore, give way. So far as this duty of\n\n                                                                                 69 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                         ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                          70   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n medical profession is concerned, it is a duty coupled with\n human instinct and therefore, it needs neither any decision nor\n any code for compliance. In any case, Code of Medical Ethics\n framed by the Medical Council of India Item 13 specifically\n provides for it.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102852\" id=\"span_108\">129] In <a href=\"/doc/102852/\" id=\"a_280\">M. Nagraj</a> (supra), the Constitution Bench in the\n context of certain fundamental rights, including the right to life\n and human dignity, has held that the values impose a positive\n duty on the State to ensure their attainment as far as\n practicable. The rights, liberties and freedoms of the individual\n are not only to be protected against the State, they should be\n facilitated by it. It is the duty of the State to not only to protect\n the human dignity but to facilitate it by taking positive steps in\n that direction.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\"> 130] Therefore, if the child, despite attempts at medical\n termination of pregnancy, is born alive, then the parents as well\n as the Doctors owe a duty of care to such child. The best\n interest of the child must be the central consideration in\n determining how to treat the child. The extreme vulnerability of\n such child is itself reason enough to ensure that everything\n which is reasonably possible and feasible, in the circumstances,\n will have to be offered to such child, so that it develops into a\n healthy child.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\"> 131] In such matters, the instinct of the parents, will no doubt\n take over when it comes to the love and care to be offered to\n such child. However, in the unfortunate situation, where for\n\n                                                                       70 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                 71   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n several myriad factors, the parents of such child are unwilling\n to or genuinely not in a position to care for such child, then, the\n &quot;parens patriae&quot; doctrine, will oblige the State to assume\n parental responsibility in relation to such child.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\"> 132] Even apart from the &quot;parens patriae&quot; doctrine, the\n provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_281\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of\n Children) Act, 2015</a>, will apply to such an unfortunate\n situation. There are detailed provisions under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_282\">Juvenile\n Justice Act</a> to deal with cases of &quot;abandoned child&quot; as defined\n under <a href=\"/doc/1333524/\" id=\"a_283\">section 2(1)</a> or &quot;child in need of care and protection&quot; as\n defined in <a href=\"/doc/130120695/\" id=\"a_284\">section 2(14)</a> of the Juvenile Justice Act. The\n hospital/clinic authorities, must take necessary measures as\n prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_285\">Juvenile Justice Act</a> to deal with such\n unfortunate situations. The best interest of the child, must be\n the primary consideration in all such matters.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\"> 133] According to us, both the parens patriae doctrine as well\n as provisions of <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_286\">Juvenile Justice Act</a> obliged the State to\n assume parental responsibility in relation to such children.\n Therefore, the State, consistent with the provisions of the\n <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_287\">Juvenile Justice Act</a> will have to protect and take care of such\n children,         should,     such    need   arise.      Mr.      Vagyani          and\n Ms.Kantharia, the learned Government Pleaders, on the basis of\n instructions, have assured this Court, that consistent with the\n provisions of <a href=\"/doc/96409490/\" id=\"a_288\">section 27</a> of the Juvenile Justice Act, the State\n Government, where it has not already done so, will by\n notification in the Government Gazette constitute for every\n District, one or more Child Welfare Committees (CWC) for\n\n                                                                              71 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                      ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                          72   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n exercising the powers and discharging the duties conferred\n upon such Committees in relation to children in need of care\n and protection under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_289\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\"> 134] The learned Government Pleaders, on the basis of\n instructions, have assured this Court that the State and its\n agencies like CWC etc. will, after compliance prescribed\n procedures, declare such children legally &quot;free for adoption&quot;, in\n case the enquiries establish that such children have no one to\n care for or are abandoned or surrendered. In any case, we\n direct the State and its agencies to take all steps in this regard,\n keeping in mind the principle of the best interests of such\n children.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\"> 135] The learned Government Pleaders pointed out that at\n least, at major Government Hospitals in Metros as well as at\n District places, there are specialized adoption agencies, which\n facilitate adoption of such children. In any case, the learned\n Government Pleaders, again on basis of instructions, assured\n this Court that the State and its agencies will take care of such\n children, as obligated under the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_290\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>, till\n suitable means of rehabilitation are found or till such children\n attain the age of 18 years.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_178\"> 136]       We make absolute, the interim orders made in these\n petitions, on the basis of which, the petitioners, were permitted\n to medically terminate their pregnancies in circumstances\n made clear by us, in the said interim orders.</p><pre id=\"pre_16\">\n\n\n\n                                                                       72 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                              73     Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\"> 137] We are conscious that when it comes to laying down\n procedures or prescribing safeguards in such matters, the State\n and its agencies are much better poised to undertake such an\n exercise. We are therefore, of the opinion that the State, in\n consultation           with   various   stakeholders,         must        consider\n formulating suitable policies to deal with such cases, more\n particularly, when it comes to constitution of Medical Boards to\n expeditiously examine pregnant mothers and submit reports to\n this Court and the hospitals/clinics where terminations, if\n permitted, can take place in safe and hygienic conditions.\n Similarly, the State and its agencies, in consultation with\n various stakeholder, like the Juvenile Justice Boards and the\n CWCs, must also consider formulating suitable policies to deal\n with cases of children born alive, despite attempts at medical\n pregnancies, including but not restricted to issues of medical\n care, adoptions etc. However, since such matters are on the rise\n and further since the resolution of such issues brooks no delay,\n we have, relying mainly upon the decisions of the Supreme\n Court attempted to suggest procedures and safeguards, which,\n we propose to follow until the State formulates policies in such\n matters. Taking into consideration the nature of such matters\n and the necessity of expeditious resolution of such issues, it is\n obviously not possible for pregnant mothers to wait until the\n formulation of such policies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\"> 138] Accordingly, we dispose of these petitions, with the\n following orders:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">          (a)      We hold that a registered medical practitioner may\n          medically terminate pregnancy which has exceeded 20\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">                                                                             73 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                     ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                                    74   Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n          weeks, without permission from the High Court, only\n          where he is of opinion, formed in good faith, that the\n          termination of such pregnancy is immediately necessary\n          to save the life of the pregnant woman, which means that\n          the registered medical practitioner is of the opinion that\n          unless pregnancy is terminated immediately, the pregnant\n          woman might succumb (die);\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">          (b)       We hold that a registered medical practitioner is not\n          entitled to terminate pregnancy exceeding 20 weeks,\n          where such termination is not immediately necessary to\n          save the life of the pregnant woman i.e. there is no\n          immediate danger of the pregnant woman succumbing, in\n          case the pregnancy is not terminated;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">          (c)      We hold that where a pregnant woman, the length of\n          whose pregnancy has exceeded 20 weeks seeks to\n          terminate such pregnancy on the ground that its\n          continuance would involve grave injury to her physical or\n          mental health or where there is a substantial risk that if\n          the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or\n          mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped,\n          such pregnant woman will have to seek permission from\n          the High Court and unless such permission is granted, no\n          registered           medical   practitioner    can      terminate          such\n          pregnancy, inter alia on the basis of the interpretation of\n          the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_291\">section 5</a> of the MTP Act;</p><pre id=\"pre_17\">\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 74 of 78\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">::: Uploaded on - 03/04/2019                         ::: Downloaded on - 04/04/2019 04:17:32 :::</span>\n   dss                             75    Judgment-wp-10835-18-g.doc\n\n          (d)      We hold that this Court can, in exercise of its extra\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">          ordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n          of India, permit medical termination of pregnancies, the\n          length of which exceeds twenty weeks, in contingencies\n          set out in clauses (i) and (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_293\">section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP\n          Act, subject no doubt by adherence to the procedures and\n          the safeguards indicated in this judgment and order;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\">          (e)      We direct the State to constitute and establish, as\n          expeditiously as possible, and in any case within a period\n          of three months from today, Medical Boards as indicated\n          in this judgment and order, in each of the districts, to\n          examine pregnant women and to furnish reports in cases\n          where permission to medically terminate pregnancy whose\n          length exceeds twenty weeks, is sought for by institution\n          of writ petitions in this Court.
