She apprehended danger to her life, having discovered  that  her\nfetus was diagnosed with Anencephaly, a  defect  that  leaves  foetal  skull\nbones unformed and is both untreatable and certain  to  cause  the  infant’s\ndeath during or shortly after  birth.   This  condition  is  also  known  to\nendanger the mother’s life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">      By order dated 11.1.2017, while issuing  notice  to  the  respondents,\nthis Court gave a direction for examination of petitioner no.1 by a  Medical\nBoard consisting of the following seven Doctors :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">1.

This  is\nalso borne by the report dated 12.1.2017, received from the Director  (ME  &amp;\nMH)&#x27;s Office, Seth G.S. Medical College &amp; KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai –  400\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">012.\n      By  its  report  dated  12.1.2017,  the  Medical  Board  has  examined\npetitioner no.1 with specific  reference  to  their  special  expertise  for\ngeneral, medical, radiological, psychiatric and anaesthetic  evaluation.  An\nobstetric evaluation was done  by  two  Obstetricians.  Ultrasonography  was\nperformed  at  KEM  Hospital  on  12.1.2017  by  the  Additional  Professor,\nRadiology. The said Board has further reported  that  obstetric  examination\nshows 24 weeks pregnancy, external ballottement  present,  fetal  parts  not\nwell felt with mild polyhydramnios. On internal examination, the  cervix  is\nposterior and OS is closed. Ultrasonography diagnosis has revealed a  single\nlive fetus with anencephaly with mild polyhydramnios with hypotelorism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">      We have been informed that the fetus is without  a  skull  and  would,\ntherefore, not be in a position  to  survive.  It  is  also  submitted  that\npetitioner no.1 has undergone psychiatric evaluation. She is reported to  be\ncoherent,  has  average  intelligence  and  with  good  comprehension.   She\nunderstands that her fetus is abnormal and the risk of  fetal  mortality  is\nhigh. She also has the support of her husband in her decision making.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      Upon evaluation of petitioner no.1, the aforesaid  Medical  Board  has\nconcluded that her current pregnancy is of about 24 weeks. The condition  of\nthe fetus is not compatible with extra-uterine life.  In  other  words,  the\nfetus would not be able to survive outside the uterus.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">      Importantly, it is reported that the  continuation  of  pregnancy  can\ngravely endanger the physical and mental health of petitioner no.1  and  the\nrisk of her termination  of  pregnancy  is  within  acceptable  limits  with\ninstitutional back up.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      This Court, as at present being advised,  would  not  enter  into  the\nmedico-legal  aspect  of  the  identity  of  the  fetus  but   consider   it\nappropriate to decide the  matter  from  the  standpoint  of  the  right  of\npetitioner no.1 to preserve her life in view of the  foreseeable  danger  to\nit, in case she allows the current pregnancy to run  its  full  course.  The\nmedical evidence clearly suggests that there is no  point  in  allowing  the\npregnancy to run its full course since  the  fetus  would  not  be  able  to\nsurvive outside the uterus without a skull.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_2\">Suchita Srivastava and Anr. vs. Chandigarh  Administration</a>  [(2009)\n9  SCC  1],  a  bench  of  three  Judges  held  “a  woman’s  right  to  make\nreproductive  choices  is  also  a  dimension  of  ‘personal   liberty’   as\nunderstood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution”.   The  Court  there  dealt\nwith the importance of the consent of the pregnant  woman  as  an  essential\nrequirement for proceeding with the termination  of  pregnancy.   The  Court\nobserved as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">“22. There is no doubt that a woman’s right to make reproductive choices  is\nalso a dimension of “personal liberty” as understood  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article  21</a>  of\nthe Constitution of India. It is important to  recognise  that  reproductive\nchoices  can  be  exercised  to  procreate  as  well  as  to  abstain   from\nprocreating. The crucial consideration is that a woman’s right  to  privacy,\ndignity and bodily integrity should be  respected.  This  means  that  there\nshould be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive  choices\nsuch as a woman’s right  to  refuse  participation  in  sexual  activity  or\nalternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive  methods.  Furthermore,\nwomen are also free to choose  birth  control  methods  such  as  undergoing\nsterilisation procedures. Taken to their  logical  conclusion,  reproductive\nrights include a woman’s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full  term,\nto give birth and to subsequently raise children.....”\n\n      The crucial consideration in the present case is whether the right  to\nbodily integrity calls for a  permission  to  allow  her  to  terminate  her\npregnancy.  The report of the Medical Board clearly warrants  the  inference\nthat the continuance of the pregnancy involves the risk to the life  of  the\npregnant woman and a possible grave injury to her physical or mental  health\nas required by <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 3 (2)(i)</a> of  the  Medical  Termination  of  Pregnancy\nAct, 1971.  Though, the pregnancy is into the 24th week,  having  regard  to\nthe danger to the life and the certain inability of  the  fetus  to  survive\nextra uterine life, we consider it appropriate to permit the  petitioner  to\nterminate the pregnancy.  The overriding consideration is  that  she  has  a\nright to take all such steps as necessary to preserve her own  life  against\nthe avoidable danger to it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      In these circumstances given the danger  to  her  life,  there  is  no\ndoubt  that  she  has  a  right  to  protect  and  preserve  her  life   and\nparticularly since she has made an informed choice.   The  exercise  of  her\nright seems to be within the limits of reproductive autonomy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      In the circumstances, we consider it appropriate in the  interests  of\njustice and particularly, to  permit  petitioner  no.1  to  undergo  medical\ntermination of her pregnancy under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_6\">Medical Termination  of\nPregnancy Act, 1971</a>.  The learned Solicitor General  Mr.  Ranjit  Kumar  who\ntook notice on the last date of hearing  has  not  opposed  the  petitioners\nprayer on any ground, legal or medical.  We order accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      The termination of pregnancy of petitioner no.1 will be  performed  by\nthe Doctors of the  hospital  where  she  has  undergone  medical  check-up.\nFurther, termination of her pregnancy  would  be  supervised  by  the  above\nstated Medical Board who shall maintain complete  record  of  the  procedure\nwhich is  to  be  performed  on  petitioner  No.1  for  termination  of  her\npregnancy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      With the aforesaid directions, the instant writ  petition  is  allowed\nin terms of prayer  (a)  seeking  direction  to  the  respondents  to  allow\npetitioner no.1 to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       Mr.  Colin  Gonsalves,  learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\npetitioners, submits that the petitioners do not press other prayers in  the\ninstant writ petition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      We take on record the aforesaid submission made by     Mr.  Gonsalves,\nlearned counsel appearing for the petitioners.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                                    .......................J\n                                                               [S.
