JEEVAN  REDDY,  J.- This petition\t raises\t a  question\nconcerning  the\t freedom  of press vis-A-vis  the  right  to\nprivacy of the citizens of this country.

Certain other reliefs are prayed for  in\nthe writ petition but they are not pressed before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">3.Shankar @ Gauri Shankar @ Auto Shankar was charged  and\ntried  for  as many as six murders.  He\t was  convicted\t and\nsentenced to death by the learned Sessions Judge, Chenglepat\non 31-5-1991 which was confirmed by the Madras High Court on\n17-7-1992.   His appeal to this Court was dismissed on\t5-4-\n1994.  It is stated that his mercy petition to the President\nof India is pending consideration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.The  petitioners have come forward with  the\tfollowing\ncase: Auto Shankar wrote his autobiography running into\t 300\npages while confined in Chenglepat sub-jail during the\tyear\n1991.  The autobiography was handed over by him to his wife,\nSmt Jagdishwari, with the knowledge and approval of the jail\nauthorities,  for  being  delivered to\this  advocate,\tShri\nChandrasekharan.   The\tprisoner requested his\tadvocate  to\nensure\t that\this  autobiography  is\tpublished   in\t the\npetitioners&#x27;  magazine, Nakkheeran.  The petitioners  agreed\nto  the same.  Auto Shankar affirmed this desire in  several\nletters\t written to his advocate and the  first\t petitioner.\nThe  autobiography  sets  out the close\t nexus\tbetween\t the\nprisoner  and several IAS, IPS and other officers,  some  of\nwhom  were  indeed  his partners  in  several  crimes.\t The\npresence  of  several  such officers  at  the  house-warming\nceremony  of  Auto Shankar&#x27;s house is proved  by  the  video\ncassette  and  several photographs taken  on  the  occasion.\nBefore\t commencing   the   serial   publication   of\t the\nautobiography  in their magazine, the petitioners  announced\nin  the\t issue dated 21-5-1994 that very soon  the  magazine\nwould  be  coming out with the sensational life\t history  of\nAuto  Shankar.\t This announcement sent\t shock\twaves  among\nseveral\t police\t and prison officials who were\tafraid\tthat\ntheir  links with the condemned prisoner would\tbe  exposed.\nThey  forced  the said prisoner, by  applying  third  degree\nmethods, to write letters addressed to the second respondent\n(Inspector  General  of Prisons) and  the  first  petitioner\nrequesting  that his life story should not be  published  in\nthe magazine.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">637</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">Certain\t correspondence ensued between the  petitioners\t and\nthe prison authorities in this connection.  Ultimately,\t the\nInspector General of Prisons (R-2) wrote the impugned letter\ndated 15-6-1994 to the first petitioner.  The letter  states\nthat  the  petitioner&#x27;s\t assertion  that  Auto\tShankar\t had\nwritten his autobiography while confined in jail in the year\n1991   is  false.   It\tis  equally  false  that  the\tsaid\nautobiography  was handed over by the said prisoner  to\t his\nwife   with  the  knowledge  and  approval  of\tthe   prison\nauthorities.  The prisoner has himself denied the writing of\nany  such  book.   It is equally false\tthat  any  power  of\nattorney was executed by the said prisoner in favour of\t his\nadvocate,  Shri\t Chandrasekharan  in  connection  with\t the\npublication  of\t the  alleged book.  If a  prisoner  has  to\nexecute a power of attorney in favour of another, it has  to\nbe done in the presence of the prison officials as  required\nby  the\t prison rules; the prison records do  not  bear\t out\nexecution  of  any  such  power\t of  attorney.\t The  letter\nconcludes:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t      &quot;From   the   above  facts,  it\tis   clearly\n\t      established  that the serial in your  magazine\n\t      under  the caption &#x27;Shadowed Truth&#x27;  or  &#x27;Auto\n\t      Shankar&#x27;s\t dying\tdeclaration&#x27; is\t not  really\n\t      written by Gauri Shankar but it is written  by\n\t      someone else in his name.\t Writing an  article\n\t      in  a  magazine  in the name  of\ta  condemned\n\t      prisoner\tis  against prison  rules  and\tyour\n\t      claim  that the power of attorney is given  by\n\t      the  prisoner  is unlawful.  In  view  of\t all\n\t      those it is alleged that your serial  supposed\n\t      to  have written by Auto Shankar\tis  (false?)\n\t      since  with an ulterior motive for this  above\n\t      act  there will arise a situation that we\t may\n\t      take    legal   action   against\t  you\t for\n\t      blackmailing.   Hence, I request you  to\tstop\n\t      publishing the said serial forthwith.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.The  petitioners submit that the contents of the  impugned\nletter\tare untrue.  The argument of jeopardy to  prisoner&#x27;s\ninterest  is a hollow one.  The petitioners have a right  to\npublish\t the said book in their magazine as desired  by\t the\nprisoner  himself.  Indeed, the petitioners  have  published\nparts  of  the said autobiography in three issues  of  their\nmagazine dated 11-6-1994, 18-61994 and 22-6-1994 but stopped\nfurther\t publication in view of the threatening tone of\t the\nletter\tdated  15-6-1994.  The petitioners have\t reasons  to\nbelieve\t that  the police authorities may  swoop  down\tupon\ntheir  printing\t press,\t seize the issues  of  the  magazine\nbesides damaging the press and their properties, with a view\nto  terrorise  them.   On  a  previous\toccasion  when\t the\npetitioners&#x27;   magazine\t  published,   on   16-8-1991,\t  an\ninvestigative report of tapping of telephones of  opposition\nleaders\t by  the  State\t Government,  the  then\t editor\t and\npublisher  were arrested, paraded, jailed and  subjected  to\nthe third degree methods.  There have been several instances\nwhen  the  petitioners&#x27;\t press was  raided  and\t substantial\ndamage done to their press and properties.  The\t petitioners\nare apprehensive that the police officials may again do\t the\nsame since they are afraid of their links with the condemned\nprisoner  being\t exposed  by the  publication  of  the\tsaid\nautobiography.\tThe petitioners assert the freedom of  press\nguaranteed  by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, which, according  to  them,\nentitles  them\tto publish the said  autobiography.   It  is\nsubmitted that the condemned prisoner has also the undoubted\nright to have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">638</span>\nhis  life  story published and that he cannot  be  prevented\nfrom doing so.\tIt is also stated in the writ petition\tthat\nbefore approaching this Court by way of this writ  petition,\nthey  had  approached  the Madras  High\t Court\tfor  similar\nreliefs\t but  that the office of the High Court\t had  raised\ncertain\t objections  to\t the  maintainability  of  the\twrit\npetition.   A learned Single Judge of the High Court, it  is\nstated,\t heard the petitioners in connection with  the\tsaid\nobjections but no orders were passed thereon till the filing\nof the writ petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.Respondents  2  and 3 have filed  a  counter-affidavit,\nsworn  to by Shri T.S. Panchapakesan, Inspector\t General  of\nPrisons,  State\t of  Tamil  Nadu.   At\tthe  outset,  it  is\nsubmitted that the writ petition filed by the petitioners in\nthe High Court was dismissed by the learned Single Judge  on\n28-6-1994  holding inter alia that the question whether\t the\nsaid  prisoner\thad  indeed written  his  autobiography\t and\nauthorised the petitioners to publish the same is a disputed\nquestion  of fact.  This was so held in view of the  failure\nof  the learned counsel for the petitioners to\tproduce\t the\nalleged\t letters written by the prisoner to his counsel,  or\nto   the  petitioners,\tauthorising  them  to  publish\t his\nautobiography.\tIt is submitted that the letter dated  15-6-\n1994  was  addressed  to the first  petitioner\tinasmuch  as\n&quot;there\twas a genuine doubt regarding the authorship of\t the\nautobiography alleged to have been written by the  condemned\nprisoner  while\t he  was in  prison  and  which\t purportedly\nreached\t his wife.  Besides, it was also not  clear  whether\nthe  said  prisoner had as a matter of fact  authorised\t the\npetitioner  to\tpublish\t the  said  autobiography.   In\t the\ncontext of such a disputed claim both as to authenticity  as\nwell as the authority to publish the said autobiography, the\nsaid communication was addressed to the petitioners  herein,\nsince the petitioners have threatened to publish  derogatory\nand  scurrilous\t statements  purporting to  (be?)  based  on\nmaterial   which   are\t to  be\t found\t in   the   disputed\nautobiography,&quot;\t It is submitted that the allegation that  a\nnumber\tof  IAS,  IPS  and  other  officers  patronised\t the\ncondemned prisoner in his nefarious activities is  baseless.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;It is only in the context of such a situation coupled\twith\nthe  fact that the petitioner might under the guise of\tsuch\nan  autobiography tarnish the image of the  persons  holding\nresponsible   positions\t in  public  institution  that\t the\ncommunication  dated  15-6-1994 was sent to  him&quot;,  say\t the\nrespondents.  They also denied that they subjected the\tsaid\nprisoner  to  third degree methods to  pressurise  him\tinto\nwriting letters denying the authorisation to the petitioners\nto publish his life story.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">7.Neither  Auto Shankar nor his wife  nor his counsel\nare  made  parties to this writ petition.  We  do  not\thave\ntheir  version\ton  the disputed  question  of\tfact,  viz.,\nwhether\t Auto Shankar has indeed written  his  autobiography\nand/or\t whether   he  had  requested  or   authorised\t the\npetitioners to publish the same in their magazine.  In\tthis\nwrit  petition\tunder  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 32</a> of  the  Constitution,  we\ncannot go into such a disputed question of fact.

We must,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">639</span>\nhowever,  make it clear that ours is only an assumption\t for\nthe purpose of this writ petition and not a finding of fact.\nThe said disputed question may have to be gone into, as\t and\nwhen necessary, before an appropriate court or forum, as the\ncase may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\t      8.On the pleadings in this petition, following\n\t      questions arise:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      (1)Whether  a citizen of this  country  can\n\t      prevent  another person from writing his\tlife\n\t      story  or biography?

If the Court does find that a\n\t      claimed  right is entitled to protection as  a\n\t      fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it\n\t      must  satisfy  the compelling  State  interest\n\t      test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\t       *\t *\t    *\n\t      privacy primarily concerns the individual.

The second is  that\t individuals\n\t      need  a place of sanctuary where they  can  be\n\t      free from societal control.

He took the plea that  the\tsaid\nprovision  contravened Section 12(1) of the Constitution  of\nAntigua\t and Barbuda which provided that no person shall  be\nhindered in the enjoyment of freedom of expression.  At\t the\nsame time, sub-section (4) of Section 12 stated that nothing\ncontained  in or done under the authority of law was  to  be\nheld  inconsistent with or in contravention  of\t sub-section\n12(1) to the extent that the law in question made provisions\nreasonably required in the interest of public order.

In the course  of\t his\nspeech, Lord Bridge of Harwich observed thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t      &quot;In a free democratic society it is almost too\n\t      obvious  to need stating that those  who\thold\n\t      office  in Government and who are\t responsible\n\t      for\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">\t      23  (1990)  2  AC 312: (1990)  2\tAll  ER\t 103\n\t      :(1990) 2 WLR 606, PC\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\t      648</span>\n\t      public  administration must always be open  to\n\t      criticism.   Any attempt to stifle  or  fetter\n\t      such criticism amounts to political censorship\n\t      of the most insidious and objectionable  kind.\n\t      At  the same time it is no less  obvious\tthat\n\t      the very purpose of criticism leveled at those\n\t      who  have\t the conduct of\t public\t affairs  by\n\t      their  political\topponents  is  to  undermine\n\t      public confidence in their stewardship and  to\n\t      persuade\tthe  electorate that  the  opponents\n\t      would  make  a  better job of  it\t than  those\n\t      presently\t holding  office.  In the  light  of\n\t      these  considerations their  Lordships  cannot\n\t      help  viewing  a\tstatutory  provision   which\n\t\t\t    criminalities  statements likely  to  undermin\ne\n\t      public  confidence  in the conduct  of  public\n\t      affairs with the utmost suspicion.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">21.The question is how far the principles emerging from\t the\nUnited\tStates and English decisions are relevant under\t our\nconstitutional\tsystem.\t So far as the freedom of  press  is\nconcerned,   it\t flows\tfrom  the  freedom  of\tspeech\t and\nexpression  guaranteed\tby <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>  But  the\tsaid\nright  is subject to reasonable restrictions placed  thereon\nby  an existing law or a law made after the commencement  of\nthe  Constitution in the interests of or in relation to\t the\nseveral matters set out therein.  Decency and defamation are\ntwo  of the grounds mentioned in clause (2).  Law  of  torts\nproviding  for damages for invasion of the right to  privacy\nand  defamation\t and <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 499</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_11\">500</a> IPC are  the  existing\nlaws  saved under clause (2).  But what is called for  today\nin the present times  is a proper balancing of the  freedom\nof press and said laws consistent with the democratic way of\nlife  ordained\tby  the Constitution.\tOver  the  last\t few\ndecades,  press and electronic media have emerged  as  major\nfactors\t in our nation&#x27;s life.\tThey are still\texpanding\nand in the process becoming more inquisitive.  Our system of\nGovernment demands  as do the systems of Government of\tthe\nUnited\tStates\tof  America and United\tKingdom\t  constant\nvigilance  over exercise of governmental power by the  press\nand  the  media among others.  It is essential\tfor  a\tgood\nGovernment.   At  the same time, we must remember  that\t our\nsociety\t may  not  share  the  degree  of  public  awareness\nobtaining in United Kingdom or United States.  The sweep  of\nthe  First Amendment to the United States  Constitution\t and\nthe freedom of speech and expression under our\tConstitution\nis  not\t identical though similar in their  major  premises.\nAll  this may call for some modification of  the  principles\nemerging  from\tthe English and United States  decisions  in\ntheir application to our legal system.\tThe broad principles\nset  out hereinafter are evolved keeping in mind  the  above\nconsiderations.\t  But before we set out those principles,  a\nfew more aspects need to be dealt with.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">22.We may now consider whether the State or its\t officials\nhave  the authority in law to impose a prior restraint\tupon\npublication  of material defamatory of the State or  of\t the\nofficials,  as\tthe  case may be?  We  think  not.   No\t law\nempowering  them  to  do so is brought to  our\tnotice.\t  As\nobserved  in  New York Times v. United\tStateS24,  popularly\nknown  as  the Pentagon papers case, &quot;any  system  of  prior\nrestraints of (freedom of) expression comes to this\n24 (1971) 403 US 713 : 29 L Ed 2d 822 (197 1)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">649</span>\nCourt bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional\nvalidity&quot; and that in such cases, the Government &quot;carries  a\nheavy burden of showing justification for the imposition  of\nsuch  a restraint&quot;.  We must accordingly hold that  no\tsuch\nprior restraint or prohibition of publication can be imposed\nby  the\t respondents upon the proposed\tpublication  of\t the\nalleged autobiography of &quot;Auto Shankar&quot; by the\tpetitioners.\nThis cannot be done either by the State or by its officials.\nIn other words, neither the Government nor the officials who\napprehend that they may be defamed, have the right to impose\na  prior  restraint  upon the  publication  of\tthe  alleged\nautobiography  of  Auto\t Shankar.   The\t remedy\t of   public\nofficials/public figures, if any, will arise only after\t the\npublication and will be governed by the principles indicated\nherein.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">23.We  must  make  it clear that we  do\t not  express  any\nopinion\t about\tthe right of the State or its  officials  to\nprosecute the petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 499</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_13\">500</a> IPC.\tThis\nis  for the reason that even if they are entitled to do\t so,\nthere is no law under which they can prevent the publication\nof a material on the ground that such material is likely  to\nbe defamatory of them.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Question No. 3</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">24.It  is  not stated in the counter-affidavit\tthat  Auto\nShankar had requested or authorised the prison officials  or\nthe  Inspector\tGeneral of Prisons, as the case may  be,  to\nadopt  appropriate  proceedings\t to  protect  his  right  to\nprivacy.  If so, the respondents cannot take upon themselves\nthe  obligation\t of  protecting his right  to  privacy.\t  No\nprison\trule  is brought to our notice\twhich  empowers\t the\nprison\tofficials to do so.  Moreover, the occasion for\t any\nsuch  action  arises  only after  the  publication  and\t not\nbefore, as indicated hereinabove.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">25.Lastly,  we must deal with the objection raised by  the\nrespondent  as\tto the maintainability of the  present\twrit\npetition.  It is submitted that having filed a writ petition\nfor  similar  reliefs in the Madras High  Court,  which\t was\ndismissed as not maintainable under a considered order,\t the\npetitioners  could  not\t have approached  this\tCourt  under\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_14\">Article\t 32</a> of the Constitution.  The petitioners,  however,\ndid disclose the above fact but they stated that on the date\nof their filing the writ petition, no orders were pronounced\nby the Madras High Court.  It appears that the writ petition\nwas filed at about the time the learned Single Judge of\t the\nMadras\tHigh  Court  pronounced the  orders  on\t the  office\nobjections.  Having regard to the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, we are not inclined to throw out the writ petition\non  the said ground.  The present writ petition can also  be\nand  is hereby treated as a special leave  petition  against\nthe orders of the learned Single Judge of the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">26.  We may now summarise the broad principles flowing\tfrom\nthe above discussion:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t      (1)The right to privacy is implicit in  the\n\t      right  to life and liberty guaranteed  to\t the\n\t      citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21.</a>  It is\n\t      a\t &quot;right to be let alone&quot;.  A citizen  has  a\n\t      right to safeguard the privacy of his own,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">650</span>\nhis family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing\nand  education\tamong  other  matters.\t None  can   publish\nanything concerning the above matters without his consent\nwhether\t truthful  or  otherwise and  whether  laudatory  or\ncritical.  If he does so, he would be violating the right to\nprivacy\t of the person concerned and would be liable  in  an\naction for damages.  Position may, however, be different, if\na  person  voluntarily thrusts himself into  controversy  or\nvoluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n(2)The\trule aforesaid is subject to the  exception,  that\nany  publication  concerning the aforesaid  aspects  becomes\nunobjectionable\t if  such publication is based\tupon  public\nrecords\t including  court records.  This is for\t the  reason\nthat  once a matter becomes a matter of public\trecord,\t the\nright  to  privacy  no\tlonger subsists\t and  it  becomes  a\nlegitimate  subject  for comment by press  and\tmedia  among\nothers.\t  We  are,  however,  of the  opinion  that  in\t the\ninterests  of  decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(2)</a> an exception  must  be\ncarved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of\na sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should\nnot  further be subjected to the indignity of her  name\t and\nthe incident being publicised in press/media.\n(3)There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">- indeed, this is not an exception but an independent  rule.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">In  the\t case of public officials, it is obvious,  right  to\nprivacy,  or  for  that matter, the  remedy  of\t action\t for\ndamages\t is simply not available with respect to their\tacts\nand  conduct  relevant to the discharge\t of  their  official\nduties.\t This is so even where the publication is based upon\nfacts and statements which are not true, unless the official\nestablishes that the publication was made (by the defendant)\nwith reckless disregard for truth.  In such a case, it would\nbe  enough for the defendant (member of the press or  media)\nto  prove that he acted after a reasonable  verification  of\nthe facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what he\nhas  written is true.  Of course, where the  publication  is\nproved\tto  be\tfalse and actuated  by\tmalice\tor  personal\nanimosity, the defendant would have no defence and would  be\nliable\tfor damages.  It is equally obvious that in  matters\nnot  relevant  to the discharge of his\tduties,\t the  public\nofficial enjoys the same protection as any other citizen, as\nexplained  in  (1) and (2) above.  It needs  no\t reiteration\nthat  judiciary, which is protected by the power  to  punish\nfor  contempt  of  court  and  Parliament  and\tlegislatures\nprotected  as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles 105</a>  and\t <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_18\">104</a>\nrespectively   of  the\tConstitution  of  India,   represent\nexceptions to this rule.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\t      (4)So   far   as\tthe   Government,   local\n\t      authority\t and other organs  and\tinstitutions\n\t      exercising  governmental power are  concerned,\n\t      they  cannot maintain a suit for\tdamages\t for\n\t      defaming them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">\t      (5)Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that\n\t      <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_19\">Official\tSecrets\t Act, 1923</a>, or\tany  similar\n\t      enactment or provision having the force of law\n\t      does not bind the press or media.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\t      651</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\t      (6)There is no law empowering the State  or\n\t      its  officials  to prohibit, or  to  impose  a\n\t      prior restraint upon the press/media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">27.We  may  hasten  to\tadd  that  the\tprinciples   above\nmentioned  are only the broad principles.  They are  neither\nexhaustive nor all-comprehending; indeed no such enunciation\nis possible or advisable.  As rightly pointed out by Mathew,\nJ., this right has to go through a case-by-case development.\nThe  concepts dealt with herein are still in the process  of\nevolution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">28.In  all  this discussion, we may clarify, we\t have  not\ngone  into the impact of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> read\twith  clause\n(2)  thereof  on <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 499</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_22\">500</a> of  the  Indian  Penal\nCode.  That may have to await a proper case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">29.Applying the above principles, it must be held that the\npetitioners have a right to publish, what they allege to  be\nthe  life story/autobiography of Auto Shankar insofar as  it\nappears from the public records, even without his consent or\nauthorisation.\t But if they go beyond that and publish\t his\nlife  story, they may be invading his right to\tprivacy\t and\nwill be liable for the consequences in accordance with\tlaw.\nSimilarly,  the\t State or its officials\t cannot\t prevent  or\nrestrain  the said publication.\t The remedy of the  affected\npublic\tofficials/public  figures,  if\tany,  is  after\t the\npublication, as explained hereinabove.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">30.The\twrit petition is accordingly allowed in the  above\nterms.\tNo costs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">652</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">653</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">654</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">655</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">656</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">657</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">658</span>\n\n\n\n","numcites":9,"numcitedby":172,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":501107,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"defamation","formInput":"defamation"},{"value":"freedom of press","formInput":"freedom%20of%20press"},{"value":"auto shankar","formInput":"auto%20shankar"},{"value":"rape ","formInput":"rape%20"},{"value":"prior restraint","formInput":"prior%20restraint"},{"value":"article 32","formInput":"article%2032"},{"value":"freedom of speech","formInput":"freedom%20of%20speech"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"libel","formInput":"libel"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"false statement","formInput":"false%20statement"},{"value":"rape victim","formInput":"rape%20victim"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"torts","formInput":"torts"},{"value":"personal right","formInput":"personal%20right"},{"value":"public figure","formInput":"public%20figure"},{"value":"article 19 1 a ","formInput":"article%2019%201%20a%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"free-speech","formInput":"tag:free-speech"},{"value":"appeal-to-supreme-court, power-to-issue-writ","formInput":"tag:appeal-to-supreme-court, power-to-issue-writ"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"defamation","formInput":"tag:defamation"},{"value":"punishment-for-defamation","formInput":"tag:punishment-for-defamation"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
