Surat alias Sujja, is an accused in\n\nFIR No.318 dated 12.9.2004, registered under Sections 302/102-\n\nB/216/201/148/149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\">IPC</a> and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 25</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_3\">54</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_4\">59</a> of the Arms Act. After his\n\narrest the police filed an application, before the J.M.I.C. Ferozepur Jhirka\n\nfor being allowed to take his blood sample. On 7.12.2004, the Surat @ Sujja\n\nmade a statement before the Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ferozepur Jhirka\n\nthat he has no objection if his blood sample is taken. The Magistrate,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> Crl. Rev.

Surat @ Sujja, filed Criminal Revision No.34 of 2004/2006,\n\nchallenging this order. Vide order dated 3.5.2007, the revision was\n\ndismissed. It appears that when the doctor visited the jail to take a blood\n\nsample but Surat @ Sujja refused to cooperate, thus compelling the doctor\n\nto return.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">             The petitioner/complainant filed an application praying that the\n\nprosecution should be directed to take the blood sample of the accused by\n\nusing force as prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 53</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\n(hereinafter referred to as `the Code&#x27;). The trial court dismissed the\n\napplication by holding that a second application, for taking a blood sample\n\nis not maintainable and even otherwise an accused cannot be forced to\n\nfurnish his blood sample.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">             Counsel for the petitioner submits, that Section 53 of the Code,\n\nallows the use of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for &quot;examination&quot; of the person of an\n\naccused. The accused agreed and, thereafter, refused to undergo a blood\n\ntest. The trial court should have, therefore, directed the Civil Surgeon,\n\nGurgaon to use &quot;reasonable force&quot;, for the purpose of drawing a blood\n\nsample for the purpose of D.N.A. profiling. It is further submitted that the\n\ncourts below misconstrued the prayer in the application as in essence, the\n\nprayer is to carry out the order dated 7.12.2004 in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Section 53 of the Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">             Counsel for the accused, on the other hand, submits that though\n\nhe does not dispute the facts but in view of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, the accused cannot be forced to give a blood sample.

It is further submitted that\n\nas the respondent had already refused to furnish his blood sample, the\n\nsecond application for the same purpose is not maintainable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">            I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\norders passed by the courts below. It is not disputed that respondent no.2\n\nvoluntarily agreed to provide a blood sample but later refused to cooperate.\n\nThe question that falls for adjudication is whether the prosecution can be\n\nallowed to use force to take a blood sample of an accused.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">            The argument against the use of force for an invasive\n\n&quot;examination&quot; of the person of an accused flows from <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 20(3)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 20(3)</a> mandates that no person\n\naccused of an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> protects the life and personal liberty of a person and its import\n\nextends to the protection of personal privacy, except in accordance with\n\nthe procedure established by law. A long line of judicial precedents have\n\nconsistently held that where the intrinsic character of the evidence does not\n\nundergo a change, an order calling upon an accused to submit to a physical\n\nexamination of his person would not breach the protective wall of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_12\">Article\n\n20(3)</a> of the Constitution, as it does not fall within the mischief of the\n\nexpression &quot;to be a witness&quot;. Evidence like finger prints, hair and skin\n\nsamples, blood and semen sample, to name a few, are unvariable constants\n\nand, therefore,   the calling cards of the genetic make up of a person. An\n\norder requiring an accused to undergo an &quot;examination&quot; would not fall\n\nwithin the mischief of the expression &quot;to be a witness&quot;. Reference in this\n\nregard would necessarily have to be made to a judgment of the Supreme\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> Crl. Rev.

In other words, the mere fact of being in\n\n                  police custody at the time when the statement in question\n\n                  was made would not, by itself, as a proposition of law,\n\n                  lend itself to the inference that the accused was\n\n                  compelled to make the statement, though that fact, in\n\n                  conjunction with other circumstances disclosed in\n\n                  evidence in a particular case, would be a relevant\n\n                  consideration in an enquiry whether or not the accused\n\n                  person had been compelled to make the impugned\n\n                  statement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                  2. The mere questioning of an accused person by a police\n\n                  officer, resulting in a voluntary statement, which may\n\n                  ultimately turn out       to be incriminatory, is not\n\n                  &#x27;compulsion&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                  3. &#x27;To be a witness&#x27; is not equivalent to &#x27;furnishing\n\n                  evidence&#x27; in its widest significance; that is to say, as\n\n                  including not merely making of oral or written statements\n\n                  but also production of documents or giving materials\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> Crl.

Case law has gone\n\n                   beyond this strict literal interpretation of the expression\n\n                   which may now bear a wider meaning, namely, bearing\n\n                   testimony in Court or out of Court by a person accused of\n\n                   an offence, orally or in writing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                   7.

It\n\n                 may render the very grounds on which divorce is\n\n                 permissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to\n\n                 privacy specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n                 Constitution   of   India    and   with    the   extensive\n\n                 interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right\n\n                 has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as\n\n                 absolute right. What is emphasized is that some\n\n                 limitations on this right have to be imposed and\n\n                 particularly where two competing interests clash. In\n\n                 matters of aforesaid nature where the legislature has\n\n                 conferred a right upon his spouse to seek divorce on such\n\n                 grounds, it would be the right of that spouse which\n\n                 comes in conflict with the so-called right to privacy of\n\n                 the respondent.
