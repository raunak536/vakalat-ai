In this regard, the petitioner had\n\nsubmitted an application dated 03.09.2021 and an affidavit dated 01.03.2022\n\nbefore the SHO Police Station, City Jagadhari and DSP, Headquarter Jagadhari\n\nand the police also recorded the statement of petitioner in this regard.

However, while referring to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1235517/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 33 (1)</a> of\n\nthe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and\n\nServices) Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the Aadhaar Act), the said\n\nauthority had refused to supply the desired information to the police. Learned\n\ncounsel further contends that without specific orders by this Court, the UIDAI\n\nauthority would not provide any information, which is necessary to trace his\n\nmissing daughter.\n\n            During the proceedings of the present case, a status report dated\n\n27.02.2023 by way of affidavit of Deputy Superintendent of Police, Yamuna\n\nNagar was filed before this Court. It was stated that a new Special Investigation\n\nTeam headed by DSP, Headquarters, Yamuna Nagar had been constituted on\n\n22.02.2023. After the constitution of the SIT, best efforts were made to recover\n\nRukhsana daughter of the petitioner and the police also went to village Gaju,\n\nPatiala Punjab and enquiry was made regarding the missing girl, but her\n\nwhereabouts could not be known. During the course of investigation, it was also\n\nfound that the Aadhaar card of the missing girl namely, Rukhsana had been\n\nfound activated but the whereabouts of the said person had not been found. It\n\nwas also stated that a letter No. 9082, dated 23.02.2022 had been written to the\n\nDirector, UIDAI, Regional Officer, Chandigarh to supply the information of\n\n\n\n\n                                       2 of 13\n                    ::: Downloaded on - 03-06-2023 15:34:51 :::\n                                                                         Neutral Citation No:=\n\n\n\n\nCRM-W-1526-2022 in CRWP-1524 of 2016                                    - 3-\n\nAadhaar Card holder and address and mobile number of the missing girl. But\n\nthe Section Officer, Ministry of Electronic &amp; IT, Government of India, UIDAI,\n\nChandigarh had intimated that the <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_3\">Aadhaar Act, 2016</a>, restrained the sharing of\n\ninformation procured from Aadhaar number holders except as per the\n\nprovisions of Aadhaar Card. The DSP also annexed the copy of the letter dated\n\n24.02.2022, whereby UIDAI had refused to supply the desired information.\n\nApart from that, the DSP Yamuna Nagar also filed an affidavit dated\n\n26.03.2022, before this Court with a prayer to direct UIDAI to provide the\n\nrequisite information as sought by them vide letter dated 23.02.2022.\n\n               In response to the notice, a short reply has been filed on behalf of\n\nUnique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). Mr. Arvind Moudgil, learned\n\ncounsel for UIDAI submits that the UIDAI is required to maintain the security\n\nand confidentiality of the identity information and authentication records of\n\nindividuals. <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_4\">The Aadhaar Act, 2016</a> (as amended) imposes restrictions on\n\nsharing of information. He further contends that the disclosure of information,\n\nincluding identity information or authentication records (except the core\n\nbiometric information) can only be made in accordance with the provisions of\n\nSection 33 (1) of Aadhaar Card 2016 (as amended by Aadhaar (Amendment)\n\nAct of 2019). Learned counsel further submits that an order for disclosure of\n\ninformation can be made only by this Court after giving an opportunity of\n\nhearing to UIDAI and the concerned Aadhaar number card holder also. In the\n\npresent case, an order directing UIDAI to disclose the required information can\n\nbe passed only after hearing the missing girl namely, Rukhsana as she is the\n\nAadhaar card number holder in the present case and prayed for dismissal of the\n\napplication.\n\n\n\n\n                                       3 of 13\n                    ::: Downloaded on - 03-06-2023 15:34:51 :::\n                                                                        Neutral Citation No:=\n\n\n\n\nCRM-W-1526-2022 in CRWP-1524 of 2016                                   - 4-\n\n             I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have considered\n\nthe rival submissions made by them.\n\n             As per the statement of objects and reasons of <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_5\">Aadhaar Act, 2016</a>,\n\nthe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) was established by a\n\nresolution of Government of India, Planning Commission vide the notification\n\ndated 28.01.2009. The object of the establishment of the said authority was\n\nprimarily to lay down policies and to implement the Unique Identification\n\nScheme of the Government, by which the residents of India were to be provided\n\nunique identity number. This number, when authenticated successfully, would\n\nserve as a proof of identity and could be used for identification of the\n\nbeneficiaries for the transfer of benefits, subsidies, services and other purposes.\n\nLater on, it was felt that the process of enrolment, authentication, security,\n\nconfidentiality and use of Aadhaar card related information should be made\n\nstatutory so as to facilitate the use of Aadhaar number for the delivery of\n\nvarious benefits, subsidies and services, the expenditures of which were\n\nincurred from or receipt therefrom formed part of consolidated fund of India.\n\nOver a period of time, the use of Aadhaar card had increased manifold. As a\n\nresult, commensurate measures relating to ensuring the security of such\n\ninformation were taken and the offences pertaining to certain unlawful actions\n\nwere created. <a href=\"/doc/47062758/\" id=\"a_6\">The Act</a> was enacted in the year 2016, which was further\n\namended by Act No. 14 of 2019.\n\n             In order to appreciate the controversy involved in the present case,\n\nit would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant provisions of law in the\n\npresent case.\n\n          &quot;28.

We have held that this provision is to be read down\n          with the clarification that an individual, whose information is sought\n          to be released, shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing. If such an\n          order is passed, in that eventuality, he shall also have right to\n          challenge such an order passed by approaching the higher court.\n          During the hearing before the court concerned, the said individual\n          can always object to the disclosure of information on accepted\n          grounds in law, including <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution or the\n          privacy rights, etc.\n\n                       &quot;513.6. Insofar as <a href=\"/doc/1682870/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 33(2)</a> is concerned, it is held\n          that disclosure of information in the interest of national security\n          cannot be faulted with. However, for determination of such an\n          eventuality, an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary\n          should be given such a power. Further, in order to avoid any possible\n          misuse, a Judicial Officer (preferably a sitting High Court Judge)\n          should also be associated with. We may point out that such\n\n\n\n                                     8 of 13\n                  ::: Downloaded on - 03-06-2023 15:34:51 :::\n                                                                         Neutral Citation No:=\n\n\n\n\nCRM-W-1526-2022 in CRWP-1524 of 2016                                    - 9-\n\n          provisions of application of judicial mind for arriving at the\n          conclusion that disclosure of information is in the interest of national\n          security, are prevalent in some jurisdictions. In view thereof, <a href=\"/doc/1682870/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n          33(2)</a> of the Act in the present form is struck down with liberty to\n          enact a suitable provision on the lines suggested above.\n\n             Apart from that, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court considered the need to\n\nprotect the privacy interests of individuals, while furthering the legitimate State\n\ninterests. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also directed the State to embark upon\n\nthe exercise of balancing of competing interests. While dwelling on &quot;Right to\n\nPrivacy&quot;, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held in the matter of K.S. Puttaswamy\n\nVersus Union of India 2019 (1) SCC as follows:-\n\n                        &quot;109.6. Right to privacy cannot be impinged without a\n\n          just, fair and reasonable law.

While it intervenes to protect legitimate State interests, the\n          State interests, the State must nevertheless put into place a robust\n          regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold requirement. These\n          three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just\n          informational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and\n          content-based mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement is an\n          express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21.</a> For, no person can be deprived\n          that there must be a law in existence to justify an encroachment on\n          privacy of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\n          procedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential\n          requirement Second, the requirement of a need, in terms of a\n          legitimate State aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law\n          which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of reasonableness\n          mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 14</a>, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State\n          action. The pursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does\n          not suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate,\n          involves a value judgment. Judicial review does not reappreciate or\n\n\n\n                                      9 of 13\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 03-06-2023 15:34:51 :::</span>\n                                                                           Neutral Citation No:=\n\n\n\n\nCRM-W-1526-2022 in CRWP-1524 of 2016                                      - 10-\n\n          second guess the value judgment of the legislature but is for deciding\n          whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable\n          or manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the\n          means which are adopted by the legislature are proportional to the\n          object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law. Proportionality is\n          an essential facet of the guarantee against arbitrary State action\n          because it ensures that the nature and quality of the encroachment on\n          the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence, the\n          threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual\n          interdependence between the fundamental guarantees against\n          arbitrariness on the one hand and the protection of life and personal\n          liberty, on the other. The right to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of\n          the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is\n          subject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">                 311. Apart from national security, the State may have\n          justifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data. In a social\n          welfare State, the Government embarks upon programmes which\n          provide benefits to impoverished and marginalised sections of\n          society. There is a vital State interest in ensuring that scarce public\n          resources are not dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons\n          who do not qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\n          development is coupled with a legitimate concern that the utilisation\n          of resources should not be siphoned away for extraneous purposes.\n          Data mining with the object of ensuring that resources are properly\n          deployed to legitimate beneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to\n          insist on the collection of authentic data. But, the data which the\n          State has collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of the\n          State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for extraneous\n          purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate concerns of the State\n          are duly safeguarded while, at the same time, protecting privacy\n          concerns. Prevention and investigation of crime and protection of the\n          revenue are among the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms\n          are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social welfare State.\n          Information technology -legitimately deployed is a powerful enabler\n          in the spread of innovation and knowledge.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">             Further, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held in a catena of\n\njudgments that privacy has been held to be integral element of right to life and\n\npersonal liberty, which has been guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India. As right to life and liberty is not absolute, similarly right to privacy can\n\nalso never be held to be the absolute right and has always subjected to certain\n\nlimitations. A law, which encroaches upon the privacy has to withstand the\n\ntouchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights.

The law must also be valid with reference to\n\nthe encroachment on life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">             This Court, being a constitutional Court, is also cognizant of the\n\nfact that the Judge has to ensure that life and liberty is preserved and has to\n\nbalance the same. If any information is required to protect the legitimate State\n\ninterests or public interests, the disclosure of the same can never be said to be in\n\nviolation of Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act. As held above, even the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that this Court has to balance between the legitimate\n\nconcerns of the State and the privacy concerns of the individuals. Prevention\n\nand investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are among the\n\nlegitimate aims of the State. In the instant case, the learned counsel appearing\n\non behalf of UIDAI has opposed the disclosure of the information by taking\n\nshelter of the provisions of Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act. However, the said\n\nprovision of the Act has now been read down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe matter of K.S. Puttaswamy Versus Union of India 2019 (1) SCC (Supra).\n\nIn order to exercise the powers under <a href=\"/doc/993519/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 33</a> of the Act, a strong case has\n\nbeen made out by the aggrieved person. The petitioner/applicant in the present\n\ncase is an unfortunate father, who has invoked the constitutional powers of this\n\nCourt to direct the police authorities to trace his missing daughter namely\n\nRukhsana, who is missing for the last seven years. During the course of\n\ninvestigation, as is apparent from the affidavit filed by the head of the SIT, that\n\nthe Aadhaar Card of missing girl Rukhsana has been found activated, but her\n\nwhereabouts had not been found. Even the investigation conducted by SIT, has\n\n\n\n\n                                     11 of 13\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                   ::: Downloaded on - 03-06-2023 15:34:51 :::</span>\n                                                                          Neutral Citation No:=\n\n\n\n\nCRM-W-1526-2022 in CRWP-1524 of 2016                                     - 12-\n\ncome to a grinding halt as UIDAI has refused to divulge the information\n\nrelating to updation of Aadhaar card No. 380791154552, which belongs to the\n\nmissing girl Rukhsana. This action on the part on UIDAI clearly infringes upon\n\nthe rights of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, as right\n\nto fair investigation is an integral element of right to life and liberty. Apart from\n\nthat, the denial of such information not only violates the rights of the petitioner,\n\nbut also tramples upon the right of the abducted girl namely Rukhsana, who can\n\nnever be deprived of her right to          live with dignity with    her family as\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. In the instant case,\n\napparently from the investigation conducted so far, it is apparent that Rukhsana\n\nhas been kidnapped by certain individuals and it is quite possible that she has\n\nbeen confined by some unknown criminals illegally. Consequently, even\n\nRukhsana cannot be denied of her right to fair investigation, even though she is\n\nnot a petitioner before this Court. But, being a guardian of constitutional rights\n\nof a citizen, this Court can always take cognizance of the same and can also\n\nensure the grant of same to the individuals, who had not even been able to\n\nknock the doors of this Court for redressal of their grievances. Even the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the matter of K.S. Puttaswamy Versus Union of India 2019\n\n(1) SCC (Supra) has clearly held that the data can be collected by the State for\n\nutilisation of legitimate purposes of the State and the prevention and\n\ninvestigation of crime are among the legitimate aims of the State. Thus, the\n\nobjections raised by UIDAI are repelled in view of the discussion above.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_4\">Learned Senior Panel Counsel appearing for UIDAI also relied\n\nupon interim order 20.01.2021 passed by a Division Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nBombay High Court.
