On an avid and\n                                          diligent discernment of the Preamble, it is manifest that it\n                                          recognises the necessity of the right to privacy and\n                                          confidentiality of a child to be protected and respected by\n                                          every person by all means and through all stages of a\n                                          judicial process involving the child. Best interest and well-\n                                          being are regarded as being of paramount importance at\n                                          every stage to ensure the healthy physical, emotional,\n                                          intellectual and social development of the child. There is\n                                          also a stipulation that sexual exploitation and sexual abuse\n                                          are heinous offences and need to be effectively addressed.\n                                          The Statement of Objects and Reasons provides regard\n                                          being had to the constitutional mandate, to direct its\n                                          policy towards securing that the tender age of children\n                                          is not abused and their childhood is protected against\n                                          exploitation and they are given facilities to develop in a\n                                          healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and\n                                          dignity.

So, the courts should deal with such cases\n                                            sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from being a\n                                            dehumanising act, is an unlawful intrusion on the right of\n                                            privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious blow to\n                                            her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and\n                                            dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim\n                                            and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a\n                                            minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A\n                                            rapist not only causes physical injuries, but leaves\n                                            behind a scar on the most cherished position of a\n                                            woman i.e. her dignity, honour, reputation and\n                                            chastity. Rape is not only an offence against the person\n                                            of a woman, rather a crime against the entire society.

Rape is a crime and\n                                          not a medical condition. Rape is a legal term and not a\n                                          diagnosis to be made by the medical officer treating the\n                                          victim. The only statement that can be made by the\n                                          medical officer is to the effect whether there is evidence\n                                          of recent sexual activity. Whether the rape has occurred\n                                          or not is a legal conclusion, not a medical one.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">                                                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">                                          21.
