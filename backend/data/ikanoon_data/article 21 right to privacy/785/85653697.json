In the last week of October\n\n2016, after closing of the college, when the prosecutrix along\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   3</span>\n\n\nwith her friends was going to her house, then the appellant\n\nwho, had come with Bobby, happened to see the prosecutrix\n\nand told his friend Bobby that he liked her. The appellant also\n\nasked his friend Bobby to put forward a proposal of friendship\n\non his behalf to the prosecutrix. Bobby gave the mobile phone\n\nnumber of the prosecutrix to the appellant. When the appellant\n\nmade a telephone call to the prosecutrix she then asked him,\n\nfrom where he had obtained her mobile phone number, who, in\n\nturn, disclosed that he had obtained her mobile phone number\n\nfrom someone. On this, the prosecutrix asked the appellant not\n\nto make telephone calls to her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3          On the next day, when the prosecutrix had gone to\n\nher college, then she asked Bobby that to whom he had given\n\nher mobile phone number and Bobby disclosed that he had\n\ngiven her mobile phone number to the appellant as he was\n\nasking for the same. On this, the prosecutrix told Bobby that\n\nthe appellant was harassing/troubling her by making repeated\n\ntelephone calls. Then, Bobby telephoned the appellant from\n\nmobile phone of the prosecutrix and advised him not to trouble\n\nher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4          On the next day, the appellant visited her college\n\nand was angry and asked the prosecutrix as to when had he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    4</span>\n\n\ntroubled her and he just wanted to talk to her. On this, she told\n\nhim that she was not interested to talk to him.\n\n5          Thereafter, the prosecutrix and the appellant did not\n\ntalk for many days. But, after some days, the appellant made a\n\ntelephone call to the prosecutrix informing her that his brother\n\nalong with his girl friend was going on a trip and his brother\n\nwas also asking him to accompany and        when he asked the\n\nprosecutrix to accompany him to such trip, then she told him\n\nthat she had to appear in test/examination and he should not\n\nmake any telephone calls to her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">6          After some days, the appellant again went to the\n\ncollege of the prosecutrix and told her that he was going back\n\nand he wanted to talk to her once.

However, he did not commit\n\nany   wrong     act   with   her.   Later,   the   appellant    started\n\nblackmailing her by saying that he would not leak and\n\ndisseminate her video and photos if she would pay him\n\nRs.20,000/- and after paying the amount, he would give nude\n\nphotos and video to her. She expressed her inability to pay\n\nRs.20,000/- to him as she was not doing any job. She promised\n\nto give him Rs.20,000/- as and when she would get a job and\n\nasked him to delete her pictures and video. The appellant in\n\nanger told her that she would see how he would defame her.\n\nThe prosecutrix on account of fear of the appellant closed her\n\nmobile SIM.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">8         On 9th and 10th November, the prosecutrix came to\n\nknow that her photos and video had been leaked and\n\ndisseminated.

That apart, her\n\ntestimony is clearly belied by what can be seen and observed in\n\nSD card, Ext.

S.\n\nGuleria, learned Deputy Advocate General, would argue that the\n\nlearned trial court has painstakingly discussed each and every\n\naspect of the case, more particularly, oral as well documentary\n\nevidence that has come on record and it is only thereafter that\n\nthe appellant has been convicted and sentenced and in such\n\ncircumstances, no interference is warranted.\n\n22         We have heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nand have also gone through the records of the case.\n\n23         At the outset, it needs to be observed that rape is\n\nthe most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a\n\nsociety, as it is an assault on the body, mind and privacy of the\n\nvictim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                     13</span>\n\n\nvictim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless\n\nfemale. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the\n\nvery core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an\n\naccomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the\n\nvictim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher\n\npedestal than an injured witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">24          Rape is the most hated crime, which tantamounts to\n\na serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends\n\nboth, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and\n\nphysical harm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.\n\nGang rape is all the more a serious and heinous offence.\n\n25          The committal of rape is a beastly act and takes out\n\nthe life from the life of victim. The scars of rape always remain\n\nengraved in her mind and she cannot overcome throughout her\n\nlife. Rape leaves physical as well as mental scars on the victim.\n\nPhysical wounds may heal up, but the mental scars, though\n\nless visible are more difficult to treat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">26          Rape is a crime not against an individual but a\n\ncrime which destroys the basic equilibrium of the social\n\natmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not only lowers the dignity of a woman but\n\nalso mars her reputation. The plight of the woman and shock\n\nsuffered by the victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    14</span>\n\n\ngrows with traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame\n\nhaunted by the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of\n\nterrifying melancholia. The torment on the victim has the\n\npotentiality to corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized\n\nsociety. It has been rightly said that whereas a murderer\n\ndestroys the physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and\n\ndefiles the soul of a helpless female. The offence of &quot;Rape&quot; is\n\ngrave by its nature, which warrants a strong deterrent by\n\njudicial hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255210\" id=\"span_15\">27         In <a href=\"/doc/255210/\" id=\"a_24\">State of Punjab vs. Ramdev Singh</a>, AIR 2004\n\nSC 1290, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held as under:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           This Court dealt with the issue and held that rape is\n           violative of victim&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of\n           the Constitution. So, the courts should deal with such\n           cases sternly and severely. Sexual violence, apart from\n           being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion on the\n           right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a serious\n           blow to her supreme honour and offends her self-esteem\n           and dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim\n           and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a\n           minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist\n           not only causes physical injuries, but leaves behind a scar\n           on the most cherished position of a woman, i.e. her\n           dignity, honour, reputation and chastity. Rape is not only\n           an offence against the person of a woman, rather a crime\n           against the entire society.

The consequential\n          death is more horrendous. It is to be kept in mind that an\n          offence against the body of a woman lowers her dignity\n          and mars her reputation. It is said that one&#x27;s physical\n          frame is his or her temple. No one has any right of\n          encroachment.

When a family suffers\n          in such a manner, the society as a whole is compelled to\n          suffer as it creates an incurable dent in the fabric of the\n          social milieu.

He stated that he was not in a position to\n\ntell as to from which mobile the video had come in the SD card\n\nEx.P4.

According to\n\nhim, chronological events of the case are as follow:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">           On 20.10.2016, when the prosecutrix was allegedly\n           taken by the appellant to Moon Light Hotel these\n           the alleged video was made and allegations of\n           forcible oral sex were made.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">           On 9.11.2016 the video was allegedly gone viral and\n           and this fact came to the notice of the prosecutrix.\n           On 23.11.2016, the prosecutrix          for the first time\n           made a report, Ext. PW1/A to Police Post Thural.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">90         In our considered view, the delay has to be\n\nconsidered in the back ground of the facts and circumstances of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                   46</span>\n\n\neach case and is a matter of appreciation of evidence. It is well\n\nsettled that the delay in registering FIR cannot by itself be a\n\nground to doubt the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">91         In cases of delay, the Courts are required to examine\n\nthe evidence with a close scrutiny and in doing so; the contents\n\nof the FIR should also be scrutinized more carefully. If Court\n\nfinds that there is no indication of fabrication or it has not been\n\nconcocted or engineered to implicate innocent persons then,\n\neven if there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the case of the\n\nprosecution cannot be dismissed merely on that ground. The\n\ndisinclination to inform the family or report the matter to the\n\npolice might be due to apprehension and attitude of the society\n\ntowards the victim. Therefore, the delay in lodging the complaint\n\nin such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is\n\nfalse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">92         However, in the instant case, it needs to be noticed\n\nthat the prosecutrix is alleged to have been sexually assaulted\n\nand the alleged video made on 20.10.2016 and she is alleged to\n\nhave come know about the obscene video/photographs being\n\nuploaded    and made viral on 9.11.2016, which allegations\n\nultimately have been found to be false.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    47</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n\n93         In     such   circumstances,    an    inordinate   and\n\nunexplained delay in registering FIR does cast a cloud of\n\nsuspicion regarding the credibility of the prosecution story when\n\nread with the testimony of the victim, medical evidence and all\n\nother evidence led by the prosecution. The inordinate delay in\n\nregistration of FIR and the time and opportunities which the\n\nvictim had, to report the matter to the police or any other\n\nperson by raising an alarm when she was forced to undergo the\n\ntrauma of rape is unexplainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">94         It is here that the requirement of the testimony of\n\nthe victim being credit worthy to be termed as sterling witness\n\nwhose version can be accepted without corroboration steps in. It\n\nis here that the version of the victim on the core spectrum of the\n\ncrime should remain intact while all other attendant materials,\n\nnamely, oral, documentary and material objects should match\n\nthe said version in material particulars in order to enable the\n\nCourt trying the offence to rely on the core version to sieve the\n\nother supporting materials for holding the offender guilty of the\n\ncharge alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120726166\" id=\"span_57\">95         In this background, it shall be fruitful to refer to the\n\nfollowing observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_41\">Rai\n\nSandeep @ Deepu vs. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) (2012) 8 SCC 21:-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                         48</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">15. Keeping the above basic features of the offence alleged\nagainst the appellants in mind, when we make reference\nto the evidence of the so called &#x27;sterling witness&#x27; of the\nprosecution, namely, the prosecutrix, according to her\nversion in the chief examination when the persons who\nknocked at the door, were enquired they claimed that they\nwere from the crime branch which was not mentioned in\nthe FIR. She further deposed that they made a statement\nthat they had come there to commit theft and that they\nsnatched the chain which she was wearing and also the\nwatch from Jitender (PW-11). While in the complaint, the\naccused alleged to have stealthily taken the gold chain\nand wrist watch which were lying near the T.V. It was\nfurther alleged that the appellant in Criminal Appeal\nNo.2486 of 2009 was having a knife in his hand which\nstatement was not found in the complaint. After referring\nto the alleged forcible intercourse by both the appellants\nshe stated that she cleaned herself with the red colour\nsocks which was taken into possession under Exhibit PW-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">4/B in the hospital, whereas, Exhibit PW- 4/B states that\nthe recovery was at the place of occurrence. The police\nstated to have apprehended the appellants at the instance\nof Jitender (PW-11) who knew the appellant in Criminal\nAppeal No.2486 of 2009 even prior to the incident, that\nJitender (PW-11) also revealed the name of the said\naccused to her and that, therefore, she was able to name\nhim in her complaint. When the seized watch was shown\nto her in the Court, the brand name of which was OMEX,\nshe stated that the said watch was not worn by her\nnephew Jitender (PW-11) as it was stated to be &#x27;TITAN&#x27;\nand the chain was a gold chain having no pendant. She\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                         49</span>\n\n\nmade it clear that that was not the chain which she was\nwearing and that it did not belong to her and that the\nwatch found in the same parcel which was a women&#x27;s\nwatch was not the one which was worn by Jitender (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">11).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">15. In our considered opinion, the &#x27;sterling witness&#x27; should\nbe of a very high quality and caliber whose version\nshould, therefore, be unassailable. The Court considering\nthe version of such witness should be in a position to\naccept it for its face value without any hesitation. To test\nthe quality of such a witness, the status of the witness\nwould be immaterial and what would be relevant is the\ntruthfulness of the statement made by such a witness.\nWhat would be more relevant would be the consistency of\nthe statement right from the starting point till the end,\nnamely, at the time when the witness makes the initial\nstatement and ultimately before the Court. It should be\nnatural and consistent with the case of the prosecution\nqua the accused. There should not be any prevarication in\nthe version of such a witness. The witness should be in a\nposition to withstand the cross- examination of any length\nand howsoever strenuous it may be and under no\ncircumstance should give room for any doubt as to the\nfactum of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as,\nthe sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation\nwith each and everyone of other supporting material such\nas the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of\noffence committed, the scientific evidence and the expert\nopinion. The said version should consistently match with\nthe version of every other witness. It can even be stated\nthat it should be akin to the test applied in the case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                     50</span>\n\n\n           circumstantial evidence where there should not be any\n           missing link in the chain of circumstances to hold the\n           accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if\n           the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as\n           well as all other similar such tests to be applied, it can be\n           held that such a witness can be called as a &#x27;sterling\n           witness&#x27; whose version can be accepted by the Court\n           without any corroboration and based on which the guilty\n           can be punished. To be more precise, the version of the\n           said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should\n           remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely,\n           oral, documentary and material objects should match the\n           said version in material particulars in order to enable the\n           Court trying the offence to rely on the core version to sieve\n           the other supporting materials for holding the offender\n           guilty of the charge alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">\n96         As regards credit worthiness of the testimony of the\n\nprosecutrix, it would be noticed that the initial version given by\n\nher in her statement Ext. PW1/A, she had not alleged any act\n\nconstituting offence under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 376</a> IPC and only stated that\n\nthe appellant had taken her to Moon Light Hotel and there, he\n\nhad taken off her clothes and when she had only underwear on\n\nher body, then he clicked photographs and made a video, but\n\nspecifically stated that he did not commit any wrong act with\n\nher as is evident from the following:-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                  51</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">           &quot;USNE MERE SATH KOI GALAT KAAM NAHI KIYA\n           HAI&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">97         Thereafter,   the   prosecutrix   in   her   statement\n\nrecorded under <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 164</a> Cr. P.C., Ext. PW1/B had again\n\nstated that the appellant had not committed any wrong or\n\nsexual intercourse with her as is evident from the following:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">           &quot;USNE AISI KOI GANDI HARKAT NA KI HAI.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">           MATLAB SEX NAHI KIYA HAI.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">98          It was after the arrest of the appellant on 6.12.2016,\n\nthat the prosecution got another statement of the prosecutrix\n\nrecorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. wherein allegations of oral\n\nsex were made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">99         We really fail to understand and appreciate as to\n\nwhere was the necessity of getting another statement recorded\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. when especially it was not recorded\n\nfor the purpose of elaborating the facts that had already been\n\nstated   by the prosecutrix in the earlier statement recorded\n\nbefore the Magistrate and there is otherwise no explanation\n\nplaced on record by the prosecution as to what necessitated the\n\nthird statement    inventing thereby entirely a different story,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                  52</span>\n\n\nwhich casts a serious doubt on the story now put-forth by the\n\nprosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">100        Apart from above, different versions have been given\n\nby the prosecutrix in her three statements and same therefore\n\nhave to be taken with pinch of salt and are suggestive of the fact\n\nthat she had suppressed the true facts and was otherwise\n\ncapable of inventing stories.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">101        Why we observe so is because the prosecutrix in her\n\nearlier version had stated that she was given some intoxicants\n\nin the drink by the appellant before she was taken to Hotel\n\nMoon Light, but in her statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 164</a>\n\nCr. P.C. she changed her version by stating that the intoxicated\n\ndrink was given to her after she was taken to Moon Light Hotel.\n\nFurther there is no explanation on record that if the prosecutrix\n\nwas not consenting party, then what prompted her to go inside\n\nthe Hotel with the appellant, more particularly, in view of the\n\nfact that she was major and capable of deciding what was right\n\nor wrong for her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">102        Further, there is no explanation, as observed above,\n\nas to why matter was reported belatedly on 23.11.2016\n\nparticularly when the prosecutrix had already come to know\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                   53</span>\n\n\nabout the alleged leakage of video on 9.11.2016, which story\n\nhas otherwise been proved to be totally false.\n\n103           The present FIR was not spontaneous and appears\n\nto have been lodged after long deliberations and consultation as\n\nis evident from the fact that in the initial version given by the\n\nprosecutrix herself there were no allegations of any sex, oral or\n\notherwise and this was not something which could have\n\nescaped the mind of the prosecutrix if it was not consensual. It\n\ngoes   a long way to establish         that she was probably a\n\nconsenting party and that is why she did not report the matter.\n\nThis observation is further strengthened from the fact that the\n\nprosecutrix     herself   had   refused   to     undergo    medical\n\nexamination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_79\">104           Further, as per statement of the prosecutrix, she\n\nhad seen the alleged video and photographs in the mobile of her\n\nfriends, Shagun, Shivani and Sahil and photographs were also\n\nclaimed to have been sent to her by her friend Rakesh, but\n\nsurprising enough, none of these witnesses were ever associated\n\nduring the police investigation or examined in the Court.\n\n105           It also needs to be noticed that the prosecutrix\n\nneither gave her mobile to the police during investigation nor\n\ndisclosed the mobile numbers in her deposition, rather the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                  54</span>\n\n\nprosecutrix destroyed the mobile phone after registration of the\n\ncase as has been admitted by her in her statement. All these\n\nfacts collectively do probablize the defence of the appellant that\n\nthe video was made from the mobile of the prosecutrix herself\n\nbecause even S.D. card, Ext. P4 containing alleged obscene\n\nvideo was given by her after taking it out from her own mobile\n\nphone as admitted, PW4 LHC Anjana, PW5 Vishal Katoch as\n\nalso PW16 Investigating Officer and above all by the prosecutrix\n\nherself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">106          This fact assumes greater importance for the reason\n\nthat admittedly no obscene videos were found in the mobile of\n\nthe appellant, Ext.1 that was taken into possession vide memo,\n\nExt. PW3/A and in the report of RFSL, it has been specifically\n\nconcluded that no      porn video/photograph was found in the\n\nextracted data from the mobile phone, Ext.1.\n\n107          We also find it rather strange as to why the\n\nprosecutrix would claim and state that S.D. card did not belong\n\nto her     and had been given to her by her friend Rajat, which\n\nstatement is in contradiction with statements of PW4, PW5 and\n\nPW16. That apart, even so called Rajat has neither been\n\nassociated nor examined by the prosecution.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                    55</span>\n\n\n108          Further, the fact that the prosecutrix visited the\n\nHotel in question with the appellant on 20.10.2016 has been\n\ntotally   falsified   by the entries, Ext. PW8/A, wherein date of\n\nstay of the appellant is reflected as 22.10.2016. The version of\n\nthe prosecutrix that she had visited Hotel Moon Light with the\n\nappellant only once is also belied by her in her statement before\n\nthe court where she admitted that she had gone twice to the\n\nhotel with the appellant but could not tell the date as to when\n\nshe had gone to Moon Light Hotel before 20.10.2016.\n\n109          We have also seen the videos contained in the S.D.\n\ncard, Ext. P4, which are suggestive of the prosecutrix being a\n\nconsenting party and would not like to observe anything more.\n\n110          Apart from above,     it has specifically come in the\n\nstatement of PW16 Investigating Officer that the calls details of\n\nthe prosecutrix and the appellant had been obtained, but had\n\nnot been placed on record, which constrains this Court to draw\n\nan adverse inference as by withholding call details and mobile\n\nof the prosecutrix,       the prosecution has withheld material\n\nevidence, which could have revealed - (a) as to whether the\n\nappellant and the prosecutrix were in touch with each other (b)\n\nto rule out that the alleged video was not made from the mobile\n\nof the prosecutrix (c) to confirm whether she had received video\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                  56</span>\n\n\nfrom any of her friends as alleged by her or the same was\n\notherwise present in her mobile phone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">111         As a matter of fact, no reasons had been assigned\n\nby the prosecution for not taking into possession the mobile\n\nphones of the friends of the prosecutrix or for that matter, her\n\ncousin&#x27;s phone (PW5), who specifically stated that alleged video\n\nwas available in his mobile as it has been sent to him by his\n\nWhatsapp group, which alone could have shown source of the\n\nvideo that was alleged to have been made viral, but not proved.\n\n112         Furthermore, even the conduct of the prosecutrix in\n\nnot disclosing the fact regarding preparation of alleged video or\n\nhaving been forced to have oral sex            immediately after\n\n20.10.2016 to any person including         her friends or family\n\nmembers also reflects on her adversely.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">113         That apart, the prosecution    case regarding   video\n\nhaving become viral has otherwise not established from record\n\nand the entire prosecution case otherwise crumbles because\n\nS.D. card, Ext.P4 has been proved to have been produced by\n\nthe prosecutrix   herself and being      custodian of such card,\n\nwhere the video has been found, it was she alone who could\n\nhave transmitted the same; unless there was evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                     57</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n\n114        There is no evidence on record regarding sexual\n\nharassment, assault      or use      of criminal force against the\n\nprosecutrix so as to disrobe her and bring the case within the\n\nmischief of <a href=\"/doc/106760949/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 354-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/166765731/\" id=\"a_48\">354-B</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">115        Furthermore, there is no evidence for sustaining the\n\ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/752609/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 385</a> IPC as the prosecution has miserably\n\nfailed to prove that    there were threats to the prosecutrix to\n\nextort money for not making the video viral that was found in\n\nthe S.D. card in the mobile belonging to the prosecutrix.\n\n116        As regards offence under <a href=\"/doc/1136668/\" id=\"a_50\">section 67A</a> of the I.T.
