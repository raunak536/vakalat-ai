The petitioner, which is registered under the <a href=\"/doc/82830114/\" id=\"a_1\">Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950</a>, started a secondary school at Sondoli in the District of Kolhapur. Initially classes for Standard VIII were conducted for academic year 1994-95. The secondary school was conducted without any authorisation from the State Government and, it was only on 13-1-1995 that the petitioner applied for sanction and approval by the Government. The pattern of conducting unauthorised classes continued in 1995-96 and in 1996-97 when classes came to be conducted for standards VIII, IX &amp; X without permission from the Government. The students of the school who had pursued their studies for standard X were permitted to appear for the Board examination through another recognised school. On 18-9-1998, another application came to be filed by the school before the State Government for sanction. By a communication dated 20-8-1999, the State Government rejected the application of the petitioner for permission to open and establish a secondary school. Three reasons were furnished by the State Government for rejecting the application : (i) the institution had not furnished Audit Reports for the previous two years; (ii) the Managing Committee of the Trust did not include 30% of women amongst its members; and (iii) the Trust had unauthorisedly commenced the running of the school without the permission of the State Government. The petitioner was called upon to cease and desist from conducting the school in the absence of permission by the State Government. In the present proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, the petitioner seeks to impugn the letter of the State Government dated 20-8-1999, by which permission to establish and conduct the school has been rejected.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">3. The writ petition which is being disposed of by this judgment, was one of a batch of petitions filed in this Court in which the central issue relates to the role and function of the State Government in granting or refusing permissions to establish primary, secondary and higher secondary schools in the State. This group of writ petitions arises out of applications filed by private managements for setting up primary and secondary schools in diverse parts of the State of Maharashtra. In many cases, permissions have been refused while in others, permissions granted to some other educational institution are sought to be impunged. In certain cases, the grievance of the petitioners before us has been that applications made for the grant of permission have been kept pending for disproportionately long period without decision. In some cases, it is distressing to find that institutions have admitted students without permission to conduct the school having been granted. The writ petitions before the Court are in many respects similar to those which are filed year after year when permissions for setting up new primary and secondary schools are granted or refused. In many of the petitions which the Court has had to consider, there has been a grievance that permissions for setting up primary and secondary schools have been granted without due verification of the infrastructure which is available for setting up the school. In certain cases, there is a grievance that the selection of an institution amongst several applicants is not based upon a consideration of objective norms or standards. In certain cases there are allegations of political interference in the decision making process. In many cases schools have been functioning without the requisite infrastructure needed to impart even basic levels of primary and secondary education. In certain cases, grievances have been made before the Court that as a result of permissions granted for setting up schools, there has been an unhealthy competition between educational institutions in a given geographical area.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4. The grievances raised in successive writ petitions filed in this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> suggested that there was a need for the State to formulate a comprehensive policy in regard to the setting up of primary and secondary schools in the State of Maharashtra. The formulation of a comprehensive policy and the laying down of objective and fair norms for evaluation of applications would subserve the need for a transparent and consistent process of decision making by the State Government. In the absence of well identified and properly enumerated norms stipulating the basis on which applications for setting up primary and secondary schools would be disposed of, individual decisions governing the grant of permissions are liable to be questioned on the ground that decisions were taken on an ad hoc basis, not necessarily guided by objective considerations and often, for extraneous purposes. Consequently, when the batch of writ petitions before us was heard for admission, we requested the learned Advocate General to seek instructions on whether the State Government would consider whether it should formulate a uniform policy consisting of well defined norms on the basis of which individual applications for setting up primary, secondary and higher secondary schools would be decided. The learned Advocate General has responded with fairness and has informed the Court that the State Government was in a position to formulate a suitable policy that would enable the process of deciding applications for setting up primary, secondary and higher secondary schools to be objective and fair. The Advocate General placed before us a draft of the policy which the State Government proposes to issue, for consideration. During the course of hearing, with the assistance of Counsel, certain suggestions were made by us which have been accepted by the learned Advocate General. Before dealing with the matter any further we wish to record our appreciation of the fair stand adopted by the State Government and of the able assistance rendered to us by the learned Advocate General.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">5. The right to education has received primary importance in the Constitutional set up after independence. The provisions of the Constitution recognise the significance and importance of education. Judicial decisions have elaborated upon the scope and ambit of the right to education. <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 41</a> of the Constitution which is part of the Directive Principles of State Policy enunciates that the State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provisions for the right to education. <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 45</a> provides that &quot;the State shall endeavour to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this Constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 45</a> recognises that every child shall, upto the age of fourteen have the right to receive education. The right to education is indeed so basic and so fundamental that it has, subject to the qualification to which we shall presently advert, been construed to be a part of the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a>, it is well settled, includes all those faculties and means by which life becomes meaningful. Life, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> lies beyond the realm of a bare physical existence. That right, by the process of a creative judicial interpretation encompassed the right to privacy, to a speedy trial, to public health, to information, to the means of communication to inaccessible areas and to a clean environment; these are a few of the areas to which the right to life has extended. In the contemporary society of today, there can be no doubt about the fact that education is the key to meaningful human existence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_1\">In one sense, perhaps basic, education is the source of the acquisition of knowledge and the means to secure information about the course of human affairs. In another sense, perhaps even more fundamental, education in its true sense is a means to the development of human personality. In the complex and highly specialised age that modern societies are tending to imbibe, education is a source of opportunity, of work, livelihood and gainful avocation. The Supreme Court recognised the primary importance of education in its landmark judgment in <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_10\">Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, . The Supreme Court held that education until the attainment of the age of fourteen is a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Recognising the importance of receiving education in the life of every child in our society, the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental right of every child to receive education until the age of fourteen. The Supreme Court held as follows :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> &quot;The citizens of this country have a fundamental right to education. The said right flows from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21.</a> This right is, however, into an absolute right. Its content and parameters have to be determined in the light of <a href=\"/doc/1791268/\" id=\"a_13\">Articles 45</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_14\">41.</a> In other words every child/citizen of this country has a right to free education, until he completes the age of fourteen years. Thereafter his right to education is subject to the limits of economic capacity and development of the State.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_2\">Education has thus a position of prime importance in the Constitutional scheme of a just and fair society. The position of importance that education has in the constitutional set up has found acceptance, affirmation and elaboration in judgments of the Supreme Court. There is a significant need to spread education in a society such as ours where poverty, underdevelopment and social disability have to be overcome by making available the benefit of education to the widest strata of society. In the State of Maharashtra, it has been estimated that nearly 11,000 habitations are without a primary education facility. The levels of literacy in States such as Kerala have been substantially improved with the rapid spread of primary education. The importance of the spread of primary education is hence an intrinsic part of State policy designed to ensure the reach of education to the population at large. The primary duty to ensure the spread of education is one that the Constitution requires the State of perform. Yet, there is a constitutional recognition on the limitations of the State - both in terms of resources and capacity - in performing this rule. Consequently, the Supreme Court recognised a fundamental right to receive education until the age of fourteen, in <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_15\">Unnikrishnan</a>&#x27;s case. The Court recognised that the role of private institutions is important in order to supplement the role of the State in achieving the spread of education. The necessary consequence is that private institutions would, when they seek to enter the filed of education, be subject to the same restrictions and regulatory requirements as would apply to the State as dispenser of education. In seeking recognition and in certain cases, financial assistance from the State, private managements of educational institutions are liable to be regulated by the State to ensure that the interests of students, of teachers and the course of education are promoted.&quot;</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_3\">6. Before we deal with the scheme which has been formulated by the State Government, reference may be made to some of the existing provisions relating to the starting of new schools within the State. The provisions in that regard are contained in Chapter II of the Secondary School Code which is entitled &quot;recognition, organisation and management of schools.&quot; <a href=\"/doc/16626950/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 1</a> of Chapter II has made provisions for (i) applications for starting new schools; (ii) conditions of recognition; (iii) provisional and permanent recognition; (iv) power to grant recognition; and (v) refunal of recognition (vi) withdrawal of recognition. Para 3.2 thereof lays down the conditions which a school seeking recognition of the education department of the State must fulfill in order to secure recognition. These conditions include: (i) a consideration of whether there is a need for a school in the locality, so as to prevent unhealthy competition between institutions of the same category in the neighbourhood; (ii) existence of competent, reliable and properly constituted management; (iv) existence of proper infrastructure for the purposes of running the school; (v) engagement of duly qualified teaching staff meeting the qualifications prescribed by the State; (vi) the teaching of a curriculum approved by the competent authority; (vii) grant of admission according to rules <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_17\">laid down by</a> the concerned department of the State; (viii) implementation of the rates of fees for students and of pay scales, allowances and conditions of service of the staff prescribed by the State; (ix) maintenance of records as directed by the State; and (x) that the management shall not conduct or allow unrecognised schools or classes to be conducted in the premises of the school or elsewhere. The Code makes provision for provisional recognition from year to year for a period of five years and thereafter, the grant of recognition subject to satisfactory working of the institution. Provisions have also been made for refusal of recognition and the withdrawal of recognition subject to the remedy of an appeal.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">7. Apart from the provisions of the Code, the State Government has issued Government Resolutions dated 27th July 1992 and 3rd June, 1998 governing the grant of permissions for starting new schools or for the renewal of existing permissions. Copies of those Resolutions have been placed on the record in a compilation tendered by the learned Advocate General. The Government Resolution dated 27th July, 1992 provides that Government has in December, 1991 prepared a master plan for secondary schools and, places in the State where secondary schools were necessary have been included in the plan. The G.R, provides that in the case of villages having a pre-secondary school (a primary school upto the VIIth standard) the population should be at least 1000. In a pre-secondary school, the muster roll strength of students of the VIIth standard should be 25 (15 in the case of hilly or adivasi areas or for a linguistic minority). The case for establishing a secondary school could be considered only where pre-secondary school exists in the village and where there is no secondary school within a radius of 5 kilometres. In urban areas there should be one secondary school for a population of 10,000. Some of the provisions of these Government Resolutions have been adverted to by us for the purpose of considering the broad policy frame work already in place governing the establishment and opening of new schools.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">8. In formulating appropriate norms and standards for the establishment of new primary and secondary schools in the State, certain basic considerations have to be borne in mind. These considerations include the following:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1. The first and foremost is the need for ensuring the spread of primary and secondary education to all parts of the socio economic strata and in all geographical areas of the state. Areas of under development; areas which are geographically inaccessible such as the hilly areas; areas of adivasi habitation and other socially and educationally backward areas need special priority and emphasis. These areas have to be identified by the State Government in terms of a master plan which will be valid for a period of ten years. Once formulated, the master plan should be scrupulously adhered to unless new problems require a change in a master plan that was originally formulated.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2. In granting permissions for setting up new primary, secondary and higher secondary schools, due and proper emphasis has to be given to the existence of requisite infrastructure. The spread of education has to be consistent with the maintenance of basic facilities required in terms of infrastructure, including a properly qualified and equipped teaching staff. Unrecognised schools with little or no infrastructure and with a lack of qualified teaching staff cannot be permitted and the State would be justified in dealing with such institutions with strictness.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3. Applications for the establishment of new schools ought to be processed and decided by a body of experts in a transparent and objective manner. The policy which has been submitted for our consideration by the learned Advocate General accepts this principle. The same which is being formulated by the State Government in the present case contemplates District and State Level Committees consisting of experts in the area and nominees of the Vice-Chancellor or the Chancellors as the case may be. Reasons, brief as they may be, should be given by the Committees for granting or rejecting applications for establishment of schools.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">4. In determining whether a new school should be permitted care has to be taken to ensure that unhealthy competition between educational institutions is avoided.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">5. In order to discourage the practice of establishing unauthorised institutions, the policy stipulates that no unauthorised institution shall be considered by the Government from the year 2000-2001 for the grant of permission unless the institution concerned undertakes that it shall not admit any student in the absence of permission by the Government.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88263547\" id=\"span_4\">6. The fundamental principle that has to be borne in mind is that provision of primary education is a constitutionally protected fundamental right. The State has a constitutional duty to provide, within the limits of its economic capacity and development the right to education. As the Supreme Court held in <a href=\"/doc/88263547/\" id=\"a_18\">Unnikrishnan</a>&#x27;s case, the need for private institutions to impart education has come into being because of the limitation on the resources of the State to provide education for the society at large. The Supreme Court held as follows :</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;The private educational institutions merely supplement the effort of the State in educating the people, as explained above. It is not an independent activity. It is an activity supplemental to the principal activity carried on by the State. No private educational institution can survive or subsist without recognition and/or affiliation. The bodies which grant recognition and/or affiliation are the authorities of the State. In such a situation, it is obligatory---in the interest of general public--upon the authority granting recognition or affiliation to insist upon such conditions as are appropriate to ensure not only education of requisite standard but also fairness and equal treatment in the matter of admission of students. Since the recognising/ affiliating authority is the State, it is under an obligation to impose such conditions as part of its duty enjoined upon it by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. It cannot allow itself or its power and privilege to be used unfairly. The incidents attaching to the main activity attach to supplemental activity as well.&quot; (At. P. 755)\n \n\nPrivate institutions which enter the arena of providing education, perform the role of supplementing the function of the State. The establishment and functioning of those institutions must therefore be subject to regulation by the State to secure the interest of the students and teachers, of those who are taught and those who teach. Recognition is a means of ensuring that the students of the institution can appear at examinations conducted by the State and be conferred with qualifications granted by the State and its authorities. The State also has a vital interest in the proper functioning of schools because a significant proportion of them do receive grants in aid from the State.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">7. These considerations underline the need to ensure that decision of the Government on whether or not to permit the establishment of new educational institution must be transparent, objective and fair. The norms on the basis of which those decisions are arrived at should be certain and definite. The investigation of whether those norms are fulfilled must be carried out by academic experts within the Government, with the assistance of experts outside. In this manner, the process of establishing new schools in the State must meet the requirements of fair and non discriminatory treatment. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution mandates that Governmental decisions be guided by reason and informed by public interest, The need for this is all the greater, where the right in question is the right to receive education, a part of which the right to primary education until the age of fourteen, is a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">7-A. We clarify that the policy and scheme has been formulated by the State Government. We have made a few suggestions which have been accepted by the learned Advocate General and incorporated in the policy. The policy which has been formulated by the State Government and which will form a part of this order is as follows: -\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">1. Master Plan :\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(1) A Master Plan will be prepared by the State Government in order to facilitate grant of permission to primary, secondary and high secondary schools for the next 10 years and the same will be observed scrupulously. The Master Plan will be placed before the High Court for approval. Once formulated, no change will be permitted in the Master Plan except with the permission of the Court.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(2) The Master Plan will be for Marathi Medium schools only. Schools established by religious or linguistic minorities are required to be started according to necessity and, therefore, these schools will not be required to abide by the Master Plan, However, such schools will not be allowed to change their medium of instruction already granted without the permission of the Government. The grant of permission to establish schools by religious and linguistic minorities will be in accordance with their rights under <a href=\"/doc/1983234/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 30</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(3) At present, there is no Master Plan for permission to primary schools. It will take sometime to prepare the same and, therefore, there will be no Master, Plan for granting permissions to primary schools for the academic year 2000-2001.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">However, a Master Plan will be prepared for permission of private primary schools for the period 2001-2010. Urban, Semi-urban agglometated habitations and villages having 10,000 population or more will be included in the Master Plan,\n \n\n(4) The existing Master Plan for Secondary and Higher Secondary schools will be updated for the period 2000-2010. The conditions of 5 km distance prescribed for starting secondary schools will be relaxed only in the case of areas suffering from special hindrances and these are hilly, mountainous, river and tribal areas.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">2. Quota for School Permission:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">1) Permission will be granted to 100 primary, 300 secondary and 50 higher secondary private schools every year from June, 2000. Primary education is a Constitutional responsibility of the Zilla Parishads, Nagar Parishads, Cantonment Boards and Municipal Corporations and primary schools will be started by these local bodies. However, interested private institutions will be permitted to start 100 primary schools except English medium schools on permanent no grant basis. Secondary and higher secondary private schools will be considered for grant in accordance with Government policy.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(2) Under the existing policy English medium secondary schools are permitted on permanent no-grant basis. There will be no quota limit for such     English medium schools and other medium schools permitted on permanent no grant basis.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(3) No separate girls schools will be sanctioned in future. Permission will be        granted ,only to start co-educational schools.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(4) Nearly 11,000 habitations in the State are without primary education facility as these habitations do not fulfill the existing criteria (i.e. 1.5 km vicinity and 200 population for general areas 100 population and 1 km. for tribal, hilly and remote areas). The condition of 1.5/1 km and population is relaxed to 1/2 km. Habitation schools will be started through Gram Panchayats on the basis of Madhya Pradesh Governments&#x27; &quot;Shikshan hami yojana&quot;. An annual expenditure for each Habitation School will be Rs. 13,000/-.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(5) In future, Std. XI and XII will not be affiliated to Senior Colleges. These classes will be attached to Secondary Schools only. If the intake capacity of the existing higher secondary schools is not sufficient to accommodate all eligible students permission will be granted to affiliate Std. XI and XII to senior colleges as an exception.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">3. Application for permission to start a school :---\n</p>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\"> (1) Applications will be invited from private institutions according to the Master Plan.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">(2) Applications will be invited for secondary and higher secondary schools for the year 2000-2001 after the Master Plan is updated.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">(3) Chalan Fee will not be charged from the applicants for the year 2000-2001 who have applied for the same place in the Master Plan during the year 1999-2000 and have already deposited requisite Chalan fee.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\"> (4) Late Chalan fee will not be allowed henceforth.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">4. Scrutiny of Applications :---\n</p>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">(1) A District Level Committee will be constituted under the Chairmanship of Principal (DIET) to examine the applications. All the Education Officers in the concerned District will be Members of the Committee. The District Level Committee shall also consist of two representatives being experts in the field of education nominated by the Vice Chancellor of the concerned University in the area.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">(2) The Regional Deputy Director will route the applications received from the Committee and will only submit them to the Director of Education.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">(3) A State Level Committee will be constituted under the Chairmanship of Director of Education, Chairman, Maharashtra State Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, Director State Council for Educational Research and Training, Director, Adult Education and Director, Maharashtra State Bureau of Text Book Production and Curriculum Research. The State Level Committee shall also consist of two other Members who shall be educational experts nominated by the Chancellor. This Committee will select a maximum of two institutions for each location in the Master Plan.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">(4) Priority will be given to the applications received from the institutions who have offered to run the school on permanent no grant basis. The financial capacity of such institutions will be examined carefully.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">(5) Due care will be taken while sanctioning new schools to ensure that the existing schools will not close down for want of enrolment. Unhealthy competition should be avoided.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">(6) Applications will not be rejected for petty or insignificant reasons. Reasons for rejection of applications will be communicated to the concerned institutions. Similarly, while granting permission, the Committees will record reasons is order to ensure that the process is objective and transparent,\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">5. Grant-in-aid to private, primary, secondary and higher secondary schools.\n</p>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">(1) Grants will not be allowed for the first four years from the date of the grant of permission for setting up recognised schools.

The establishment of unauthorised educational institutions has to be deprecated. Such institutions are known to come up without as much as affording an opportunity to the State, to discharge its statutory functions of verifying due compliance with the applicable provisions of law Institutions with little or no infrastructure, poorly equipped, with unqualified staff are detrimental to the cause of education. In the circumstances, the State Government&#x27;s decisions to reject the application made by the school on the ground that it had been commenced unauthorisedly cannot be faulted. We wish to clarify that while it would be open to the petitioner to make a fresh application for the year 2000-2001 to the District Level Committee constituted under the above scheme, the petitioner shall, before filling such an application, intimate to the State Government that it shall not grant any admissions unless it receives the permission of the State Government to conduct the school. As regards the condition for the induction of 30% of women representatives on the managing Committee, we wish to clarify that it is not mandatory under the scheme framed by the State Government to induct any stipulated number of women members of the Managing Committee. The application made by the petitioner and other similarly placed institutions&#x27; would hence not be liable to be rejected on that ground.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">We direct that the State Government shall constitute District Level and State Level Committees in terms of the scheme prepared by the State Government as aforesaid within a period of ten days from today. It would be open to the petitioner to make a fresh application to the District Level Committee for the academic year 2000-2001. This would be subject to the condition that the school shall not be continued any further by the petitioner in the absence of permission.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">Petition will stand disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">All concerned parties to act on an ordinary copy of this order duly\nauthenticated by the Court Sheristedar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">Certified copy is expedited.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">8.
