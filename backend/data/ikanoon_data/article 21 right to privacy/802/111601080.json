Bhuyan, learned Additional Public Prosecutor, Assam.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">2. This is an appeal against the judgment dated 26.07.2022 passed by the learned Sessions Judge,\nBongaigaon in Sessions Case No.49(M)/2018 convicting the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/455161/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 376(1)</a> IPC and\nsentencing him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 12 (twelve) years with a fine of Rs.50,000/-, in\ndefault to undergo simple imprisonment for 1 (one) year.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3. The appellant, who was 24 years old has been convicted on the ground of having raped a woman of\n48 years, resulting in the birth of a child. Though the appellant had filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/985477/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n389</a> Cr.P.C. for suspension of the sentence and release of the appellant on bail, vide I.A.(Crl.)\nNo.160/2023, this Court had dismissed the said I.A.(Crl.) No.160/2023, vide order dated 10.10.2023 by\nholding that unless and until a DNA test/profiling of the appellant was done, it would not be proper to\nsuspend the sentence and release the appellant on bail.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4. This Court had, during the pendency of I.A.(Crl.) No.160/2023, directed the appellant&#x27;s counsel to\nobtain instructions as to whether the appellant was willing to undergo a DNA test, to verify whether he\nwas the father of the child that had been born to the victim. However, the learned Senior Counsel for\nthe appellant had stated on 10.10.2023 that the appellant was not willing to undergo a DNA test.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5. The question that arose was whether this Court could direct the appellant to undergo a DNA test, to\nprove whether he was the father of the child born to the victim and which in turn would prove as to\nwhether he was the rapist of the victim.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6. The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant had submitted that this Court cannot compel the\nappellant to undergo a DNA test without his consent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_1\">In this regard the learned Senior Counsel had\nsubmitted that in terms of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_3\">Goutam Kundu Vs. State\nof West Bengal &amp; Others</a>, reported in 1993 3 SCC 418, Courts in India cannot order a blood test as a\nmatter of course. He had also submitted that the Apex Court has held that the Courts have to carefully\nexamine the consequence of ordering a blood test and no one can be compelled to give his/her sample\nof blood for analysis.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.   The learned Senior Counsel submits that the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not prove\nthat the appellant was the rapist of the victim or that the appellant was the father of the victim&#x27;s child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">                                                                                           Page No.# 3/15\n\nIn this respect, he has referred to the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, especially the\nevidence given by the victim in her cross-examination, wherein she has stated that she came to know\nthe name of the appellant only when the case was filed and that she had not seen the face of the person\nwho raped her on the relevant night, due to darkness. He also submits that as the FIR had been filed\nafter 6/7 months after the alleged rape had been committed, the same cast a doubt on the authenticity of\nthe contents of the FIR.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.   On the other hand, the Additional Public Prosecutor submits that the victim was mentally ill and\nunable to recall previous incidents, as given in the testimony of PW-1. She also submits that the victim\nwas 48 years of age and the appellant was 24 years of age. Further, though a bichar (village meeting\nunder the aegis of the elder of the village) had been held in the village on 2 (two) occasions, due to the\nalleged illegal act of the appellant, the appellant did not turn up in the bichar held on the 2 (two)\noccasions. She submits that though the evidence of the prosecution witnesses proved the guilt of the\nappellant, the appellant should be subjected to a DNA test to conclusively prove the said fact.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.   We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">10. The question to be decided is as to whether the appellant had raped the victim and whether the\nchild born to the victim had been fathered by the appellant, as it has been alleged that the child was the\nresult of the rape. As stated earlier, an issue has cropped up as to whether a DNA test could/should be\ndone on the appellant and the child, so as to determine whether the appellant had fathered the child,\nbesides considering the evidence that has already been recorded by the learned Trial Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">11. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_2\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_4\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra), the Supreme Court was seized of an issue, wherein the\npaternity of a child between a married couple was disputed. The alleged father (husband) of the child\nprayed for a Blood Group test of the child and himself to prove that he was not the father of the child.\nThe application was dismissed on the ground that there were other methods in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_5\">Evidence Act</a> to\nprove the paternity of the child and that the Blood Group test could not conclusively prove the paternity\nof a child. The Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_6\">in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_7\">the above case</a></a> held that though a Blood Group test was a useful test\nto determine the question of disputed paternity, it could be relied upon by the Courts as a circumstantial\nevidence, which ultimately excluded a certain individual as a father of the child. The Supreme <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_8\">Court\nfurther held</a> that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, the presumption of legitimacy of a child,\nwith regard to the father is that a child born of a married woman is deemed to be the legitimate child of\n                                                                                          Page No.# 4/15\n\na husband and would remain so, even if the child was born within 280 days after dissolution of a\nmarriage and the mother remain unmarried, unless it could be shown that the parties to the marriage\nhad no access to each other at any time, when the child could have been begotten.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_3\">It was in the above\ncontext that the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_10\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) held that the Courts in India cannot order a\nblood test as a matter of course. It thus held as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;(1) That courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (2) Wherever applications are made for such prayers in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer\n       for blood test cannot be entertained.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that the husband must establish non-access in\n       order to dispel the presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (4) The court must carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of ordering the\n       blood test; whether it will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and the mother as an\n       unchaste woman.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       (5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood for analysis.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_4\">12. The paternity test that was sought to be done by the alleged father in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_12\">Goutam Kundu</a> (supra) was\na Blood Group test and not a DNA profiling/test, wherein DNA rich cells are extracted. On the other\nhand, Blood Group test examines the Blood type of a person. As per the medical literature existing\ntoday with regard to DNA test and Blood test, perhaps the greatest difference between a Blood Group\ntest and a DNA test is that a Blood Group test cannot be used as conclusive proof of fatherhood. It can\nonly be used to disprove parentage and not to prove that the individual is the father of the child. The\nDNA test on the other hand, is a very reliable test, which is based on different parameters than a Blood\nGroup test.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">13. With the incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC w.e.f. 23.06.2006, DNA test can be done\nto facilitate the prosecution, in proving it&#x27;s case against an accused. Though it may be\nargued that right to privacy is a part of the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a>\nand that <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20(3)</a> provides that nobody should be compelled to give evidence against\nhimself, we were of the view that the same cannot over-ride the search for the truth, as the\nsame is allowed in terms of <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 53A</a> Cr.P.C (<a href=\"/doc/1890761/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 52</a> BNSS). Further, offence of rape\nis an offence against the society at large and as the objective of a Criminal Court proceeding\nis to find out the &quot;truth&quot;. We were accordingly of the view that the appellant&#x27;s right under\n                                                                                              Page No.# 5/15\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_18\">Articles 20(3)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">&amp; 21</a> would have to give way to public interest, so that the truth was laid bare\nfor all to see.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">14. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41352099\" id=\"span_5\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/41352099/\" id=\"a_20\">Harishchandra Sitaram Khanorkar Vs.

DNA conclusively\npoints the finger of guilt towards the perpetrator of a crime. However, while\nconsidering this scientific piece of evidence, the Court is required to examine as\nto whether at any point of time, it could be said that there was the slightest\nchance of playing with the samples and/or tampering with it by anyone.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68696327\" id=\"span_7\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/68696327/\" id=\"a_22\">Mukesh Vs.

The above cases show that there is no bar or restriction in having a DNA profiling of an accused in\na case of rape. In the present case, not only is there an allegation of rape against the appellant, but the\nappellant has been accused of being the father of the child born due to the rape inflicted by the\nappellant. It is quite clear that DNA profiling of the appellant could prove whether the appellant was\nthe father of the child born to the victim. As <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 53A</a> Cr.PC allowed for examination of a person\naccused of rape through DNA profiling on the request of a Police Officer not below the rank of Sub-\nInspector, this Court did not find any bar or restriction for this Court to pass a direction for DNA\nprofiling of the appellant, which would prove whether the appellant was the father of the child and thus\nfurther prove the question whether any rape had been committed on the victim by the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                                                                                           Page No.# 11/15\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">28.

Orissa State Commission</a> for Women, reported in 2010 8\nSCC 633, the Supreme Court has held that depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, it would\nbe permissible for a Court to direct the holding of a DNA examination to determine the paternity of a\nchild. However, the Court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the interests of the parties\nand on due consideration whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA test is needed. Thus, in a case\nrelating to the charge by the husband regarding the alleged infidelity of the wife, the same could be\nordered by the Court depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">30. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_17\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_46\">Dipanwita Roy Vs.

It also held that in view of the issue involved <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_47\">in <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_48\">the above case</a></a>, <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\nAct was not strictly attracted to the case.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">31. As can be seen, even in civil cases regarding disputes with regard to infidelity of the wife and\npaternity of a child, the Supreme Court has allowed DNA test to be done, after balancing the interests\nof the parties, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of a case. The case in hand is however\ndifferent, as it pertains to a criminal case and in the view of this Court, the right to preserve individual\nprivacy claimed by the appellant, has to give way to the object of finding out the truth, otherwise the\nsame could amount to sacrificing the cause of justice. Thus, in criminal cases, the requirement of\nfinding out the truth would over-ride the stand of the appellant, in not agreeing to undertake a DNA\ntest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">32. The present case is with regard to whether the appellant had committed a crime against society,\nwhich can be proved by way of a DNA test. We were of the view that the principal of proportionality is\nalso in favour of the Court resorting to DNA testing, to find out whether a crime had been committed\nby the appellant, keeping in view the allegation made by the victim and the fact that a child had been\nborn.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">33. A perusal of the orders passed by the Supreme Court clearly go to show that DNA test/profiling is\n                                                                                        Page No.# 12/15\n\nuseful and helpful in coming to a decision with regard to identifying the perpetrator of a crime. The\nSupreme Court has in many cases, as <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_50\">referred to above</a>, supported the use of DNA test/profiling.\nHowever, it is only in respect of civil cases where the paternity of a child is in dispute between the\nmarried couples that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has given words of caution that DNA test/profiling\nshould not be done at the drop of a hat, in view of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31929238\" id=\"span_18\">As stated in the\nearlier paragraphs, the Supreme Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/31929238/\" id=\"a_52\">Sandeep Vs. State of U.P.</a> (supra), has accepted\nthe confirmation that the accused therein was the father of the unborn child, who had died during the\nmurder of a pregnant woman, determined on the basis of a DNA test. In the present case, the victim has\naccused the appellant of raping her and making her pregnant. In that view of the matter, we were of the\nview that the DNA test/profiling would conclusively prove whether the appellant had fathered the child\nand whether he had raped the victim, as he has denied raping her.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">34. This Court, vide order dated 13.10.2023 had directed that additional evidence was required to be\ntaken in terms of <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 391</a> Cr.P.C, by having a DNA test/profiling of the appellant and the child born\nto the victim, to prove whether the child had been fathered by the appellant. The learned Trial Court\nwas accordingly directed to take additional evidence for having a DNA test/profiling done on the\nappellant and the child of the victim. The learned Trial Court was to ensure all precautions were taken\nat the time of taking of samples from the above persons and making sure the samples were not\ncompromised in any manner. The learned Trial Court was to also ensure that the persons/institution\nwhich was going to conduct the DNA test/profiling, took all possible precautions so that the entire\ntesting procedure was not compromised in any manner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">35. Consequent to the above direction passed by this Court in the order dated 13.10.2023, the learned\nTrial Court has submitted a Confidential Report dated 08.11.2024 issued by the Directorate of Forensic\nScience, Kahilipara. Dr. Monalisha Choudhury, Senior Scientific Officer, DNA Typing Unit,\nDirectorate of Forensic Science, Kahilipara appeared before this Court on 05.09.2025 and stated that in\nterms of the Confidential Report dated 08.11.2024, the appellant was not the father of the child born to\nthe victim. The above fact having been cleared, the next issue to be decided is whether the evidence of\nthe victim was sufficient to convict the appellant, keeping in view the fact that the appellant had been\nconvicted on the sole testimony of the victim.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">36. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"120726166\" id=\"span_19\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/120726166/\" id=\"a_54\">Rai Sandeep Vs.

Sudip stopped me at Majhipara, gagged my mouth, told me not to shout, took me to\n       the nearby jungle and raped me. I resisted but he did not listen. He told me not to reveal it to\n       anyone. After raping me he released me and I came home. I did not told the incident to anyone\n       as the accused told me not to reveal it. I became pregnant. I was not aware that I became\n       pregnant due to rape by the accused. My husband expired about 4/5 years prior to the incident.\n       The village ladies asked me seeing my condition of bulging of the stomach and inquired me as\n       to what I have done. At that time I revealed them about the rape by the accused. Thereafter my\n       relative Phulkumari lodged the case against Sudip. Police inquired me, took me to hospital for\n       medical examination and also produced me before the Hakim. I stated the fact to the Hakim at\n       Bijni. I gave birth to a baby girl during Durga Puja. I have three sons and two daughters from\n       my husband. The daughters are married and my elder and younger son stays at Guwahati with\n       my daughter. One son stays with me.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">               XXX\n               It was around 7:00-8:00 PM and it was dark. There are two routes leading to our\n       village from Patiladaha bajar and I was coming through village road from the front of the\n       house of the accused as that route is short. I was not knowing the accused prior to the incident.\n       I was not knowing his name. After the incident I knew him. I was not knowing his name. I came\n       to know his name only when the case was filed, Joymoti told me the name of the accused. I was.\n       knowing Sudip&#x27;s mother earlier but not knowing Sudip.

It is not a fact that I did not get pregnant from the accused. It is not\n       a fact that I got pregnant from other person and on being questioned by the village women I\n       narrated a false story of rape on me by the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">38. A reading of the testimony of the victim and especially the cross examination, shows that the\nvictim had not seen the face of the rapist during the time she was raped. PW-7 has stated that she came\nto know the name of the rapist from one Joymati. However, neither has Joymati been made a\nprosecution witness nor has any evidence been given by Joymati. As such, there is a huge gap as to\nhow Joymati or the victim came to the conclusion that the appellant was the rapist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">       In her cross examination, the victim has denied the suggestion that she got pregnant because\nsome other person, other than the appellant, had impregnated her. However, as per the DNA test report,\nthe stand taken by the victim is found to be false, as the appellant is not the father of the child\nconceived by the victim.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">39. On considering the above evidence of the victim, we are not inclined to go any further into the\nevidence given by the other witnesses, inasmuch as, the testimony of the victim does not prove that the\nappellant had raped the victim.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">40. The learned Trial Court had convicted the appellant, on the finding that the victim had become\npregnant due to the appellant raping the victim and on the ground that in cases involving a rustic\nwoman, a Court should not insist on technicalities. The learned Trial Court thus held that as the\npregnancy of the victim had been proved, the statement of the victim that she had been raped by the\nappellant would have to be accepted. However, as can be seen from the DNA test/profiling done on the\nappellant and the child, the appellant is not the father of the child. As such, the very basis for the\nlearned Trial Court to have convicted the appellant does not have any legs to stand on. Further, the\nvictim came to know the name of the appellant only on being told by one Joymati, who did not give\nany evidence before the learned Trial Court, nor was she made a prosecution witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">                                                                                       Page No.# 15/15\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">41. On considering the above, we cannot agree with the findings of the learned Trial Court that the\ncase against the appellant had been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The victim cannot be said to\nbe a sterling witness and the conviction of the appellant on the sole testimony of the victim cannot be\nupheld, as the same does not inspire the confidence of this Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">42. In view of the reasons stated above, the impugned judgment being not sustainable, we acquit the\nappellant from the charges framed against him under <a href=\"/doc/455161/\" id=\"a_55\">section 376(1)</a> IPC.
