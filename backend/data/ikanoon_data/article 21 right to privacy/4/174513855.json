The appellants in the appeals are respondents 4\n\nto 6 in W.P.(C) No.29704 of 2015 and petitioners in W.P.(C)\n\nNo.2213 of 2018. Parties and documents are referred to in this\n\njudgment for convenience, as they appear in W.P.(C) No.29704\n\nof 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">             2.    The petitioner is a person residing at Vaikom in\n\na residential property owned by her. A toddy shop under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020      6</span>\n\n\n\nVaikom Excise Range is located in the property adjacent to the\n\nresidential property of the petitioner. Respondents 4 to 6 are\n\nthe licencees of the said toddy shop. According to the\n\npetitioner, since the functioning of the toddy shop has been\n\ncausing nuisance to her and family, she preferred a complaint\n\nto the first respondent, the Excise Commissioner, seeking\n\norders to change its location. Though it was found that the\n\ntoddy shop has been functioning in the same location and\n\npremises right from 1994-95 in accordance with the Rules\n\nframed under the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_1\">Abkari Act</a> and that the petitioner is a person\n\nwho started residing in the adjacent property after the\n\nestablishment of the toddy shop, the first respondent, as per\n\nExt.P7 order, directed respondents 4 to 6 to relocate the toddy\n\nshop, invoking Rule 7(3) of the Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal\n\nRules, 2002 (the Rules), holding that its functioning is causing\n\ninconvenience to the petitioner. Respondents 4 to 6 challenged\n\nExt.P7 order in revision before the Government mainly on the\n\nground that a suitable alternative place is not available in the\n\nlocality within the permissible limits and in terms of Ext.P12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        7</span>\n\n\n\norder, the Government modified Ext.P7 order permitting\n\nrespondents 4 to 6 to continue the toddy shop at the same\n\nlocation and premises until they get a suitable alternative place\n\nfor relocation. W.P.(C) No.29704 of 2015 was one filed\n\nchallenging Ext.P12 order to the extent it permits respondents 4\n\nto 6 to continue the toddy shop at its present location and\n\npremises until they get a suitable alternative place for\n\nrelocating the same, and W.P.(C) No.2213 of 2018 was filed by\n\nrespondents 4 to 6 challenging Exts.P7 and P12 orders.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">             3.    The writ petitions were heard along with a few\n\nother similar writ petitions challenging the location of toddy\n\nshops referred to therein.    The learned Single Judge took the\n\nview that the underlying concern in all the writ petitions is the\n\ninfringement of right to privacy of the petitioners and held that\n\nlocation of a toddy shop in a residential area would be in\n\nderogation of the right of the individuals to have respect for\n\ntheir private and family life. The learned Single Judge thereafter\n\nlaid down the criteria for deciding the question as to whether\n\nlocation of a particular shop would infringe the privacy rights of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        8</span>\n\n\n\nindividual/individuals who were raising objections/complaints\n\nagainst its location and then decided the writ petitions applying\n\nthe said criteria, having regard to the facts involved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"709776\" id=\"span_4\">4.    As far as the writ petitions from which these\n\nappeals arise, having found that the toddy shop is located in\n\nthe property adjacent to the residential property of the\n\npetitioner and having taken note of the fact that the first\n\nrespondent himself has found in Ext.P7 order that the\n\nfunctioning of the toddy shop is causing inconvenience to the\n\npetitioner, the learned Single Judge held that the location of the\n\ntoddy shop is infringing the privacy rights of the petitioner. One\n\nof the contentions raised by respondents 4 to 6 in the writ\n\npetition was that the residential property of the petitioner was\n\none acquired by her while the toddy shop was being run in the\n\nadjacent property and she is therefore estopped from raising\n\nany objection against the location of the toddy shop. As regards\n\nthe said contention, the learned Single Judge held, placing\n\nreliance on the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/709776/\" id=\"a_2\">Olga Tellis and\n\nothers v. Bombay Municipal Corporation and others</a>, AIR\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       9</span>\n\n\n\n1986 SC 180, that the right to privacy of the petitioner being a\n\nfundamental right, the same can be subjected only to\n\nconstitutional limitations and a claim for enforcement cannot be\n\ndefended based on a plea of estoppel. In the light of the said\n\nfindings, the learned Single Judge allowed W.P.(C) No.29704 of\n\n2015 restraining respondents 4 to 6 from operating the toddy\n\nshop and dismissed W.P.(C) No.2213 of 2018.      Respondents 4\n\nto 6 are aggrieved by the said decisions in the writ petitions\n\nand hence, these appeals.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">             5.    Heard Sri.Anwin John Antony, the learned\n\ncounsel for respondents 4 to 6, Dr.(Adv.)K.P.Satheesan, the\n\nlearned Senior Counsel for the petitioner and Dr.(Adv.)Thushara\n\nJames, the learned amicus curiae appointed in the matter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">             6.   The learned counsel for respondents 4 to 6\n\ncontended that the trade carried on by respondents 4 to 6, that\n\ntoo with the licence of the competent authority under the Rules\n\nframed under the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_3\">Abkari Act</a> being a lawful activity, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the same would infringe the right to privacy of any\n\none, especially when they have a constitutional right to carry on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        10</span>\n\n\n\nthe said activity in the light of the licence obtained by them. It\n\nwas also submitted by the learned counsel that the nuisance\n\nwhich the petitioner is complaining of, is the nuisance allegedly\n\ncaused by the general public and there must not therefore, be\n\nany action against the licensees on account of the alleged\n\nnuisance.     It was also argued by the learned counsel that\n\ninsofar as respondents 4 to 6 have been running the toddy shop\n\nin the same location and premises throughout the time when\n\nthe petitioner has purchased the adjacent land, constructed her\n\nresidential building therein and started residing therein, she is\n\nestopped from raising any objection against the lawful conduct\n\nof the toddy shop.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_7\">7.   Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel for the\n\npetitioner supported the impugned judgment pointing out that\n\nduring 1994-95 when the toddy shop was established in the\n\npresent location and premises, there was hardly anyone\n\nresiding in its vicinity, but in course of time, the location has\n\nbecome a thickly populated residential area and it is in the\n\naforesaid background that complaints happened to be lodged\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020      11</span>\n\n\n\nagainst the location of the toddy shop. It was also pointed out\n\nby the learned counsel that the petitioner was constrained to\n\napproach this Court since the competent authorities after\n\nhaving found that the toddy shop is liable to be relocated, did\n\nnot prescribe a time limit for the same. It was submitted by the\n\nlearned counsel that the functioning of a toddy shop in a thickly\n\npopulated residential area would certainly infringe the right to\n\nprivacy of the persons residing in its vicinity which is a\n\nfundamental right falling within the facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. To bring home the point that the functioning of\n\nthe toddy shop would infringe the right to privacy of the\n\npetitioner and others, the learned counsel relied on the decision\n\nof the Larger Bench of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_5\">K.S.Puttaswamy and\n\nanother v. Union of India and others</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1. The\n\nlearned counsel has read over to the Court paragraphs 126,\n\n264, 272, 297 to 299, 316, 344, 350, 499, 536, 604, 605 and\n\n650 in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_6\">the said judgment</a> to reinforce the said contention. For\n\nthe said purpose, the learned counsel also relied on the order\n\ndated 27.10.2021 passed by the Apex Court in W.P.(Crl.) No.314\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020           12</span>\n\n\n\nof 2021.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"675008\" id=\"span_10\">Placing reliance on the decisions of the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/675008/\" id=\"a_7\">Khoday Distilleries Ltd. and others v. State of Karnataka\n\nand others</a>, (1995) 1 SCC 574 and Nashirwar and others v.\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh and others, (1975) 1 SCC 29, the\n\nlearned    counsel     for   the   petitioner   submitted   that   the\n\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\n\nConstitution does not extend to trade in liquor which is res\n\nextra commercium, and restrictions which are not permissible\n\nwith other trades can certainly be imposed on trade in liquor.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79972\" id=\"span_11\">It\n\nwas also submitted by the learned counsel placing reliance on\n\nthe decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/79972/\" id=\"a_9\">Krishnan Kakkanth v.\n\nGovernment of Kerala and others</a>, (1997) 9 SCC 495 that\n\nreasonableness of a restriction is to be determined in an\n\nobjective manner, and from the standpoint of the interests of\n\nthe general public and not from the standpoint of the interests\n\nof the persons upon whom restrictions are imposed. It was\n\nasserted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the trade\n\nin liquor being res extra commercium, respondents 4 to 6 do\n\nnot have any fundamental right to carry on their activity and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       13</span>\n\n\n\nthe statutory right of respondents 4 to 6 to carry on trade in\n\nliquor has to give way to the fundamental right to privacy\n\navailable to the petitioner.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_13\">It was also submitted by the learned\n\ncounsel, placing reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_10\">Sharda v. Dharmpal</a>, (2003) 4 SCC 493 that even assuming\n\nthat respondents 4 to 6 have a fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_11\">Article\n\n19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution on the strength of the licence\n\nobtained by them, the right to privacy of the petitioner being\n\npart of the right to life guaranteed to the petitioner under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a>,     the same would    prevail over the rights of\n\nrespondents 4 to 6, for the fundamental right of the petitioner\n\nadvances public morality and public interest.       It was also\n\nargued by the learned counsel that even assuming that the\n\nright to privacy of the petitioner and others is not infringed on\n\naccount of the functioning of the toddy shop, insofar as it is\n\nfound by the competent authority in Ext.P7 order that the shop\n\nis one liable to be relocated under Rule 7(3) of the Rules and\n\ninsofar as <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_13\">the said decision</a> of the competent authority has not\n\nbeen interfered with in revision by the Government, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       14</span>\n\n\n\ndecision of the Government in permitting respondents 4 to 6 to\n\nrun the toddy shop until they find an alternative location and\n\npremises is arbitrary. In reply to the argument advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for respondents 4 to 6 that the petitioner is\n\nestopped from raising objections against the conduct of the\n\ntoddy shop, the learned counsel submitted that there cannot be\n\nany estoppel or waiver of fundamental rights guaranteed to the\n\ncitizens. The learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in Olga Tellis in support of the said proposition.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">             8.    Though the learned Senior Government Pleader\n\nsupported Ext.P7 order of the Excise Commissioner and Ext.P12\n\norder of the Government modifying Ext.P7 order, it was argued\n\nthat the Government has strong reservations against the\n\nfinding rendered by the learned Single Judge that location of a\n\ntoddy shop in a residential area would be in derogation of the\n\nright of individuals to respect their private and family life. The\n\nlearned Government Pleader also argued that the trade of\n\nrespondents 4 to 6 being a lawful activity undertaken on the\n\nstrength of the licence issued under a regulatory statute, in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       15</span>\n\n\n\nabsence of a challenge to the statutory provision in terms of\n\nwhich the licence is issued, one cannot be heard to contend\n\nthat the activity infringes any of the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed to the petitioner. It was also argued by the learned\n\nGovernment Pleader, that insofar as the learned Judge has also\n\nrejected the contention of the licensees that the petitioner who\n\ntook a conscious decision to reside in the vicinity of the toddy\n\nshop is not entitled to raise objections against the functioning of\n\nthe toddy shop, if the proposition that the functioning of a\n\ntoddy shop in the vicinity of a residential house would be in\n\nderogation of the right to privacy of the inhabitant therein is\n\nupheld, the position would be that no toddy shop could function\n\nin the State for there is hardly any area in the State where there\n\nis no residential house and even if any such area exists, there is\n\nno assurance that no one would reside in its vicinity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">             9.    On a query from the court as to why the\n\nGovernment has not preferred an appeal against the impugned\n\njudgment if the Government was aggrieved by the same, the\n\nlearned Government Pleader submitted that steps are being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020         16</span>\n\n\n\ntaken by the Government to challenge the impugned judgment\n\nin appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">             10.    The learned amicus curiae, after a scholarly\n\nresearch, made elaborate submissions on the various concepts\n\nnamely,      &quot;res   extra    commercium&quot;,    &quot;right   to   privacy&quot;,\n\n&quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;, &quot;waiver&quot;, &quot;horizontal\n\napplication of fundamental rights&quot; etc. referred to and relied on,\n\nin the impugned judgment by the learned Single Judge to arrive\n\nat the conclusion that the location of a toddy shop in a\n\nresidential area would be in derogation of the privacy rights of\n\ninhabitants of the locality. She has also elaborately referred to\n\nthe various foreign judgments relied on by the learned single\n\nJudge in the impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">             11.    As regards the concept of right to privacy, the\n\nlearned amicus curiae has referred to the various stages of the\n\ndevelopment of the right to privacy, right from the period of\n\nAristotle. She has referred to the 1890 essay by Samuel\n\nWarren and Louis Brandeis titled &quot;Right to Privacy&quot; and\n\nthe 1960 essay of William Prosser titled &quot;Privacy&quot;. She has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020         17</span>\n\n\n\nalso made submissions as to the development of the right to\n\nprivacy through US Courts by referring, among others to\n\nGriswold v. State of Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) and\n\nRoe v. Wade,          410 U.S. 113 (1973). She has also made\n\nsubmissions as to the development of the right to privacy\n\nthrough the European Courts by referring, among others, to\n\nBernstein of Leigh v. Skyviews &amp; General Ltd., [1978] QB\n\n479 and Halford v. United Kingdom, (1997) 24 EHRR 523).\n\nShe has also referred to the various international covenants\n\ndealing    with   &quot;individual   privacy&quot;   such   as   the   Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights, 1948, the International Covenant\n\non Civil and Political Rights, 1966 and the Convention for the\n\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1953\n\n(ECHR) which highlight the importance of privacy and explains\n\nit as a &quot;protection from interference&quot;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_20\">She has also referred to\n\nthe various judgments of the Apex Court, wherein the concept\n\nof right to privacy was dealt with, including the judgment in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_14\">M.P.Sharma v.

State of T.N. and others</a>,\n\n(1994) 6 SCC 632. The learned amicus curiae has also dealt\n\nwith   elaborately      the   decision     of    the    Apex    Court   in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy overruling M.P.Sharma and Kharak Singh\n\nholding that the right to privacy is a fundamental right under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Specific reference was made by\n\nthe learned amicus curiae to paragraphs 292, 399 to 405, 423,\n\n424, 426 and 560 of the judgment of the Apex Court in the said\n\ncase. The essence of the submissions made by the learned\n\namicus curiae as regards the concept of right to privacy was\n\nthat though right to privacy is a facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a>, despite not\n\nbeing an enumerated or enlisted right, it permeates every other\n\nright and it is a mutable concept, being a relational right.\n\nAccording to the learned amicus curiae, the cultural ethos,\n\nmorality,    public     perceptions,     laws,    customs,      attitudes,\n\ntechnological developments, family values and almost any and\n\nevery aspect of life and law can affect what privacy holds at a\n\nrelevant point in time. It was submitted by the learned amicus\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       19</span>\n\n\n\ncuriae that the test to be applied to determine as to whether\n\none holds an enforceable right of privacy is to ascertain\n\nwhether the right bearer&#x27;s privacy is interfered with. It was\n\nargued by the learned amicus curiae that while applying the\n\ntest aforesaid, regard must also be given to the bundle of\n\nrights, if any, already crystallised in others. It was pointed out\n\nthat if crystallised rights exist in favour of others, by way of a\n\nprocedure established by the State, such rights cannot be\n\ndisplaced, in the name of privacy. In such a context, the person\n\nwho claims privacy, is subjected to the reasonable restrictions\n\nthrough which State has already crystallised rights of others,\n\nsubmitted the amicus curiae. In short, the submission made by\n\nthe amicus curiae was that a right bearer cannot unsettle\n\nestablished rights, much less hold a reasonable expectation of\n\nasserting his right over and above the rights of others. The\n\nlearned amicus curiae concluded her argument pointing out\n\nthat privacy is the state of being with oneself and one&#x27;s\n\npossessions to the exclusion of others, the constitutional status\n\naccorded to it by raising it to the level of fundamental rights is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020           20</span>\n\n\n\nnot   for   its    casual    invocation,   but   for   its   responsible\n\nenforcement. It was also pointed by the learned amicus curiae\n\nthat in a world where Google compulsorily reminds us of what\n\nwe crave to forget, privacy may be hard to achieve. But legal\n\nsystems across the world, align to protect this right, for it is the\n\ncore, the compass and the cradle for any human development.\n\nAccording to her, the vigour and vitality of this constitutional\n\nright, that permeates every other right, should not be misused,\n\nelse it will destroy the very fulcrum of the Constitution.</span></span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">             12.   As    regards    the    concept     of    reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy, it was pointed out by the learned\n\namicus curiae that the concept was first conceived in the US in\n\nKatz v. United states, 389 U.S.347 (1967) and a two-prong\n\ntest was laid down in the said case to ascertain whether the\n\nright bearer has a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;, namely,\n\nthe person must show a &quot;subjective&quot; expectation that his\n\nactivities would be private and that the person must also show\n\nthat his subjective expectation of privacy is one which society\n\nconsiders &quot;reasonable&quot;. It was pointed out by the learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             21</span>\n\n\n\namicus    curiae     that    the    question   whether      a    reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy exists is a matter determined on a case\n\nby case basis, and is fact-specific.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">             13.    The learned amicus curiae has also submitted\n\nthat the various foreign judgments relied on by the learned\n\nJudge in the impugned judgment cannot have any relevance in\n\nthe context of the right to privacy found in favour of the\n\npetitioner. It was pointed out by the learned amicus curiae that\n\nthose are judgments dealing with <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 8</a> of the ECHR which\n\nrecognises reasonable restrictions. According to the learned\n\namicus    curiae,    it     was    highly   inappropriate       to   make   a\n\ncomparison between <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 8</a> of ECHR and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nIndian Constitution, for <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> as interpreted by Courts\n\ncarries within it, a wider right to privacy when compared to the\n\nright to privacy guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 8</a> of ECHR for private and\n\nfamily life, home and correspondence. It was also argued by the\n\nlearned amicus curiae that the concepts like public morality and\n\nsocial morality have nothing to do with the concept of privacy\n\nand the learned Judge ought not have introduced those\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        22</span>\n\n\n\nconcepts into the concept of privacy. The learned amicus curiae\n\nhas also submitted that the Constitution does not grant the\n\npower of impact assessment to Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> and\n\nthe impact assessment of the privacy rights made by the\n\nlearned Single Judge was highly inappropriate. The learned\n\namicus curiae has also submitted that privacy is to be\n\ndistinguished from expressions like public order, peace and\n\ntranquillity. It was pointed out that due to disruption of public\n\norder, peace and tranquillity, if a person grieves over violation\n\nof his privacy, then the State assumes a different role, and must\n\nstep in to protect the right to privacy as the guarantor of\n\nfundamental rights. But, according to the learned amicus\n\ncuriae, cases of this nature must be viewed as cases involving\n\npublic order, peace and tranquility, calling for State&#x27;s powers\n\nand duty to establish law and order, and not as cases involving\n\nright to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">             14.    It is seen that although the learned Single\n\nJudge referred to the concept of res extra commercium to find\n\nthat the licensees of the toddy shop are enjoying only a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        23</span>\n\n\n\nprivilege to vend toddy and the State is accountable and\n\nresponsible to the people as to the conduct of toddy shops, the\n\nlearned Judge did not rest the judgment on the said principle.\n\nInstead, the judgment is rested on the finding that the location\n\nof a toddy shop in a residential area would be in derogation of\n\nthe right of the inhabitants in that area to have respect for their\n\nprivate and family life, namely, their right to privacy. In order to\n\narrive at the said finding, the learned Judge referred to the\n\nobservations made by this Court and Bombay High Court in a\n\nfew earlier judgments that the rules in place need to be\n\namended to ensure that toddy shops are not allowed in busy\n\nresidential areas; that liquor shops shall not cause any\n\ninconvenience or threat to public peace to the residents in the\n\nlocality; that the Government ought to respect the wishes and\n\nfundamental rights of the people while granting liquor licence\n\netc. The learned Judge has also referred to for the said purpose\n\na few passages from the recent judgment of the Apex court in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy. The learned Judge thereafter referred to a\n\nfew judgments of the European Court of Human Rights dealing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        24</span>\n\n\n\nwith the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 8</a> of the ECHR providing that\n\neveryone has the right to respect for their private and family\n\nlife. The learned Judge then proceeded to hold that <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 8</a> of\n\nthe ECHR shall be read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution to\n\namplify the right to life in a sense to protect the privacy. It is on\n\na cumulative reference to the aforesaid materials that the\n\nlearned Judge came to the conclusion that establishment of\n\ntoddy shops in a residential area would be in derogation of the\n\nrights of the inhabitants therein to have respect for their private\n\nand family life. It is relevant to note that the petitioner in the\n\nwrit petition had no case that her right to privacy is affected in\n\nany manner on account of functioning of the toddy shop.\n\nInstead, the case set out by the petitioner was only that the\n\ntoddy shop is one to be relocated within a time frame in terms\n\nof Rules 7(3) of the Rules. The first and foremost question to be\n\nadjudicated therefore is as to whether the existence of a toddy\n\nshop in the proximity of a residential building would be in\n\nderogation of the right to privacy of the person residing therein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">             15. In order to adjudicate the question aforesaid, it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             25</span>\n\n\n\nis necessary to understand the scope of the right to privacy of\n\nan individual. The materials relied on by the Apex Court in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy reveal that the concept of privacy originated\n\nfrom the distinction made by the Greek philosopher Aristotle\n\nbetween the public sphere of political affairs and the personal\n\nsphere of human life. A &quot;right to be let alone&quot; was however\n\ndeveloped as part of the right to life much later by Samuel D.\n\nWarren and Louis D. Brandeis in their article &quot;the Right to\n\nPrivacy&quot; published in the year 1890.           According to the said\n\nauthors, solitude and privacy are necessary and essential for an\n\nindividual to lead his life in communities. It is about seventy\n\nyears thereafter, that William L. Prosser in his essay\n\npublished in the year 1960 titled &quot;Privacy&quot; attempted to define\n\nthe right to privacy, among others, as a protection from\n\nintrusion upon a person&#x27;s seclusion or solitude or private affairs.\n\nRight to privacy of an individual is considered as a natural and\n\ninseparable right, which inheres in every human being to\n\nprotect    the   innate      dignity   and   autonomy   of   man.   In\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy, privacy was held to be not only as an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020            26</span>\n\n\n\nintrinsic element of right to life and personal liberty under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution but also as a constitutional value\n\nwhich is embodied in the fundamental freedoms embedded in\n\nPart III of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">             16.    The question as to what privacy postulates has\n\nbeen attempted to be answered by the Apex Court in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy. Paragraphs 297 to 299, 322, 323, 325 and\n\n326 of the judgment in the said case rendered by Dr.D.Y.\n\nChandrachud, J. dealing with the essential nature of the right to\n\nprivacy read thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;Essential nature of privacy\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             297.   What, then, does privacy postulate?. Privacy postulates\n             the reservation of a private space for the individual, described\n             as the right to be let alone. The concept is founded on the\n             autonomy of the individual. The ability of an individual to make\n             choices lies at the core of the human personality. The notion of\n             privacy enables the individual to assert and control the human\n             element which is inseparable from the personality of the\n             individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality is\n             manifested in the ability to make decisions on matters intimate\n             to human life. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n             matters which can be kept private. These are concerns over\n             which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The body and\n             the mind are inseparable elements of the human personality.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020                 27</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the mind can exist\n             on the foundation that each individual possesses an inalienable\n             ability and right to preserve a private space in which the human\n             personality can develop. Without the ability to make choices,\n             the   inviolability   of   the     personality   would    be   in   doubt.\n             Recognising a zone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that\n             each individual must be entitled to chart and pursue the course\n             of development of personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of\n             human dignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which\n             are intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\n             where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy,\n             an individual is not judged by others. Privacy enables each\n             individual to take crucial decisions which find expression in the\n             human personality. It enables individuals to preserve their\n             beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences\n             and choices against societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is\n             an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of the\n             individual to be different and to stand against the tide of\n             conformity in creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects the\n             individual from the searching glare of publicity in matters which\n             are personal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the person\n             and not to the place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes\n             the foundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\n             individual can decide how liberty is best exercised. Individual\n             dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven\n             out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">             298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity.\n             Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value. As an\n             intrinsic   value,    human      dignity   is    an   entitlement   or   a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             28</span>\n\n\n\n             constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental\n             facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably intertwined, each\n             being a facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability of the\n             individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realisation of\n             the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning\n             of which privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in\n             privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only within a private space.\n             Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the\n             body and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to\n             make decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy has\n             not been couched as an independent fundamental right. But\n             that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded\n             to it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with\n             those fundamental rights which are expressly protected is\n             understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of protected\n             freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against\n             arbitrary State action. It prevents the State from discriminating\n             between individuals. The destruction by the State of a sanctified\n             personal space whether of the body or of the mind is violative\n             of the guarantee against arbitrary State action. Privacy of the\n             body entitles an individual to the integrity of the physical\n             aspects of personhood. The intersection between one&#x27;s mental\n             integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of\n             thought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the\n             freedom of self-determination. When these guarantees intersect\n             with gender, they create a private space which protects all\n             those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family,\n             marriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all integral to\n             the dignity of the individual. Above all, the privacy of the\n             individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             29</span>\n\n\n\n             freedom shall be exercised. An individual may perceive that the\n             best form of expression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a\n             realm of privacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul in a\n             creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a\n             process of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which\n             musically lead to silence. The silence, which lies within, reflects\n             on the ability to choose how to convey thoughts and ideas or\n             interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood.\n             The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the\n             individual is entitled to decide upon his or her preferences. Read\n             in conjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to\n             have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including\n             what and how one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one\n             will espouse and a myriad other matters on which autonomy\n             and self-determination require a choice to be made within the\n             privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of\n             religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability to\n             choose a faith and the freedom to express or not express those\n             choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner\n             in which privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the\n             exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not contain a separate\n             article telling us that privacy has been declared to be a\n             fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III\n             with an alpha-suffixed right to privacy : this is not an act of\n             judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both\n             reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom\n             which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate\n             expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional\n             value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020               30</span>\n\n\n\n             rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-\n             determination.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">             299. Privacy represents the core of the human personality and\n             recognises the ability of each individual to make choices and to\n             take decisions governing matters intimate and personal. Yet, it\n             is    necessary     to   acknowledge      that   individuals   live   in\n             communities and work in communities. Their personalities\n             affect and, in turn are shaped by their social environment. The\n             individual is not a hermit. The lives of individuals are as much a\n             social phenomenon. In their interactions with others, individuals\n             are    constantly    engaged     in   behavioural   patterns   and    in\n             relationships impacting on the rest of society. Equally, the life of\n             the individual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social\n             values imbibed from living in the community. This state of flux\n             which represents a constant evolution of individual personhood\n             in the relationship with the rest of society provides the rationale\n             for reserving to the individual a zone of repose. The lives which\n             individuals lead as members of society engender a reasonable\n             expectation of privacy. The notion of a reasonable expectation\n             of privacy has elements both of a subjective and objective\n             nature. Privacy at a subjective level is a reflection of those areas\n             where an individual desires to be left alone. On an objective\n             plane, privacy is defined by those constitutional values which\n             shape the content of the protected zone where the individual\n             ought to be left alone. The notion that there must exist a\n             reasonable expectation of privacy ensures that while on the one\n             hand, the individual has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the\n             other, the exercise of individual choices is subject to the rights\n             of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an individual who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020                31</span>\n\n\n\n             possesses a plot of land may decide to build upon it subject to\n             zoning regulations. If the building bye-laws define the area upon\n             which construction can be raised or the height of the boundary\n             wall around the property, the right to privacy of the individual is\n             conditioned by regulations designed to protect the interests of\n             the community in planned spaces. Hence while the individual is\n             entitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only on the\n             subjective expectation of the individual but on an objective\n             principle which defines a reasonable expectation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">                                            xxxxx\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">             322. Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. Privacy\n             has both a normative and descriptive function. At a normative\n             level privacy subserves those eternal values upon which the\n             guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are founded. At a\n             descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of entitlements\n             and interests which lie at the foundation of ordered liberty.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">             323. Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal\n             intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage, procreation, the\n             home and sexual orientation. Privacy also connotes a right to be\n             left   alone.    Privacy    safeguards   individual   autonomy    and\n             recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of\n             his or her life. Personal choices governing a way of life are\n             intrinsic   to   privacy.    Privacy   protects   heterogeneity   and\n             recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\n             legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate\n             zone to the private zone and from the private to the public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             32</span>\n\n\n\n             arenas, it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or\n             surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\n             Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential facet of\n             the dignity of the human being.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                                   xxxx\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">             325. Like other rights which form part of the fundamental\n             freedoms protected by Part III, including the right to life and\n             personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a>, privacy is not an absolute\n             right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to\n             withstand   the   touchstone   of   permissible   restrictions   on\n             fundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> an invasion of\n             privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which stipulates a\n             procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must also\n             be valid with reference to the encroachment on life and\n             personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21.</a> An invasion of life or personal\n             liberty must meet the threefold requirement of (i) legality,\n             which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in\n             terms of a legitimate State aim; and (iii) proportionality which\n             ensures a rational nexus between the objects and the means\n             adopted to achieve them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">             326. Privacy has both positive and negative content. The\n             negative content restrains the State from committing an\n             intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\n             positive content imposes an obligation on the State to take all\n             necessary measures to protect the privacy of the individual.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             33</span>\n\n\n\nParagraphs 399, 402, 403 and 405 of the judgment in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy rendered by S.A.Bobde, J., dealing with the\n\ncontent of the right to privacy read thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">              The content of the right to privacy\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">              399. It might be broadly necessary to determine the nature\n              and content of privacy in order to consider the extent of its\n              constitutional protection. As in the case of &quot;life&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article\n              21</a>, a precise definition of the term &quot;privacy&quot; may not be\n              possible. This difficulty need not detain us. Definitional and\n              boundary-setting challenges are not unique to the rights\n              guaranteed in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21.</a> This feature is integral to many core\n              rights, such as the right to equality. Evidently, the expansive\n              character of any right central to constitutional democracies like\n              ours has nowhere stood in the way of recognising a right and\n              treating it as fundamental where there are strong constitutional\n              grounds on which to do so.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                                            xxxx\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">              402.&quot;Privacy&quot; is &quot;[t]he condition or state of being free from\n              public attention to intrusion into or interference with one&#x27;s acts\n              or decisions&quot;. The right to be in this condition has been\n              described as &quot;the right to be let alone&quot; . What seems to be\n              essential to privacy is the power to seclude oneself and keep\n              others from intruding it in any way. These intrusions may be\n              physical or visual, and may take any of several forms including\n              peeping over one&#x27;s shoulder to eavesdropping directly or\n              through instruments, devices or technological aids.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020              34</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">              403. Every individual is entitled to perform his actions in\n              private. In other words, she is entitled to be in a state of repose\n              and to work without being disturbed, or otherwise observed or\n              spied upon. The entitlement to such a condition is not confined\n              only to intimate spaces such as the bedroom or the washroom\n              but goes with a person wherever he is, even in a public place.\n              Privacy has a deep affinity with seclusion (of our physical\n              persons and things) as well as such ideas as repose, solitude,\n              confidentiality and secrecy (in our communications), and\n              intimacy. But this is not to suggest that solitude is always\n              essential to privacy. It is in this sense of an individual&#x27;s liberty\n              to do things privately that a group of individuals, however\n              large, is entitled to seclude itself from others and be private. In\n              fact, a conglomeration of individuals in a space to which the\n              rights of admission are reserved--as in a hotel or a cinema hall\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">              --must be regarded as private. Nor is the right to privacy lost\n              when a person moves about in public. The law requires a\n              specific authorisation for search of a person even where there\n              is suspicion. Privacy must also mean the effective guarantee of\n              a zone of internal freedom in which to think. The disconcerting\n              effect of having another peer over one&#x27;s shoulder while reading\n              or writing explains why individuals would choose to retain their\n              privacy even in public. It is important to be able to keep one&#x27;s\n              work without publishing it in a condition which may be\n              described as private. The vigour and vitality of the various\n              expressive freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution depends\n              on the existence of a corresponding guarantee of cognitive\n              freedom.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             35</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">                                         xxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">              405. Privacy, that is to say, the condition arrived at after\n              excluding other persons, is a basic prerequisite for exercising\n              the liberty and the freedom to perform that activity. The\n              inability to create a condition of selective seclusion virtually\n              denies an individual the freedom to exercise that particular\n              liberty or freedom necessary to do that activity.\n\n\n\nAs evident from the extracted excerpts, privacy is the\n\nconstitutional core of human dignity. It postulates a private\n\nspace for an individual to make choices and to take decisions\n\nconcerning matters intimate and personal to human life for\n\nmanifestation of his dignity. It safeguards individual autonomy\n\nand recognises the ability of the individual to control vital\n\naspects of his life. The very basis of the right to privacy is the\n\nfreedom to exercise the personal choices. It is on account of this\n\nreason that it is stated that the right to privacy permeates\n\nevery other right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.\n\nWhile the legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from\n\nintimate zone to private zone and from private zone to public\n\nzone, privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        36</span>\n\n\n\nindividual is in a public space. The right to privacy has multiple\n\nfacets and it varies from person to person, dependent on their\n\napproach to society and concern for privacy. One should\n\nhowever have a reasonable expectation of the privacy and its\n\nextent is based, not on the subjective expectation of the\n\nindividual, but on an objective principle which defines a\n\nreasonable expectation having regard to the rights of others to\n\nlead orderly lives. Privacy has both positive and negative\n\ncontents. The negative content restrains the State from\n\ncommitting an intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a\n\ncitizen. Its positive content imposes an obligation on the State\n\nto take all necessary measures to protect the privacy of\n\nindividuals. As noted, insofar as individuals live and work in\n\ncommunities, the right to privacy, like other rights falling under\n\nthe umbrella of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a>, is not an absolute right and it is\n\nsubject to the rights of others to lead orderly lives. Likewise,\n\nprivacy violations must be real and existing, not imaginary or\n\nanticipated. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to\n\nwithstand     the   touchstone   of    permissible   restrictions   on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020               37</span>\n\n\n\nfundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a>, an invasion of\n\nprivacy must be justified on the basis of a law which stipulates\n\na procedure which is fair, just and reasonable.               Similarly, the\n\nlaw must also be valid with reference to the encroachment on\n\nlife and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21.</a> Again, an invasion of\n\nlife or personal liberty must meet the threefold requirement of\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">(i) legality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need,\n\ndefined    in   terms    of   a    legitimate    State    aim;      and     (iii)\n\nproportionality, which ensures a rational nexus between the\n\nobjects and the means adopted to achieve them.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">             17.   Although divergent views were expressed in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy          as    to   the    application    of   the    test     of\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy for ascertaining whether a\n\nprivacy      claim      is     constitutionally         enforceable,          in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy and another (Aadhaar) v. Union of India\n\nand another, (2019) 1 SCC 1, the Apex Court clarified that\n\nthe test of reasonable expectation of privacy has been\n\napproved in K.S.Puttaswamy. In addition, it was also held in\n\nK.S.Puttaswamy (Aadhaar) that the test of reasonable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             38</span>\n\n\n\nexpectation of privacy would not only ensure that the individual\n\nhas a protected zone of privacy, but also that the exercise of\n\nindividual choices is subject to the right of others to lead\n\norderly lives. It was also held in the said case that all matters\n\npertaining to individuals do not qualify as being an inherent\n\npart of right to privacy and that only those matters over which\n\nthere would be a reasonable expectation of privacy are\n\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21</a>, indicating clearly that breach of\n\nprivacy rights can be claimed only when claimant on the facts\n\nof a particular case and circumstances has &quot;reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy&quot;. The relevant portions of paragraphs\n\n341.2, 511.1 and 638 to 640 of the judgment of the Apex Court\n\nin K.S.

Further, the notion of\n               reasonable expectation of privacy has both subjective and\n               objective elements. At a subjective level it means &quot;an\n               individual desires to be left alone&quot;. On an objective plain\n               privacy is defined by those constitutional values which shape\n               the content of the protected zone where the individual &quot;ought\n               to be left alone&quot;. Further, the notion of reasonable expectation\n               of privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the individual\n               has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the other &quot;the exercise\n               of individual choices is subject to the right of others to lead\n               orderly lives&quot;.

After noticing several judgments of the US Supreme\n               Court,    D.Y.    Chandrachud,     J.   in   <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_43\">K.S.   Puttaswamy     [K.S.\n               Puttaswamy v. Union of India</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1] has noted that\n               the reasonable expectation of privacy test has been relied on\n               by various other jurisdictions while developing the right to\n               privacy. In para 195, the following has been held : (SCC p. 449)\n                             &quot;195. The development of the jurisprudence on the\n                        right to privacy in the United States of America shows\n                        that even though there is no explicit mention of the\n                        word &quot;privacy&quot; in the Constitution, the courts of the\n                        country have not only recognised the right to privacy\n                        under various amendments to the Constitution but also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             44</span>\n\n\n\n                     progressively extended the ambit of protection under\n                     the right to privacy. In its early years, the focus was on\n                     property and protection of physical spaces that would\n                     be considered private such as an individual&#x27;s home. This\n                     &quot;trespass doctrine&quot; became irrelevant when it was held\n                     that what is protected under the right to privacy is\n                     &quot;people, not places&quot;. The &quot;reasonable expectation of\n                     privacy&quot; test has been relied on subsequently by\n                     various other jurisdictions while developing the right to\n                     privacy.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">As discernible from the extracted excerpts, before coming to\n\nthe conclusion as to whether a privacy claim is actionable, it is\n\nobligatory for the Court to consider (1) whether the individual,\n\nby his conduct, has &quot;exhibited an actual expectation of\n\nprivacy&quot;, (2) whether the individual has shown that &quot;he seeks\n\nto preserve something as private&quot;, (3) whether the individual&#x27;s\n\nsubjective expectation of privacy is &quot;one that society is\n\nprepared to recognize as &quot;reasonable&quot; and (4) whether                     the\n\nindividual&#x27;s expectation, viewed objectively, is &quot;justifiable&quot;\n\nunder the circumstances.         Having thus understood the scope of\n\nright to privacy protected in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020          45</span>\n\n\n\nConstitution, let us consider the question whether the existence\n\nof a toddy shop in the proximity of a residential building would\n\nbe in derogation of the right to privacy of the person residing\n\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">             18.   In order to consider the question as to whether\n\nthe facts of the case disclose a case of privacy enforceable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, it is necessary to examine\n\nthe correctness of the proposition <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_46\">laid down by</a> the learned\n\nSingle Judge that existence of a toddy shop near a residential\n\npremise would be in derogation of the right to privacy of the\n\ninhabitants therein. The fact that toddy shops are run in the\n\nState in accordance with the provisions contained in the Rules\n\nframed under the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_47\">Abkari Act</a> is not in dispute. The petitioners in\n\nthe writ petitions have no case that the existence of toddy\n\nshops in a residential area would be in derogation of their right\n\nto privacy. Also, there was no challenge in any of the writ\n\npetitions    against    the   statutory   provision   which   permits\n\nestablishment of toddy shops in residential areas. As such, even\n\nassuming that the conduct of toddy shops is adversely affecting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             46</span>\n\n\n\nthe privacy rights of the inhabitants in the locality, insofar as\n\nthe right to privacy is not an absolute one, but only a right\n\navailable to individual subject to the rights of others to lead\n\norderly lives, in the absence of a finding in the impugned\n\njudgment      that        the   statutory   provision   which    permits\n\nestablishment        of    toddy    shops   in   residential    areas   is\n\nunconstitutional in any manner inasmuch as it does not satisfy\n\nthe requirement of &quot;procedure established by law&quot; as contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the learned Single Judge has\n\nerred in holding that the existence of a toddy shop in a\n\nresidential area would be derogation of the right to privacy of\n\nthe people in the locality, for without such a finding, conduct of\n\na toddy shop in a residential area is a permissible activity in\n\nterms of statutory provision. Although the learned Single Judge\n\nhas found that violation of the right to privacy is liable to be\n\nread into Rule 7(3) of the Rules as a ground to order relocation\n\nof a shop, for the said provision confers power on the\n\nCommissioner of Excise to order transfer of shops or to close\n\nthe shops in the interest of public peace, morality or grounds of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020               47</span>\n\n\n\nexpediency, such a finding was not rendered in the context of\n\nRule 7(2) of the Rules permitting establishment of toddy shops\n\nin residential areas as well. Be that as it may, according to us,\n\nthe said finding cannot be understood as a finding that the\n\nstatutory provision is unconstitutional. The reason being that\n\nthe role of the High Court exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution is only to examine whether the statute or the\n\nstatutory provision, as the case may be, conforms to the\n\nconstitutional provisions, and not to undertake an exercise to\n\nmake a statute or statutory provision conforming to the\n\nconstitutional provisions, if it is not otherwise. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"903846\" id=\"span_53\">The proposition\n\naforesaid has been reiterated by the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/903846/\" id=\"a_50\">Union of\n\nIndia and others v.

Now, we will examine whether there is any\n\nfactual basis for the learned Single Judge in holding that the\n\nexistence of a toddy shop in a residential area would be in\n\nderogation of the right to privacy of the inhabitants of the\n\nlocality. Among the cases dealt with by the learned Judge, in\n\nW.P.(C) No.29704 of 2015 from which W.A.No.389 of 2020\n\narises, the grievance voiced was only that      persons who are\n\ncoming to the toddy shop are causing nuisance to the\n\npetitioner. In W.P.(C) No.41459 of 2018, the grievance voiced\n\nhowever was that food is being served in the toddy shop\n\nwithout obtaining licence from the local authority. In W.P.(C)\n\nNo.20809 of 2019, the grievance voiced, however, was\n\nconcerning the possible nuisance on account of discharge of\n\nwaste from a proposed toddy shop and the grievance voiced in\n\nW.P.(C) No.25901 of 2018 concerns the decision of the\n\ncompetent authority to relocate an existing toddy shop near to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             49</span>\n\n\n\na residential colony. In the report filed by one among the Amici\n\nCuriae appointed in the matter by the Single Judge, a few ill\n\neffects of toddy shops in residential area were indicated. The\n\nrelevant portion of the report reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                      •   &quot;It is mainly pointed out that women and children\n                          who walk through the public roads near toddy\n                          shops are the main sufferers. Owing to their\n                          intoxication, it is said that, the toddy drinkers, pass\n                          lewd comments on them and also use abusive\n                          language. Girls in those area often face harassment\n                          and intimidation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                      •   The toddy shop has a bad influence on children\n                          growing up in the localities, making them gullible to\n                          addiction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                      •   The brawls in and outside the toddy shop often\n                          affect the peaceful atmosphere in the nearby\n                          homes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">It is seen that it is placing reliance on the said observations and\n\na few judgments of the European Court of Human Rights\n\n(ECtHR) that the learned Single Judge has rendered a finding\n\nthat the existence of a toddy shop in the vicinity of a residential\n\nhouse would be in derogation of the right to privacy of the\n\ninhabitants therein. As noted, privacy postulates, in essence, a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       50</span>\n\n\n\nprivate space for an individual to make choices and to take\n\ndecisions concerning matters intimate and personal to his life\n\nfor manifestation of his dignity and to safeguard his individual\n\nautonomy. The right to privacy varies from person to person,\n\ndependent on his approach to the society and concern for\n\nprivacy. The life an individual leads as a member of a society\n\ngives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The right to\n\nprivacy will not extend beyond that reasonable expectation and\n\neven that right is to be exercised subject to the rights of others\n\nto lead orderly lives. In other words, the right to privacy of an\n\nindividual is not dependent on the avocation and activities of\n\nothers around him and it is only when an individual is not able\n\nto make choices or take decisions concerning matters intimate\n\nand personal to him as a human being for manifestation of his\n\ndignity, it could be said that the right to privacy of that person\n\nis infringed. There is no finding by the learned Single Judge in\n\nthe impugned judgment as to how the privacy of the\n\ninhabitants around a toddy shop is infringed on account of the\n\nfunctioning of the toddy shop. The observations made by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020              51</span>\n\n\n\namicus curiae appointed in the writ petitions as <a href=\"/doc/903846/\" id=\"a_51\">referred to\n\nabove</a> would only indicate, at the most, that the conduct of a\n\ntoddy shop may cause nuisance or breach of public peace or\n\nraise moral concerns. Nuisance, breach of peace, moral\n\nconcerns etc. have nothing to do with privacy, though\n\ndisruption of public order, peace and tranquillity may at times\n\nlead to infringement of privacy rights. But, disruption of public\n\norder,   peace     and       tranquillity    cannot   be   understood   as\n\nsynonymous to breach of privacy rights. According to us, the\n\ngeneral concerns expressed by the amicus curiae in the writ\n\npetitions are all taken care of in the Rules inasmuch as the\n\nRules empowers the authorities concerned to relocate a toddy\n\nshop in the interest of public peace or morality or on grounds of\n\nexpediency. When the Rules take care of the concerns\n\naforesaid, it was unnecessary for the learned Single Judge to\n\naddress the issue of violation of privacy rights that may arise in\n\nthe event of the breach of the Rules, for the basic issue\n\nconcerns only nuisance or breach of public peace or morality. A\n\nperusal of the impugned judgment reveals that the view taken\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020        52</span>\n\n\n\nby the learned Single Judge is that anything and everything that\n\naffects the peaceful residence of a person would affect its\n\nprivacy rights. We are unable to agree. If privacy rights\n\nenforceable under the Constitution are expanded to this level,\n\nwe are afraid that there would be utter chaos as regards the\n\nrights of others including the right to livelihood, for in the social\n\nset up of our country, there are umpteen avocations and\n\nactivities which people may pursue for their livelihood near the\n\nplace of residence of others and a very wide definition of\n\nprivacy rights protected under the Constitution as made by the\n\nlearned Single Judge would give rise to conflicts as to the\n\npermissible and non-permissible activities near a residential\n\nhouse. As observed by the Apex Court in paragraph 423 of the\n\njudgment in K.S.Puttaswamy, right to privacy is a relational\n\nright insofar as it is always connected on the actions which are\n\nsought to be secured from interference to the acts of\n\nassociating with others. Further, as noted, right to privacy\n\nvaries from person to person and country to country, dependent\n\non the socio-economic background, the approach to society and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020            53</span>\n\n\n\nconcern for privacy.         In other words, right to privacy to be\n\npreserved and protected in one country may not be the right to\n\nprivacy to be preserved and protected in another country. In the\n\nsaid view of the matter, according to us, the judgments of the\n\nECtHR cannot have any relevance in the context of deciding the\n\nscope of privacy of an individual in the context of the Indian\n\nsociety. That apart, it is seen that the very scope of the\n\njurisdiction of the ECtHR is to determine whether the laws in the\n\ncountries over which it has jurisdiction provides an adequate\n\nremedy in a specific case in which it considered whether there\n\nhas been an invasion of privacy contrary to <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 8</a> of the\n\nECHR which provides that everyone has right to respect for his\n\nprivate and family life, home and correspondence and whether\n\nthe   restriction,    if     any,   imposed   is   justifiable.   In   the\n\ncircumstances, the reliance placed by the learned Single Judge\n\non the judgments of the ECtHR is misplaced. We are therefore\n\ninclined to hold that there was no factual basis for the learned\n\nSingle Judge to hold that the existence of a toddy shop in a\n\nresidential area would be in derogation of the right to privacy of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020         54</span>\n\n\n\nthe inhabitants of the locality.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">             20.   Let us now examine the question as to whether\n\nthe facts of the writ petitions from which these writ appeals\n\narise disclose a case of privacy enforceable in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution. As noted, the toddy shop is functioning\n\nin the property adjacent to the residential property of the\n\npetitioner and the grievance of the petitioner in the writ petition\n\nwas that the conduct of the toddy shop causes nuisance to her\n\nand her family.      It is not disputed by the petitioner that the\n\ntoddy shop is functioning in the same locality and premises\n\nright from the year 1994. The petitioner has purchased the land\n\nadjacent to the toddy shop only much later, in the year 2005. It\n\nis still after about five years, that the petitioner constructed the\n\nresidential building therein. It is still after a few years thereafter\n\nthat the petitioner chose to reside in the building. Even\n\nassuming that nuisance is caused to the petitioner on account\n\nof the functioning of the toddy shop and that the said nuisance\n\namounts to breach of privacy rights of the petitioner, the\n\nquestion to be examined is whether such rights are protected\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020            55</span>\n\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. As noted, before holding\n\nthat a privacy claim is actionable, it is obligatory for the Court\n\nto consider whether the individual, by his conduct, has\n\nexhibited an actual expectation of privacy and sought to\n\npreserve the same.           Likewise, before holding a privacy claim\n\nactionable, it is also necessary for the Court to consider\n\nwhether the individual&#x27;s subjective expectation of privacy is one\n\nthat the society is prepared to recognize as reasonable and\n\njustifiable under the circumstances. According to us, the\n\nconduct of the petitioner in purchasing a land lying adjacent to\n\na toddy shop for construction of a residential building, the\n\nconduct of the petitioner in taking an informed decision after a\n\nconsiderable time to construct a building therein for her\n\nresidence, the conduct of the petitioner in residing in that\n\nbuilding a few years thereafter while the toddy shop was being\n\nrun uninterruptedly in the adjacent land do not lead to an\n\ninference that the petitioner, by her conduct, has exhibited an\n\nactual expectation of the alleged privacy and sought to\n\npreserve the same. Even if it is assumed that the petitioner has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020               56</span>\n\n\n\nexhibited an actual expectation of the alleged privacy, we do\n\nnot think that on the facts of this case, the society would\n\nrecognize the expectation of privacy in a case of this nature as\n\nreasonable and justifiable under the circumstances. In other\n\nwords, a case of privacy protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution is not made out in the writ petitions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">             21.   The       surviving        question   is   as   to   the\n\nsustainability of Ext.P7 order of the first respondent and Ext.P12\n\norder of the Government. As noted, the first respondent\n\ndirected respondents 4 to 6 to relocate the toddy shop, invoking\n\nRule 7(3) of the Rules, holding that its functioning is causing\n\ninconvenience to the petitioner. In terms of Ext.P7 order, the\n\nfirst respondent has also directed the concerned Excise official\n\nto enforce the same in a time bound manner. In the light of the\n\nprovisions contained in Rule 7(3) of the Rules and the finding\n\nrendered in Ext.P7 order that the functioning of the toddy shop\n\nis affecting the peaceful residence of the petitioner and\n\nmembers of her family, the first respondent cannot be found\n\nfault with for having taken the view that the toddy shop is one\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020           57</span>\n\n\n\nwhich is liable to be relocated. It is seen that it is having regard\n\nto the fact that respondents 4 to 6 were running the shop in the\n\nsame premises and location from the year 1994 and the fact\n\nthat the petitioner is a person who has constructed a residential\n\nhouse in the property adjacent to the toddy shop while the\n\ntoddy shop was being run in that premises without interruption\n\nand also the fact that it is not easy to find out an\n\nunobjectionable      site    to   relocate   the   toddy   shop,   the\n\nGovernment modified Ext.P7 order permitting respondents 4 to\n\n6 to run the toddy shop in the same premises and location until\n\nthey find a suitable place for relocation. We do not find any\n\ninfirmity in the decision of the Government as well.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">             22.   It is relevant to note that though Rule 7(3) of\n\nthe Rules confers power on the first respondent not only to\n\nrelocate a toddy shop, but also to close it down on the grounds\n\nmentioned therein, the first respondent has chosen not to\n\nexercise the power to close down the shop on the complaint of\n\nthe petitioner. In other words, even according to the first\n\nrespondent, the shop is not one to be closed down. As noted,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020       58</span>\n\n\n\nthe specific case put forward by respondents 4 to 6 in the\n\nrevision petition preferred by them challenging Ext.P7 order\n\nbefore the Government is that there is no unobjectionable\n\npremises available within the boundaries of the shop for the\n\npurpose of relocation. The petitioner also does not have a case\n\nthat there are other places within the boundaries of the shop\n\nwhere it could be relocated. In a case of this nature, if it is not\n\neasy to find an unobjectionable premises within the limits of the\n\nboundary of the toddy shop, and if this Court directs time\n\nbound implementation of Exts.P7 and P12 orders, respondents\n\n4 to 6 would be constrained to close down the shop which is not\n\nintended by the competent authority in terms of Ext.P7 order.\n\nThe petitioner is therefore not entitled to a time bound\n\nimplementation of Exts.P7 and P12 orders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">             23.   Coming to the challenge to Ext.P7 order made\n\nby respondents 4 to 6, the trade for which licence is granted to\n\nthem being subject to Rule 7(3) of the Rules, insofar as it is\n\nfound by the competent authority that a ground for relocation\n\nof the toddy shop exists, this Court may not be justified in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\"> W.A. Nos.389 &amp; 391 of 2020             59</span>\n\n\n\ninterfering with the factual conclusion arrived at by the\n\ncompetent authority in this regard, especially when they derive\n\nthe right to run the shop in terms of the Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">             24.   In the result, the impugned judgment is set\n\naside and the writ petitions, viz, W.P.(C) Nos.29704 of 2015 and\n\n2213 of 2018 are dismissed. It is, however, made clear that this\n\njudgment will not stand in the way of the petitioner moving the\n\nfirst respondent for follow up action for enforcement of Ext.P7\n\norder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">             Before    parting,   we        also   place   on     record   our\n\nboundless appreciation for the able assistance given by the\n\nlearned amicus curiae Dr.(Adv.)Thushara James, for rendering\n\nthis judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">                                                      Sd/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">                                       P.B.SURESH KUMAR, JUDGE.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">                                                                Sd/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">                                                     C.S.SUDHA, JUDGE.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">ds/Mn/YKB\n </p>","numcites":16,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Kerala High Court","citetid":174513855,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"article 21 right to privacy","formInput":"article%2021%20right%20to%20privacy"},{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"article 21 of constitution","formInput":"article%2021%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION","formInput":"LEGITIMATE%20EXPECTATION"},{"value":"human dignity","formInput":"human%20dignity"},{"value":"res extra commercium","formInput":"res%20extra%20commercium"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"aadhaar","formInput":"aadhaar"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"Right to privacy is fundamental right","formInput":"Right%20to%20privacy%20is%20fundamental%20right"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"amicus curiae","formInput":"amicus%20curiae"},{"value":"encroachment as is where is","formInput":"encroachment%20as%20is%20where%20is"},{"value":"personal right","formInput":"personal%20right"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"public morality","formInput":"public%20morality"},{"value":"scc online ","formInput":"scc%20online%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"right-to-occupation, fundamental-right","formInput":"tag:right-to-occupation, fundamental-right"},{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
