Humans by nature are social animals. They are\n\nnot living in isolation in society. They possess\n\nfreedom       and     liberty         of   choice.      Humans    possess\n\ncertain          inalienable           rights        which       are     so\n\nfundamental and related to their person and body.\n\nThe aspiration of humans as individuals is to live\n\nwith     dignity.         This       notion    of   the    individual&#x27;s\n\nright to choose a life of his own began to be\n\nconfronted         with,      in     history     when     the   sovereign\n\nstarted limiting his authority. The moral value of\n\nsensations to secure a private life, not entangled\n\nwith      the     public        sphere,        created     a    sense    of\n\npossessiveness in man. This individualistic notion\n\nand    idea      of    private       reason     identified       with   the\n\ndignity of the individual is a starting point for\n\ndefining privacy as a right.

Then the &quot;right to life&quot; served\nonly to protect the subject from battery in its various\nforms; liberty meant freedom from actual restraint; and the\nright to property secured to the individual his lands and\nhis   cattle.

The doors to this public space have\n\nbeen opened forever, making the identity of the\n\nindividual digitally immortal. Digital immortality\n\ndefines the continuation of an active or passive\n\ndigital       presence         even       after   death.        The     online\n\npresence        of    data     permanently        raises         new   issues\n\nregarding        the      right      to   privacy.

This problem\n\nbefore the Courts in India essentially stems from\n\nthis new era of technology due to the lack of\n\nlegislation          or    regulation.         The    intersection           of\n\nprivacy and technology has become a challenge to\n\nthe judicial administrator as well.

If there is one principle which runs\nthrough the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the\nprinciple of the rule of law and under the Constitution, it\nis    the    judiciary          which    is        entrusted       with    the    task    of\nkeeping every organ of the State within the limits of the\nlaw    and       thereby       making    the       rule     of    law   meaningful       and\neffective. It is to aid the judiciary in this task that the\npower       of    judicial       review        has      been      conferred      upon    the\njudiciary         and     it     is     by     exercising          this    power     which\nconstitutes one of the most potent weapons in armory of the\nlaw,    that       the     judiciary         seeks        to     protect   the     citizen\nagainst violation of his constitutional or legal rights or\nmisuse of abuse of power by the State or its officers.

But it\nis   necessary        to    remind     ourselves       that    the       concept   of\nindependence        of     the    judiciary       is   not    limited       only   to\nindependence from executive pressure or influence but it is\na    much     wider        concept    which       takes      within      its   sweep\nindependence from many other pressures and prejudices.

The independent judiciary was thus obliged to\n\nensure that the supremacy of law prevailed. The\n\nConstitution envisages that the judiciary not only\n\nstates the law through an interpretative process\n\nbut also protects the Constitution and democracy.\n\nIn that process, the judiciary cannot act like\n\nunelected         legislators               and    erode           parliamentary\n\nsupremacy to legislate by undermining the rule of\n\nlaw. The essence of democracy, characteristically,\n\nis    defined       by      the      role    of    each       institution          to\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                      -:34:-</span>\n\n\nsustain         the         balance         contemplated                 in     the\n\nConstitution, making each independent in its own\n\nsphere.       Democracy         literally           means      rule        by    the\n\npeople.        The     term      is       derived        from        the       Greek\n\ndēmokratia, which was coined from dēmos (&quot;people&quot;)\n\nand    kratos        (&quot;rule&quot;)        in    the      middle          of   the    5th\n\nCentury BCE to denote the political systems then\n\nexisting in some Greek city-states, notably Athens\n\n[Source       online        Britannica,        viewed          on    11/12/24].\n\nThe     independent          judiciary         being       a    creation          of\n\ndemocracy,         must      also     possess        the       character          of\n\ndemocratic            institutions             by        allowing             public\n\nscrutiny.        In     a    true     liberal        democracy,               public\n\nopinion is necessary.

In\n\nthe      Indian        scenario,             these        rights           rest     on\n\nfundamental rights not like in Europe, where it is\n\nbased on European directives and more or less a\n\nregulatory          mechanism             exists         related           to     data\n\ntransmission             or          dissemination               of        personal\n\ninformation.           Therefore,              the       right        to    erasure\n\ncannot be understood in the same manner, as we\n\nrefer to the right to be forgotten. The right to\n\nbe forgotten can be claimed to erase memory to\n\nmove forward in life with dignity. Whereas, when\n\nthe    information            is     incorrect           or   irrelevant           the\n\nright to erasure can be claimed.

In Open\n\nCourt      proceedings,            any     onlooker            is    entitled    to\n\nwatch      proceedings         and       report         any     case    that    the\n\nCourt considers. If that cannot be prevented, can\n\nCourts      prevent         uploading             and       publishing    of    the\n\njudgments online? It is here that the issue of\n\nanonymity related to privacy crops up. The parties\n\nmay not have any objection to the uploading of the\n\njudgments by masking the details of the litigants.\n\nThere may be a plethora of reasons for a litigant\n\nto prevent disclosure of the names or the content.\n\nThat perhaps requires a balancing exercise to be\n\ngenerally        guided       by     the          governing         informational\n\npolicy of the judiciary.

The pursuit of a legitimate\nState    aim       ensures       that     the          law    does     not         suffer     from\nmanifest       arbitrariness.             Legitimacy,                as        a     postulate,\ninvolves       a     value       judgment.             Judicial       review          does       not\nreappreciate or second guess the value judgment of the\nlegislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is\nsought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest\narbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means\nwhich are adopted by the legislature are proportional to\nthe object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law.\nProportionality            is    an    essential             facet    of       the    guarantee\nagainst arbitrary State action because it ensures that the\nnature and quality of the encroachment on the right is not\ndisproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence, the\nthreefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the\nmutual interdependence between the fundamental guarantees\nagainst arbitrariness on the one hand and the protection of\nlife    and    personal          liberty,        on     the     other.         The    right       to\nprivacy, which is an intrinsic part of the right to life\nand    liberty,       and       the    freedoms         embodied          in       Part    III    is\nsubject       to     the    same       restraints             which       apply       to     those\nfreedoms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\"> W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                          -:65:-</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">41.

The right to be forgotten can be\n\nclaimed to erase past records. The learned counsel\n\nfor    one     of    the     petitioners,                 Shri   Johnson      Gomez\n\nargued that the implication of this is that a bail\n\norder      pertaining         to      a     client         in    the   year   2013\n\nalone      appears         in        the       public       domain      and     his\n\nsubsequent          acquittal         from          all    charges      finds    no\n\nplace in the digital domain.

As    adverted          to    earlier,           the       right     to    be\n\nforgotten can be claimed as a right to erase past\n\nmemory.

The internet\n\nhas     unlimited         capacity          to    remember.       The    Court\n\ncannot generally balance the interest claimed by\n\nthe individuals and the information available in\n\nthe    digital         domain        for    eternity.       The   Court,      no\n\ndoubt,      would       be    able     to       form   an   opinion      after\n\nadverting         to    the     attending          circumstances         of    a\n\nparticular case to order the removal of personal\n\ndata or erasure of such data from digital space\n\nafter      considering          the        factors     relating     to    such\n\ncases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">51.

The      information         in        the\n\ndigital space would remain there forever unless it\n\nis    erased        using      technological            tools.       The     data\n\navailable on the internet for eternity is a direct\n\naffront to the right to be forgotten.                                Google is\n\none    of     the     providers         of      search    engine.          It   is\n\npopularly known as Google search. It is reported\n\nthat more than 3.5 billion searches per day are\n\nhandled by the search engine. It is claimed by\n\nGoogle      that      they      continuously            map    the    web       and\n\nother sources to connect users to provide the most\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                       -:97:-</span>\n\n\nrelevant and helpful information.

The      learned           Senior          Counsel     Shri    Sajan\n\nPoovayya        argued       in      extenso         and     submitted   that\n\nGoogle neither discharges a public function nor is\n\nunder        the       State         authority.            Therefore,        no\n\ndirections are warranted against them.                            A detailed\n\nargument has been raised by the counsel stating\n\nthat Google LLC., a company incorporated in the US\n\nis not a publisher and only an intermediary. The\n\nlearned        counsel         relied           on     various     judgments\n\narising       from      domestic         Courts        and     international\n\nCourts.         Pointing out to the judgment in Google\n\nLLC. v. Defteros [(2022) HCA 27] of the Australian\n\nHigh Court, the counsel submitted that the act of\n\nproviding hyperlinks in a search or re-search does\n\nnot     amount       to    publication.                Therefore,       it   is\n\nsubmitted         that      the      Google          search    engine    only\n\nenables the parties to access information that is\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                      -:98:-</span>\n\n\nalready        available         in     the         public      domain.     The\n\nlearned counsel further argued that the relevant\n\nprovisions of Information Technology (Intermediary\n\nGuidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules,\n\n2021 (hereafter Intermediary Rules) categorically\n\nrecognizes         and     exempts         transient        and    incidental\n\nstorage from the ambit of publishing or hosting.\n\nIt is submitted that it is the publisher that is\n\nresponsible          for      the      content         it      creates     and,\n\ntherefore,         the     direction           is    to   be      passed   only\n\nagainst       the     publishers           and      not     against      Google\n\nsearch. His argument was that intermediaries are\n\nnot responsible for the unlawful actions of third\n\nparties. The learned Counsel also raised arguments\n\non the right to privacy claimed by the petitioner\n\nand submitted that the right to privacy is not an\n\nabsolute        right       but       is       subject       to    reasonable\n\nrestrictions. He also submitted that the right to\n\nknow is an indivisible facet of the Constitution.\n\nThe right to privacy claimed cannot result in the\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                      -:99:-</span>\n\n\neffacement of public records. The learned counsel\n\nrelied on the judgment of the Apex Court in Shreya\n\nSinghal v. Union of India [(2013) 12 SCC 73] and\n\nsubmitted          that      intermediaries           are     not    in     a\n\nposition to determine the legitimacy or veracity\n\nof any claims for removal in the absence of Court\n\norder       directing          intermediaries           to    take       such\n\naction.        The learned Counsel appearing for Google\n\nIndia submitted that they are neither necessary\n\nnor a proper party in the proceedings as they are\n\nnot     operating          the       search    engine        online.      The\n\nlearned Central Government Counsel relying on                             the\n\nIntermediary          Rules      submitted       that    Google      is    an\n\nintermediary           and     they     are    also     bound       by    the\n\nIntermediary Rules. He referred to various rules\n\nand the nature of content in the search engine and\n\nsubmitted          that      Google      would    come        within      the\n\nmeaning       of    an     intermediary,         as   defined       in    the\n\nRules. The learned Government Pleader, Shri Kannan\n\nsubmitted that the High Court is a Court of record\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                       -:100:-</span>\n\n\nand    publication           of      judgments          online    would        only\n\nserve the public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">63. We are not called upon here to determine the\n\nresponsibility               or      liability           of      Google         for\n\npublishing          judgments          online           in    terms       of     the\n\nIntermediary            Rules.         The       publication              of     the\n\njudgments online and allowing the same to remain\n\nonline forever may infringe upon the right of a\n\nparty based on the right to be forgotten.                                 We have\n\nalready adverted to the nature of a right that can\n\nbe claimed as a right to be forgotten. If the\n\njudgments         of    the       Court      are    allowed          to    remain\n\nonline for eternity, certainly, it would invade\n\nsuch rights of the parties. The problem that has\n\narisen        in       the        absence          of        legislation          is\n\ndetermining            the    period        or     circumstances               under\n\nwhich a party can invoke the aforesaid right. We\n\nare     not     remaining            oblivious          to    this    fact.       A\n\nlitigant may in the future, approach this Court to\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                     -:101:-</span>\n\n\nremove          online       content.          In    the     absence      of\n\nlegislation, the Court may have to recognise his\n\nright and direct removal of such content available\n\nonline on a case-to-case basis. The contention by\n\nthe learned counsel for Google that they are only\n\nan intermediary and they are not liable for the\n\ncontents         or    publication             of   the    judgments,     no\n\ndoubt, the said contention has to be upheld. We\n\nare not here to decide upon compliance or non-\n\ncompliance            with     the     Intermediary          Rules.      The\n\nargument of the learned Central Government Counsel\n\nthat Google has to be treated as an intermediary\n\nand therefore has to follow the Intermediary Rules\n\ndoes      not     require        meritorious          consideration       in\n\nthese cases. We are called upon, in these cases,\n\nto decide on the points involved qua fundamental\n\nrights claimed by the petitioners. Irrespective of\n\nthese rules, the State and non-State actors are\n\nbound      to    respect       the   fundamental           rights   of   the\n\ncitizens. There is no difficulty in identifying\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                       -:102:-</span>\n\n\nGoogle        as    a    non-State        actor       by    its      nature    of\n\nfunction and operation which could have an impact\n\non    the     socio,       cultural,         economic          and    political\n\nlife     of    the       citizen.      They       are      qualified     to    be\n\nidentified as a non-State actor. Even in the OECD\n\nGuidelines for Multi-national Enterprises, guiding\n\nprinciples          on     business          and      human       rights,      an\n\nenterprise like Google is liable as a non State\n\nactor       for      human      rights           violation.          Google    is\n\nincorporated in the United States of America and\n\nOECD is an intergovernmental organisation of which\n\nUS is also a party. The Guidelines aim to promote\n\npositive contributions by enterprises to economic,\n\nenvironmental and social progress worldwide.                                  [See\n\nOECD     Guidelines          for      Multi-national            Enterprises,\n\n2011 Edition]. Further, there is no difficulty in\n\nholding that the claim based on fundamental rights\n\ncan      be        enforced          horizontally.             However,        the\n\njudgments          are    public       records          and,    making        them\n\navailable          to     the    public          to   view      through       the\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                         -:103:-</span>\n\n\nprocess of a search made online, cannot be found\n\nfault with. At the same time, we cannot hold that\n\nGoogle is content blind to the publications made\n\nonline; can they allow any prohibited nature of\n\ncontent to appear online? For example, paedophilic\n\ncontent.         An algorithm means a set of procedures\n\nused      for     solving            a    problem         or       performing     a\n\ncomputation.             In          the           era        of       artificial\n\nintelligence, it is quite possible for Google to\n\nidentify the nature of the content and remove the\n\nsame.       Google is not a mere passive conduit. They\n\nare now using AI tools to identify the needs and\n\nrequirements of a user online and attempting to\n\nbring      out     the     best          results         in     what   they     are\n\nlooking for online. Keeping aside the Intermediary\n\nRules etc., we are of the firm view that Google\n\ncannot       claim       itself           as       a     mere      intermediary,\n\nallowing the contents to appear for the viewers or\n\nusers in the digital platform. The publication of\n\nany valid records is protected by the Constitution\n W.P.(C).Nos.26500/2020 &amp; con.cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                     -:104:-</span>\n\n\nas forming part of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, the right to\n\nfreedom of speech and expression.                              There is no\n\ndifficulty           for       Google          during        the     era       of\n\nadvancement of AI to create a tool and identify\n\nparticular data and remove the same.                               If that is\n\nnot done, it would really infringe the claim based\n\non the right to be forgotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">64.

It     is    for      the\n\nLegislature to fix grounds for the invocation of\n\nsuch a right.
