Their marriage was solemnized on 09.07.1995 at Trichy.  Heartburns arose between them, broke their nuptial life.  On 06.05.1997, a female child was born and named as Vyshali.  The love lost between them, culminated in filing of F.C.O.P.No.1981 of 2005 by the respondent on the file of the Principal Family Court, Chennai, for dissolution of marriage.  A male child was born on 28.08.2004 and this respondent disclaims paternity of the child.  The petitioner filed her counter.  Matter came up for enquiry and presently, it is in part-heard stage.  The respondent filed I.A.No.2246 of 2007 under <a href=\"/doc/508449/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 10</a> of the Family Court Act, 1984 r/w. <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">Order 26 Rule 10A CPC</a>., praying the Court to pass appropriate orders for DNA test to be conducted on the male child born on 28.08.2004.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">\t2.\tIn the affidavit, the respondent has stated that after few years of marriage life, the petitioner used to demand money for promoting her father&#x27;s business and that petitioner&#x27;s father also instigated her to make such demand.  He borrowed nearly Rs.4 lakhs and gave it to the petitioner&#x27;s father to set right his financial crisis and even afterwards, they instigated and compelled him to organise finance, for which, he expressed his inability and hence, the petitioner started quarreling with him everyday and the same became routine affair and in time course, they stopped falling with each other and they were sleeping in separate rooms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\t2(ii).\tThe respondent has further stated that there was no physical relationship between both the parties from the month of May&#x27; 2003 onwards and even thereafter, no cohabitation had taken place between them; that at the time when his mother was seriously ill, he had gone to Salem often to look after his mother and spent considerable time for providing medication, however, she died in the month of March 2004; that by the end of the year 2003, due to constant problems and misunderstandings in the matter of money, the petitioner left the matrimonial home, went to her parents&#x27; house and stayed with her parents for nearly about three months and returned back at the end of the third month; and that she pleaded and requested that she would mend her ways and in view of the daughter&#x27;s welfare, he accepted her request and within three days, she told him that she was pregnant, which was a great shock to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\t2(iii).\tIn the affidavit, it is further stated that the respondent was having no physical intimacy with the petitioner from the month of May&#x27; 2003 onwards till that date.  While so, she delivered a male child on 28.08.2004 and that the same is illegitimate child which was born through some other person.  Therefore, he filed a petition for custody of his daughter, Vaishali in O.P.No.2111 of 2005 on the file of the Principal Family Court, Chennai on the ground that the petitioner was leading an adulterous life, and therefore, it has become essential to establish the paternity of the male child, since the same is the subject matter of both the petitions filed by this respondent and if the DNA test is not ordered, he will be put to irreparable loss and mental agony and hence, DNA test may be directed to be conducted on the male child born on 28.08.2004 and the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\t3.\tIn the counter filed by the petitioner, inter alia it is alleged that the petition under the provisions mentioned therein is neither maintainable in law nor facts; that allegations are per se defamatory and were invented by the respondent to cover up his mis-deeds and adultery; that the respondent had caused untold cruelty and mental agony to her two children and herself; that the respondent is not living in adulterous life; that the respondent was having illicit intimacy with one Uma Maheswari, wife of Krishnan and leading an immoral life with her; that she also came to know that he is having illicit intimacy with various women; that scrutiny of the oral evidence adduced by the respondent before the trial Court would show that he had illegal connection with the said Uma Maheswari; and that said Uma Maheswari&#x27;s husband filed O.P.NO.133 of 2004 before the Sub Court, Vellore, arraying the respondent as second respondent and divorce was granted in favour of the said Uma Maheswari.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t3(ii).\tThe petitioner has further stated that the respondent&#x27;s father is running a clinic, by name, Sathosh Infertility Centre at Salem; that she was taken to the said Clinic and artificial insemination was performed by the respondent; that both of them lived separately upto 16.09.2005 and in the notice (Ex.P4) only, he has stated that the second child was not born to him; that conducting DNA test on the male child is not warranted; and that by abusing his financial position, he created medical records under the head DNA ID Check Test Results and filed Xerox copy before the Court, while filing the Original Petition.  The respondent lived with two children and herself till the first birthday of the second child, i.e., 28.08.2005 and celebrated the birthday with full pleasure and joy.  If anything wrong was done to her, during the course of artificial insemination, the respondent and his family members were solely responsible for the illegal acts.  Subjecting a tender year child, aged three years, for DNA test is inhuman and it would show the respondent&#x27;s sadist approach to continue his lust with the said Uma Maheswari.  Hence, she prayed that the petition may be dismissed, as it is frivolous and vexatious.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t4.\tLearned Principal Judge, Family Court, Chennai, allowed the application, ordering DNA test and directing the respondent to bear the expenses for such examination.  It was observed that it has become necessary to order for DNA test and taking the blood sample for the test is not against law.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\t5.\tLearned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, Mr.S.Parthasarathy, would contend in vehemence that under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Court should presume the birth of a child, during the wedlock, as legitimate one; that such presumption has to be rebutted only by means of adducing any evidence with convincing materials and it is not open to the respondent to pray the Court to direct for DNA test; that no individual could be compelled to give blood samples even for medical examination and it is incumbent upon him to prove, &quot;non-access&quot;; that it is the fishing expectation; that in the course of artificial insemination conducted on the petitioner, there might have been a foul play on the part of the respondent and that the settled positions have put a legal embargo on the Courts to order DNA test in a routine manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">\t6.\tArguing on the other side of the coin, Mr.A.Natarajan, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, would contend that there was no necessity for having  artificial insemination as pleaded by the petitioner and that portion is not supported with any materials; that while there has been no problems as to reputation of both the parties, that is to say, there is no defect in both of them, no necessity would have arisen for artificial insemination; that there is no question of inference under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act; that the father of the respondent is running a Sidha Clinic in Salem, but he is not a Doctor and there is no system nor procedure is available in Sidha medicine for artificial insemination and that legal principles are in favour of a person, who seeks for DNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\t7.\tBoth the parties would consistently placing their respective contentions as to access and non-access respectively, for which, Matrimonial Court has to exercise its wisdom to come out with clear findings, after appreciation of the oral and documentary piece of evidence on record.  It is not for this Court to enter into that arena and find out whether there was access between the parties during relevant period of time.  Bounden duty casts upon the Court to follow the legal principles and ratio laid down by the Supreme Court on this subject and to appropriately direct the parties to perform their legal obligation.  It is the primary duty of the Court to see that the truth is unfolded.  Prime concern of the Court is to see whether directing an individual to undergo DNA test is lawful and it would affect his right of privacy and the right of personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is violated. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">\t8.\tTo begin with, it is profitable to extract <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act for better understanding of the matter in issue.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t&quot;112.

This presumption can be displaced only by strong preponderance of evidence and not by a mere balance of probabilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_2\">10.\tLearned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, in support of his contention, garnered support from the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_8\">Goutam Kundu v.

In matters of this kind the court must have regard to <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. This section is based on the well-known maxim pater is est quem nuptial demonstrate (he is the father whom the marriage indicates). The presumption of legitimacy is this, that a child born of a married women is deemed to be legitimate, it throws on the person who is interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole burden of proving it. The law presumes both that a marriage ceremony is valid, and that every person is legitimate. Marriage of filiation (parentage) may be presumed, the law in general presuming against vice and immorality.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"736558\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505918\" id=\"span_6\">13.\tThe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_15\">Banarsi Dass</a>&#x27;s case, has also referred to a decision reported in 2003 (<a href=\"/doc/736558/\" id=\"a_16\">10) SCC 228 [Amarjit Kaur v.
