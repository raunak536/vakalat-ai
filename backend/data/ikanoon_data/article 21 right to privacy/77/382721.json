Infringement of &#x27;Suspended Right to marry&#x27; cannot be\nlegally compensated by damages either in Torts or common law, is our answer\nto the problem raised in this appeal which is based on the peculiar facts\nof its own. the appellant; after obtaining the Degree of MBBS in 1987 from\nJawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research.\nChandigarh, completed his internship and junior residence at the same\ncollege. In June, 1990 he joined the Nagaland State Medical and Health\nService as Assistant Surgeon Grade-I.\n\nThereafter, the appellant joined the MD Pharmacology Course though he\ncontinued in the Nagaland State Service on .the condition that he would\nresume his duties after completing the MD Course. In September, 1991 the\nappellant joined the further Course of Diploma in Opthamalogy which\ncompleted in April, 1993, In August, 1993 he resumed his duties in the\nNagaland State Health Service as Assistant Surgeon Grade-I.\n\nOne Itokhu Yepthomi who was ailing from a disease which was provisionally\ndiagnosed as Aortic Anuerisrn was advised to go to the &#x27;Z&#x27; Hospital at\nMadras and the appellant was directed by the Government of Nagaland to\naccompany the said patient to Madras for treatment. For the treatment of\nthe above disease, Itokhu Yepthomi was posted for surgery on May 31, 1995\nwhich, however, was cancelled due to shortage of blood. On June 1, 1995 the\nappellant and one Yehozhe who was the driver of Itokhu Yepthomi were asked\nto donate blood for the latter. Their blood samples Were taken and the\nresult showed that the appellant&#x27;s blood group was A(+ve). On the next\ndate, namely, on June 2, 1995, Itokhu Yepthomi was operated for Aortic\nAnuerism and remained in the Hospital till 10th June, 1995 when he was\ndischarged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">In August, 1995 the appellant proposed marriage to one Ms, &#x27;Y&#x27; which was\naccepted and the marriage was proposed to be held on December 12, 1995. But\nthe marriage was called off on the ground of blood test conducted at the\nrespondent&#x27;s hospital in which the appellant was found to be HIV(+). The\nappellant went again to the respondent&#x27;s hospital at Madras where several\ntests were conducted and he was found to be HIV (+), Since the marriage had\nbeen settled but was subsequently called off, several people including\nmembers of the appellant&#x27;s family and persons belonging to his community\nbecame aware of the appellant&#x27;s HlV(+) status: This resulted in severe\ncriticism of the appellant and he was, ostracized by the community. The\nappellant left Kohima (Nagaland) around November 26, 1995 and started\nworking and residing at Madras.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">The appellant then approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\nCommission for damages against the respondent, on the ground that the\ninformation which was required to be kept secret under Medical ethics was\ndisclosed illegally and, therefore, the respondent was liable to pay\ndamages. The Commission dismissed the Petition as also the application for\ninterim relief summarily by order dated 3rd July, 1998 on the ground that\nthe appellant may seek his remedy in the. civil Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently contended that the\nprinciple of&quot; &quot;duty of care&quot; as applicable to persons in medical\nprofession. includes the duty to maintain confidentiality and since this\nduty was violated by the respondents, they are liable in damages to the\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">Duty to maintain confidentiality has its origin in the Hippocratic Oath,\nwhich is an ethical code attributed to the ancient Greek physician\nHippocrates, adopted as a guide to conduct by the medical profession\nthroughout the ages and still used in the graduation ceremonies of many\nmedical schools and colleges: Hippocrates lived and practised as a\nPhysician between third and first Century B.C. He has been referred to by\nPlato as a famous Ascleplad who had philosophical approach to medicine. His\nmanuscripts, the Hippocratic Collection (Corpus Hippocracticum), contained\nthe Hippocractie Oath which is reproduced below :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;I swear by Apollo the physician and Aesculapius and health and all-heal\nand all the gods and goddesses that according to my ability arid judgment I\nwill keep this path and this stipulation - to reckon him who taught me this\nart equally dear to me as my parents, to Share my substance with and\nrelieve his necessities if required, to look upon his offspring in the same\nfooting as my own brothers and to teach them this art if they shall wish to\nlearn it without fee or stipulation and that by precept, lecture, and every\nother mode of instruction I will impart a knowledge of the art to my own\nsons and those of my teachers and to disciples bound by a stipulation and\noath according to the law of medicine but to none others. 1 will follow\nthat system of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment, I\nconsider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is\ndeleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to any one if\nasked nor suggest any such counsel, and in like manner I will not give to a\nwoman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and with holiness I will\npass my life and practice my art, I will not cut persons laboring under the\nstone but will leave this to be done by men who are practitioners of this\nwork, Into whatever houses I enter, I will go into them for the benefit of\nthe sick and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and\ncorruption, and further, from the seduction of females or males, of freeman\nand slaves, whatever in connection with rny professional practice, or not\nin connection with it, I see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not\nto be spoken of abroad, I will not divulge as reckoning that all such\nshould be kept secret. While I continue to keep this oath unviolated, may\nit be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected by\nall men, in all times, but should I trespass and violate this oath, may the\nreverse be my lot.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">The Hippocractic Oath consists of two parts. The first, or covenant; is the\nsolemn agreement concerning the relationship of apprentice to&quot; teacher and\nthe obligations enjoined on the pupil. The second part constitutes the\nethical code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">It is on the basis of the above that International Code of Medical Ethics\nhas laid down as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;A physician shall preserve absolute confidentiality on all he knows about\nhis patient even after his patient has died.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">Here, in this country, there is the <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, which\ncontrols the medical education and regulates the professional conduct.\nSection 20A which was inserted by the <a href=\"/doc/1109820/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Medical Council (Amendment)\nAct</a> 1964 provides as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;Professional Conduct :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(1) The Council may prescribe the standards of professional con-duct and\netiquette and a code of ethics for medical practitioners,\n\n(2)  Regulations made by the Council under sub-section (1) may specify\nwhich violations thereof shall constitute infamous conduct in any\nprofessional respect, that it is to say, professional misconduct, and such\nprovision shall have effect notwithstanding anything Contained in any law\nfor the time being in&#x27; force.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">At the same time, that is, by the same <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_3\">Amending Act</a>; clause (m) was also\nintroduced in <a href=\"/doc/101411070/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 33</a> and this clause provides as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;33. Power to make regulations -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The Council may, with the previous sanction of the Central Government, make\nregulations generally to carry out the purposes of this Act, and, without\nprejudice to the generality of this power, such regulations may provide for\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(a) xxx                     xxx                          xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(m) the standards of professional conduct and etiquette and code of ethics\nto be observed by medical practitioners,&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">It is under these provisions that the Code of Medical Ethics has been made\nby the Indian Medical Council which, inter alia, provides as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;Do not disclose the secrets of a patient that have been learnt in the\nexercise of your profession. Those may be disclosed only in a Court of Law\nunder orders of the presiding judge,&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">It is true that in the doctor-patient relationship, the most important\naspect is the doctor&#x27;s duty of maintaining secrecy. A doctor cannot\ndisclose to a person any information regarding his patient which he has\ngathered in the course of treatment nor can the doctor disclose to anyone\nelse the mode of treatment or the advice given by him to the patient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">It is contended that the doctor&#x27;s duty to maintain secrecy has a corelative\nright vested in the patient that whatever has come to the knowledge of the\nDoctor would not be divulged and it is this right which is being enforced\nthrough these proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">It is the basic principle of Jurisprudence that every Right has a co-\nrelative Duty and every Duty has a co-relative Right. But the rule is not\nabsolute. It is subject to certain exceptions in the sense that a person\nmay have a Right but there may not be co- relative Duty. The instant case,\nas we shall presently see, falls within the exceptions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">&#x27;RIGHT is an interest recognised arid protected by moral or legal rules. It\nis an interest the violation of which would be a legal wrong. Respect for\nsuch interest would be a legal duty. That is how Salmond has defined the\n&quot;Right&quot;. In order, therefore, that an interest becomes the subject of a\nlegal right, it has to have not merely legal protection but also legal\nrecognition, the elements of a &quot;LEGAL RIGHT&quot; are that the &#x27;right&#x27; is vested\nin a person and is available against a person who is under a corresponding\nobligation and duty to respect that right and has to act or forbear from\nacting in a manner so as to prevent the violation of the right, If,\ntherefore, there is &amp; legal right vested in a .person, the latter can seek\nits protection against a person who is bound by a corresponding duty not to\nviolate that right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">Hippocratic Oath as such is not enforceable in a court of law as it has no\nstatutory force. Medical information about a person is protected by the\nCode of Professional Conduct made by the Medical Council of India under\n<a href=\"/doc/190423852/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 33(m)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 20A</a> of the Act. The relevant provisions of\nthe Code of Medical Ethics have already been reproduced above which contain\nan exception to the general rule of confidentiality, inasmuch as it\nprovides that the information may be disclosed in a court of law under the\norders of the Presiding Judge. This is also the law in England where it is\nprovided that the exceptions; to this rule permit: disclosure with the\nconsent, or in the best interests, of the patient, in compliance with a\ncourt order or other legally enforceable duty and, in very limited\ncircumstances, where the public interest so requires. Circumstances in\nwhich the public interest would override the duty of confidentiality could,\nfor example, be the investigation and prosecution of serious crime or where\nthere is an immediate or future (but not a past and remote) health risk to\nothers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">The General Medical Council of Great Britain in its guidance on HIV\ninfection and AIDS has provided as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;When diagnosis has been made by a specialist and the patient after\nappropriate counselling, still refuses permission for the General\nPractitioner to be informed of the result, that request for privacy should\nbe respected. The only exception would be when failure to disclose would\nput the health of the health- care team at serious risk. All people\nreceiving such information much consider themselves to be under the same\nobligations of confidentiality as the doctor principally responsible for\nthe patient&#x27;s care. Occasionally the doctor may wish to disclose a\ndiagnosis to a third party other than a health-care professional. The\nCouncil think that the only grounds for this are when there is a serious\nand identifiable, risk to a specific person. who, if not so informed would\nbe exposed to infection..,.. A doctor may consider it a duty to ensure that\nany sexual partner is informed regardless of the patient&#x27;s own wishes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(Emphasis supplied).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">Thus, the Code of Medical Ethics also carves out an exception to the rule\nof confidentiality and permits the disclosure. in the circumstances\nenumerated above under which public interest, would override. the duty of\nconfidentiality, particularly where there, is an immediate or future health\nrisk to others,\n\nThe argument .of the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, that the\nrespondents were under a duty to, maintain confidentiality on account, of\nthe Code of Medical Ethics. formulated by the Indian Medical Council cannot\nbe accepted as the proposed rnarriage carried with it the health risk to an\nidentifiable person who had to be protected from being infected with the\ncommunicable disease from which the appellant suffered, The right to\nconfidentiality, if any. vested in the appellant was not enforceable in the\npresent situation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">Learned counsel for the appellant then contended that the appellant&#x27;s right\nof privacy has been infringed by the respondents by disclosing  the\nappellant was HIV(+) and, therefore, they are liable in damages. Let us\nexamine this contention..\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_1\">Right to privacy has been culled out of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> arid\nother provisions of the Constitution relating to Fundamental Rights read\nwith Directive Principles of State Policy. It was in this context that it\nwas held by this Court in Kharuk Singh v..

If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy of\nthe person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages.

Henry Wade, 410 US 113, the Supreme\nCourt of United States said that : &quot;Although the Constitution of the U.S.A.\ndoes not explicitly men-tion any right of privacy, the United States\nSupreme Court recognizes that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee\nof certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution,\nand that the roots of that right may be found in the First Amendment, in\nthe Fourth and Fifth Amendments, in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, in\nthe Ninth Amendment, and in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first\nsection of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the &quot;right to privacy is not\nabsolute.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">Reference may, at this stage, be made to <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 8</a> of the European\nConvention on Human Right which defines this right us follows,:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;(1) Every one has the. right to respect for his private and family life,\nhis home and his correspondence. (2) There shall be no interference by a\npublic authority With the exercise of this right except such as is in\naccordance with the law and is necessary in democratic society in the\ninterests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of\nthe country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of\nhealth or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of\nothers.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">(Emphasis supplied).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">As one of the basic Human Rights, the right of privacy is not treated as\nabsolute and is subject to such action as may be lawfully taken for the\nprevention of Crime or disorder or protection of health or morals or\nprotection of rights and freedoms of others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">Right of Privacy may, apart from contract, also arise out of a particular\nspecific relationship which may be commercial, matrimonial, or even\npolitical. As already discussed above, Doctor-patient relationship, though\nbasically commercial, is, professionally, a matter of confidence: and,\nthere-fore, Doctors are morally and ethically bound to maintain\nconfidentiality. In such a situation, public disclosure of even true\nprivate facts may amount to an invasion of the Right of Privacy which may\nsometimes lead to the clash of one person&#x27;s &quot;right to be let alone&quot; with\nanother person&#x27;s right to be informed. Disclosure of even true private\nfacts has the tenancy to disturb a person&#x27;s tranquility. It may generate\nmany complexes in him and may even lead to psychological problems. He may,\nthereafter, have a disturbed life all through. In the face of these\npotentialities and as already held by this Court in its various decisions\nreferred to above, the Right of Privacy is an essential component of right\nto life envisaged by Article .21, The &#x27;right, however, is not absolute and\nmay be lawfully restricted for the prevention of crime, disorder or\nprotection of health or morals or protection of rights and freedom of\nothers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">Having regard to the fact that the appellant was found to be HIV(+); its\ndisclosure would not be violative of either the rule of confidentiality or\nthe appellant&#x27;s Right of Privacy as Ms. &#x27;Y&#x27; with whom the appellant was\nlikely to be married was saved in time by such disclosure, or else, she too\nwould have been infected with the dreadful disease if marriage had taken\nplace and consummated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">We may now examine the right based on confidentiality in the context of\nmarriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">Marriage is the sacred union, legally permissible, of two healthy bodies of\nopposite sexes. It has to be mental, psychological and physical Union. When\ntwo souls thus unite, a new soul comes into existence. That is how, the\nlife goes on and on on this planet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">Mental and physical health is-of prime importance in a marriage, as one of\nthe objects of the marriage is the procreation of equally healthy children.\nThat is why, in every system of matrimonial law, it has been provided that\nif a person was found to be suffering from any, including venereal disease,\nin a communicable form, it will be open to the other partner in the\nmarriage to seek divorce. Reference, for instance, may be made to <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n13(i)(v)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 which provides as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">&quot;13(1) Any marriage solemnized, whether before or after the commencement of\nthis Act, may, on a petition presented by either the husband or the wife,\nbe dissolved by a decree of divorce on the ground that the other party\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(i) xxx                     xxx                            xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(v)   HAS BEEN SUFFERING FROM VENEREAL DISEASE IN A COMMUNICABLE FORM.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">So also <a href=\"/doc/209038/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 2</a> of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 sets but\nthat if the husband is suffering: from a virulent venereal disease, a Woman\nmarriage under Muslim Law to such person shall be entitled to obtain a\ndecree for dissolution of her marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\"><a href=\"/doc/122564/\" id=\"a_19\">Under the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936</a>, one of the grounds for\ndivorce set Out in <a href=\"/doc/190896350/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 32</a> is that the defendant has, since the\nmarriage, infected the plaintiff with venereal disease.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\"><a href=\"/doc/806295/\" id=\"a_21\">Under the Indian Divorce Act, 1869</a>, the grounds for dissolution of a\nmarriage have been set out in <a href=\"/doc/2723293/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 10</a> which provides that a wife may\npetition for dissolution if her husband was guilty of incestuous adultery,\nbigamy with adultery or of rape, sodomy or bestiality,\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/695509/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 27</a> of the Special Marriage Act, the party to a marriage has\nbeen given the right to obtain divorce if the other party to whom he or she\nwas married was suffering front venereal disease in a communicable form.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">The emphasis, therefore, in practically all systems of marriage is on a\nhealthy body with moral ethics. Once the law provides the &quot;venereal\ndisease&quot; as a ground for divorce to either husband or wife, such a person\nwho was suffering from that disease, even prior to the marriage cannot be\nsaid to have any right to marry so long as he is not fully cured of the\ndisease. If the disease, with which he was suffering, would constitute a\nvalid ground for divorce, was concealed by him and he entered into marital\nties with a woman who did not know that the person with whom she was being\nmarried was suffering from a virulent venereal disease, that person must be\ninjuncted from entering into marital ties so as to prevent him from\nspoiling the health and, consequently, the life of an innocent woman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">The contention of the learned counsel that every young man or, for that\nmatter, a woman, has a right to marry cannot be accepted in the absolute\nterms in Which it is being contended. Having regard to the age and the\nbiological needs, a person may have a right to marry but this right is not\nwithout a duty, If that person is suffering from any communicable Venereal\ndisease or is impotent so that marriage would be a complete failure or that\nhis wife would seek divorce from him on that ground, that person is under a\nmoral, as also legal duty, to inform the woman with whom the marriage is\nproposed that he was not physically healthy and that he was suffering from\na disease which was likely to be communicated to her. In this situation,\nthe right to marry and duty to inform about his ailment are vested in the\nsame person. It is a right in respect of which a corresponding duty cannot\nbe claimed as against some other person. Such a right, for these reasons\nalso, would be an exception to the general rule that every &quot;RIGHT&quot; has a\ncorelative &quot;Duty&quot;. Moreover, so long as the person is not Cured of the\ncommunicable venereal disease or impotency, the RIGHT to marry cannot be\nenforced through a court of law and shall be treated to be a &quot;SUSPENDED\nRIGHT&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">There is yet another aspect of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\"><a href=\"/doc/734195/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 269</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164731/\" id=\"a_25\">270</a> of the Indian Penal Code provide as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;269. Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">- Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he\nknows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any\ndisease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription or a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with\nboth.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">270. Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">- Whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has\nreason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease\ndangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with\nboth.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">These two Sections spell out two separate and distinct offences by\nproviding that if a person, negligently or unlawfully, does an act which he\nknew was likely to spread the infection of a disease, dangerous to life,\n:to another person, then the former would be guilty of an offence,\npunishable with imprisonment for the term indicated therein. Therefore, if\na person suffering from the dreadful disease &quot;AIDS&quot;, knowingly marries a\nwoman and thereby transmits infection to that woman, he would be guilty of\noffences indicated in <a href=\"/doc/734195/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections 269</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1164731/\" id=\"a_27\">270</a> of the Indian Penal Code. The\nabove statutory provisions thus impose a duty upon the appellant not to\nmarry as the marriage would have the effect of spreading the infection of\nhis own disease, which obviously is dangerous to life, to the woman whom he\nmarries apart from being an offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">Can the appellant, in the face of these statutory provisions, contend that\nthe respondents, in this situation, should have maintained strict secrecy.\nWe are afraid, respondent&#x27;s silence would have made them participient\ncriminis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">Ms. &#x27;Y&#x27;, with whom the marriage of the appellant was settled, was saved in\ntime by the disclosure of the vital information that the appellant was\nHIV(+). The disease which is communicable would have been positively\ncommunicated to her immediately on the consummation of marriage. As a human\nbeing, Ms. &#x27;Y&#x27; must also enjoy, as she, obviously, is entitled to, all the\nHuman Rights available to any other human being. This is apart from, and,\nin addition to, the Fundamental Rights available to her under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a>,\nwhich, as we have seen, guarantees &quot;Right to Life&quot; to every citizen of this\ncountry. This right would positively include the right to be told that a\nperson, with whom she was proposed to be married, was the victim of a\ndeadly disease, which was sexually communicable. Since &quot;Right to Life&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">includes right to lead a healthy life so as to enjoy all faculties of the\nhuman body in their prime condition, the respondents, by their disclosure\nthat the appellant was HIV (+), cannot be said to have, in any way, either\nviolated the rule of confidentiality or the right of privacy. Moreover,\nwhere there is a clash of two Fundamental Rights, as in the instant case,\nnamely, the appellant&#x27;s right to privacy as part of right to life and Ms.\n&#x27;Y&#x27;s right to lead a healthy life which is her Fundamental Right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a>, the RIGHT which would advance the public morality or public\ninterest, would alone be enforced through the process of Court, for the\nreason that moral considerations cannot be kept at bay and the judges are\nnot expected to sit as mute structures of clay, in the Hall, known as Court\nRoom, but have to be sensitive, &quot;in the sense that they must keep their\nfingers firmly upon the pulse of the accepted morality of the day&quot; (See :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">Legal Duties : Allen)\n\n&quot;AIDS&quot; is the product of indisciplined sexual impulse. This impulse, being\nthe notorious human failing if not disciplined, cart afflict and overtake\nanyone how high soever or, for that matter, how low he may be in the social\nstrata. The patients suffering from the dreadful disease &quot;AIDS&#x27;1 deserve\nfull sympathy. They are entitled to all respects as human beings. Their\nsociety cannot, and should not be avoided, which otherwise, would have bad\npsychological impact upon them. They have to have their avocation-\nGovernment jobs or service cannot be denied to them as has been laid down\nin some American decisions. (See-.School Board of Nassau Country, Florida\nv. Airline, (1987) 107 S. Ct. 1123; Chalk v, USDC CD of Col., 9th Circuit\n(1988) 840 2 F. 2d 701; Shuttleworth v, Broward Cty., SDA Fla. (1986) 639\nF. Supp. 654; Raytheon v. Fair Employment and Housing Commission, Estate of\nChadbourne, (1989) 261 Cal. -Reporter 197. But, &quot;sex&quot; with them or\npossibility thereof has to be avoided as otherwise they would infect and\ncommunicate the dreadful disease to others. The Court cannot assist that\nperson to achieve that object.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">For the reasons stated above, the appeal is without merits and is,\nconsequently, dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n","numcites":21,"numcitedby":120,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":382721,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"right to marry","formInput":"right%20to%20marry"},{"value":"code of medical ethics","formInput":"code%20of%20medical%20ethics"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"medical ethics","formInput":"medical%20ethics"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"venereal disease","formInput":"venereal%20disease"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"personal right","formInput":"personal%20right"},{"value":"hiv","formInput":"hiv"},{"value":"\"right to privacy\"","formInput":"%22right%20to%20privacy%22"},{"value":"divorce  filter:  hiv","formInput":"divorce%20%20filter%3A%20%20hiv"},{"value":"confidentiality","formInput":"confidentiality"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"marriage act","formInput":"marriage%20act"},{"value":"spreading an infection","formInput":"spreading%20an%20infection"},{"value":"vested right ","formInput":"vested%20right%20"},{"value":"Treatment  filter:  Permission to go abroad","formInput":"Treatment%20%20filter%3A%20%20Permission%20to%20go%20abroad"},{"value":"moral ","formInput":"moral%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"indian-medical-law","formInput":"tag:indian-medical-law"},{"value":"divorce","formInput":"tag:divorce"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
