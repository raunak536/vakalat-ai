He submitted that though the entire mankind \n\n     is benefited by milk and milk products, some human beings want the \n      \n\n\n     Court   to   permit   the   cattle   to   be   slaughtered.     He   urged   that   the \n   \n\n\n\n     slaughter   is   rightly   prohibited   in   the   State   by   the   Amendment   Act.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_166\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1572027\" id=\"span_107\">Relying upon a decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1572027/\" id=\"a_351\">Javed v.

It is clear from the inclusion of the words &quot;right to \n\n     blink&quot; that this exposition of the right to privacy is more in the nature of \n\n     a literary exercise than a judicial finding.

They are concerned with the right of every person to have \n\n     access   to   food   in   order   to   nourish   his   body   and   sustain   his   life.

Since   it   has   been   demonstrated   that   the   right   to \n\n\n\n\n\n     privacy is not included in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_392\">Article 21</a>, the right to eat the food of one&#x27;s \n\n     choice as a part of the right to privacy can also not be read into the \n\n\n\n\n\n     fundamental   right   to   life   or   personal   liberty.   He   urged   that   the \n\n     observation is not central to the judgment which was concerned with \n\n     total ban on slaughter-houses.  It was in that context that the judgment \n\n     merely made a passing observation, more in the nature of an obiter, and \n\n     certainly not as ratio, that what one chooses to eat is one&#x27;s personal \n\n     affair and therefore, part of his right to privacy.

The   concept   of   tilling   the   land \n                       with mechanical tillers is applicable in case of large \n                       farms.     This   is   not   the   position   in   the   State.    An \n                       average small farmer can ready his farm with proper \n\n\n\n\n                                                             \n                       tilling in 2/3 days&#x27; time before the rains are expected. \n                       The   farmer   is   not   caught   unawares.     Further, \n                       mechanical   tilling   with   tractors   has   got   its   own \n                       disadvantage.  The mechanical tiller breaks the crust of \n\n\n\n\n                                               \n                       the   soil   up   to   the   depth   of   12   to   15   inches.     This \n                       exposes the crust of 12 to 15 inches to outside dryness \n                             \n                       and   the   humus   of   the   entire   crust   is   lost.     In   this \n                       situation,   unless   there   is   good   rain   or   irrigation   to \n                       make the crust of 12 to 15 inches wet, sowing cannot \n                            \n                       take    place.   On the  other  hand, ploughing with the \n                       conventional plough with the help of bullocks breaks \n                       the crust up to the depth of 5 to 6 inches only and the \n                       humus below this level is retained.   In this situation, \n      \n\n                       even a small amount of rain makes the crust wet and \n                       suitable   for   sowing.     I   say   that   the   Petitioners   have \n   \n\n\n\n                       given examples of unusual phenomena of rain this year \n                       in   Western   Maharashtra.     The   phenomena   being \n                       unusual cannot justify their contention. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">                       I   further   say   that   bullocks   also   are   used   for \n                       transportation   of   Agriculture   produce   through \n                       bullock cart which is much economical than using \n                       motor   vehicles   to   majority   of   poor   farmers. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">                       Besides,   ploughing   and   sowing,   bullocks   are   also \n\n\n\n\n\n                       used   for   carting,   hauling,   water   lifting,   grinding \n                       etc.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\">                                                                           (emphasis added)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_237\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"101278772\" id=\"span_171\">103.

It is contended that the shortage can be overcome \n   \n\n\n\n     only by increasing dung availability and that is possible only if the cattle \n\n     is saved.  It is contended that under the Indian Agriculture and Animal \n\n\n\n\n\n     Husbandry   Practices,   yielding   of   dung   by   cattle   enjoys   the   topmost \n\n     position amongst all the yields from cattle.   It is pointed out that the \n\n\n\n\n\n     dung fuel is extensively used for cooking purposes as well as for lining \n\n     the walls and floors of houses in villages.   It is contended that the dung \n\n     used for lining of the walls and floors acts as a disinfectant and also \n\n     performs a thermoregulatory function.

The Apex Court has held that the Court would begin with \n      \n\n\n     the presumption regarding reasonability of restrictions. The facts stated \n   \n\n\n\n     in the preamble and the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to \n\n     any legislation are evidence of the legislative judgment. They indicate \n\n\n\n\n\n     the   thought  process  of  the  elected  representatives  of   the   people  and \n\n     their   cognizance   of   the   prevalent   state   of   affairs,   impelling   them   to \n\n\n\n\n\n     enact   the   law.   These,   therefore,   constitute   important   factors   which \n\n     amongst others will be taken into consideration by the court in judging \n\n     the reasonableness of any restriction imposed on the fundamental rights \n\n     of the individuals.  Hence,it will be necessary to reproduce the Objects \n\n     and   Reasons   of   the   impugned   Amendment   Act.

It   does   not   mean   that \n                       directive   principles   are   less   important   than \n                            \n                       Fundamental rights or that they are not binding on the \n                       various   organs   of   the   State.   <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_566\">Article   37</a>   of   the \n                       Constitution   emphatically   states   that   directive \n                       principles   are   nevertheless   fundamental   in   the \n      \n\n                       governance of the country and it shall be the duty of \n                       the State to apply these principles in making laws.

In our view, \n      \n\n\n     apart   from   the   conclusions   recorded   by   the   Apex   Court   on   the \n   \n\n\n\n     usefulness of the progeny of cow even after it ceases to be a milch or  \n\n     draught animal, the State of Maharashtra has placed on record facts \n\n\n\n\n\n     and   data   to   support   what   is   stated   in   the   Statement   of   Objects   and \n\n     Reasons   of   the   Amendment   Act.     The   State   has   placed   on   record \n\n\n\n\n\n     material to support the stand that it is necessary to preserve cows, bulls \n\n     and bullocks and to prevent its slaughter in the State.  Considering the \n\n     legal and factual position and what we have discussed above, we find \n\n     that the stand of the State Government that prohibiting the slaughter of \n\n     cows, bulls and bullocks is in public interest will have to be accepted.   \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">    ::: Uploaded on - 06/05/2016                            ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2016 00:02:22 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_324\">      ash                                             137                 fleshmatter draft 5\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_325\">     132.

The \n\n     contention raised is that the slaughter of a bull or bullock is an essential \n\n\n\n\n\n     part of Muslim religion.  It is contended that a large number of Muslim \n\n     population is poor and they cannot afford to sacrifice one goat even on \n\n\n\n\n\n     the occasion of BakrI&#x27;d instead seven persons can afford to sacrifice one \n\n     cow or a progeny of cow.   Reliance is placed by the Petitioners on the \n\n     extracts of holy Quran and other material in support of their contention \n\n     that the sacrifice of a cow, bull or bullock is an essential part of the \n\n     Muslim religion.  It is contended that to commemorate the outstanding \n\n     act of sacrifice (Quarbani) by Prophet Abraham, people sacrifice a lamb, \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">    ::: Uploaded on - 06/05/2016                      ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2016 00:02:22 :::</span>\n      ash                                                   138                 fleshmatter draft 5\n\n     goat, ram, cow, bull, bullock or camel on Eid-ul-Adha.  It is contended \n\n     in Writ Petition No.9209 of 2015 that the animal sacrifice is compulsory \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    \n     according to Islamic Jurisprudence and it is obligatory for every mature \n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n     Muslim to sacrifice a cow, goat, lamb or a bull according to his financial \n\n     status to almighty God.     We must note here that the said issue is no \n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n     longer res integra.  In the case of Ashutosh Lahiri, a three Judge Bench \n\n     of the Apex Court observed that it is optional for a Muslim to sacrifice a \n\n\n\n\n                                             \n     goat for one person or a cow or a camel for seven persons.  The Apex \n                             \n     Court held that it is, therefore, not obligatory for a muslim to sacrifice a \n\n     cow or progeny of cow.   The Paragraphs 8 and 9 of <a href=\"/doc/101278772/\" id=\"a_595\">the said decision</a> \n                            \n     read thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">                       &quot;8. The aforesaid relevant provisions clearly indicate \n      \n\n                           the legislative intention that healthy cows which \n                           are   not   fit   to   be   slaughtered   cannot   be \n   \n\n\n\n                           slaughtered at all. That is the thrust of <a href=\"/doc/42270693/\" id=\"a_596\">Section 4</a> \n                           of   the   Act.

This is the very essence of the Act \n                           and it is necessary to subserve the purpose of the \n                           Act i.e. to increase the supply of milk and avoid \n                           the   wastage   of   animal   power   necessary   for \n                           improvement   of   agriculture.   Keeping   in   view \n\n\n\n\n\n                           these   essential   features   of   the   Act,   we   have   to \n                           construe <a href=\"/doc/111978170/\" id=\"a_598\">Section  12</a> which deals with  power  to \n                           grant exemption from the Act. As we have noted \n                           earlier   the   said   section   enables   the   State \n                           Government   by   general   or   special   order   and \n                           subject to such conditions as it may think fit to \n                           impose, to exempt from the operation of this Act \n                           slaughter   of   any   animal   for   any   religious, \n                           medicinal or research purpose. Now it becomes \n                           clear that when there is a total ban under the Act \n                           so far as slaughtering of healthy cows which are \n                           not fit to be slaughtered as per  <a href=\"/doc/42270693/\" id=\"a_599\">Section  4(1)</a> is \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">    ::: Uploaded on - 06/05/2016                            ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2016 00:02:22 :::</span>\n      ash                                                      139                 fleshmatter draft 5\n\n                              concerned, if that ban is to be lifted even for a \n                              day, it has to be shown that such lifting of ban is \n                              necessary for subserving any religious, medicinal \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \n                              or   research   purpose.

By a detailed finding recorded in this \n\n     judgment, we are accepting the contention that <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_663\">Section 9B</a> suffers from \n\n     the vice of unconstitutionality and, therefore, it is not necessary to test \n\n     the challenge to <a href=\"/doc/46556846/\" id=\"a_664\">Sections 5A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/40363680/\" id=\"a_665\">5B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_666\">5C</a> on the basis of the provisions of \n\n     the <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_667\">Section 9B</a>. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">    ::: Uploaded on - 06/05/2016                            ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2016 00:02:23 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_349\">      ash                                                   149                fleshmatter draft 5\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_350\">     144.              Another challenge to <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_668\">Section 5C</a> is on the ground that the \n\n     said provision is not an ancillary or incidental provision.   On a plain \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n     reading   of   <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_669\">Section   5C</a>,   we   disagree   with   the   said   submission.

As   the   provision   imposing   a   complete   ban   on  the \n\n     slaughter of cow, bull or bullock is constitutional, we do not see how \n\n\n\n\n                                             \n     the vice of unconstitutionality is attracted to the provision which seeks a \n                             \n     ban on a person consciously possessing the flesh of cow, bull or bullock \n\n     which is slaughtered inside the State.   The said provision ensures the \n                            \n     ban imposed by <a href=\"/doc/38929124/\" id=\"a_672\">Section 5</a> is properly implemented.

Firstly, the \n                            \n     possibility of a legal provision being misused is no ground to hold it \n\n     unconstitutional.   Secondly, in the subsequent part of the decision, we \n      \n\n\n     have held <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_695\">Section 9B</a> to be an unconstitutional.    Another argument is \n   \n\n\n\n     that if the possession contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_696\">Section 5C</a> is not construed as \n\n     &quot;conscious possession&quot;, a person who is found in possession of flesh of \n\n\n\n\n\n     cow, bull or bullock without the knowledge of the fact that the same is \n\n     the flesh of animals slaughtered in contravention of the <a href=\"/doc/38929124/\" id=\"a_697\">Section 5</a> will \n\n\n\n\n\n     be convicted for an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_698\">Section 5C</a>. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_359\">     149.

The \n                             \n     meaning of the word &quot;conscious&quot; is awareness of a fact.  It is a state of \n\n     mind which is deliberate.   <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_713\">Section 5C</a> makes possession of flesh as an \n                            \n     offence.

It takes in all the freedoms. In  Bolling  v. \n                       Sharpe  [   (1954)   347   US   497,   499]   ,   the   Supreme \n                       Court   of   America   observed   that   the   said   expression \n      \n\n\n                       was   not   confined   to   mere   freedom   from   bodily \n                       restraint and that liberty under law extended to the \n   \n\n\n\n                       full range of conduct which the individual was free to \n                       pursue, But this absolute right to liberty was regulated \n                       to protect other social interests by the State exercising \n                       its power such as police power, the power of eminent \n\n\n\n\n\n                       domain, the power of taxation etc. The proper exercise \n                       of the power which is called the due process of law is \n                       controlled by the Supreme Court of America. In India \n                       the   word   &quot;liberty&quot;   has   been   qualified   by   the   word \n                       &quot;personal&quot;, indicating thereby that it is confined only \n\n\n\n\n\n                       to the liberty of the person.

The \n                             \n                       expression   &quot;coercion&quot;   in   the   modern   age   cannot   be \n                       construed in a narrow sense. In an uncivilized society \n                       where there are no inhibitions, only physical restraints \n                       may detract from personal liberty, but as civilization \n                            \n                       advances   the   psychological   restraints   are   more \n                       effective   than   physical   ones.   The   scientific   methods \n                       used   to   condition   a   man&#x27;s   mind   are   in   a   real   sense \n                       physical   restraints,   for   they   engender   physical   fear \n      \n\n\n                       channelling   one&#x27;s   actions   through   anticipated   and \n                       expected grooves. So also the  creation of conditions \n   \n\n\n\n                       which   necessarily   engender   inhibitions   and   fear \n                       complexes   can   be   described   as   physical   restraints. \n                       Further, the right to personal liberty takes in not only \n                       a   right   to   be   free   from   restrictions   placed   on   his \n\n\n\n\n\n                       movements, but also free from encroachments on his \n                       private   life.  It   is   true   our   Constitution   does   not \n                       expressly   declare   a   right   to   privacy   as   a \n                       fundamental right, but the said right is an essential \n                       ingredient   of   personal   liberty.  Every   democratic \n\n\n\n\n\n                       country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to give \n                       him   rest,   physical   happiness,   peace   of   mind   and \n                       security. In the last resort, a person&#x27;s house, where he \n                       lives with his family, is his &quot;castle&quot;; it is his rampart \n                       against   encroachment   on   his   personal   liberty.   The \n                       pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter J., \n                       in Wolf v.

If the Court does find that a \n                            claimed   right   is   entitled   to   protection   as   a \n                            fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must \n\n\n\n\n\n                            satisfy the compelling State interest test. Then the \n                            question would be whether a State interest is of \n                            such   paramount   importance   as   would   justify   an \n                            infringement   of   the   right.

In Paragraph 312, the \n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n     Apex   Court   held   that   the   right   of   privacy   has   been   held   to   be   a \n\n     fundamental right of the citizen being an integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_817\">Article 21</a> of \n\n\n\n\n                                             \n     the Constitution of India.  The Apex Court observed that in exceptional \n                             \n     circumstances,   the   surveillance   in   consonance   with   the   statutory \n\n     provisions may not violate that right.  Ultimately, in Paragraph 318, the \n                            \n     Apex Court held that right of privacy and the right to sleep have always \n\n     been treated to be a fundamental right like a right to breathe, to eat, to \n      \n\n\n     drink,   to   blink,   etc.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"560071\" id=\"span_280\">In   the   decision   in   the   case   of  <a href=\"/doc/560071/\" id=\"a_818\">Hinsa   Virodhak  \n   \n\n\n\n     Sangh   v.

In Paragraph 27, the \n\n\n\n\n\n     Apex Court held that what one eats is one&#x27;s personal affair and it is a \n\n     part   of   his   right   to   privacy   which   is   included   in   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_819\">Article   21</a>   of   the \n\n\n\n\n\n     Constitution of India.

A citizen has a right to lead a \n\n\n\n\n\n     meaningful life within the four corners of his house as well as outside \n\n     his   house.   This   intrusion   on   the   personal   life   of   an   individual   is \n\n     prohibited by the right to privacy which is   part of   personal liberty \n\n     guaranteed   by   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_843\">Article   21.</a>   The   State   cannot   prevent   a   citizen   from \n\n     possessing   and   consuming   a   particular   type   of   food   which   is   not \n\n     injurious to health (or obnoxious).

Paragraph 7 of the judgment \n\n\n\n\n                                              \n     delivered by Bhagwati, J is relevant for our consideration which deals \n                             \n     with the nature and requirement of the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_879\">Article 21</a> of \n\n     the Constitution of India.

So far as the right to personal \n\n\n\n\n\n                       liberty is concerned, it is ensured by providing that no \n                       one   shall   be   deprived   of   personal   liberty   except \n                       according   to   procedure   prescribed   by   law.   The   first \n                       question that arises for consideration on the language \n                       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_882\">Article 21</a> is : what is the meaning and content of \n\n\n\n\n\n                       the   words   &quot;personal   liberty&quot;   as   used   in   this   article? \n                       This question  incidentally  came  up  for  discussion  in \n                       some   of   the   judgments   in  <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_883\">A.K.

It is said that the  freedom  to move  freely  is \n                       carved   out   of   personal   liberty   and,   therefore,   the \n                       expression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_891\">Article 21</a> excludes that \n      \n\n                       attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. \n                       Both are independent fundamental rights, though \n   \n\n\n\n                       there is overlapping. There is no question of one \n                       being carved out of another. The fundamental right \n                       of life and personal liberty has many attributes and \n                       some of them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_892\">Article 19.</a> If a person&#x27;s \n\n\n\n\n\n                       fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_893\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the \n                       State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but \n                       that cannot be a complete answer unless the said \n                       law satisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_894\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_895\">Article 19(2)</a> so \n                       far as the  attributes  covered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_896\">Article  19(1)</a> are \n\n\n\n\n\n                       concerned.&quot;  There can be no doubt that in view of \n                       the   decision   of   this   Court   in R.C.

Preventing a citizen \n      \n\n\n     from possessing flesh of cow, bull or bullock slaughtered outside the \n   \n\n\n\n     State amounts to prohibiting a citizen from possessing and consuming \n\n     food of his choice.

Under the traditional view, burden of \n\n     pursuation never shifts from one party to the other at any stage of the \n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n     proceedings, whereas evidential burden may well shift back and forth \n\n     between   the   parties   as   the   trial   progresses.     The   normal   rule   of \n\n\n\n\n                                         \n     presumption   of   innocence   of   the   accused   would   thus   imply   that   it \n                             \n     would   be   for   the   prosecution   to   discharge   the   pursuasive   or   legal \n\n     burden to prove the guilt of the accused.  Traditionally conceived, every \n                            \n     criminal offence has two essential elements -  actus reus, that is to say, \n\n     the guilty act itself and  mens rea, the guilty mind.   Though there are \n      \n\n\n     many crimes (known as crimes of strict liability) which do not require \n   \n\n\n\n     mens   rea,   whenever  mens   rea  is   required,   the   prosecution   has   to \n\n     ordinarily establish both the  actus reus  of the crime and the  mens rea. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_511\">     This traditional view has undergone changes over time.

The statute, namely, <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_1102\">Section 9B</a>, does cast the pursuasive \n\n     burden on the accused to prove that the slaughter, transport, export, \n\n\n\n\n\n     sale,   purchase   or   possession,   as   the   case   may   be,   was   not   in \n\n     contravention   of   the   provisions   of   the   Act.

The   rationale   behind   limiting   the   individual&#x27;s   right   to \n\n     personal liberty and the consequential entitlement to due process in a \n      \n\n\n     criminal trial, in the first place, is to balance the interests of the state to \n   \n\n\n\n     secure   a   conviction,   particularly   in   the   case   of   heinous   crimes,   and \n\n     thereby enforce the law with the interests of the citizen to be protected \n\n\n\n\n\n     from injustice   at the hands of the law enforcement machinery.   The \n\n     Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1584447/\" id=\"a_1106\">Noor Aga</a> (supra), put the matter thus :</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">                    &quot;Enforcement   of   law,   on   the   one   hand   and   protection   of \n                    citizen from operation of injustice in the   hands of the law \n                    enforcement machinery, on the other, is, thus, required to be \n                    balanced.  The constitutionality of a penal provision placing \n                    burden of proof on an accused, thus, must be tested on the \n                    anvil of the State&#x27;s responsibility to protect innocent citizens. \n                    The   court   must   assess   the   importance   of   the   right   being \n                    limited to our society and this must be weighed against the \n                    purpose of the limitation.

The Supreme Court in  <a href=\"/doc/87098/\" id=\"a_1107\">P.N.

One of the areas where such presumptions are raised is in \n\n     respect of proof of negative facts.</span>  The English Court of Appeal in R vs.  \n      \n\n\n     Edwards64, whilst considering the provisions of the Licence Act of 1964, \n   \n\n\n\n     held that when the accused was convicted of selling intoxicating liquor \n\n     without a licence, the burden was on the defendant (accused) to prove \n\n\n\n\n\n     that   he   held   a   licence   and   as   he   had   not   done   so,   he   was   rightly \n\n     convicted.     After   following   a   number   of   precedents   on   the   statutory \n\n\n\n\n\n     exceptions,   the   Court   held   that   it   was   no   part   of   the   duty   of   the \n\n     prosecution to prove a negative fact that the accused did not have a \n\n     licence.  The other area is where the particular fact is within the special \n\n     knowledge   of   the   accused.     Criminal   courts   are   familiar   with   the \n\n     problem presented by the proof of a purpose for which an act is done, \n\n     whenever such purpose is a necessary ingredient of the  offence with \n     64 [1974]2 All ER 1085 at 1095\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_378\">    ::: Uploaded on - 06/05/2016                           ::: Downloaded on - 07/05/2016 00:02:28 :::</span>\n      ash                                              222                 fleshmatter draft 5\n\n     which the accused is charged.  Generally, in the absence of an express \n\n     admission   by   the   accused,   the   purpose   with   which   he   did   the   act \n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n     complained of is a matter of inference from what he actually did.

But if the purpose for which they were being moved was \n      \n\n\n     to transfer possession  from  the  mover  to some other person  at their \n   \n\n\n\n     intended destination, the mover was guilty of the offence of trafficking \n\n     under  <a href=\"/doc/101624776/\" id=\"a_1109\">Section  3</a> of  that Act.   If  the  quantity of  the  controlled drugs \n\n\n\n\n\n     being moved was in excess of a certain minimum specified in <a href=\"/doc/35710480/\" id=\"a_1110\">Section \n\n     15</a>,   a   rebuttable   presumption   was   created   that   the   purpose   of   such \n\n\n\n\n\n     moving was to so transfer possession.  The onus lied upon the mover to \n\n     satisfy the Court, upon balance of probabilities, that he had not actually \n\n     intended to part with the possession of the drugs to anyone else, but to \n\n     retain them solely for his own consumption.

In other words, the moment anyone is \n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n     found to be in possession of bovine flesh in the State of Maharashtra, \n\n     irrespective   of   where   the   slaughter   has   taken   place,   such   person \n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     commits   an   offence   under   the   Act   and   a   uniform   punishment   is \n                             \n     provided   for   under   the   Act   for   such   offence.     What   is,   thus,   in \n\n     contravention of the Act is the very possession of bovine flesh.  If that \n                            \n     be the case, <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_1130\">Section 9B</a>, inasmuch as it casts the burden of proving that \n\n     the possession of such flesh was not in contravention of the Act, makes \n      \n\n\n     no practical sense on the terms of <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_1131\">Sections 5C</a> and <a href=\"/doc/139741415/\" id=\"a_1132\">5D</a> on the one hand \n   \n\n\n\n     and   <a href=\"/doc/37529484/\" id=\"a_1133\">Section   9B</a>,   on   the   other.

It is relatively easy for the prosecution to \n      \n\n\n     bear the burden of establishing  that the slaughter was in contravention \n   \n\n\n\n     of   the   Act   than   for   the   accused   to   bear   the   burden   of   showing \n\n     otherwise.  Besides, the essence of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/16595794/\" id=\"a_1137\">Section 5C</a> consists \n\n\n\n\n\n     of possession of bovine flesh which is produced out of contravention of \n\n     the Act, i.e. by slaughter within the State.  How can this essential fact \n\n\n\n\n\n     be left to the accused to controvert?  The basis of any presumption in \n\n     law in a criminal trial, as we have seen above, is the substantial causal \n\n     or probative connection between the  facts found proved and the facts \n\n     presumed.   That connection is absent in this case.   Merely because a \n\n     person   is   found   in   possession   of   bovine   flesh   does   not   make   his \n\n     knowledge of slaughter within the State in any way probable.

We must note that Shri Jha, the learned counsel appearing for \n\n\n\n\n\n     one   of   the   Intervenors  made   a     submission   on   23 rd  December   2015, \n\n     which was the last working day before the Christmas Vacation, when \n\n\n\n\n\n     the hearing was conducted with the consent of the parties till 6.30 p.m. \n\n     During   the   course   of   the   arguments,   after   the   Court   hour   on   23 rd \n\n     December 2015, he urged that when a large number of litigants are \n\n     waiting in a queue, it was a grave error on the part of this Court to have \n\n     given priority to the hearing of this group of Petitions.
