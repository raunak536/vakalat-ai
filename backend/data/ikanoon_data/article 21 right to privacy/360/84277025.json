The\n          Commission feels that such definition is\n          not feasible and it does not serve any\n          purpose. The influential persons are not\n          merely those who are holding or who have\n          held public offices; even their henchmen\n          and close relations, the rich and powerful\n          and men with muscle power having links\n          with one or the other political party are\n          quite influential in their own way and they\n          have the potential to create stumbling\n          blocks   for   smooth      investigation        and\n          effective trial. Moreover, it is not desirable\n          to give too much of an expansive meaning\n          to this term so as to 13 include elected\n          representatives at the Panchayat level or\n          all the office-bearers of various political\n          parties.

BAIL APPLICATION NO. 8610/2013\n\n\n           National Commission for women had sent\n           a draft scheme to the Central Government\n           in 1995. The Committee of Secretaries\n           had on this given the following guidelines\n           in this regard:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">           (i). That a plan scheme would be prepared\n           by     the     NCW/DWCD            for     disbursing\n           compensation to the victims of rape and\n           the scheme should also provide for interim\n           compensation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">           For    re-integration      and     rehabilitation       of    the\n\nvictims of rape, ground realities are too traumatic. A victim\n\nof rape requires long term counselling; physical and\n\npsychological therapy, social security, gainful employment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">All these facilities are lacking. To make the rape victim to\n\nwait and have patience till the trial is concluded, is to leave\n\nher to the miseries without applying any balm or providing\n\nsuccour.   A    rape    victim   cannot      stand      in   the    hostile\n\natmosphere, until some aid is provided by the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">Since institutions for providing psychological counselling to\n\novercome the scar, are not available and for gainful\n\nemployment, institutions to provide vocational education\n\nare also lacking. Only means to rehabilitate victim of rape\n\nis to provide compensation.          What compensation is to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                42/43</span>\n\n                              S.B. CR. MISC.

Rape victims urgently require sustenance or\n\nsubsistence for integration and to live with dignity in the\n\nsociety.   The courts always in a given case can provide\n\ninterim compensation. Providing of interim compensation, in\n\nno way, shall have any bearing on the trial. The courts\n\nwhile awarding interim compensation, neither pronounce\n\nthe accused as guilty nor victim as sufferer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">           Suffice it to say, where a person, who has\n\nlevelled an allegation and has opted to come in public glare,\n\nefforts must be made to insulate her, so that he can defend\n\nher case with dignity. For availing lawful remedy, best legal\n\nprofessional     help should be made available to the rape\n\nvictim to espouse her cause. One cannot become oblivious\n\nof the fact that in present case top-notch professionals are\n\nstanding for the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">           The    interim   relief     awarded,    can     always      be\n\nreduced or enhanced by the trial court.                 In the given\n\ncircumstances, to ensure that such an interim compensation\n\nawarded is not misused, way can be evolved for return of\n\nthe amount, if it is held by the trial court that the case has\n\nbeen falsely instituted.    In that case, the amount can be\n\nrecovered along with damages from the person, who, on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                            43/43</span>\n\n                                           S.B.

The State\n\n           Government while disbursing compensation, shall take an\n\n           indemnity bond from the victim, so that in case the case is\n\n           held to be false, the amount is returned to the State with\n\n           interest and damages to be accessed by the trial court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">                        Nothing    said   herein    shall     be    construed       as\n\n           expression on the merits of the case and the trial court shall\n\n           confine itself strictly to the evidence adduced in the trial,\n\n           uninfluenced by any observation made herein above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">                        On prayer made by counsel for the petitioners,\n\n           the case is adjourned and the present petitions be listed\n\n           after order of the trial court on issue of cognizance is placed\n\n           on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">                        Copy of this order be forthwith sent to trial court\n\n           for strict compliance.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                                  (KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA), J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">Anil/6-7\n </p>","numcites":54,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Rajasthan High Court - Jodhpur","citetid":84277025,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"universal declaration of human rights","formInput":"universal%20declaration%20of%20human%20rights"},{"value":"rape ","formInput":"rape%20"},{"value":"rape case","formInput":"rape%20case"},{"value":"adjournment granted","formInput":"adjournment%20granted"},{"value":"section 309,criminal procedure code","formInput":"section%20309%2Ccriminal%20procedure%20code"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"sec 309 crpc","formInput":"sec%20309%20crpc"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"chandrima das","formInput":"chandrima%20das"},{"value":"rape victim","formInput":"rape%20victim"},{"value":"bail application","formInput":"bail%20application"},{"value":"crpc 309","formInput":"crpc%20309"},{"value":"examination of witnesses","formInput":"examination%20of%20witnesses"},{"value":"when does trial commence ","formInput":"when%20does%20trial%20commence%20"},{"value":"jurisprudence","formInput":"jurisprudence"},{"value":"day to day trial","formInput":"day%20to%20day%20trial"},{"value":"section 376","formInput":"section%20376"},{"value":"refugee","formInput":"refugee"},{"value":"compensation to victims","formInput":"compensation%20to%20victims"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"power-to-postpone-or-adjourn-proceedings","formInput":"tag:power-to-postpone-or-adjourn-proceedings"},{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
