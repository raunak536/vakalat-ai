The State Information Commission can\n           consist of the Chief Information Commissioner as a sole member.\n           When the Chief Information Commissioner is the sole member, he\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n           can act alone. Even when the State Information Commission is a\n           multi-member body, the distribution of the work amongst the\n           members (State Information Commissioners) is to be done by the\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n           Chief Information Commissioner and he can assign any complaint\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_11\">section 18</a> of the RTI Act to any one of the State Information\n                      \n           Commissioners including himself and an order passed by one member\n           of State Information Commission is valid.

In the judgment under review, this Court has also held after\n     examining the provisions of the Act that the Information Commission\n     decides matters which may affect the rights of third parties and\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n     hence there is requirement of judicial mind. For example, under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the Act, there is no obligation to furnish\n     information including commercial confidence, trade secrets, or\n\n\n\n\n                               \n     intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the\n     competitive position of the third party, unless the competent\n                \n     authority is satisfied that the larger public interest warrants the\n     disclosure of such information. Similarly, the right to privacy of a\n               \n     third party, which is part of his personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 21</a> of\n     the Constitution, may be breached if a particular kind of\n     information, purely of personal nature may be directed to be\n      \n\n     furnished by the concerned authority. To protect the rights of third\n     parties, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 11</a> of the Act provides that where a Central Public\n   \n\n\n\n     Information Officer or a State Public Information Officer, as the case\n     may be, intends to disclose any information or record or part\n     thereof, may on a request made under the Act, which relates to or\n\n\n\n\n\n     has been supplied by a third party and has been treated as\n     confidential by that third party, a written notice will have to be\n     given to such third party inviting such party to make a submission in\n\n\n\n\n\n     writing or orally, regarding whether the information should be\n     disclosed, and such submission of the third party can be kept in view\n     while taking a decision about disclosure of the information.

Here also the Information Commission\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     does not decide the rights of a third party but only whether the\n     information which is held by or under the control of a public\n     authority in relation to or supplied by that third party could be\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n     furnished to a citizen under the provisions of the Act.
