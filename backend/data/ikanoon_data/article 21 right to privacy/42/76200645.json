The Bench notes that undoubtedly search and seizure is a\n                                  drastic process and is bound to be accompanied by unsavoury events and\n                                  sometimes inconvenient results. A sudden search and seizure will no\n                                  doubt unnerve inmates of the location under search. In the cases before\n                                  me, allegations and rebuttals have been advanced in regard to the\n                                  highhandedness of the officials as well as the oppression that was\n                                  allegedly meted out to the residents. So too in Pooran Mal?s case. This\n                                  has been noticed in the judgment itself, but the Bench takes an overall\n                                  view of the matter stating that on the whole, the search was not\n                                  established to be malafide, oppressive or excessive. So too in this case.\n                                  The Bench held further that even if a search had been illegal, the evidence\n                                  seized can be validly used in the assessments to follow.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">                                                                                       (emphasis supplied)\n\n                                  4.15.1.

Having found that Doctrine of Proportionality is balancing of\n\n                     competing interest in the form of rights vis-a -vis limitations on such right,\n\n                     that leads us to the next question viz., what criteria are to be adopted for a\n\n                     proper balance between the two facets viz., the rights and limitations\n\n                     imposed upon it by a statute. It is here the concept of “proportionality”\n\n                     becomes relevant. To put it pithily, when a law limits a constitutional right,\n\n                     such a limitation is constitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing\n\n                     restrictions will be treated as proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\n\n                     purpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\n\n                     connected to the purpose, and such measures are necessary. This essence of\n\n                     doctrine of proportionality is beautifully captured by Dickson, C.J. of\n\n                     Canada in R. v.

This involves “a form of proportionality test” Although the\n                                  nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on the\n                                  circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the\n                                  interests of society with those of individuals and groups. There are, in my\n                                  view, three important components of a proportionality test. First, the\n                                  measures adopted must be rationally connected to the objective. Second,\n                                  the means should impair “as little as possible” the right or freedom in\n                                  question. Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the\n                                  measures which are responsible for limiting the right or freedom, and the\n                                  objective which has been identified as of “sufficient importance”. The\n                                  more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the more important the\n                                  objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and demonstrably\n                                  justified in a free and democratic society.”\n\n                                  4.37.

Power to tax as an inherent attribute of sovereignty.—The\n                                   power of taxation is an essential and inherent attribute of sovereignty,\n                                   belonging as a matter of right to every independent Government. It is\n                                   possessed by the Government without being expressly conferred by the\n                                   people. The power is inherent in the people because the sustenance of the\n                                   Government requires contributions from them. In fact the power of taxation\n                                   may be defined as “the power inherent in the sovereign State to recover a\n                                   contribution of money or other property, in accordance with some reasonable\n                                   rule or apportionment, from the property or occupations within its\n                                   jurisdiction for the purpose of defraying the public expenses”. Constitutional\n                                   provisions relating to the power of taxation do not operate as grants of the\n                                   power of taxation to the Government but instead merely constitute limitations\n                                   upon a power which would otherwise be practically without limit. This\n                                   inherent power to tax extends to everything over which the sovereign power\n                                   extends, but not to anything beyond its sovereign power. Even the federal\n                                   Government&#x27;s power of taxation does not include things beyond its sovereign\n                                   power. But where exclusive jurisdiction over land is granted to another State\n                                   or country, the land remains subject to the taxing power of the State within\n                                   whose boundaries it is located.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">                                         18.

While it intervenes to protect legitimate State interests, the\n                                  State must nevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the\n                                  fulfilment of a threefold requirement. These three requirements apply to\n                                  all restraints on privacy (not just informational privacy).

The existence of law is an essential\n                                  requirement. Second, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate\n                                  State aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law which imposes\n                                  the restriction falls within the zone of reasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_149\">Article\n                                  14</a>, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State action.

The third\n                                  requirement ensures that the means which are adopted by the legislature\n                                  are proportional to the object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the law.\n                                  Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against arbitrary\n                                  State action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the\n                                  encroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the\n                                  law.

As mentioned earlier “the right against self-incrimination” is\n                                  now viewed as an essential safeguard in criminal procedure. Its\n                                  underlying rationale broadly corresponds with two objectives—firstly,\n                                  that of ensuring reliability of the statements made by an accused, and\n                                  secondly, ensuring that such statements are made voluntarily. It is quite\n                                  possible that a person suspected or accused of a crime may have been\n                                  compelled to testify through methods involving coercion, threats or\n                                  inducements during the investigative stage. When a person is compelled to\n                                  testify on his/her own behalf, there is a higher likelihood of such testimony\n                                  being false. False testimony is undesirable since it impedes the integrity of\n                                  the trial and the subsequent verdict. Therefore, the purpose of the “rule\n                                  against involuntary confessions” is to ensure that the testimony\n                                  considered during trial is reliable. The premise is that involuntary\n                                  statements are more likely to mislead the Judge and the prosecutor,\n                                  thereby resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Even during the investigative\n                                  stage, false statements are likely to cause delays and obstructions in the\n                                  investigation efforts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">                                          103. The concerns about the “voluntariness” of statements allow a\n                                  more comprehensive account of this right. If involuntary statements were\n                                  readily given weightage during trial, the investigators would have a\n                                  strong incentive to compel such statements—often through methods\n                                  involving coercion, threats, inducement or deception.

In this sense, “the right\n                                  against self-incrimination” is a vital safeguard against torture and other\n                                  “third-degree methods” that could be used to elicit information. It serves\n                                  as a check on police behaviour during the course of investigation. The\n                                  exclusion of compelled testimony is important otherwise the investigators\n                                  will be more inclined to extract information through such compulsion as a\n                                  matter of course.

During the trial stage, the onus is on the prosecution to\n                                  prove the charges levelled against the defendant and the “right against\n                                  self-incrimination” is a vital protection to ensure that the prosecution\n                                  discharges the said onus.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_122\">104.

If it is permissible in law to obtain evidence from the accused\n                                  person by compulsion, why tread the hard path of laborious investigation\n                                  and prolonged examination of other men, materials and documents?

The judgment of the\n                                  High Court is set aside. The appeal is allowed and the orders of transfer\n                                  are quashed.
