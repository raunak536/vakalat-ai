At around 1.00 p.m., she reached at\n\n    her   house.   On    reaching,   the    prosecutrix          told      the\n\n\n\n\n\n    complainant that on the previous            day, the appellant\n\n    removed her clothes, applied oil at the place of her\n\n    urination and put his penis at the place of her urination and\n\n    the prosecutrix further told that the appellant committed\n\n    &quot;Bura Kaam&quot; with her and also touched her breast.                      The\n\n\n\n    complainant further reported to the police that prosecutrix\n\n    revealed her that she also started bleeding from the place\n\n\n\n\n    of urination and when prosecutrix started weeping, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    appellant intimidated her and asked her to keep quiet and\n\n\n\n\n\n    he also did not hand over her clothes to her and asked her\n\n    to take bath. When the complainant asked prosecutrix as to\n\n    where was her sister-in-law (Bhabhi), prosecutrix told that at\n\n    that time her sister-in-law (daughter of appellant) had gone\n\n    to place Berthin.      Prosecutrix further revealed to the\n\n    complainant that at that time she was watching T.V.

It was also reported by the complainant\n\n    that when she checked her daughter, she found that &quot;Galat\n\n\n\n\n\n    Kaam&quot; had really been committed with her. Complainant\n\n    requested the police for medical examination of her\n\n\n\n\n\n    daughter.

Prosecutrix also told\n\n    that the appellant had applied oil to her private part.

The prosecutrix also told her that\n\n    when she started crying, the appellant had asked her to first\n\n    take bath but thereafter had himself proceeded to give a\n\n    bath.

At the outset, it needs to be observed that rape\n\n    is the most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a\n\n    society, as it is an assault on the body, mind and privacy of\n\n    the victim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame of\n\n    the victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a\n\n    helpless female. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                        ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2024 20:32:24 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                       39</span>\n                            Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:8175 )\n\n\n\n\n    shakes the very core of her life.

But, we find that such\n\n    contention     loses   its    sheen,   particularly,        when        the\n\n    prosecutrix    has     been    subjected     to     lengthy         cross-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">    examination, but, nothing could be extracted from her, out\n\n\n\n    of which the appellant could take an advantage.

The\n\n\n\n\n\n    prosecutrix can conveniently be termed to be a sterling\n\n\n\n\n\n    witness of a very high quality and calibre whose version is\n\n    unassailable. The burden put forth by the prosecution can\n\n    be accepted at its face value without any hesitation. The\n\n    prosecutrix appears to be absolutely truthful and, as\n\n    observed above, consistent right from the starting point till\n\n    the end.

Mr. Ahuja, learned counsel for the appellant,\n\n\n\n\n\n    would then contend that medical evidence in the instant\n\n    case does not support the case of the prosecution and,\n\n    therefore, the appellant deserves to be acquitted. He would\n\n    strenuously argue that no semen or blood was found on\n\n    &#x27;Dupatta&#x27; which as per the prosecution had been used for\n\n\n\n    cleaning after the commission of offence.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">    60.        However, we find no merit in such contention.

The appellant is only assuming\n\n    such allegation, whereas, this is not the case of the\n\n    prosecution.   Therefore, in such circumstances, obviously,\n\n    there would be no traces of semen on the &#x27;Dupatta&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                         ::: Downloaded on - 10/09/2024 20:32:24 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                      47</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">                           Neutral Citation No. ( 2024:HHC:8175 )\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">    61.

No doubt, in\n\n    her cross-examination, she did state that redness and\n\n    laceration could be there because of insertion of fingers.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">    But, then it has come in the statement of prosecutrix herself\n\n    that it was the appellant, who           inserted the finger.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">    Furthermore, the witness (PW12) after stating that she\n\n\n\n\n\n    cannot say conclusively that rape was committed, but,\n\n\n\n\n\n    volunteered to state that the injuries noticed by her were\n\n    indicated in the MLC that make the probability of offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366037\" id=\"span_101\">63.
