The Appellant sought information regarding punishment given to Mr. R.R.\nSingh for submitting fake TA claims etc. PIO gave reply on 9.5.2014 stating that it\nis personal information. The appellant approached the Commission. The appellant in\nhis RTI application has sought following information:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     i.    Copy of office order imposing punishment on Dr. R.R. Singh, Civil\n           Engineering Department on the charge of making bogus TA claims,\n     ii.

The CPIO in his reply dated 21.04.14 stated that the information sought\nunder point 1 and 2 was personal information and exempted from disclosure under\nsection 8(1)(e) and (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_1\">RTI Act</a> and served no larger public interest. However,\nwhile responding to points 3 and 4, he stated that the decision regarding revoking\nof the punishment of Dr. R.R. Singh was taken in the 41st BOM meeting held on\n19.09.2013 and 42nd meeting held on 19.12.2013.

Mr. Sanjeev Kumar, CPIO via email\nsubstantiated his argument for denial of information sought by citing the Delhi High\nCourt decision in <a href=\"/doc/15738113/\" id=\"a_2\">Union Public Service Commission vs R.K.

The appellant in his second appeal expressed the need for disclosure of\ninformation citing three cases.          <a href=\"/doc/669140/\" id=\"a_4\">K. Ravikumar vs Bangalore University and\nAnr1</a>, in which it was stated:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot;10. Before concluding, I deem it proper to observe that in light of the policy\n          of the Government on transparency and openness, the authorities cannot\n          flatly deny any document on the ground of confidentiality or secret in such\n          matters. Mere repetition of the words would not provide confidential/secret\n          colour to a public document. Transparency and openness provide a right of\n          information to a citizen for enforcing his constitutional right of judicial review\n          in a Court of law. In the circumstances, I deem it proper to observe that the\n          authorities normally have to provide the document sought by an individual if\n          the said document has nexus with the judicial remedy in accordance with\n          law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"830022\" id=\"span_4\">Another case cited is the <a href=\"/doc/830022/\" id=\"a_5\">Canara Bank vs The Central Information2</a>, in which it\nwas held;</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          &quot;8. The next exemption claimed by the petitioner is on the ground that the\n          information sought by the second respondent relates to personal information\n          pertaining to the employees of the Bank, disclosure of which has no relationship with\n          any public activity or interest of the Bank or its employees and it would cause\n          unwarranted invasion of the privacy of those employees, details of whose transfers\n          are requested for by the 2nd respondent. I am of opinion that if this contention on\n          the basis of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is upheld, it would in fact run counter to the very object\n          of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">Right to Information Act</a> itself.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_5\">The third case relied upon by appellant is <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_8\">R.

None can publish\n        anything concerning the above matters without his consent whether truthful or\n        otherwise and whether laudatory or critical.

As the order in first appeal referred to, Girish judgment like many CPIOs and\nFirst Appellate Authorities to deny the information, the Commission felt it is\nimportant to examine the precedential value of order of Supreme Court in Girish\nRamchandra Deshpande 4 , vis-a-vis other significant Judgments of Supreme\nCourt and High Courts on the subject having value as precedent and issues like\nwhether the information sought, complaints inquired and action taken against him\nhas any relation to public activity or interest. The law of personal information or\nprivacy of public servants vis-a-vis <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">Right to Information Act</a> is the central point in\nGirish case. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act exempts the disclosure of information\nwhich has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would\ncause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless larger\npublic interest justifies the disclosure of such information. Mr. Girish submitted on\n27th August 2008 sought from Regional Provident Fund Commissioner (Ministry of\nLabour, Government of India) following relating to another public servant. The\nresponse of the public authority was:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        a. Copy of appointment order of Shri A.B. Lute, is in 3 pages.

Girish filed a writ petition6 which was dismissed by Single Judge of Bombay High\nCourt, Nagpur Bench. Then he filed Letters Patent Appeal 7 before the Division\nBench, Bombay High Court at Nagpur, which also was dismissed. Appellant filed\nspecial leave petition before the Supreme Court. Apex court judges, Mr K S Radha\nKrishnan and Dipak Misra, JJ dismissed the SLP October 3, 2012 saying:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the details called for\n        by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to the third respondent, show cause\n        notices and orders of censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal\n        information as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The performance\n        of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee\n        and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules\n        which fall under the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the disclosure of which has\n        no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the\n        disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">        Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n        Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public\n        interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be\n        passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">        14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are &quot;personal\n        information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n        8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public\n        Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority\n        is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">5</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">  CIC Decision in Girish R Deshpande v Ministry of Labour and Employment &amp; EPFO, No 1989/IC(A)/2008, in\nF.No.s CIC/MA/A/2007/00825,863, dated 21st February, 2008\n6 Girish R Deshpande No.4221 of 2009 Bombay High Court, Nagpur Bench, Mr Justice B P.

The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide public interest in\n          seeking information, the disclosure of such information would cause unwarranted\n          invasion of privacy of the individual under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">          16. We are, therefore, of the view that the petitioner has not succeeded in\n          establishing that the information sought for is for the larger public interest. That\n          being the fact, we are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition. Hence, the\n          same is dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">7. In a different second appeal by Mr Manoj Arya, RTI Activist versus PIO Cabinet\nSecretariat, Learned Commissioner Shri Satyanand Misra8, refused to provide the\ncopies of complaints and other related information about a public servant quoting\nthe Division Bench order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Girish. The Department\nof Personnel and Training issued an Office Memorandum No. 11/2/2013-IR (Pt.) on\ndisclosure of personal information under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_22\">RTI Act</a> on 14th August 2013, quoting an\noperative part of the order of the Supreme Court in Girish. The OM stated:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          The Central Information Commission in one of its decisions has held that information\n          about the complaints made against an officer of the Government and any possible\n          action the authorities might have taken on those complaints, qualifies as personal\n          information within the meaning of provision of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act, 2005.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">8. The impact of this OM is tremendous and widespread among public authorities as\nany request for information about assets/income, service book details, complaints\nagainst public servant during service and action taken thereon are being refused.\nWith three orders of CIC issued by CIC Shri Satyananda Mishra (two before and one\nafter Girish), upheld by Bombay HC single judge bench, Division Bench at Nagpur\nand it reached finality as the Supreme Court dismissed Special Leave Petition which\nwas well supported by the Office Memorandum from the nodal agency DoPT, its\nnatural that such information is totally denied by PIOs across the country.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">9. SC order in Girish and Law of Precedent: The point to be noted is that the order\nof the Supreme Court in Girish is that his SLP was dismissed, which means the\nSupreme Court did not permit the appellant to file an appeal over the order of\ndivision Bench of Bombay High Court. It is clear that there was no hearing of appeal\non merits. The Supreme Court was given discretionary powers under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 136</a> to\n\n\n8   CIC/SM/A/2013/000058, on 26.6.2013\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                                                5</span>\n decide whether an appeal from order of the High Court could be taken up for\nhearing. In its discretion it has decided to dismiss this SLP.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">10. The SLP and the Law of Precedent: The <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 141</a> of Indian Constitution\nsays that the law declared by Supreme Court to be binding on all courts. &quot;The law\ndeclared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of\nIndia&quot;. This is the Constitutional source of law of precedent in India. In a 2006\nlandmark case State of Orissa &amp; Ors. vs. M.D. Illyas 9 , the Supreme Court\nexplained that &quot;a decision is a precedent on its own facts and that for a judgment to\nbe a precedent it must contain the three basic postulates. A finding of material\nfacts, direct and inferential, (an inferential finding of fact is the inference which the\nJudge draws from the direct or perceptible facts); (ii) statements of the principles\nof law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) Judgment\nbased on the individual effect of the above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">11. Special Leave Petition and Discretion of Supreme Court: An appeal is\ndifferent from Special Leave Petition. The petition for special leave to appeal (SLP)\nis filed before the Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. The\nSupreme Court may accept or reject the same. <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 136</a> says: (1) Notwithstanding\nanything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to\nappeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter\npassed or made by any Court or Tribunal in the territory of India. (2) Nothing in clause (1)\nshall apply to any judgement, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any\nCourt or Tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"907581\" id=\"span_16\">12. This discretionary power of the Supreme Court is not subject to any\nconstitutional limitation, and is left entirely to the discretion of the Supreme Court.\nIt is a plenary jurisdiction in the matter of entertaining and hearing appeals by\ngranting special leave against any kind of the judgment or order made by the Court\nor Tribunal in any case or matter and the jurisdiction can be exercised in spite of\nother specific provision for appeal contained in the Constitution, Cr P C or other\nstatute.        This jurisdiction of the apex court cannot be whittled down by any\n\n9   State of Orissa &amp; Ors. vs. M.D. Illyas, (2006) 1 S.C.C.275\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                          6</span>\n legislation subordinate to the Constitution, as held in <a href=\"/doc/907581/\" id=\"a_28\">Mahendra Saree Emporium\nII vs. G.V. Srinivasa Murthy10</a>. Conclusiveness or finality given by a statute to\nany decision of a Court or Tribunal cannot deter the Supreme Court from exercising\nthis jurisdiction.     When special leave is granted the issues raised only can be\ncontested and the entire case is not open at large. That is why the decision in SLP\ncannot be said to have been heard on merits like that in appeals.

This Court observed that\nwhat was done by the learned single Judge was subversive of judicial discipline. The\nfacts and circumstances of the case persuaded this Court to form an opinion that the\ntenants were indulging in vexatious litigations, abusing the process of the Court by\napproaching the High Court and the very entertainment of review petitions (after\ncondoning a long delay of 221 days) and then reversing the earlier orders was an\naffront to the order of this Court. However the learned judges deciding the case have\nnowhere in the course of their judgment relied on doctrine of merger for taking the\nview they have done. A careful reading of this decision brings out the correct\nstatement of law and fortifies us in taking the view as under.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">A petition for leave to appeal to this Court may be dismissed by a non-speaking\norder or by a speaking order. Whatever be the phraseology employed in the\norder of dismissal, if it is a non-speaking order, i.e. it does not assign\nreasons for dismissing the special leave petition, it would neither attract the\ndoctrine of merger so as to stand substituted in place of the order put in\nissue before it nor would it be a declaration of law by the Supreme Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution for there is no law which has been\ndeclared. If the order of dismissal be supported by reasons then also the\ndoctrine of merger would not be attracted because the jurisdiction\nexercised was not an appellate jurisdiction but merely a discretionary\njurisdiction refusing to grant leave to appeal. We have already dealt with this\naspect earlier. Still the reasons stated by the Court would attract applicability\nof <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution if there is a law declared by the Supreme Court\nwhich obviously would be binding on all the courts and tribunals in India and\ncertainly the parties thereto. The statement contained in the order other than on\npoints of law would be binding on the parties and the court or tribunal, whose order\nwas under challenge on the principle of judicial discipline, this Court being the apex\ncourt of the country. No court or tribunal or parties would have the liberty of taking\nor canvassing any view contrary to the one expressed by this Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1659499\" id=\"span_48\">The order of\nSupreme Court would mean that it has declared the law and in that light the case\nwas considered not fit for grant of leave. The declaration of law will be governed by\n<a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 141</a> but still, the case not being one where leave was granted, the doctrine of\nmerger does not apply. The Court sometimes leaves the question of law open. Or it\nsometimes briefly lays down the principle, may be, contrary to the one <a href=\"/doc/1659499/\" id=\"a_70\">laid down by</a>\nthe High Court and yet would dismiss the special leave petition. The reasons given\nare intended for purposes of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 141.</a> This is so done because in the event of\nmerely dismissing the special leave petition, it is likely that an argument could be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                                   13</span>\n       advanced in the High Court that the Supreme Court has to be understood as not to\n      have differed in law with the High Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">25. Finally in Kunhayammed the Supreme Court listed out following conclusions:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      (i)     Where an appeal or revision is provided against an order passed by a court,\n              tribunal or any other authority before superior forum and such superior forum\n              modifies, reverses or affirms the decision put in issue before it, the decision\n              by the subordinate forum merges in the decision by the superior forum and it\n              is the latter which subsists, remains operative and is capable of enforcement\n              in the eye of law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      (ii)    The jurisdiction conferred by <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution is divisible into\n              two stages. First stage is up to the disposal of prayer for special leave to file\n              an appeal. The second stage commences if and when the leave to appeal is\n              granted and special leave petition is converted into an appeal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      (iii)   Doctrine of merger is not a doctrine of universal or unlimited application. It\n              will depend on the nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior forum and\n              the content or subject-matter of challenge laid or capable of being laid shall\n              be determinative of the applicability of merger. The superior jurisdiction\n              should be capable of reversing, modifying or affirming the order put in issue\n              before it. Under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution the Supreme Court may\n              reverse, modify or affirm the judgment-decree or order appealed against\n              while exercising its appellate jurisdiction and not while exercising the\n              discretionary jurisdiction disposing of petition for special leave to appeal. The\n              doctrine of merger can therefore be applied to the former and not to the\n              latter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      (iv)    An order refusing special leave to appeal may be a non speaking order or a\n              speaking one. In either case it does not attract the doctrine of merger.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">              If the Petition seeking grant of leave to appeal is dismissed, it is an\n              expression of opinion by the Court that a case for invoking appellate\n              jurisdiction of the Court was not made out. Therefore, neither the doctrine of\n              merger nor <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution will apply to such a case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">      (v)     If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order i.e. gives\n              reasons for refusing the grant of leave, then the order has two implications.\n              Firstly, the statement of law contained in the order is a declaration of law by\n              the Supreme Court within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution.\n              Secondly, other than the declaration of law, whatever is stated in the order\n              are the findings recorded by the Supreme Court which would bind the parties\n              thereto and also the Court, Tribunal or authority in any proceedings\n              subsequent thereto by way of judicial discipline, the Supreme Court being the\n              Apex Court of the country. But, this does not amount to saying that the\n              order of the court, tribunal or authority below has stood merged in\n              the order of the Supreme Court rejecting special leave petition or that\n              the order of the Supreme Court is the only order binding as res\n              judicata in subsequent proceedings between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">      (vi)    Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction of Supreme\n              Court has been invoked, the order passed in appeal would attract the doctrine\n              of merger; the order may be of reversal, modification or merely affirmation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">      (vii)   On an appeal having been referred or a petition seeking leave to appeal\n              having been converted into an appeal before Supreme Court the jurisdiction\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                                            14</span>\n                   of the High Court to entertain a review petition is lost thereafter as provided\n                  by sub rule(1) of Rule (1) of order 47 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_76\">of the CPC</a>.

This means that the order in Girish will bind on the points decided by it. But\nthe order of Bombay HC (DB) does not get merged with the order of Supreme Court\nin Girish. The 2010 judgment is very significant in understanding how the dismissal\nof SLP in Girish cannot be considered as binding precedent. The Supreme Court has\ncategorically reiterated in 201 case of <a href=\"/doc/1386976/\" id=\"a_77\">Bhakra Beas Management Board v.\nKrishan Kumar Vij and Anr.21</a>, that mere dismissal of a special leave petition at a\npreliminary stage does not constitute a binding precedent, and accordingly, any\norder passed by the High Court placing reliance on earlier order, shall still be\nchallenged subsequently.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1940266\" id=\"span_52\">By referring to the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1940266/\" id=\"a_78\">Kunhayammed</a> case\nauthored by the most illustrious learned Judge (Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice R.C. Lahoti as\nhe then was) it was held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          In any case, the dismissal would remain a dismissal by a non-speaking order where\n          no reasons have been assigned and no law has been declared by the Supreme Court.\n          The dismissal is not of the appeal but of the special leave petition. Even if the\n          merits have been gone into, they are the merits of the special leave petition\n          only. In our opinion neither doctrine of merger nor <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 141</a> of the\n          Constitution is attracted to such an order.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">27. Thus 2010 order of the Supreme Court made it clear that even if the dismissal\nof SLP is on merits, it could be merits of dismissal of SLP only and it cannot be\nequated with decision on merits in appeal, which only is regarded as precedent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">28.

Thus mere dismissal of SLP cannot be said to be law declared under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_88\">Article\n141</a> and consequently may not be a binding precedent when all merits were not\nthoroughly discussed. Assuming that the order is one where the two sides of the\ncase are discussed and the apex court agreed with one and dismissed SLP, still it\nmay not attract the doctrine of merger and become a precedent to be followed by\nthe lower courts and tribunals because what was heard was not appeal but special\npermission to file an appeal.   The Supreme Court may dismiss the SLP with one\nword order or one sentence order or it might have discussed the facts, as that\nhappened in Girish. The Hon&#x27;ble bench of the SC in Girish discussed the facts in\nfive or six paragraphs and held the matter need not be heard in the appeal. The\nmention and discussion of all facts and legal aspects give character of &#x27;speaking\norder&#x27; to it. But the merits or facts discussed are only limited to the extent of\nallowing or refusing the &#x27;special leave&#x27;, then, it does not mean that all the facts -\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                                                  16</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\"> whether questions of law, of fact or mixed questions of law and fact were heard,\ndiscussed and decided for the purpose of laying down law on those questions.\nThough facts were discussed and decided in Girish that was limited to dismissal of\nSLP and cannot be considered as ratio of rejecting a full-fledged appeal establishing\na law contrary to the expressed will of Parliament as found in enactment such as\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_89\">RTI Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">The plain meaning of RTI provisions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">30.

It may look somewhat paradoxical that plain meaning rule is not plain and\nrequires some explanation.

Does such unauthorised writing infringe the citizen&#x27;s right to privacy?\nWhether the freedom of press guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> entitles the press to\npublish such unauthorised account of a citizen&#x27;s life and activities and if so to what\nextent and in what circumstances?&quot; While answering the above questions, a bench\nof two judges of the Supreme Court, for the first time, directly linked the right to\nprivacy to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution but at the same time excluded matters of\npublic record from being protected under this &#x27;Right to Privacy&#x27;. After analysing\nSupreme Court orders and some American decisions the Bench the Supreme Court\nheld in Paragraph 9:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal intimacies of the\n      home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child-rearing. This\n      catalogue approach to the question is obviously not as instructive as it does not give\n      analytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps,\n      the only suggestion that can be offered as unifying principle underlying the concept\n      has been the assertion that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in\n      the concept of ordered liberty.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      Then the Supreme Court summarized the law based on decisions in\n      paragraph 26 of Rajgopal:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      (1) the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the\n      citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_104\">Art. 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let alone.&quot; A citizen has a right\n      to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood,\n      child bearing and education among other matters. None can publish anything\n      concerning the above matters without his consent - whether truthful or otherwise\n      and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to\n      privacy of the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">      Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\n      controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">      (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication concerning the\n      aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n      records including Court records. This is for the reason that once a matter becomes a\n      matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\n      legitimate subject for comment by press and media among others. We are, however,\n      of the opinion that in the interests of decency (<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 19(2)</a>) an exception must be\n      carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                                              20</span>\n       abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of her\n      name and the incident being published in press/ media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">      (3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above - indeed, this is not an\n      exception but an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right\n      to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not\n      available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their\n      official duties.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">      Part 1 of the above order has an exception in Part 2. The information that\n      formed part of public record or court record does not give rise to any privacy,\n      except in cases of female victims of sexual crimes where her name shall not\n      be revealed. This was not on the question of privacy but because there is a\n      need to secure the victim and prevent further victimization by the society.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">37. Question is what is public record? Public record as defined in the <a href=\"/doc/13351240/\" id=\"a_106\">Public\nRecords Act</a> is any record held by any Government office. The Rajgopal order is\nclear as to the areas of privacy - such as his family, marriage, procreation,\nmotherhood, child bearing and education among other matters. Issuance of\nmemos, initiating disciplinary action or imposing penalty does not fall in any of\nthese categories and thus it cannot be said to be the personal or private\ninformation of the employee.      Point 3 says that the acts and conduct relevant of\npublic servant to discharge of their official duties cannot be treated as private\ninformation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">38. What is Personal? Conflict with <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 8</a> of RTI Act: The Supreme Court\ncategorically stated that Point 3 was not just an exception to Point 1 but an\nindependent rule by itself. This rule is similar to <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act, which\nsays the information which is related to public activity is not private information.\nThe order in Girish is contrary to both express provision of law and well laid down\nratio by the apex court in division bench. The order in Girish does not even\nmention R Rajgopal&#x27;s proposition and there was neither any analysis nor its\noverruling. When compared and analysed, the ratio in Rajgopal was in full-fledged\nwrit appeal which was heard on merits was not over ruled by the order of dismissal\nof SLP in Girish. The ratio decidendi in Rajgopal is in tune with <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                                           <a href=\"/doc/1156532/\" id=\"a_110\">21</a></span>\n while dismissal of SLP in Girish is in conflict with that express provision of the law.\nThe Girish order does not explain why the provision of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_111\">RTI Act</a> is not the law and\nby what rule of interpretation the new principle that employee related information is\npersonal information has been evolved?              Without over ruling the ratio in\nRajagopal, it is not jurisprudentially possible to establish a different principle of\nlaw, that too in conflict with express provision of law. As it was not writ appeal\nthere was no opportunity to bring the ratio in Rajagopal to the notice of the\nDivision Bench of Supreme Court. Another vital point is that the memos, complaints\nor disciplinary action related information is not unconnected with public activity,\nwhich was also not discussed in the order. It might have happened because it was\nnot a full writ appeal but a hearing on SLP only.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">39.     Privacy of Assets Information of public servants: The assets and\nproperties owned by a person, spouse and children could be private information of\nthe public servant because this is in his personal domain as per Point 1, but when\ncontrasted with Point 3 of Rajagopal ratio assets related information is not\npersonal. The public servant is not expected to misappropriate the public money,\nwith which he will be dealing in his day-to-day operations. In such background, the\nproperty he and his family members earned could be revealed. This became the law\nbecause of judicial pronouncements and also amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_112\">Representation of\nPeople&#x27;s Act</a>, and passing of <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_113\">Lokpal Act</a> by the Parliament. The disciplinary action\nor complaints against a public servant, cannot fall under the categories of private\ndomain such as family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child bearing and\neducation. Compared to an order of division bench of Supreme Court in dismissal\nof SLP in Girish under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 136</a>, the decision of the division bench in Writ Appeal\nin R Rajgopal under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 141</a> has binding value as declaration of law.           The\ninformation sought under Girish cannot primarily be considered as personal. Even\nif assumed as personal, the public relation, invasion of privacy, public interest\nfactors make that information to be shared because of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_72\">40.

The Delhi High Court opined that such information could not be\nregarded as personal information and could be disclosed 27 . Later, some of the\njudges of Supreme Court and High Courts started voluntarily declaring their assets\non the websites. This order is appealed to the Supreme Court by the Secretary\nGeneral of Supreme Court, which is awaiting the hearing.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">41.    A Division Bench of Bombay High Court in the case of Surup Singh Naik Vs.\nState of Maharashtra28 held in the said case that the information which cannot\nbe denied to the Parliament or the State Legislature cannot be denied to the citizen.\nThe proviso at the end of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 8(1)</a> of RTI Act perhaps was not brought before\nBombay HC (DB) in Girish case. Thus the Bombay HC(DB) in Surup Singh Naik\nsets off the precedent of Bombay HC(DB) in Girish to the extent of applicability of\nProviso to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 8(1)</a> of RTI Act, and the public nature of conduct of public\nservant necessitating disclosure of information sought.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">42.    Law on privacy of assets statements: It is necessary to refer to express\nprovisions of enactments which are ignored by courts in Girish. The Parliament\nconsidered the question of assets statement of public servants and passed <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_120\">Lokpal\nAct</a>. Thus the law is consolidated and settled on the aspect of assets statement of\npublic servants is aspect. <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_121\">The Representation of People&#x27;s Act</a> 1951, and the\njudgments of the Supreme Court emphatically declared that the voters have right\nto information about the asset statements of the contesting candidates, who are\nunder a mandatory statutory duty to file affidavits at the time of filing nomination\nand every year after getting elected. These statements are available both under S 3\nand S 4, i.e., they are proactively disclosed and also shared if a citizen demands\nunder <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_122\">RTI Act</a>.

To understand the relationship between the disciplinary action and &#x27;public\nactivity&#x27;, we need to know what are the conduct rules, underwhich the public\nservant can be inquired into on charges of &#x27;misconduct&#x27;.            The complaints if\ngenerated under Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964 (in short CCS Rules),\ntheir performance is with reference to public activity unless there is any exceptional\nunconnected incident. In principle the actions of employee are public in nature and\nexceptionally they could be private also. But it is not correct to say that entire\nactivity between employer and employee, is personal to the employee. This\nstatement could be proper with reference to private employment to great extent\nwith possible exceptions there too. When the conduct of public servant is in\nquestion in complaints and action thereof, it is improper to classify it as &#x27;personal&#x27;\ninformation of the employee concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">55.   Introduction to the revision of CCS Rules, as available in the website of\nMinistry of Personnel refers to recommendations of Committee on Prevention of\nCorruption chaired by K Santhanam and based on them, rules were revised. This\nmeans the Government believes in preventing corruption by strictly implementing\nthe Central Civil Service Conduct Rules. Most of the rules indicate that the attitude,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                                     28</span>\n conduct and character of public servants are directly connected to the public\nactivity and there is a public interest in regulating their conduct40.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">56.      If this is the purpose of the revision of CCS rules, how can any complaint\nagainst a public servant action there on could be personal information? From the\ntext of the order of the Supreme Court, it appears that this aspect was not brought\nto apex court&#x27;s notice. How can this be considered as full-fledged appeal where all\nsubstantial issues were heard to make that a precedent under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 141?</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">57. Rule 3A deals &quot;Promptness and Courtesy&quot; and says: No Government servant\nshall (a) in the performance of his official duties, act in a discourteous manner; (b)\nin his official dealings with the public or otherwise adopt dilatory tactics or wilfully\ncause delays in disposal of the work assigned to him. The Rule 3B demands that\nevery government servant to act in accordance with the Government&#x27;s policies\nregarding age of marriage, preservation of environment and protection of wildlife\nand cultural heritage. They should observe government&#x27;s policies regarding\nprevention of crime against women. 3C imposed Prohibition of sexual harassment\nof working women. In para 7 of Chapter VI of the First Five Year Plan, the Planning\nCommission have observed that no officer who does not have a reputation for\nhonesty should be placed in a position in which there is considerable scope for\ndiscretion. The Government of India fully agree with this observation. [MHA OM No.\n41/2/55(II)-Ests.(A), dated 23.04.1955] The rules also provide for action against\nthose Government servants who do not look after their families properly.\nDisciplinary action lies against playing cards on lawns outside the office buildings.\nRule 26 deals with accountability for delay in decision making. A Core Group on\nAdministrative Reforms (CGAR) under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary in\nFebruary, 2003 has decided that the existing provisions about accountability\nmechanism should be reiterated with a view to bring to everyone&#x27;s notice that these\nprovisions are adequate for initiating disciplinary proceedings when an officer\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">40</span>\n     http://www.persmin.gov.in/DOPT/EmployeesCorner/Acts_Rules/CCSRules_1964/ccs_conduct_rules_1964_deta\nils.htm:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                                                                     29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\"> adopts a dilatory attitude leading to delay in decision-making and/or harassment of\nthe public.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">58.     They have to maintain absolute integrity, devotion to duty and do nothing\nwhich is unbecoming of a Government servant. They shall not use their position or\ninfluence directly or indirectly to employment for any member of his family in any\ncompany or firm.      Every employee should furnish information in respect of their\nclose relations in the enclosed proforma which should be added to the confidential\nreport dossier of the employee concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">59. Allegations of sexual harassment, non-maintenance of family and misbehaviour\ncould be &#x27;personal&#x27; information of that person, provided he is not in public field or\ndoes not possess public employment. If there is any complaint on such conduct,\nagainst a public servant, does it become personal information of that public\nservant? Especially when the public conduct of public person includes the\nmaintenance of family, if action is taken against him for such misconduct relating to\nhis own family, it will not be proper to classify that information as &#x27;personal&#x27; and it\nwill be illegal to restrict such information from disclosure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">60.      If a public servant is found guilty of an offence of moral turpitude by a court\nof law and punished; he will also face a disciplinary action which might even lead to\ndismissal from employment. It will not be a case of double jeopardy, a principle of\njustice which means that none should be punished twice for same offence, though it\nlooks like that. If he is penalized by court of law, he should not be allowed to\nrepresent the &#x27;state&#x27;. For instance, a proved rapist or killer cannot hold public office\nunder &#x27;state&#x27;. Sitting in the seat of public office, if a public servant affects the rights\nof people in general, one member of such public has authority to demand\ninformation. Thus:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      a) there is no legal basis for considering the conduct of public servants in the\n         service of public or public authority as his/her private information. The legal\n         boundaries of personal or privacy are specified by the division bench of\n         Supreme Court in R Rajagopal, which remain in force as precedent as it was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                                                        30</span>\n          not overruled. It is not logical or legal to say that the public conduct of public\n         servant has no relation with public activity or public interest. The Decision of\n         Supreme Court in R Rajagopal on the privacy and personal information was\n         clearly defined and the information about conduct of public servant in his\n         public office will not fall under the categories of information defined as\n         personal information <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_155\">in that case</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      b) When the employer is &quot;the State&quot; (=public in democracy) its relation with the\n         employees, i.e., public servants is totally different from relation between\n         private employee or private institute or a shop. And the information about\n         service and service related conduct of the public servant during his\n         employment in public authority may be public information and may not be\n         personal information of that employee. This question has to be decided in\n         each and every case base on facts and circumstances of that case. The\n         information about disciplinary action, memos, reports etc against that public\n         servant is part of &#x27;information&#x27; as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 2(f)</a> of Right to\n         Information Act, 2005, and it can be disclosed subject to <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_158\">9</a> of\n         that Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"973841\" id=\"span_98\">c) As far as the assets related information is concerned, the Supreme Court&#x27;s\n         order in <a href=\"/doc/973841/\" id=\"a_159\">PUCL v UoI</a> and ADR v UoI besides the <a href=\"/doc/53292799/\" id=\"a_160\">Lokpal Act</a>. 2003 laid down\n         the law that public servant&#x27;s assets related information is not personal\n         information but has to be disclosed under a statutory obligation and thus\n         could be disclosed under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_161\">RTI Act</a>.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">      d) In view of the several other decisions of the Supreme Court quoted above\n         and objectives of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_162\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>, the information about\n         disciplinary action taken against the public servant can be shared as per the\n         Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">61.      The principle laid down in Girish Ramachandra Despande cannot be used by\nthe public authority to deny the information sought.

Such an application will\ndefeat very purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_163\">Right to Information Act</a>. Is it proper to say official\nconduct of a public servant in a public authority with reference to the disciplinary\naction taken on charges of a bogus TA claim is not related to official or public\nactivity of the authority? It is in public interest to reveal why the punishment was\nimposed on a public servant and then why it was revoked?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">62.     The Commission observes that the conduct of the public authority in the\ncase of Dr. R.R. Singh was in relation to the false claim of TA, enquiry thereafter,\ndisciplinary action taken and its straightaway revocation which is directly connected\nto the public activity of public authority and it also deals with misuse of public\nmoney. In view of the Supreme Court judgments cited, various other legal aspects\nand the facts produced, the Commission concludes that the information sought\npertains to public interest/public activity hence it does not attract the exemptions\nunder sec 8(1)(j).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">63.     The Commission directs the         Public Authority to provide      point-wise\ninformation sought along with the reasons for revocation of punishment of Dr. Dr.\nR.R.
