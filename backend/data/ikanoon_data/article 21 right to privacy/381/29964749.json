He   submitted   that   that\n  is   the   reason   why   there   is   a   provision   made   for\n  payment   of     Compounding   charges,   Infrastructure\n  charges   etc.     He   submitted   that   the   provisions\n  relating   to the said charges have direct a nexus\n  with   the   object   sought   to   be   achieved   by   the\n  Amendment Act.  He submitted that merely because an\n  argument is made that only the rich people may be\n  able   to   pay   the   Compounding   charges   as   well   as\n  Infrastructure charges and poor people may not able\n  to   pay   the   same   is   not   sufficient   to   uphold   the\n  contention regarding violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14</a> of the\n  Constitution   of   India.   He   submitted   that   the\n  amendment   cannot   become   discriminatory   because\n  different Planning Authorities are entitled to have\n  different   norms   for   Compounding   of   illegal\n  structures.

However, the power to strike\n           down primary legislation enacted by the Union or the State\n           Legislatures is on limited grounds. Courts can strike down\n           legislation either on the basis that it falls foul of federal\n           distribution of powers or that it contravenes fundamental\n           rights or other constitutional rights/provisions of the\n           Constitution of India. No doubt, since the Supreme Court\n           and the High Courts are treated as the ultimate arbiter in all\n           matters involving interpretation of the Constitution, it is the\n           courts which have the final say on questions relating to rights\n           and whether such a right is violated or not. The basis of the\n           aforesaid statement lies in <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution\n           which proscribes the State from making &quot;any law which\n           takes away or abridges the right conferred by Part III&quot;,\n           enshrining fundamental rights. It categorically states that\n\n  29 (2017) 7 SCC 59\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                         ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                         50</span>\n\n           any law made in contravention thereof, to the extent of the\n           contravention, be void.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">            77.

With this, we advert to the discussion on the grounds of\n           judicial review that are available to adjudge the validity of\n           a piece of legislation passed by the legislature. We have\n           already mentioned that a particular law or a provision\n           contained in a statute can be invalidated on two grounds,\n           namely: (i) it is not within the competence of the legislature\n           which passed the law, and/or (ii) it is in contravention of\n           any of the fundamental rights stipulated in Part III of the\n           Constitution or any other right/provision of the\n           Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">               Ultimately, in paragraph 83, the Apex Court held thus:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">              83. It is, thus, clear that in exercise of power of judicial\n           review, the Indian courts are invested with powers to strike\n           down primary legislation enacted by Parliament or the State\n           Legislatures. However, while undertaking this exercise of\n           judicial review, the same is to be done at three levels. In the\n           first stage, the Court would examine as to whether\n           impugned provision in a legislation is compatible with the\n           fundamental         rights    or the   constitutional    provisions\n           (substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal\n           distribution of powers (procedural judicial review). If it is\n           not found to be so, no further exercise is needed as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                            ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                     51</span>\n\n           challenge would fail. On the other hand, if it is found that\n           legislature lacks competence as the subject legislated was\n           not within the powers assigned in the List in Schedule VII,\n           no further enquiry is needed and such a law is to be\n           declared as ultra vires the Constitution. However, while\n           undertaking substantive judicial review, if it is found that\n           the impugned provision appears to be violative of\n           fundamental rights or other constitutional rights, the Court\n           reaches the second stage of review. At this second phase of\n           enquiry, the Court is supposed to undertake the exercise as\n           to whether the impugned provision can still be saved by\n           reading it down so as to bring it in conformity with the\n           constitutional provisions. If that is not achievable then the\n           enquiry enters the third stage. If the offending portion of\n           the statute is severable, it is severed and the Court strikes\n           down the impugned provision declaring the same as\n           unconstitutional.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"103855227\" id=\"span_144\">(emphasis added)\n\n        Another   decision   on   this   aspect   is   the\n   decision of the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/103855227/\" id=\"a_142\">Deena\n   @ Deen Dayal and Others vs. Union of India and\n   others</a> (supra).  By <a href=\"/doc/103855227/\" id=\"a_143\">the said decision</a>, the Apex\n   Court held  that it  is permissible to  challenge\n   the   validity   of   a   statute   on   the   ground   of\n   violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_144\">Article  14</a> of the  Constitution of\n   India.  The Apex Court also dealt with the issue\n   of   burden   of   proof   as   regards   the   challenge\n   based on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_145\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_146\">, 19</a>  as well  as 21 of the\n   Constitution.

In a challenge based on the\n            violation of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_151\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_152\">21</a>, the petitioner has\n            undoubtedly to plead that, for example, his right to free\n            speech and expression is violated or that he is deprived of\n            his right to life and personal liberty. But once he shows\n            that which really is not a part of the &quot;burden of proof&quot;, it\n            is for the State to justify the impugned law or action by\n            proving that, for example, the deprivation of the\n            petitioner&#x27;s right to free speech and expression is saved\n            by clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 19</a> since it is in the nature of a\n            reasonable restriction on that right in the interests of\n            matters mentioned in clause (2), or that, the petitioner\n            has been deprived of his life or personal liberty according\n            to a just, fair and reasonable procedure established by\n            law.     In cases arising under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 19</a>, the burden is\n            never on the petitioner to prove that the restriction is not\n            reasonable or that the restriction is not in the interests of\n            matters mentioned in clause (2).         Likewise, in cases\n            arising under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 21</a>, the burden is never on the\n            petitioner to prove that the procedure prescribed by law\n            which deprives him of his life or personal liberty is\n            unjust, unfair or unreasonable. That is why the ratio of\n            cases which fall under the category of the decision in\n            Ram Krishna Dalmia must be restricted to those arising\n            under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 14</a> and cannot be extended to cases arising\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 19</a> of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">                                       (emphasis added)\n   43       In paragraph 22, of the same decision, the\n   Apex Court held thus: \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                      ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                       53</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1849054\" id=\"span_149\">&quot;22      Another decision in the same category of cases is <a href=\"/doc/1849054/\" id=\"a_159\">Mohd.\n            Faruk V.

Having noticed this, the evolution of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 21</a>, since the\n           decision in <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_166\">Cooper [Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India</a>,\n           (1970) 1 SCC 248] indicates two major areas of change. First, the\n           fundamental rights are no longer regarded as isolated silos or\n           watertight compartments. In consequence, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 14</a> has been\n           held to animate the content of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 21.</a> Second, the expression\n           &quot;procedure established by law&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 21</a> does not connote\n           a formalistic requirement of a mere presence of procedure in\n           enacted law. That expression has been held to signify the\n           content of the procedure and its quality which must be fair,\n           just and reasonable. The mere fact that the law provides for\n           the deprivation of life or personal liberty is not sufficient to\n           conclude its validity and the procedure to be constitutionally\n           valid must be fair, just and reasonable. The quality of\n           reasonableness does not attach only to the content of the\n           procedure which the law prescribes with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_170\">Article\n           21</a> but to the content of the law itself. In other words, the\n           requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 21</a> is not fulfilled only by the enactment\n           of fair and reasonable procedure under the law and a law\n           which does so may yet be susceptible to challenge on the\n           ground that its content does not accord with the requirements\n           of a valid law. The law is open to substantive challenge on the\n           ground that it violates the fundamental right.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">            .........................\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"590378\" id=\"span_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_155\">294. The Court, in the exercise of its power of judicial review, is\n        unquestionably vested with the constitutional power to adjudicate upon the\n        validity of a law. When the validity of a law is questioned on the ground\n        that it violates a guarantee contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 21</a>, the scope of the\n        challenge is not confined only to whether the procedure for the deprivation\n        of life or personal liberty is fair, just and reasonable. Substantive\n        challenges to the validity of laws encroaching upon the right to life or\n        personal liberty has been considered and dealt with in varying contexts,\n        such as the death penalty (<a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_173\">Bachan Singh [Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</a>,\n        (1980) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 580] ) and mandatory death sentence\n        (<a href=\"/doc/590378/\" id=\"a_174\">Mithu [Mithu v. State of Punjab</a>, (1983) 2 SCC 277 : 1983 SCC (Cri)\n        405] ), among other cases. A person cannot be deprived of life or\n        personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure established\n        by law. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 14</a>, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses the\n        entirety of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 21.</a> The interrelationship between the guarantee\n        against arbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty\n        operates in a multi-faceted plane.

Hence, while judicial review\n        in constitutional challenges to the validity of legislation is exercised with a\n        conscious regard for the presumption of constitutionality and for the\n        separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial\n        institutions, the constitutional power which is vested in the Court must be\n        retained as a vibrant means of protecting the lives and freedoms of\n        individuals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">             296.

Moreover, even in the country of its origin,\n        substantive due process has led to vagaries of judicial interpretation.\n        Particularly having regard to the constitutional history surrounding\n        the deletion of that phrase in our Constitution, it would be\n        inappropriate to equate the jurisdiction of a constitutional court in\n        India to entertain a substantive challenge to the validity of a law with\n        the exercise of substantive due process under the US Constitution.\n        Reference to substantive due process in some of the judgments is\n        essentially a reference to a substantive challenge to the validity of a\n        law on the ground that its substantive (as distinct from procedural)\n        provisions violate the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">                                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_158\">(emphasis added)\n    \n   45     The controversy whether a legislation can be\n   challenged on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 14</a>\n   is   now   laid   to   rest   by   a   recent   decision   of   the\n   five Judge                  Constitution Bench of the Apex Court\n   in the case of   <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_183\">Shayara Bano v.

The last two grounds of challenge may be taken up together\n            for consideration.

Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is\n            unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law\n            and is therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 14</a>, and if it effects any matter\n            relating to public employment, it is also violative of <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 16.</a>\n            <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_197\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_198\">16</a> strike at arbitrariness in State action and ensure\n            fairness and equality of treatment.

Equality is a dynamic concept\n            with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned\n            within traditional and doctrinaire limits. We must reiterate here\n            what was pointed out by the majority in E.P. Royappa v. State of\n            T.N. [E.P. Royappa v.

It must\n            therefore now be taken to be well settled that what <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 14</a>\n            strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary,\n            must necessarily involve negation of equality. The doctrine of\n            classification which is evolved by the courts is not paraphrase\n            of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 14</a> nor is it the objective and end of that article. It is\n            merely a judicial formula for determining whether the\n            legislative or executive action in question is arbitrary and\n            therefore constituting denial of equality. If the classification is\n            not reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions <a href=\"/doc/1281050/\" id=\"a_232\">referred\n            to above</a>, the impugned legislative or executive action would\n            plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_233\">Article\n            14</a> would be breached.

In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non-\n            arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is a\n            golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of\n            the Constitution.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732220\" id=\"span_171\">72.

Ananthi Ammal [State of T.N.</a>\n            v. Ananthi Ammal, (1995) 1 SCC 519] . Before, however, we\n            refer to the holding in <a href=\"/doc/1000425/\" id=\"a_239\">the said decision</a>, it would be\n            appropriate to remind ourselves of certain basic propositions\n            in this behalf. In the United Kingdom, Parliament is supreme.\n            There are no limitations upon the power of Parliament. No\n            court in the United Kingdom can strike down an Act made by\n            Parliament on any ground. As against this, the United States\n            of America has a Federal Constitution where the power of the\n            Congress and the State Legislatures to make laws is limited\n            in two ways viz. the division of legislative powers between\n            the States and the Federal Government and the fundamental\n            rights (Bill of Rights) incorporated in the Constitution. In\n            India, the position is similar to the United States of America.\n            The power of Parliament or for that matter, the State\n            Legislatures is restricted in two ways. A law made by\n            Parliament or the legislature can be struck down by courts on\n            two grounds and two grounds alone viz. (1) lack of\n            legislative competence, and (2) violation of any of the\n            fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution\n            or of any other constitutional provision. There is no third\n            ground. We do not wish to enter into a discussion of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                             ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                    60</span>\n\n            concepts of procedural unreasonableness and substantive\n            unreasonableness--concepts inspired by the decisions of the\n            United States Supreme Court. Even in USA, these concepts\n            and in particular the concept of substantive due process have\n            proved to be of unending controversy, the latest thinking\n            tending towards a severe curtailment of this ground\n            (substantive due process). The main criticism against the\n            ground of substantive due process being that it seeks to set up\n            the courts as arbiters of the wisdom of the legislature in\n            enacting the particular piece of legislation. It is enough for us\n            to say that by whatever name it is characterised, the ground\n            of invalidation must fall within the four corners of the two\n            grounds mentioned above. In other words, say, if an\n            enactment is challenged as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 14</a>, it can be\n            struck down only if it is found that it is violative of the\n            equality clause/equal protection clause enshrined therein.\n            Similarly, if an enactment is challenged as violative of any of\n            the fundamental rights guaranteed by sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\n            <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 19(1)</a>, it can be struck down only if it is found not\n            saved by any of clauses (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_242\">Article 19</a> and so on. No\n            enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is\n            arbitrary [ An expression used widely and rather\n            indiscriminately--an expression of inherently imprecise\n            import.</span> The extensive use of this expression in India reminds\n            one of what Frankfurter, J. said in Hattie Mae Tiller v.\n            Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 87 L Ed 610 : 318 US 54\n            (1943), &quot;A phrase begins life as a literary expression; its\n            felicity leads to its lazy repetition and repetition soon\n            establishes it as a legal formula, undiscriminatingly used to\n            express different and sometimes contradictory ideas&quot;, said\n            the learned Judge.] or unreasonable. Some or other\n            constitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating an\n            Act. An enactment cannot be struck down on the ground that\n            court thinks it unjustified. Parliament and the legislatures,\n            composed as they are of the representatives of the people, are\n            supposed to know and be aware of the needs of the people\n            and what is good and bad for them. The court cannot sit in\n            judgment over their wisdom. In this connection, it should be\n            remembered that even in the case of administrative action,\n            the scope of judicial review is limited to three grounds viz. (i)\n            unreasonableness, which can more appropriately be called\n            irrationality, (ii) illegality and (iii) procedural impropriety\n            (see Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil\n            Service [Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for Civil\n            Service, 1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174 : (1984) 3 All\n            ER 935 (HL)] which decision has been accepted by this\n            Court as well). The applicability of doctrine of\n            proportionality even in administrative law sphere is yet a\n            debatable issue. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195585826\" id=\"span_175\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"861688\" id=\"span_176\">(See the opinions of Lords Lowry and\n            Ackner in <a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_243\">R. v.

It would be rather odd if an enactment\n            were to be struck down by applying the said principle when\n            its applicability even in administrative law sphere is not fully\n            and finally settled.

[ It is clear that\n            one judgment can have more than one ratio decidendi.\n            This was recognised early on by the Privy Council in an\n            appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in\n            Commissioners of Taxation for the State of New South\n            Wales v. Palmer, 1907 AC 179 (PC). Lord Macnaghten put\n            it thus: (AC p. 184)&quot;... But it is impossible to treat a\n            proposition which the court declares to be a distinct and\n            sufficient ground for its decision as a mere dictum, simply\n            because there is also another ground stated upon which,\n            standing alone, the case might have been determined.&quot;In\n            Jacobs v. London County Council, 1950 AC 361 : (1950) 1\n            All ER 737, the House of Lords, after referring to some\n            earlier decisions held, as follows: (AC p. 369 : All ER p.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">            741)&quot;... However, this may be, there is, in my opinion, no\n            justification for regarding as obiter dictum a reason given\n            by a Judge for his decision, because he has given another\n            reason also. If it were a proper test to ask whether the\n            decision would have been the same apart from the\n            proposition alleged to be obiter, then a case which ex facie\n            decided two things would decide nothing. A good\n            illustration will be found in London Jewellers Ltd. v.\n            Attenborough, (1934) 2 KB 206 (CA). In that case the\n            determination of one of the issues depended on how far\n            the Court of Appeal was bound by its previous decision in\n            Folkes v. R., (1923) 1 KB 282 (CA), [in which] the court\n            had given two grounds for its decision, the second of\n            which [as stated by Greer, L.J., in Attenborough case,\n            (1934) 2 KB 206] was that: (KB p. 222)&#x27;... where a man\n            obtains possession with authority to sell, or to become the\n            owner himself, and then sells, he cannot be treated as\n            having obtained the goods by larceny by a trick.&#x27; &quot;In\n            Attenborough case, (1934) 2 KB 206 it was contended\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                          ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">                                    64</span>\n\n            that, since there was another reason given for the decision\n            in Folkes case, (1923) 1 KB 282, the second reason was\n            obiter, but Greer, L.J., said in reference to the argument of\n            counsel: (Attenborough case, KB p. 222)&quot;I cannot help\n            feeling that if we were unhampered by authority there is\n            much to be said for this proposition which commended\n            itself to Swift, J., and which commended itself to me in\n            Folkes v. R., (1923) 1 KB 282, but that view is not open to\n            us in view of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Folkes\n            v. R., (1923) 1 KB 282. In that case two reasons were\n            given by all the members (footnote 65 contd.)of the Court\n            of Appeal for their decision and we are not entitled to pick\n            out the first reason as the ratio decidendi and neglect the\n            second, or to pick out the second reason as the ratio\n            decidendi and neglect the first; we must take both as\n            forming the ground of the judgment.&quot;So, also, in Cheater\n            v. Cater, (1918) 1 KB 247 (CA) Pickford, L.J., after citing\n            a passage from the judgment of Mellish, L.J., in Erskine v.\n            Adeane, (1873) LR 8 Ch App 756, said: (Cheater case, KB\n            p. 252)&quot;... That is a distinct statement of the law and not a\n            dictum. It is the second ground given by the Lord Justice\n            for his judgment. If a Judge states two grounds for his\n            judgment and bases his decision upon both, neither of\n            those grounds is a dictum.&quot;] A three-Judge Bench in the\n            teeth of this ratio cannot, therefore, be said to be good law.\n            Also, the binding Constitution Bench decision in Sunil\n            Batra [Sunil Batra v.

This\n            being the case, there is no rational distinction between the\n            two types of legislation when it comes to this ground of\n            challenge under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 14.</a> The test of manifest\n            arbitrariness, therefore, as <a href=\"/doc/223504/\" id=\"a_303\">laid down in</a> the aforesaid\n            judgments would apply to invalidate legislation as\n            well as subordinate legislation under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 14.</a>\n            Manifest arbitrariness, therefore, must be something\n            done by the legislature capriciously, irrationally\n            and/or without adequate determining principle.

It is first necessary to discern the true purpose or object of\n        the impugned enactment because it is only with reference to the\n        true object of the enactment that the existence of a rational nexus\n        of the differentia on which the classification is based, with the\n        object sought to be achieved by the enactment, can be examined\n        to test the validity of the classification. In Francis Bennion&#x27;s\n        Statutory Interpretation (1984 Edn.), the distinction between the\n\n\n  32 (1990) 4 SCC 366\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_227\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                      ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">                                 70</span>\n\n        legislative intention and the purpose or object of the legislation\n        has been succinctly summarised at p. 237 as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                &#x27;The distinction between the purpose or object of an\n            enactment and the legislative intention governing it is that the\n            former relates to the mischief to which the enactment is\n            directed and its remedy, while the latter relates to the legal\n            meaning of the enactment.&#x27;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">            16. There is thus a clear distinction between the two. While the\n        purpose or object of the legislation is to provide a remedy for the\n        malady, the legislative intention relates to the meaning or\n        exposition of the remedy as enacted. While dealing with the\n        validity of a classification, the rational nexus of the differentia on\n        which the classification is based has to exist with the purpose or\n        object of the legislation, so determined. The question next is of\n        the manner in which the purpose or object of the enactment\n        has to be determined and the material which can be used for\n        this exercise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">            17. For determining the purpose or object of the legislation, it\n        is permissible to look into the circumstances which prevailed at\n        the time when the law was passed and which necessitated the\n        passing of that law. For the limited purpose of appreciating the\n        background and the antecedent factual matrix leading to the\n        legislation, it is permissible to look into the Statement of\n        Objects and Reasons of the Bill which actuated the step to\n        provide a remedy for the then existing malady. In A. Thangal\n        Kunju Musaliar v. M. Venkatachalam Potti [A. Thangal Kunju\n        Musaliar v. M.

In fact, the Supreme\n            Court has cautioned against liberal use of the power of\n            regularization and retention of unauthorized works and\n            buildings. The Supreme Court has warned that authorities\n            must take into account considerations of public safety and\n            health,       protection    of   environment   and     ill-effects   of\n            unregulated and uncontrolled construction in cities and\n            towns.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">            Therefore, it cannot be said that every unauthorized\n            construction can be permitted to be regularized by loading of\n            TDRS or by condoning or relaxing the restrictions relating to\n            FSI, open space, set backs, height of the building, etc. In\n  33 2010 (2) Mh.L.J. 759\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                                    75</span>\n\n            individual cases and by applying the standards and rules\n            strictly and rigourously , the authorities must take an\n            informed decision bearing in mind the building regulations,\n            restrictions and conditions therein.

The faith and trust that is reposed in them is in the\n            belief and hope that they do not exercise the discretionary powers,\n            without any adherence to the very laws, under which they are\n            empowered to act and decide such cases. They cannot bye-pass\n            their own rules and regulations and sacrifice public health and\n            public safety. These are vital matters and they cannot be a\n            casualty in the hands of the Municipal and Town Planning\n            authorities. Therefore, before they take any decision they must\n            not only consider the alleged hardship to individual flat\n            purchasers/ holders/occupants but bear in the interest of those\n            residing in the neighbourhood and the public at large. The\n            city and town so also the area as a whole has a vital interest in\n            such matters. Ultimately, planned and regulated development\n            of a city or town is the object of enacting planning laws.\n            Therefore, the interest of all residents is at stake. The\n            Municipal and Town Planning authorities cannot adopt an\n            attitude by which they further the interest and cause of\n            developers and wrong-doers at the cost of the township as a\n            whole. They must bear in mind the fact that essential and\n            basic amenities like water and electricity are scarce. The\n            pressure on land is immense. It is not possible to construct\n            bridges, roads all the time. Ultimately, a city or town is\n            planned for a certain number of people and population. The\n            infrastructure and basic amenities are provided considering\n            the existing population and growth at a projected rate over a\n            passage of time. If there is increasing pressure and burden on\n            the existing facilities and amenities, then, the whole system\n            would collapse resulting in large scale inconvenience. In every\n            city or town certain number of schools, educational\n            institutions, hospitals, public conveniences etc. are provided\n            on the basis of population figures and by future projection.\n            These matters must therefore have a bearing, when an application\n            for retention is made and it is not possible to hold that the\n            authorities should allow such applications only because the\n            Builder/Developer manages to generate FSI in the form of TDR\n            or otherwise. Similarly, the argument that these constructions be\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">                                   76</span>\n\n            regularized by imposing fine and charging high fees as a matter of\n            course is also difficult to accept, for the afore-mentioned reasons.\n            If by imposition of fine and charging of compounding fees, large\n            scale unauthorized constructions are regularized, then, that would\n            encourage the Builders and Developers so also others having\n            interest in the development activities, to violate laws openly. They\n            will always proceed on the basis that the building regulations can\n            be breached with impunity and all that they would be visited with,\n            is high compounding fees. That is not the intention of the\n            Legislature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">            The penal provisions in Sections 52 and 53 of the MRTP Act,\n            1966, are enacted with a defined object and purpose. It is to\n            discourage unauthorized and illegal development and also\n            punish the wrong doers. In addition to punishment of wrong\n            doers and offenders, the Legislature empowers the Planning\n            Authority to pull down, remove or alter the unauthorized\n            development or works. Therefore, there is a twin object and\n            purpose in such provisions. That is to check and control\n            unauthorized construction and development and at the same\n            time penalise all those who are responsible for the same.\n            Therefore, by merely charging compounding fees and\n            imposing heavy fines such construction cannot be regularized.\n            Ultimately, the exercise of this discretionary power must not\n            result in a license to break planning laws. Individual&#x27;s interest\n            in a property, his right to enjoy it is subject to larger public\n            good and purpose. That right has to be balanced with the\n            requirements of the society. It is not absolute.\n            While dealing with request of retention and regularization, the\n            deviation and deficiencies, the extent of irregularities, the damage\n            and ill-effects thereof and the conduct of the parties, are all\n            relevant considerations. What can be termed as a minor deviation\n            or departure in a given case, may still have adverse affects and\n            consequences on the overall development and planning of the city\n            and town. Once the population is increasing, then what is a minor\n            deviation and what could be termed to be a major infraction or\n            breach or violation of the planning laws, are matters which must\n            be decided by the Planning Authorities in the facts and\n            circumstances of each case bearing in mind the above objects and\n            purpose. They cannot as a matter of rule regularize unauthorized\n            constructions by allowing the Builder/Developer/wrong doer to\n            compensate for the violation in terms of money or by permitting\n            him to load TDR/FSI from adjoining plots and areas. If we lay\n            down such a general rule, we would be going contrary to the\n            judicial pronouncements in the field. That would be violating the\n            law of the land. We are bound by the Supreme Court decisions\n            and, therefore, cannot lay down any principle contrary to the\n            same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189023\" id=\"span_244\">(emphasis added)\n   55       Another   decision   of   the   Apex   Court   which   is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                          ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:45 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">                                        77</span>\n\n   relevant   for   dealing   with   the   provisions   of\n   sections 52 and 53 of the MRTP Act is in the case\n   of   <a href=\"/doc/1189023/\" id=\"a_334\">Mahendra   Baburao   Mahadik   vs.   Subhash   Krishna\n   Kanitkar</a> and others34.

The power to grant such permission could be exercised only\n      within the purview of the Building Bye-laws.

Though the municipal laws permit deviations from\n      sanctioned constructions being regularized by compounding but\n      that is by way of exception. Unfortunately, the exception, with the\n      lapse of time and frequent exercise of the discretionary power\n      conferred by such exception, has become the rule. Only such\n      deviations deserve to be condoned as are bona fide or are\n      attributable to some misunderstanding or are such deviations as\n      where the benefit gained by demolition would be far less than the\n      disadvantage suffered. Other than these, deliberate deviations do\n      not deserve to be condoned and compounded. Compounding of\n      deviations ought to be kept at a bare minimum. The cases of\n      professional builders stand on a different footing from an individual\n      constructing his own building. A professional builder is supposed to\n      understand the laws better and deviations by such builders can safely be\n      assumed to be deliberate and done with the intention of earning profits\n      and hence deserve to be dealt with sternly so as to act as a deterrent for\n      future. It is common knowledge that the builders enter into underhand\n      dealings. Be that as it may, the State Governments should think of\n      levying heavy penalties on such builders and therefrom develop a\n      welfare fund which can be utilized for compensating and rehabilitating\n      such innocent or unwary buyers who are displaced on account of\n      demolition of illegal constructions.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">      45. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1937304\" id=\"span_253\">In <a href=\"/doc/1937304/\" id=\"a_350\">M.I.

There is no way out. Judicial discretion cannot\n       be guided by expediency. Courts are not free from statutory fetters.\n       Justice is to be rendered in accordance with law. Judges are not entitled\n       to exercise discretion wearing the robes of judicial discretion and pass\n       orders based solely on their personal predilections and peculiar\n       dispositions. Judicial discretion wherever it is required to be exercised\n       has to be in accordance with law and set legal principles. As will be\n       seen in moulding the relief in the present case and allowing one of the\n       blocks meant for parking to stand we have been guided by the\n       obligatory duties of the Mahapalika to construct and maintain parking\n       lots.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">       A discretionary power must be exercised having regard to the larger\n       public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">      46. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"993633\" id=\"span_256\">In <a href=\"/doc/993633/\" id=\"a_351\">Consumer Action Group v. State of T.N.</a> [(2000) 7 SCC 425]\n  this Court    held: (SCC p. 443, para 30)\n\n           &quot;While exercising such a power the authority has to keep in mind\n       the purpose and the policy of the Act and while granting relief has to\n       equate the resultant effect of such a grant on both viz. the public and\n       the individual. So long as it does not materially affect the public cause,\n       the grant would be to eliminate individual hardship which would be\n       within the permissible limit of the exercise of power. But where it\n       erodes the public safety, public convenience, public health etc. the\n       exercise of power could not be for the furtherance of the purpose of the\n       Act. Minor abrasion here and there to eliminate greater hardship, may\n       in a given case, be justified but in no case affecting the public at large.\n       So every time the Government exercises its power it has to examine\n       and balance this before exercising such a power. Even otherwise,\n       every individual right including fundamental right is within\n       reasonable limit but if it makes inroads into public rights leading to\n       public inconveniences it has to be curtailed to that extent. So no\n       exemption should be granted affecting the public at large. Various\n       development rules and restrictions under it are made to ward off\n       possible public inconvenience and safety. Thus, whenever any\n       power is to be exercised, the Government must keep in mind,\n       whether such a grant would recoil on the public or not and to what\n       extent. If it does then exemption is to be refused. If the effect is\n       marginal compared to the hardship of an individual that may be\n       considered for granting.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">       Mr Naphde, therefore, is not correct in contending that the High Court\n       should have taken a lenient view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1902389\" id=\"span_257\">(emphasis added)\n\n  56       The   Apex   Court   also   dealt   with   its   earlier\n  decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1902389/\" id=\"a_352\">Friends Colony Development\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:46 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">                                    81</span>\n\n  Committee   vs.   State   of   Orissa</a>   (supra).</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1902389\" id=\"span_260\">As   regards\n  the   preparation   of   various   plans   and   legal   effect\n  thereof,   in   paragraphs   22   and   23   in   the   case   of\n  <a href=\"/doc/1902389/\" id=\"a_353\">Friends   Colony</a>   (supra),   the   Apex   Court   observed\n  thus:</span> \n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">           22. In all developed and developing countries there is emphasis on\n           planned development of cities which is sought to be achieved by\n           zoning, planning and regulating building construction activity.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">           Such planning, though highly complex, is a matter based on\n           scientific research, study and experience leading to rationalization\n           of laws by way of legislative enactments and rules and regulations\n           framed thereunder. Zoning and planning do result in hardship to\n           individual property owners as their freedom to use their property\n           in the way they like, is subjected to regulation and control. The\n           private owners are to some extent prevented from making the most\n           profitable use of their property. But for this reason alone the\n           controlling regulations cannot be termed as arbitrary or\n           unreasonable. The private interest stands subordinated to the\n           public good. It can be stated in a way that power to plan\n           development of city and to regulate the building activity therein\n           flows from the police power of the State. The exercise of such\n           governmental power is justified on account of it being reasonably\n           necessary for the public health, safety, morals or general welfare\n           and     ecological   considerations;   though     an    unnecessary        or\n           unreasonable intermeddling with the private ownership of the\n           property may not be justified.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">            23. The municipal laws regulating the building construction activity\n            may provide for regulations as to floor area, the number of floors, the\n            extent of height rise and the nature of use to which a built-up property\n            may be subjected in any particular area.

Building\n            regulations also help in reduction or elimination of fire hazards,\n            the avoidance of traffic dangers and the lessening of prevention of\n            traffic congestion in the streets and roads. Zoning and building\n            regulations are also legitimised from the point of view of the\n            control     of      community      development,      the    prevention       of\n            overcrowding of land, the furnishing of recreational facilities like\n            parks and playgrounds and the availability of adequate water,\n            sewerage and other governmental or utility services.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">                                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82473\" id=\"span_263\">(emphasis added)\n\n\n  57       In the case of <a href=\"/doc/82473/\" id=\"a_354\">Shanti Sports Club and another\n  vs. Union of India</a> and others35 in paragraphs 74 and\n  75, the Apex Court held thus:</span> \n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">                    &quot;74.

Such unlawful\n                    constructions are definitely against the public interest\n                    and hazardous to safety of occupiers and residents of\n                    multistoreyed buildings.

The reports of demolition of hutments and jhuggi\n           jhopris belonging to the poor and disadvantaged section of the society\n           frequently appear in the print media but one seldom gets to read about\n           demolition of illegally/unauthorisedly constructed multi-storeyed\n           structures raised by economically affluent people. The failure of the\n           State apparatus to take prompt action to demolish such illegal\n           constructions has convinced the citizens that planning laws are\n           enforced only against poor and all compromises are made by the State\n           machinery when it is required to deal with those who have money\n           power or unholy nexus with the power corridors.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">                                           (emphasis added)\n\n\n            In paragraph no. 29, the Apex Court held thus:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                    &quot;9.

Thus, a Planning\n  Authority   cannot   grant   a   development   permission\n  which   is   contrary   not   only   to   a   sanctioned\n  Development   Plan,   but   to   a   notified   draft\n  Development Plan.

A   Development   Plan   controls   the\n  use of lands or buildings by providing for various\n  zones   such   as   Residential,   Industrial,   No\n  Development   Zone   etc.   DCR   which   is   a   part   of   a\n  Development   Plan   provide   for   the   extent   of\n  available   FSI,   sizes   of   buildings   and   its   parts\n  such   as   size   of   staircases,   passages   etc.   DCR\n  provides   for   rules   regarding   maximum   height   of\n  different   categories   of   buildings,   amenities   such\n  as   water   tanks   and     lifts,   open   spaces,   parking\n  places,projections   etc.     Even   the   Rules   regarding\n  minimum size of plots are a part of it.

MIDC   had   issued   notices   to\n  2118   illegal   constructions   in   Navi   Mumbai   till\n  October 2015.

As can be seen from\n  the   definition   of   `development&#x27;   in     section   2   of\n  the MRTP Act, the scope of development is very wide\n  which   includes   practically   all   categories   of\n  construction   works.   As   sub-section   (1)   of   section\n  52-A applies only to the areas of Development Plan,\n  the   provisions   of   section   52-A   and   consequently,\n  Compounded   Structure   Rules   apply   only   to   those\n  areas   for   which   a   Development   Plan   within   the\n  meaning of MRTP Act is already made or is required\n  to be made.  The second part of sub-section (1) of\n  section   52-A   provides   that   upon   request   of   the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018               ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:46 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                98</span>\n\n  Planning   Authority,   the   State   Government   may\n  specify   the   terms   and   conditions   on   compliance   of\n  which   and   on   payment   of   Compounding   charges,\n  infrastructure   charges   and   premium,   the   Planning\n  Authority may declare such unauthorised development\n  which   has   been   carried   out   on   or   before   31 st\n  December 2015 as compounded structure.  Sub-section\n  (1)   specifically   provides   that   the   terms   and\n  conditions   which   may   be   specified   by   the   State\n  Government   should   not   be   inconsistent   with   the\n  Rules   made   in   this   behalf   (the   Compounded\n  Structures   Rules).     Sub-section   (2)   of   <a href=\"/doc/120481257/\" id=\"a_383\">section   52</a>\n  provides that once such development is declared as\n  compounded,   no   proceedings   under   any   law   for   the\n  time   being   in   force   against   owner   or   occupier   of\n  such   structure   shall   be   taken   or   continued.\n  Therefore,   apart   from  the  fact   that  the  action  of\n  demolition/removal cannot be taken in respect of a\n  compounded   structure,   even   if   criminal   law   is   set\n  in motion against the owner/occupier of the illegal\n  structure   for   making   an   illegal   construction,   the\n  prosecution   cannot   proceed.     Thus,   the   Amendment\n  Act not only provides for compounding of an illegal\n  structure,   but   it   seeks   to   protect   violators   from\n  prosecution   for   the   offence   punishable   under\n  section   52   of   the   MRTP   Act.     Hence,   it   seeks   to\n  protect not only shelter but it also seeks to save\n  a   person   who   commits   an   offence   from   prosecution.\n  Proviso   to   sub-section   (2)   provides   that\n  development   or   reconstruction   is   permissible     in\n  compounded   structures   only   as   per   the   provisions\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018             ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:46 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                99</span>\n\n  prevailing DCR.

If   a   structure   is   erected\n  without   obtaining   development   permission   under   the\n  MRTP Act on or before 31st December 2015 in the area\n  of   Development   Plan,   the   Planning   Authority   has   a\n  power   to   declare   such   structure   as   a   compounded\n  structure.    Once,  such  structure  is  declared  as  a\n  compounded structure, in view of sub-section (2) of\n  section 52-A, it remains protected from demolition.\n  We   have   already   noted   that   this   provision   is\n  applicable   only   to   an   area     of   Development   Plan\n  under   the MRTP Act which is defined in clause (9)\n  of <a href=\"/doc/64930018/\" id=\"a_384\">section 2</a> as &quot;Development Plan&quot; means a plan for\n  the   development   or   re-development   of   the   area\n  within the jurisdiction of a Planning Authority and\n  includes   revision   of   a   Development   Plan   and\n  proposals   of   a   special   Planning   Authority   for\n  development of land within its jurisdictions. Thus,\n  section   52A   will   apply   only   to   the   areas   under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">  jurisdiction of the Planning Authorities or Special\n  Planning Authorities.

A   structure   can   be\n  declared   as   compounded   structure   provided\n  compounding   charges,   infrastructure   charges   and\n  premium is paid.

The   clauses   (a)   to   (c)   of\n  Rule 4 do not run contrary to DCR. But clause (d)\n  suggests that unauthorised development on lands in\n  Residential   Zones,   semi-public   zones   and\n  commercial   Zones   can   be   regularized.   Clause   (e)\n  permits   compounding   of   development   made   by\n  violating   permissible     land   use   in   Residential\n  Zones. Rule 5 deals with unauthorised developments\n  which   may   be   considered   for   being   declared   as\n  compounded   structures.     Under   clause   (b)   thereof,\n  even   unauthorised   developments   on   the   lands\n  reserved   for   public   purpose   under   a   Development\n  Plan   or   regional   plan   (except   play   ground,   garden\n  and open spaces reservations) can be considered as\n  compounded structures.  However, the reservation is\n  required   to   be   shifted   or   deleted   after   following\n  due process of law. By way of illustration, we may\n  refer   to   reservations   in   Development   Plan     for\n  schools,   colleges,   hospitals,   public   utility\n  buildings for Courts, for Sewarge Treatment Plants\n  (STP) etc. Unauthorised developments thereon can be\n  tolerated by changing or shifting the reservation.\n  The preparation and sanction of a Development Plan\n  is   a   very   elaborate   process   starting   from   <a href=\"/doc/154485396/\" id=\"a_386\">section\n  21</a>   of   preparing   land   use   map     and   ending   with\n  section   31   of   the   MRTP   Act.     It   contemplates\n  preparation   of   land   use   plans,   consultations   at\n  various   levels,   inviting   objections   and\n  suggestions, finalization of the draft plan by the\n  Planning   Committee   as   well   as   by   the   Planning\n  Authority and ultimate sanction by the State.

As stated earlier, there could be\n  important   reservations   for   various   purposes\n  provided in the Development Plan such as hospitals,\n  schools,   colleges,   STPs   roads,   road   widening   etc.\n  Clause   (b)   of   Rule   5   provides   that   unauthorized\n  developments   on   such   reserved   lands   will   qualify\n  for   being   declared   as     compounded   structures   by\n  shifting   or   cancelling   of   reservation   at   the   cost\n  of   the   person   applying   for   regularization.     Thus,\n  in a given case, a person who has made unauthorised\n  development by constructing a building on the lands\n  reserved for hospitals, schools, colleges etc, will\n  be entitled to apply for declaring the structure as\n  a compounded structure by getting the   reservation\n  for   public   purpose   under   a   Development   Plan\n  cancelled or shifted. When a person who has carried\n  out illegal construction on a reserved land applies\n  for   declaring   his   structure   as   a   compounded\n  structure,   the   Planning   Authority   and   the   State\n  Government   will  have  to  follow   due  process   of  law\n  and change or shift the reservation. This provision\n  gives   a   premium   to   the   person   who   commits\n  illegality.     This   sets     at   naught   the   entire\n  process of planning under the MRTP Act.  Clause (c)\n  of   Rule   5   goes   one   step   ahead.     It   provides   for\n  permitting   declaration   of   illegal   structures   as\n  compounded   structures   which   are   constructed   on\n  lands   reserved   for   linear   reservations   such   as\n  roads,   railways,   metros   in   any   plan   if   said\n  reservations are shifted  after due process of law.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018             ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:46 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">                                103</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_232\">  In   case   of   clause   (b)   of   Rule   5,   the   cost   of\n  following   the   due   process   of   law   for   shifting   or\n  cancellation  of  reservation  is  to  be   borne   by  the\n  owner or the occupier.   Such a provision is absent\n  in   clause(c).     The   process   of   shifting   or\n  cancellation   of   reservation   is   a   very   elaborate\n  process   which   involves   inviting   suggestions   and\n  objections, hearing of objections and the ultimate\n  decision   making.     Therefore,   till   the   process   is\n  complete,   applications   for   declaration   of\n  structures   as   compounded   structures   in   the   cases\n  covered   by   clauses   (b)   and   (c)   will   have   to   kept\n  pending  and  the  illegal  structures   may  have  to  be\n  protected.   Clause   (d)   conditionally   permits\n  compounding   of   unauthorised   development   on\n  buildable   reservations.   Clause   (e)   permits\n  compounding   of   illegal   development   though   it\n  violates   land   use   zone   after   making   a   change   of\n  zone at the cost of the owner or occupier. Thus, in\n  a   given   case,   an   illegal   construction   made   on   a\n  land  in  no   development  zone  in  a  Development   Plan\n  can be declared as a compounded structure.

The   State   Government   or   the   public\n  Authorities,   as   the   case   may   be,   have   to   act   as\n  Trustees.

Clause   (a)   permits   regularization   of\n  structures   even   on   Class   II   occupancies.     Such\n  lands   are   occupied   by   allottees   on   stringent\n  conditions.

The   table\n  appended   to   the   Compounded   Structure   Rules   will\n  have to be read with the Rule 5 which provides that\n  the     types   of   unauthorised   developments   specified\n  therein   qualify   for   being   declared   as   compounded\n  structures subject to fulfillment of the conditions\n  mentioned in the said Rule and parameters specified\n  in the table. Rule 7 expressly permits compounding\n  of structures which are constructed in violation of\n  DCR. Item 1 of the table permits compounding though\n  width of the road abutting a structure may not be\n  as provided in DCR. Item 2 permits user contrary to\n  DCR   by   virtually   amending   DCR.     Item   No.3   in   the\n  table   permits   compounding   of   structures   made   by\n  utilising Floor Space Index (for short &quot;FSI&quot;) more\n  than   what   is   permissible   under   DCR.     In   such   a\n  case,   the   owner   can   procure   premium   FSI,   Fungible\n  FSI   for   TDR   by   paying   additional   compounding\n  charges at the rate of 10% of the land rate.  Item\n  5   of   the   table   indicates   that   while   declaring   a\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:46 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                                106</span>\n\n  structure   as   compounded   structure,   even   Rules\n  regarding   minimum   width   of   a   road   can   be   relaxed\n  subject   to   payment   of   additional   compounding\n  charges.   Item   6   contemplates   grant   of   benefit   of\n  compounding  even   in  the  case  of  a  structure  where\n  the plinth area exceeds the area permitted in DCR.\n  This can be done by charging additional compounding\n  charges.     Item   7   shows   that   even   if   it   is   not\n  possible   to   procure   parking   as   required   by   DCR,\n  there   can   be   regularization   subject   to   payment   of\n  20% of the additional premium. Item 4 provides for\n  relaxation   of   Rules   regarding   set   back.   Item   8\n  permits the compromising on Rules in DCR regarding\n  staircase   width,   passage   width   and   misuse   of   FSI\n  component.     Item   14   permits   relaxation   of   Rules\n  regarding   sub-division   of   layouts   in   residential\n  areas.  Thus, Rule 4 read with items 1 to 8 and 14\n  enable   the   Planning   Authority   to   waive   or   relax\n  major   or   important   requirements   of   DCR   and\n  Development Plan only for tolerating large illegal\n  constructions.

The power to grant such permission could be\n           exercised only within the purview of the Building Bye-laws.\n           Therefore, being beyond the scope of Section 44 of the MRTP Act,\n           the Municipal Council did not have any jurisdiction to direct\n           regularization of such unauthorised constructions by reason of\n           the said resolution or otherwise.

An\n  application   for   regularization   under   sub-section\n  (3) of <a href=\"/doc/28439952/\" id=\"a_393\">section 53</a> is nothing but an application for\n  grant of a development permission under section 44\n  of the MRTP Act. Hence, regularization contemplated\n  in   case of such applications can be made provided\n  the   structures   are   constructed     without   violating\n  the provisions of the  Development Plan or Regional\n  Plan, draft or final, and DCR.   An attempt made by\n  the   State   by   impugned   Amendment   Act   and   the\n  Compounded   Structures   Rules   is   to   permit\n  regularization of illegal structures  which are not\n  otherwise in accordance with the provisions of the\n  MRTP Act, Development or Regional Plan and DCR. In\n  short,   the   impugned   Amendment   Act   in   the   form   of\n  section 52-A and the Rules framed thereunder permit\n  compounding   of   illegal   structures   which   cannot   be\n  tolerated   in   terms   of   the   law   to   be   tolerated   by\n  declaring   it   as   Compounded   structures   subject   to\n  payment   of   various   amounts.     There   are   several\n  Planning Authorities (more than 350) in the entire\n  State   and   therefore,   section   52-A   has   a   sweeping\n  effect.     Thus,   section   52-A   and   the   Compounded\n  Structure   Rules   provide   for   regularizing   of   lakhs\n  of   structures   which   are   illegally   constructed   in\n  violation of the provisions of the MRTP Act and the\n  municipal laws which could not have been permitted\n  to be constructed under the provisions of the said\n  laws.

The said Act of 1971 dealt with issue\n  of Town Planning, grant of developments permission\n  etc.     In   paragraph   18,   the   Apex   Court   observed\n  thus:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"993633\" id=\"span_344\">&quot;18      The catena of decisions <a href=\"/doc/993633/\" id=\"a_410\">referred to above</a> concludes\n           unwaveringly in spite of very wide power being conferred on\n           delegatee that such a section would still not be ultra vires, if guideline\n           could be gathered from the Preamble, Object and Reasons and other\n           provisions of the Acts and Rules. In testing validity of such provision,\n           the Courts have to discover, whether there is any legislative policy\n           purpose of the statute or indication of any clear will through its various\n           provisions. If there be any, then this by itself would be a guiding\n           factor to be exercised by the delegatee. In other words, then it cannot\n           be held that such a power is unbridled or uncanalised. The exercise of\n           power of such delegatee is controlled through such policy. In the fast\n           changing scenario of economic, social order with scientific\n           development spawns innumerable situations which Legislature\n           possibly could not foresee, so delegatee is entrusted with power to\n           meet such exigencies within the in built check or guidance and in the\n           present case to be within the declared policy. So delegatee has to\n           exercise its powers within this controlled path to subserve the policy\n           and to achieve the objectives of the Act. A situation may arise, in\n           some cases where strict adherence to any provisions of the statute or\n           rules may result in great hardship. In a given situation, where exercise\n           of such power of exemption is to remove this hardship without\n           materially effecting the policy of the Act, viz., development in the\n           present case then such exercise of power would be covered under it.\n           All situation cannot be culled out which has to be judiciously\n           judged and exercised, to meet any such great hardship of any\n           individual or institution or conversely in the interest of society at\n           large. Such power is meant rarely to be used.

In <a href=\"/doc/55821627/\" id=\"a_422\">Section 113-A</a> the legislature\n           itself lays down what is to be done by the Government, while in <a href=\"/doc/111504705/\" id=\"a_423\">Section\n           113</a> the Government is conferred with wide discretion though to act\n           within the channel of the policy.

Challenge to <a href=\"/doc/111504705/\" id=\"a_426\">Section 113</a> is an unguided wide power to a\n           delegatee, but no such challenge could be made against the legislature.\n           <a href=\"/doc/55821627/\" id=\"a_427\">Section 113-A</a> is the mandate of the legislature itself to grant exemption\n           and realise regularization fees, no discretion on the delegatee. Hence\n           we hold that <a href=\"/doc/55821627/\" id=\"a_428\">Section 113-A</a> as a one-time measure is a valid piece of\n           legislation and challenge to its validity has no merit. It is\n           interesting, though a matter of concern, what is recorded in the\n           Statement of Objects and Reasons.

Before such pattern becomes cancerous and spreads to\n           all parts of this country, it is high time that remedial measure was taken\n           by the State to check this pattern.

The catena of decisions <a href=\"/doc/993633/\" id=\"a_442\">referred to above</a>\n                  unwaveringly show that the word &quot;environment&quot; is of\n                  broad spectrum which brings within its ambit hygienic\n                  atmosphere and ecological balance. It is, therefore, not only\n                  the duty of the State, but also the duty of every citizen to\n                  maintain hygienic environment. There is constitutional\n                  obligation on the State Government and the Municipalities,\n                  not only to ensure and safeguard proper environment, but\n                  also an imperative duty to take adequate measures to\n                  promote, protect and improve both man-made and natural\n                  environment. The Municipal Laws regulating the building\n                  construction activities have been enacted to achieve a larger\n                  purpose of public health, safety and general welfare. Any\n                  violation of zoning and regulation laws, takes a toll in terms\n                  of public welfare and convenience being sacrificed apart\n                  from the risk, inconvenience and hardship which is posed\n                  to the occupants of the building. Though Municipal Laws\n                  permit       deviation   from   sanctioned   constructions      being\n                  regularized by compounding but that is by way of exception.\n                  Only such deviations deserve to be condoned as are bona fide\n                  or are attributable to some misunderstanding or are such\n                  deviations as where the benefit gained by demolition would be\n                  far less than the disadvantage suffered. Other than these,\n                  deliberate deviations do not deserve to be condoned and\n                  compounded. At the time of planning, experts in the field of\n                  town planning take into account various aspects, such as,\n                  healthy living, environment, lung space need, land use\n                  intensity, areas where the residential houses are to be built and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_361\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                             ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_362\">                                        119</span>\n\n                  where the commercial buildings are to be located, the need of\n                  household industries, etc. Regularizing the constructions\n                  erected      in   violation   of   the   regulations     has    serious\n                  consequences. Regularization in many cases for the violation\n                  of the front setback, will not make it easily feasible for the\n                  Corporation to widen the abutting road in future and bring the\n                  incumbent closer to the danger of the road. The waiver of\n                  requirement of side set back will deprive adjacent buildings\n                  and their occupants of light and air and also make it\n                  impossible for a fire engine to be used to fight fire in a high-\n                  rise building. The violation of the floor space index, will\n                  result in undue strain on the civil amenities such as water,\n                  electricity, sewage collection and disposal. The waiver of\n                  requirements regarding fire stair case and other fire\n                  prevention and fire fighting measures would seriously\n                  endanger the occupants resulting in the building becoming\n                  a very veritable death trap. The waiver of car parking and\n                  abutting road width requirements would inevitably lead to\n                  congestion on public roads causing severe inconvenience to\n                  the public at large. Such grant of exemption and the\n                  regularization is likely to spell ruin for any city as it affects\n                  the lives, health, safety and convenience of all its citizens.\n                  The Court cannot remain a mute spectator when the\n                  violations also affect the environment and healthy living of\n                  law-abiders. If the laws are not enforced and the orders of\n                  the Court to enforce and implement the laws are ignored,\n                  the result can only be total lawlessness.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">                      27. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"993633\" id=\"span_363\">In <a href=\"/doc/993633/\" id=\"a_443\">Consumer Action Group</a>&#x27;s case, cited supra, the\n                      Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/55821627/\" id=\"a_444\">section\n                      113-A</a> of the Act on the premise that it was a power to be\n                      exercised as a one-time measure and the legislature cannot\n                      extend the scheme contrary to the order of the Supreme\n                      Court.

He submitted that since\n                          it was not possible for the authorities to ascertain the exact\n                          date of construction, having regard to the large number of\n                          Applications, and also having regard to the fact that it was\n                          not possible for the authorities to ascertain as to whether\n                          the construction was before the cut-off date i.e., 28.2.1999,\n                          it was necessary to enact a law to cover all the violations\n                          up to the extended dates as per the scheme.

After going through the aforesaid provisions of the Act, we\n           find that the State Legislature was well aware of the fact that in the\n           past there has been unauthorised development in the city of\n           Ahmedabad and development areas of the State on a large scale and\n           although those are liable to be demolished in accordance with the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_372\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                            ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_373\">                                    124</span>\n\n           relevant laws of the land, removal or pulling down of such\n           unauthorised development would cause hardship to a large number of\n           people and, therefore, a chance has been given for regularization on\n           conditions indicated therein. From the above provisions of law, it\n           appears that while making the provisions of regularization, it has not\n           compromised with fire safety measures under the relevant law and\n           structural stability requirements as per the GDCR.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_256\">           21       Such being the position, we find no substance in the\n           contention of Mr.Panchal that the proposed amendment is opposed to\n           fire safety measures provided under the existing law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">           22       As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the cases mentioned\n           by us in this judgment, the Legislature contains representatives of\n           people elected by it and authorised by the people to enact laws. In the\n           case before us, there is no dispute that the State Legislature had the\n           required competency over the subject matter. If State Legislature on\n           consideration of the situation prevalent in the State, decides to\n           regularise unauthorised construction without compromising with the\n           safety measures provided under other existing law, in our opinion, the\n           same cannot be said to be violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_458\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n           of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_258\">           23       We do not find any substance also in the contention of\n           Mr.Panchal that the same is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_459\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n           of India. It has laid down criteria for regularization and the classes of\n           people who are entitled to get such benefit. In those conditions, there\n           is no inequality or want of equal protection of law among the same\n           classes of citizens.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_259\">           24       Simply because the mode of regularization adopted by the\n           State Legislature could be made in a better way or in a stricter way,\n           for that reason, this Court sitting in a jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_460\">Article 226</a> of\n           the Constitution cannot declare it as ultra vires. Once legislative\n           competency is established and at the same time, it does not violate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_374\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_375\">                                    125</span>\n\n           any of the provisions of Part-III of the Constitution, there is no scope\n           of declaring the same as ultra vires. It is not even the object of the Act\n           of 2011 to continue with violation of the existing law of the land and\n           its applicability is restricted only to a specific unauthorised\n           construction for a limited period where the government could not\n           tackle the situation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">           25       If the Legislature of the State decides to condone the act of\n           violation made by the citizens on payment of penalty without\n           compromising with the safety measures of the people, we are of the\n           view, there is no scope of interference with the enactment concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_376\">26       In our opinion, a law, which subject to some conditions being\n           fulfilled, seeks to classify certain activities of the citizen as legal\n           which were previously branded as illegal, cannot be said to be in\n           violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_461\">Article 14</a> if there is no discrimination amongst the\n           beneficiaries of such law. We also do not find any substance in the\n           contention of Mr.Panchal, the learned advocate for the petitioner that\n           Legislature has no right to repeatedly condone unauthorised\n           construction for the purpose of favouring a class of persons who\n           consistently defied the law. No doubt such act may amount to giving\n           benefit to a law breaker but for that reason alone, a Court is not\n           vested with power to declare an Act as ultra vires. The Legislature\n           has right to enact a law by giving benefit to a particular class of\n           people without giving such benefit to another class, provided such\n           benefit is granted based on proper classification. A Legislature in its\n           wisdom can decide to declare an existing law as no longer valid and\n           instead of that may add new definition in the existing Act. It is\n           beyond the province of a writ-Court to demand explanation from the\n           Legislature for enactment of a particular legislation nor can the writ-\n           Court modify the same on the ground that according to the Court a\n           better option was available. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in\n           the case of <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_462\">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a> reported in (1978) 1\n           SCC 248 unless a classification made by the Legislature is patently\n           arbitrary, there is presumption in favour of validity of the enactment.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_377\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_378\">                                     126</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_262\">           In the case before us, the ground of regularization cannot be said to be\n           absurd. Only thing that can be complained is that it is inconsistent\n           with the existing law which has been violated. We have already\n           pointed out that in a given situation for the purpose of solving the\n           problem arising out of mass violation of existing law, the Legislature\n           is vested with the power to tackle the situation by enacting this type\n           of Regularization Act which is not unknown in the field of\n           legislation.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">  85       Thus,   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_463\">Gujarat   Act</a>,   it   was\n  impermissible                    to         regularise               unauthorised\n  development   on   the   lands   vesting   in   local\n  Authorities   or   public   Authorities.     There   was\n  prohibition on regularization of the structures on\n  the   land   acquired   or   allotted   by   the   Government,\n  Local   Authority   or   Statutory   Authority   for   a\n  specific purpose.  Illegal developments on the land\n  reserved   under   the   Development   Plan   are   excluded\n  from   regularization.     In   the   case   in   hand,\n  offending   provisions   permit   regularization   of\n  structures   on   the   public   properties.     It   permits\n  regularization   of   the   structures   on   the   lands\n  acquired   as   per   law   of   compulsory   acquisition.   It\n  permits   regularization   of   illegal   constructions   on\n  the lands designated or reserved for public purpose\n  under the Development Plan or town planning scheme.\n  Therefore,   Gujarat   High   Court   was   dealing   with   an\n  altogether different law. An argument was sought to\n  be   canvassed   that   in   many   States,   laws   for\n  regularization   of   illegal   structures   have     been\n  enacted. However, the argument is irrelevant as the\n  provisions of each State law are different. \n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_379\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018                          ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_380\">                                127</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">  86       Coming back to the provisions of the MRTP Act\n  and  the  Municipal  laws  applicable  to   the  State,  a\n  specific   provision   for   making   an   application   for\n  regularization as a matter of right of the illegal\n  structures or unauthorised development can be found\n  only under sub-<a href=\"/doc/102540473/\" id=\"a_464\">section 3</a> of section 53 of the MRTP\n  Act.

We   must   give   few\n  illustrations   as   to   how   the   reading   down   of   the\n  section  will   work.    If   construction  of   a  building\n  is   carried   out   without   obtaining   development\n  permission   under   the   MRTP   Act   and   the   permissions\n  required   under   the   Municipal   laws,   it   can   be\n  regularized   if   (i)     all   the   required   parameters\n  such   as   size   of   the   plinth,   available   FSI,\n  necessary   safeguards   for   fire   fighting   etc   as\n  provided in the DCR are taken care of and   (ii)the\n  structure can be made conforming to the provisions\n  of DCR. By exercise of powers under sub-section (1)\n  of section 52-A, such structure could be compounded\n  if necessary, by imposing a condition to modify or\n  alter the structure to bring it  in conformity with\n  the   DCR.   Obviously,   if   FSI   is   used   which   is   more\n  than what is permissible under the MRTP Act and the\n  DCR framed thereunder, the structure to the extent\n  to which additional F.S.I   has been used cannot be\n  regularized. If the DCR requires     open spaces and\n  set   back   to   be   provided   in   a   particular   manner,\n  unless   such   provisions   are   complied   with,   the\n  structure   cannot   be   regularized.   If   DCR     provides\n  that only owner or lessee of property can apply for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_396\">::: Uploaded on - 03/11/2018             ::: Downloaded on - 04/11/2018 01:30:47 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_397\">                                134</span>\n\n  development   permission,   the   structure   can   be\n  regularized   or   compounded   only   if   owner   or   lessee\n  apply   for   regularization.     Moreover,   a   structure\n  made   on   a   public   property   by   encroaching   upon   it\n  cannot be regularized. We are not dealing with the\n  issue   whether   by   exercising   power   under   any   other\n  statutes,   encroachments   on   the   public   properties\n  can be regularized. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_275\">  94       As far as the issue of tolerating the illegal\n  constructions   is   concerned,   we   have   already\n  summarized   the   law   on   the   point.     As   held   by   the\n  Apex Court, the Planning Authorities and the State\n  will   have   to   show   zero   tolerance   to   illegal\n  constructions   and it is the duty of the Planning\n  Authority to take immediate steps for demolition of\n  illegal   developments.     It   is   also   their   duty   to\n  ensure that such illegal developments are prevented\n  and   therefore,   as   far   as   PILs   concerning   Navi\n  Mumbai   are   concerned,   interim   orders   directing\n  survey   of   illegal   constructions,   creation   of\n  Grievance   Redress   Mechanism   etc.   will   have   to   be\n  continued   as   final   directions.
